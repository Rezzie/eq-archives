</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here:http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051408.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051825.html<BR>ANd here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052711.html<P><BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 01-22-2001 12:38 PM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>All right, due to the impression that you all have given me, it seems that I need to cover wizards next…<BR>I’ve already made several notes to myself about wizards, and I may as well start out this discussion with those notes. Keep in mind that these ‘talks’ are geared toward making sure that the classes are ‘balanced’. Please work toward that goal when posting (yes, even if that means you suggest a ‘nerf’). But I’m also interested in hearing about bugs and such too, I’m just not going to focus on them.<P>Here are the notes that I already have. Keep in mind that these are only my notes, and just because I’ve listed something does NOT mean that I like the idea or that the designers are working on making changes based on these notes. This is just what it is, a list of ideas. I’ve also added my notes to you all under the header of Note:<P>AoE spells: Mentioned elsewhere… (earlier on my list, probably under mages: basically the idea here is that maybe pets should be removed from the equation).<P>Gaze/Glimpse: Due to the clipping plane, these spells don’t really allow further seeing, just zooming in (which makes your resolution worse anyhow).<P>Note: this may not be ‘fixable’ at all due to the way the game works. It’s not like we can force your PC into a higher resolution when you use this spell…<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder: There seems to be a problem with these spells. Since they will not teleport you up, they don’t work too well in hilly terrain; because the spell only sends you a few feet (stopping when it reaches a hill or building).<P>Note: Again, this may also not be something we can change, but it’s on the list.<P>Bind Sight: Seems to cause viewer to see the target as running into walls or spinning in circles if target goes up an incline.<P>Enstill: It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive. <P>Cazic Gate: At level spell is attained, using it will most often cause death because the caster appears amidst many aggressive monsters that /con white to them.<P>Note: We’ve actually discussed this before. If I remember correctly, the general feeling was that having a dangerous gate like this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But it is also still on my list.<P>Tishan’s Relocation: This spell evacuates you to a very dangerous location, a monster crossroads in the Skyfire mountains. Could the location be moved, or was it intended that this be a very dangerous evacuation spell?<P>Note: See note about Cazic Gate.<P>Concussion: A level 39 spell dropped by a creature in a location that requires a party of level 50s to handle. Should it be in such a location?<P>Icestrike effects: Graphical effect looks like fire.<P>Lightning Bolt effects: looks exactly like Fire Bolt.<P>Other lightning and cold effects: It seems that there might be other spells that have the look of fire when they should not.<P>Having just re-read this list, I see nothing at all related to actual balancing stuff. This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such (with the possible exception of Area of Effect spells, changing those would certainly have an effect on class balances). So, please, try to focus on balance issues…<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A brief comment on balancing wizards:<P>FIX THE AGRO CODE BACK!<P>I went with my guild to Hate last night. We had a group of 6 lvl 55+ wiz w/ clarity 2 completing with a group of tanks (4 tanks, 1 healer). In 6 + hours we were able to get experience for 2 kills. That was when we made the tanks sit down. With 6 wizards casting lure,draught of jiva,tears of solusek we were never able to do enough agro to get exps. My records show we did more damage based on total numbers but the tanks produced more agro and were higher in the list.<P>Lanath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On the hate raid thing.  Get them to quit taunting.<P>I an concerned, too.  Was it just 1 group of tanks?  That is weird!  Normally, you need 3 groups to see this kind of thing.<P>Interestingly, I was in a raid with a lvl 49 (at the start) tank, with my 50 druid.  The other 2 groups had filled up, as he and I were late arrivals.  So we duoed and expected to just take some of the HP off the critters. Hehe.  Not only did we do that, but we had to back off!  His WS + yak and my heals on him were stealing kills from the 2 larger groups.<P>And some of it was really weird.  The lvl 57 wizzie UNLOADED on a lvl 50 warrior MOB.  Chaincast down on it, and its HP bar just never stopped moving.  My druid did not cast, did not heal (the MOB stayed on the other tanks)...and we still got the kill.  Also, no, the MOB never pulled off onto the wizzie.  Perhaps because the fight was so tank-heavy.  I think we had 8 tanks pounding the poor helpless critters.<P>Mmmm, kinda got off the subject.  I *LIKE* the new changes.  Before, I had to work hard on raids not to make myself unwelcome by stealing every single kill.  Now it is better.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I see entire spell lines that are supposed to be "class defining" which have been either broken or so poorly implemented that they are going completely unused (AoE (pre lvl 50 mostly Al'Kabor's and Rain), Glimpse line of spells, Relocation, Root-upgrades, Concussion, certain teleports).

</FONT><HR>Tool, I read it and I too (52 by-the-skin-of-my-teeth-after-a-Fear-raid Wizzie) find really nothing much to help balance.<P>The only idea I can see toward "balance" has to do with a few UberMOBs that I, as a member of a relatively small guild, will never see.  Now for the Uberguilds that fight them I can understand wizard frustration.  *shrug*  Play your Tank up for those days when the guild is after those critters.<P>I do like the "% of Health" damage spell.  I do doubt that the engine was designed with that in mind.  And if it was not, I should think this is something we will see in EQ2, not here.<P>As wizards continue to tell all the non-wizards how bad wizards are, I continue to play up my druid (50), shaman(41), tanks (20's), mage, rogue and chanter (teens), cleric .<P>And on the planes run I was able to get every single player camped out, while I kept 2 mobs undercontrol, snared/rooted away from camp.  I would have made it out too, if the post-50 warrior MOB had not taken damage before I got hold of it.  Hehe, survived 6 summons, but died before I could get away.  It did not matter, they had all made it out by then.  *shrug*<P>Wizards are WAY more powerful than they are given credit for. With the new aggro/exp code, we no longer have to worry about KSing the kills on multigroup raids...and people are whining about it, too.<P>Use the new tools available.  Post 50 we have excellent tools to control MOBs, do great damage against most critters, not KOS, and have great fun with a challenging, deadly classe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And then they say that classes are balanced?<BR>Any other class could get into a group much easier than a Wizard.<BR>It's a matter of giving the group a visualy noticable atrubuite that can identify wizards as a great infulance in a group.<BR>I have not been in a group that hasen't said wow that melee was quick when I bring down the carnarge.<BR>But, still, we are fast damage doers.<BR>Having played a paly without a nuker many O times I can see the advantage of having a wizard, but I understand that another healer/meleer would be better for the group thans a damage dealer that goes OOM.<BR>That's the problem, from a wizard's stand point that we have to "manage" our mana.<BR>Meaning that I normaly nuke only once or twice a fight.<BR>When in thecase of a multipul pull you have to take the mobs out quick. That means lots of mana consumption and very high taunt.<BR>If I'm not dead at the end of a mutipul pull. That's the only time that the warriors will notice you and maybe thank you.<BR>For the visual aspect of that. We're not really noticed. <BR>Yes, the mob is dead quicker, but the mob is done quicker with another tank, but that meleer can tank and also peel much easier.<BR>So the question always is?<BR>More tanks or a wizzie?<BR>Bah! In a group as a wizard I will always opt for 2 - 3 tanks.<BR>Why? Cas I could never though an at level nuke out there twice without being argoed.<BR>3 tanks = good mana dumping and me living.<BR>But, 3 tanks = 2 healers at least to keep a good pulling rythem going.<BR>A good exsample is the other day in KC.<BR>A cleric was looking for an enchanter/bard.<BR>I gave him a tell and did a /beg to get in the group.<BR>He told me that the tanks wouldn't be able to peel with the high taunt that I had and that overall he wasn't too happy to get a wizard but took me in anyways.<BR>This is what wizards have to go though to get in a group.<BR>It was worse before 50. <P>I personaly have said it and have told countless newbies and other players that ask a 51 wizard is it worth playing a wizard.<BR>I alway respond. No<BR>I tell them to play any other class except wizards, because I would never play a wizard if I was to do it again. <BR>And for people such as me that are not twinked, don't have the contacts, the grouping aspect is key.<BR>And for a wizard. It's just not there.<P>But it' a matter of persona.<BR>We need:<BR>* To be noticed for somthing. Almost everybody can nuke.<BR>1)  We need a distingushable amount of damage to be dome by our nukes.<BR>    Mages with pets can do more damage then we could pets + nuke = lot's of damage + saftey.<BR>    Honestly before level 40. I'd chouse them before a wizard.<BR>    If you that afraid of being sued? (Rumor) then tough.<BR>    Make wizards a groupable class and I don't think that it'll piss people off.<BR>2)  Give us more evack points.<BR>    hmmm? Who wouldn't like that. Fewer ppl die when I evack. Plus Oh Oh Oh...!!! No trains! I know that KC would so go for that.<BR>    Ya Ya Ya I know the evack spell is suposed to do that. But that's deep into post 50's.<BR>    Nobody evacks much in non raid groups.<BR>    But, ie CoM, Seb, MM. I always keep an evack loaded.<BR>    Because the evack spot is close to walk back to the dungeon. Therefore better to get a wiz in the group.<BR>3)  Make some melee resitaint mobs.<BR>    You have mad a lot of magic resistaint mobs.<BR>    Wouln't it be more consevible to have mobs that couldn't be hit with weapons.<BR>    I know that every melee class now adays has magic weapon.<BR>    What about a few umber mobs that are very very hard to hit that would require a bunch of casters to take down. Like a colassis that is a strong meleer. <BR>    I would see a spell hitting him before a sword would do some damage.<BR>    But currantly the only think I have seen is giants (roleplaying wise) aren't suposed to be that magicaly strong. <BR>    But, they, masters of fighting get killed by the blade.<BR>    And are impervious to magic?<BR>    hmmmm....Mesa thinks that it is EQ playabilty favoring the meleers<BR>I have made it to the planer levels where wizards can't complain as much.<BR>But, even now that advantage is only on raids.<BR>Grouping is a ..... cas nobody knows how to work with a wizard.(esp healers) <BR>But, the groups are be better off with a wizard in there. <BR>I know cas I can make the mobs sing when I want to.<BR>But, getting grouped is the hard part.<BR>&lt;-- Isn't the only one that thinks this way.<BR>/done rambleing<BR>/done comlaining<BR>For now at least : )<P>51st Wizard of the Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, thanks for listening. There's an unbelieveable number of posts stacking up in all the class talks, and many of them are repetetive. I commend you for taking the time to read them.<P>I read in the Monk Talk tread that you're going to ask the team weather Monk damage-output is supposed to be between Warriors' and Rogues'. Can you also ask where Wizard damage-output should fit in?<P>Also, I recall reading a while back about how the role of Necromancers in groups changes at high levels from an offensive position to a sort of support/mana battery position. In my experience, a Wizard's job is to crank out lots of damage to shorten battles that get hairy. What is the role of the Wizard in epic encounters that last long enough for the melee and pet classes to outdamage the Wizard by hick margins?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Without a good friends or guild grouping has been tough all of my life as a Wizard in Everquest.  I am fortunate that I have both good friends and a good guild so that I don’t have a lot of down time because I can’t find a group.  However, I see and hear many wizards unable to find groups.<P>I am disappointed in Verant’s vision of a Wizard.<P>I have played a wizard in various forms and games for over seven years.  In all of these wizards have been Masters at Damage and Travel.  They have always been superior to all classes in these two things.  I have never minded other classes obtaining the knowledge of Damage and Travel but never have they been superior to Wizards who study the Arcane.<P>Verant has chosen to stray from traditional wizards and taken away their Mastery of Travel in EQ preferring Druids to be Masters of Travel (Masters of Nature yes not Travel) and allowing other classes to be able to do similar damage as a wizard.<P>I hope with ALL of this long discussion that the programmers can restore Wizards to Masters of Damage and Travel.  The common theme in these discussions is the same.  Wizards are no longer considered be Masters of Damage.  How is Verant going to handle this?  <P>New Spells:<BR>Bolt, Magic, Fire, Cold, Lightning, Concussion Spells, Portal Spells, Mana regeneration spells, Resistance Spells, Shield spells<P>New Discipline: <BR>Channeling, Evoking, Mediation<P>Spell Modifications:<BR>Fix AE, PB, Rain spells, root/snare spells, portal locations of Cazic, WK etc. Modify Harvest, reduce mana costs for spells, minimum damage amounts applied to spells<P>Mana Regeneration: <BR>Increase Wizard mana regeneration<P>Equipment:<BR>Clarity effect equipment, mana cost reducing items (focus items)<P>My hope is Verant will make positive changes to restore Wizards to Masters of Damage and Travel.<P>Waverlyn Ladyfire<BR>Karana<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They're a GOOD CLASS, but there are problems--"wizards suck and I never should have played one" are hardly going to get any balance issues looked at."<P>Aye it is true.  We are a good class.  However there are issues.  I haven't experienced the "5 hour looking for a group" or the "nah we want a mage" issues that my bretheren have, but the fact that this does indicates that there is an issue.<P>Besides our gates, snare, and annul magic, we're a one trick pony.  Our job is to do alot of damage quick and decisively.<P>Along the path a wizard takes from 1 to 60, there are other classes that have better damaging nukes then we do.  Keep in mind these classes usually have some sort of other utility to contribute (i.e. pets or heals).<P>We do not.  We live and die by the amount of damage that we do and have a fixed cap to the amount of mana at our disposal.  Other classes have the luxury of a pet to allow them to contribute.<P>If you were to break down the melees each one has a specific role by their role (offensive damage or taking damage).  <P>When it comes to casters the line is blurred horribly.  Our magic damage superiority to other classes at times is lower or equal to others classes.  If you factor in the other damage component of pets tanking it becomes more apparent.<P><BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All I wonder is that why after hundreds of valid posts, with more and more wizards getting frustrated at the lack of movement, that Absor hasn't even bothered to respond? Even with just a friendly reminder that he's even reading the concerns and suggestions that Wizards have valiantly (and it seems futilely) put forward? It seems that whenever any class speaks of balance issues or group playability, they are heard and met with either rational arguments, or blatant dismissal. <BR>Funny enough how wizards seem to be the only class that are *hopeful* for ANY response, be it blatant dismissal or otherwise.<BR>There are so many issues with this class, and I won't go into detail because most of the wizards who have posted on this and the previous threads have probably done a better job of it than I could, the only issue I'd like to point out being that so many people seem to dismiss the PvP servers as not worth absor's time... <BR>&lt;== Plays on TZ<BR>What can I say Absor but why do you ignore us? And yes I CAN say that you are ignoring us, because all of the other classes posts have had little "yes I'm still listening" replies attached. <BR>Granted, reading dozens of pages of text can be tedious, but hey, aren't you the guy they pay to interact with players? The key words being *interact with* not *humour and dismiss*<BR>On a final note, the posts are brilliant, I myself have been reading a lot of them, and you guys should be proud, it only saddens me to see rational wizard enthusiasts like Grimstaff getting increasingly frustrated (yes I did sense that by reading your posts) and leaving. These people don't deserve the dismissal you're giving them. All I ask is that you come on the board, click the reply key, and say: <BR>"Yes, I'm still listening"<P>But alas, this post will most likely be swallowed up in the flow of other valid posts that will appear on this board, all asking for the same thing, recognition. <P>I hope you actually read this and all the other posts Absor, and prove that you have, because my opinion of the validity of this thread as an engine for change in a fundamentally flawed class is flagging. Furthermore, and if this comes off as somewhat of an attack I'm sorry, I believe that you Absor must at least type a few words in a reply window, because *It's your JOB*<P>I've said my piece, I hope I've been heard.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have looked through just about all the posts here and seem to see the same thing being said when it comes down to us Wizards and that's "we need to have our spells damage over all increased to a fare amount, not 1 or 2% but more 15 to 25 % on all spells meaning 1 to 60" and some sort of better mana regen be it a meditate rate increase or some sort of pool incress.There are a few questions that I need to have cleared up that still don't seem to make any sense so maybe if Absor is reading this he can look into it a bit and see why its set up this way.<P>1.Ok 3 our of the 4 pure casters classes are pet classes(Yes I know that Enchanters pet isn't really that good but still its something that with the right buffs can tear up a MOB and I'm sure most have seen it so it seems to fit) so why do we all seem to be getting the same amount of mana?...I mean once they cast up a pet they can sit, get back all the mana they just used to make the pet and start fighting, wouldn't it make more sense since we Wizards have only our mana to add to a fight  should we get way more from the start? Like maybe 40 to 50% more(now that seems like a lot but think what a pet cost to cast and how much mana is used and it would really fit the idea in most ways), Trust me I'm not knocking the pet casters out there and its not a class envy thing it just common sense...there pets are an extension of there mana pool and it sort of like  stored mana for them to use when there ready which brings me to the next point....mana Storage.<P>2.Harvest is a nice idea and its been some what helpful to most Wizards out there I'm sure, me included but it is a bit weak in some ways when your looking at 300 mana back at level 60,yes it saves some down time but that's it?..300 mana? Why isn't there a better way of getting our mana back? I have an idea for a sort of Storage Staff or a Mana Bottle that we can get early on as a quest and have it increases as we get higher.<P>Ok short and sweet....you get a quest at like level 15 or 20 that isn't that crazy to finish and what you get in return is say a Staff that, with the help of a new spell, can store mana for a later time when you really need it like in a pinch..The spell will get upgrades of a sort that will help you store more mana ...level 20 stores 250 to 300 level 30 stores 450 to 500 and so on. The staff's mana will disappear when you log (much like a pet will when the caster zones or camps) and will have a fast right-clickable, non-stun effect when used. It can be a Staff, Orb, Mana vile what have you but by the time you reach level 60 it can hold somewhere in the area of 750 to 1000 mana ..Sounds like a lot but just look at the spells and the mana cost and it really adds up if you ask me and like the pet classes you can cast the spell drain your mana and sit and get it all back THEN start the fight knowing that you have a better reserve incase you need to use it and there is no need to up the mana pool with this item just add the quests and the spells and its good to go.<P>Also please up the damage we can do(case in point level 44 Magician spell does 26 less damage then our level 44 spell...that's just sad and they have a pet that will do one hell of a job on a MOB) and the types of spells we get(more of a variety of them to choose from at all levels...we do have the most variety but its at a cost and the cost is that we will need to use lower level spells to hit a MOB that might be resisting the current one we had gotten at out level..Case in point..Level 44 we get a fire based spell but no magic or ice based to keep us on par with that level..It's a worthless spell in a place like Sol B because of the fire-based MOBs that live there).<BR>For all who read this Thank you for you time and I hope my idea makes some sense and is looked at to "balance" a fun class ,Take care  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm 56, a pretty good wizard and due to my work schedule, a casual player on the weekdays.  I have a rather large guild who starts earlier then I do when forming experiecne groups.  In short, I log on and there's no build in guild group for me.<P>So night after night I go to OS or KC and shout for a group.  I am deluged with tells in OS to port people out.  I havent had a pick up experience group in about a week.  <P>We are NOT group friendly.  As it is now we have NOTHING unique to offer to a group.  If I was a group, I wouldnt pick a wizard either unless i was doing AE.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One thing i seem to see here alot now too is the Velious MOB's and there major incress of HP's,maybe the people over at Verant forgot us when they upped there HP's or didnt' see this coming..one idea that i have seen to help in this is the % spell that will take say 10 or 15% of a MOB's HP when cast so if you are attacking a MOB that is like 200,000 HP's it will do somehwere in the ranger of 20,000 to 25,000 HP's which will help in a great way and if the spellis Velious-only Uber MOB's that might help a bit too because there the ones that we seem to be having the biggest trouble with. One Draw back ofcorse will be we will be the most hated thing on that creatures list but i have not trouble dying in a group to do that much damage as long as feel like i have helped in some major way im happy (oh yea and a rez) <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Response to Absor's summary:<P>1) I don't think wizards should get invis to undead.<P>2) I really think a group-based Harvest would go a long way to making us more group-friendly without increasing solo power (just don't count other wizards in the group, we don't want groups with six wizards running around).<P>3) Epics should be hard, but one class's should not be obviously harder than others.<P>4) A Resist Summons buff would make us more unique, and would fit right into teleporting prowess.<P>5) Give Al'Kabor's line a short stun to fix em or make them same mana eff as Jyll's line.<P>6) I would MUCH rather have a group snare.  It is something unique, and while sometimes difficult to use I don't want it to be easy to use like a druid or ranger.  Single snares are their job.  Being a group snare also makes quad-kiting more difficult as we have to snare them all at once... much more difficult.  I definately like a challenge.<P>7) To fix the Enstill line you should give them a minimum amount of time they will last.  Nothing huge, it could start at 5 seconds and end at 15 seconds for fetter.  After the min time was up its normal random duration would be fine.  Any hit or spell should cancel it.<P>8) I really think an AE root might be fun now.  Would aggro mobs like crazy but it would be fun.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  A point blank AE stun would be nice or a Thunderbold upgrade.<P>9) The level 56 Markar's Discord spell is WAY too rare I think it does not exist anymore.<P>Thanks for listening!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"We are a good class. However there are issues...we're a one trick pony."<P>I completely agree that there are issues, but I also think that our one trick is severely underrated.  My shaman is 52, and my DoTs and pet are impressive, but blasts are the only damage spells which can save a life.<P>The thing that gets on my nerves is that most wizards seem to think that changing the "masters of magical damage" to "masters of FAST magical damage" was just a Verant cop-out.  A wizard's nukes are surgical strikes--overwhelming force PRECISELY when and where it is needed, not infinitely sustainable damage capability.<P>When playing a wizard, I will try to nuke as a final blow (if we must have no runners), try to nuke so the next meleer hit kills the creature (none of my mana is wasted), or nuke to try to get something to begin running (to allow meleers as many "free hits" as possible).  I might burn harder than I have to because mana is good compared to tank hit points and healer mana, or I might sit out a fight or two entirely because the rest of the party can handle those two fights with their eyes closed, and I know I'll need mana for an upcoming healing mob or potential bad pull.  Maybe mana is alright, but not full, so I will stun as often as I can--I do a little damage, and that loss of combat rounds may as well be a heal.  If we pull two, I can help kill the first as fast as possible then ignore the second, or I can AE for a tad higher mana efficiency and root-park the one that runs for me.<P>All done with blasts.  But intelligently used blasts.  It's maddening to me that it seems so many wizards just want to be able to chain-cast on every pull and never run out on mana--these desires mean that the REAL balance problems (Velious hit points, scaling of mob hit points in relation to a wizard's blast of appropriate level, and possibly the ability to do modest sustained damage, given we are 100% mana dependent) may go ignored.<P>I liked how a friend of mine put the wizard's role: Every problem looks like a nail if the only tool you have is a hammer--but wizards have an entire boxful of hammers to choose from, and they all have uses.<P>/rant off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk,<P>I believe your description of when and how a wizard should blast is pretty accurate and I think most wizards would agree that this is the wisest way to manage our limited mana pool. <P>But given the fact that our blasts are only fractionally better than those of other classes, there is not an overwhelming reason to bring a wizard into a group when those other classes have more ways of contributing.<P>I enjoy the roles of sending mobs running and finishing runners, but a wizard is not needed for this. Rogues have the mob running and down before my nukes can go off. I remember the first time I grouped with a rogue. He did my job faster than I could and without the mana limits I am faced with. I was completely astounded.<P>So we're still faced with the problem that we are not needed. I believe a successful class based system should be built on interdependence.<P>Wizards need tanks. <BR>Wizards need enchanters. <BR>Wizards need healers.<P>But they only need us when they want to go to a couple of the planes.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
