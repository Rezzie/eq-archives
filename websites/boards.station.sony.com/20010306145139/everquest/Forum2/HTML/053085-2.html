</FONT><HR>I think mid lvl quests is a great idea. The Collar of Neshika was a good step in the right direction, but it is a little heavy for a monk only collar. I suggest more quests that are not easy but not impossible to achieve for DECENT not uber armor that is wearable by only a monk.  It would be a nice addition. I'm sure a lot of monks would have no problem questing for an item and would love to wear armor that can only be wore by the monk class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I always hate being a late responder to posts like this, cause I get the feeling Absor/Abashi/whoever simply are not gonna bother reading all 8/9/10+ pages of a thread.<P>As a level 53 Monk, there are a whole lot of issues I'd feel qualified to comment on, but seeing as how I want a blue name to read this, I'll only list a few, keeping them short and in point form.<P>1) Masters of Melee.  Clearly, Monks are not the masters of melee. Rogues are, with warriors placing second. A Monk with the most uber of gear DOES indeed outdamage a warrior on many occasions.<BR>This raises issue #2<P>2) Weapons. Only a Monk with the most UBER of weapon (tranquil staff or better) or Celestial Fists, can dish out warrior calibur damage in a battle.  We are only the masters of melee with the most elite of gear. I believe that a monk, even with his normal fists, should out-melee a warrior save for one who has the most uber warrior weapon.<P>Proposed Solution? Increase the Monk's natural haste/damage of his fists. Starting at 50, I think you should re-tweak the damage/delay of fists, so that Monks do not have to rely on rare uber weapons to keep up with warriors and rogues for melee damage.<P>3) AC.  Clearly a warrior in full plate/planar type armor should have a higher AC than a monk who is in robes. The bulk of a Monk's AC should lie in his defensive skills.  I don't think most monks are asking for AC like a warrior.  While I was terribly disappointed in Shiverback, and even in Silvermoon armor to a degree, I do not think it would be balancing to give monks better AC than warriors.  I DO think our defensive skills (defense, dodge, riposte, block,) should be much higher than a warriors tho. You think a warrior should be able to outmanouver a Monk with all that gear on?  <P>Proposed Solution: Any and all defensive skills for a monk should be higher than that of a warrior. It just makes sense.  Someone told me warriors have equal or higher defnese skills than monks. This makes no sense and should be addressed and tweaked to the monk's favor.<P>4) Feign Death.  I'm mentioning this even tho I don't see it as a HUGE balance issue to the class. I just think the way it works is problematic, and dangerous to other players. (Gung FDs in Frenzy room, then halls ass to stairs and FDs again... waits, runs to gargoyles and FDs again. Gets to zone and thinks all is clear, then 30,000 frogs spiders skeletons appear killing dozens of players.  Un-nerf the FD nerf.<P>5) Disciplines: Thunderkick.  "Gung has landed a Thunderous Kick (24)".  Trakanon's head is still spinning, I bet. Come on guys, this is a level 52 Discipline. The most I've kicked for is 181 points of damage, and i can still count the number of times I've kicked *higher* than my normal kick on my fingers.  This should either be a flurry of kicks, or something at LEAST double a max normal kick. Otherwise, what the heck is the good of it?  And PLEASE don't start with the comparison that a Thunder kick is akin to a warrior critical hit cause it is NOT in ANY way similar, as many others (including mylsef) have pointed out many times.<P>The only other thing I want to talk about is the Monk weight limit. After spending 11k pp on two Tink bags, I'm pretty good for carrying things and no going over weight.  The problem is coins. I can only carry a handful of platinum, and must destroy all other coins. Can't even carry gold.  Would be nice if monks could get a coin bag of some sort that would reduce coin weight.  but that's an idea, not a real balance complaint.<P><BR>Gung Fumaster<BR>53 Monk<BR>Veeshan<P><BR>Those are my only issues with the class now.. I could complain about our small hitpoints</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to comment on the following proposal, since I'm a paladin and feel concerned<BR>"6) Increase Warrior, Paladin, and ShadowKnight taunting skills.<BR>Yes, I know this isn't an enhancement to MONKS, but it would DEFINITELY help us out. WE ARE NOT TANKS. Unfortunately, it's very hard to taunt off of us due to our extreme aggro, ESPECIALLY with our low-damage, low-delay epic fists. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE implement this one change if you don't make any other!!"<P>Why would that help monks? I mean, if I'm in a group with a monk I'll let him tank and never use taunt anyway.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yet another monk supporting Zadkiel's post... <P>But two excellent ideas not really detailed in it but suggested by other posters are:<P>Increasing of hand to hand damage post 50, and perhaps H2H delay earlier - warriors use weapons, monks hands ARE their weapons...<P>Adding in more defensive skills.  Perhaps a secondary block type skill, and a secondary riposte type skill to further add to our defensive ability in an appropriate fashion rather than just increasing AC or HP.  A similar skill allowing us to avoid or mitigate the damage of magic/spell attacks in a monkly fashion would also make sense.<P>Monks are a unique and interesting class, though much of that has been eroded since Kunark - help restore that uniqueness and character/flavor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>because monks have less HP/AC than you.. therefor.. if you let us tank, the cleric uses more mana on us and the group as a whole has more downtime waiting for the cleric to get his mana back.. therefore you gain xp at a slower rate.. if you taunted like you were supposed to the cleric wouldnt need to heal as much.. downtime would be reduced and you would gain xp at a faster rate..<P>so your given the choice of taunt and gain more xp or dont taunt and gain less xp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kug, Please stop cluttering this discussion about the monk class with posts from a low level paladin who does not understand the fundamentals of the game.  Paladins have far more hps than a monk, and a far easier time getting a significantly high AC (Read: Plate Armor).  This discussion board topic is for monk balance.  Unless you are a monk, your inputs here really aren't all that relevant, especially when they are inaccurate.  My level 25 paladin has over 2/3 the hp of my level 53 monk who wears equipment that adds over 500 hps to him.  Without being completely HP/AC based my monk would have nearly the SAME hps as my level 26 warrior.<P>Thanks,<BR>Cymorg<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And at level 60 let me tell you something I couldn't care less if they set my taunt skill to zero, like I ever use it. and to answer your question monks have higher AC than pallies or SKs and much better defense skills (and maybe 10% less HPs).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Now, with the nerf to FD that happened a while back (meant to hurt primarily necros), our pulling ability is not what it should be. With rogues outdamaging monks, we arent the masters of melee we should be either.<P>lets look at rogues. They get better armor. They get defensive skills the monk does not (parry and evade). Additionally, rogues do not have to deal with the 14 stone wieght penalty that monks do. This penalty is very heavy and should be noted.<P>I think that something must be done to make monks more viable. Here are some of the changes I propose. <P>1. Armor. Our planes and expansion gear is, in a word, limp. I admit that we arent sposed to tank, but 6 ac for our plane of growth helm (btw, did you guys just forget about the crown of the froglock kings or something?)? 6 ac for our Thurgadin legs (jesus, gatorscale legs are better than that!)? Im not asking for a 24 ac helm, or 24 ac legs, but 6 is just too damn sorry.<P>2. FD. We are pullers and damage dealers. By forcing us to fd-quit you take our damage out of the equation for a solid 2 minutes. Let FD clear agro for monks!<P>3.Though I can understand that VI screwed up on rogues and you had to make them damage dealers, I still think monk damage should be closer to rogue damage. I suggest placing a higher minimum damage on kicks, this would help tremendously.<P>4. Why do warriors get stunning kicks and monks dont!? That just silly if you ask me. We deserve stunning kicks.<P>These are my pet peaves. I think people should really try to appreciate the enormity of the 14 lb limit and how it screws monks. Also, remember how utterly few hp we have. We pay alot for our monklyness, make our monklyness better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sure you are seeing a lot of repeat posts, the same general thing over and over.  More damage, more damage avoidance, some way to lose agro.  <P>There is a reason for this, as per how verant has defined monks "much like warriors who give up heavy armor to do massive amounts of damage" just doesn't fit monks anymore.  Pre-Kunark monks fit that quite well, and yes monks still do massive amounts of damage, but nothing special compared to the warrior with 200 more ac and twice the hit points, and we don't hold a candle to rogue's damage.<P>Please refer to Bodi/Valares post for the well thought out suggestions on how to make a monk fill the role you say we have.<P>I did want to suggest that we need better defensive ability, not more armorclass, just a better ability to not be hit, currently what we have in the way of damage avoidance isn't significant in comparison to other tank classes, with 400 hp less than a paladin, fully buffed i require 2 complete heals during a fight versus the paladin's one, this was the same night, fighting the same mobs and the paladin was a level lower.  That tells me that I don't stack anywhere near a paladin, let alone a warrior in defensive department.  That is why people ask for higher caps on dodge/block/riposite and adding parry.<P>Damage wise, warriors are able to do significantly equal or with velios items, more damage than monks, is that the way it suposed to be?  From our understanding as a community, the answer is no, that is why we ask for things such as the damage bonus on off hand.<P>Monks just don't have the ability to survive if things turn on us.. If our defensive abilities were increased.. ie parry/dodge/riposite/block, this might not be a problem, but currently monks desperately need a way to lose agro.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/bow Zadkiel<BR>/bow Bodi<P>I support the post made by Zadkiel in the first thread. It was developed with input from many monks on the Monkly Business web site/message forum, which Zadkiel graciously devotes his time to create and maintain. I think that it addresses many Monk concerns, much of which are about the post-50 game. This seems to be appropriate, based upon what I have read and heard about (my monk is only 35, but I have been playing him since March 1999).<P>I did have a few items that I wanted to add (some new thoughts, some emphasis on other posts):<P>1. Flying Kick Minimum Damage. How about making the minimum damage of a successful Flying Kick equal to the player's level (similar to Rogues' backstab)? If not that formula, how about making the min. damage equal to one-fifth the player's skill level in Flying Kick? This would scale well across the levels, not just post-50.<P>2. Maximum Flying Kick Damage. How about increasing the maximum damage to be equal to the player's skill level in Flying Kick? This would of course increase the overall average damage done by this special attack.<P>3. Increase the skill caps on all of the Monk special attacks to 250 (post-50).<P>4. Add the chance (post-50) for Flying Kick to result in a "string" of attacks, as suggested in Zadkiel's post. I really love that idea, but if that can't be implemented, then how about a chance to double-kick from level 50 onwards?<P>5. Add a chance to stun to Dragon Punch / Tail Rake:<P>a. The stun would only have a chance to hit if the special attack hits, and then should have a percent chance based on the player's skill level in the special attack. One possible formula: chance to stun = (skill level / 400). This would give the level 25 monk a 32% chance to stun after a successful punch/rake, and the level 60 monk a 63% chance (based on a 250 skill cap). If the special attack misses, there would be no stun.<P>b. The duration of the stun could be based on the player's level, with a formula like (level - 25)/5 (seconds), rounded down to the nearest whole number of seconds. This would yield a zero-second stun at level 25 (but would still interrupt casters), and a 7 second stun at level 60. <P>From a roleplaying aspect this makes sense to everyone, I think. Monks are martial arts masters, they should be able to stun and thus temporarily disable their opponent, and this ability should increase with their experience and training.<P><BR>Summary:<P>I support the suggestion about offhand damage bonuses made in Zadkiel's post, and think that this would go a long way towards making Monk damage output fall somewhere between warriors and rogues (which I think everyone agrees is where it should be). <P>I think that the Monk special attacks are one of the things that help make the class unique, and would like to see the suggestions above considered in addition to the offhand damage proposal. <P>In my opinion, modifying Dragon Punch/Tail Rake as above would increase our benefit to a group, and also force us to choose between the higher damage of Flying Kick (if the first 2 of my points are implemented) or the possiblity of stunning the target. This choice would make the game more interesting for Monks, I think.<P>----------------------------------------------<P>Now, if you've read this far, I would also like to thank you (Absor and Verant) for holding these class balance "talks" and listening to players voice their concerns. It think that the opportunity is appreciated by most who read any EverQuest-related web site or message board and is seen as a very positive thing. I am sure that distilling all of the information and then deciding what to implement has got to be a monumental task for the team, good luck with it. I know that many suggestions will not be implemented in the class balance tuning, but hope that they provide much food for thought for new content and improvements to the EverQuest world in the future. <P>/bow<P>Zude Turcopolier<BR>35th Monk<BR>Sign of One<BR>Karana<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>As one of the 3000+ registered users on Monkly-Business, Absor, I point your attention to the post compiled by Bodi.  The topic was debated mightily on the message boards there.  <P>After reading these threads, additional changes I'd make:<P>1 - Monks were masters pre-50 (prior to Kunark).  Too many new weapons for the other melee classes have filtered down to the lower levels.  Monks aren't the masters any more.  Add a damage bonus to the off-hand when fighting hand-to-hand.  Take another look at the damage/delay ratios of fists from 20 to 60 and compare it with the weapons that are now becoming common-place for the other classes.  (A fighting baton, obtainable in Dalnir at 30, is 8/20.  Why aren't my fists anywhere near that?)<P>2 - Casters.  I see them.  I die.  I can't interrupt them.  At level 30, I got a message indicating that my hands had become magic weapons.  How about letting the special attacks, all of them, have a chance at interrupting a caster at 30 also.<P>3a - Epic weapon.  Celestial fists.  Haste effect doesn't stack with anything.  You get hasted by someone else, you lose ATK and AC.  Fix it.<P>3b - Epic weapon.  Celestial fists.  To obtain it, you need to turn in your robe.  Give the robe back.  It's bad enough that you have to camp Raster forever, and Targin and then find Qwinn and Zephyl.  Or take the shortcut and 'gank' Zephyl or Qwinn to get the RoTLC once.  By keeping the RoTWF, you have 2 do it twice!  And pawbuster twice.  And the iksar betrayer twice.  Give back the RoTWF and you'll cut the lines down so people are only camping once.<P>3c - Epic weapon.  Celestial fists.  Damage/delay isn't really epic when you compare it with some of the weapons available for the other classes.<P>4 - Feign death.  You broke it.  It doesn't save lives in a group.  It doesn't save lives when you're at less than 2 bubbles of health.<P>5 - Shackles.  Let the humans wear them.  If they want to do the faction work to get into Cabilis, let them wear the shackles.  Means you'll have to adjust the foraged stuff so it isn't no-drop.  Means you'll have to load the newbie note on a random MOB (goblin agressor in LOIO)?<P>6 - Headbands and sashes.  Increase AC and stats on them.  Make them no-drop.  Iksar are supposed to pay a faction penalty for their AC and regen.  Currently nothing prevents them from creating a mule to get headbands and sashes (needed for the robes to get to celestial fists).<P>7 - Armor.  Natural progression seems to be -- raw silk, cured silk, crescent, shiverback, panther.  For what possible reason does the raw AC drop on some items as you go up?  Find out what most monks are wearing.  We all have pretty much the same items in the same slots, with the exception of jewelry.  It would be nice to wear our monk only armors.  Boost the AC on the monk only's to be comparable to that which we are already wearing.<P>8 - Weight.  The only beef I have with the 14 pound weight is the weapons I have to use to keep up with the warriors damage wise to be wanted in a group.  Drop the weapon weight.  Give us a quest for a weightless soulbound bag to hold all the soulbound keys in that also reduces any coin weight.  (I was fighting in DL the other day in a pickup group at 17 pounds, no coin.  One of the group members had split on and I kept destroying silver and copper until he turned it off.  The only thing I looted was some bone chips because I couldn't take the AC hit (5 per pound) from gaining too much weight by looting coins.  When you're already being hit for over 100 a pop, every AC drop hurts).<P>9 - Casters.  I see them.  I die.  I can't interrupt them.  At level 30, I got a message indicating that my hands had become magic weapons.  How about letting the special attacks, all of them, have a chance at interrupting a caster at 30 also.  (Yes, I know I have this down twice, but this weekend I separately encountered 2 green casters.  I managed to zone with less than a bubble of health with the first one, and finally killed the second when I had less than half health remaining after using mend. -- AT LEVEL 40!)<P>Gheckoh<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Before you stop considering the idea of increasing skills.<P>The current perspective is that a warrior with a Riposte skill of a 240 and a monk with a Riposte skill of 240 have the same amount of skill. (riposte is used just as an example, insert any skill shared amond melees)<P>While I don't necessarily think this is true, I can see why we as a whole don't like the idea that our skill caps are the same level.<P>I'd like to see monks get some kind of bonus.  Alot of what is asked for comes in the way of new items, new skills, new disciplines, etc.  So I'll add to it.<P>Personally I think the 'combo' attack idea is just too cool.  It would definately give monks a reason to continue to train those dead skills.  Maybe if all skills were at 200, getting a successful roll on all of the checks would cause the Round Kick to stun.<P>Back to my idea.  I'd like to see monks with 200+ Riposte skill never be hit by riposted attacks.  Have this be skill based, but if a monster riposte's a monk's attack when the monk has 200+ skill in Riposte, the monk should have 100% chance to either block, dodge, or re-riposte the attack back at the monster and a Zero% chance to be hit by the riposte.<P>With the number of attacks monks make due to CFs, 1hb weapons and haste spells, and the 800+ dmg that a monster does per hit on some of the 'Uber' monsters, 2-3 ripostes can kill the monk.<P>That's just not right.<P>monk<P>(I also agree with the Monkly Business post's points)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bodi's post mentions allowing off-hand damage bonus, and that this would require the removal of monks from the class list of the Moss Covered Twig. While the Twig is probably the item that this would affect the most, there are quite a few other weapons that would become much nicer for offhand use. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, one modification to this idea that I have heard, and like, is to restrict the offhand damage bonus to hand-to-hand only. This would avoid the need to review all the offhand weapons currently monk-usable, while leaning a bit back towards the original view of monks not concentrating on weapon use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One issue that monks are currently faced with is early obselescene. I played a monk through 23rd level, as my first character. Even with the weapons I could obtain (i.e. were within my budget, not were that I was capable of going to get.) I was, in almost all aspects, inferior to a warrior.<BR>I had fewer hp's, less ability to avoid damage, did less damage (which actually helped. I nearly cried when the war mentioned how it was so great grouping with a monk rather than a wizard cause he never had to taunt), couldn't stun (slaming big guy warriors). I could instill doubt... occasionally. like one in four fights. If I wanted to not use my special attacks much. And I ahd spent an incredible amount of time working that skill up to max.<BR>Feign Death made me a good puller.<BR>I could jump off the platform at the bank in Kelethin. Made a good shortcut.<BR>That's about it.<P>What suggestions I have to combat this? I dunno...<P>Maybe allow us to use multiple special attacks? Don't increase the number of 'attack buttons' available, but don't make them keep each other from being used.  At 23rd that would give me (sorry memory a bit fuzzy) say two specials, instill doubt.. was there something else that had to be on those buttons? mend or feign death maybe?<P>Or perhaps stuns on some of our mid level attacks? (the punch type attacks only maybe?) How about a chance for a 0 second stun on all our special attacks (ala the enchanters DD series spell 0 second stun.. interupts casting nothing else). It would make us useful against caster mobs anyway.<P>Better equipment availablility at lower levels would, of course, help, but would make the monk loose much of it's flavor...<P>An easier way to get magic gloves is one thing I would look at equipment wise. All other classes can obtain a magic weapon relativly easy within their first 10 levels. I see some (admittedly not so good) magic weapons auctioned as little as 5pp in Gfay and east commons regularly. Maybe a quest at the three monk guilds which will get some ac 2 +1 (some stat.. make it vary for individuallity between the guilds) magic gloves that is reasonably accomplishable by a level 7 or so monk. After all, a level 1 barbarian shaman can get a magic hammer with a 20 min run.<P>Something that might make the monk a more groupie class.. Most people believe, and most trials seem to indicate, that the various stat buffs (str, dex, agi, sta) are really not that useful. There is some effect but it is not very noticable, except str in very large quantities. Possibly you could look into 'enhancing' the effect stats have on the monk, since we are such a 'gearless' class? That would make the various stat buffers very much more our friends.<P><BR>Oh.. another thing. This is just a know your role type thing, but when we'd fight something with a damage shield, I'd get eaten alive by greens... Most fighters could take the punishment, or, even better, switched to a big hitting two hander. Probably not really a balance issue. Just something the monks aren't good at.<P><BR>I'll go back to playing my enchanter now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm posting in this thread for all the concerned tanks out there (warriors, paladins and SKs).<P>Monks have entirely TOO MUCH defensive ability.<P>They don't have the same level of hit points as do warriors, pallies, and SKs so their health bar drops faster, but (espeically against low blues) they take about the same amount of damage. If a cleric is in the group using complete heals that is unimportant. But if a shaman or druid is healing then a monk tanks as well as any other class.<P>I don't know WHY monks tank so well since their armor appears to be inferior. I suspect it's a combination of their higher defensive caps and higher dodge / block / riposte skills.<P>I play a level 54 paladin with all valorium / deepwater armor. When I was level 52 a monk in my former guild challenged me to a competition tanking fire giants in Sol B (he was the same level as me). I'd tank one until it died, then he'd do it. He required about twice as many complete heals as I did because his total HPs were lower. BUT an evaluation of our logs showed that he took the same total damage. Had a shaman been healing we'd have required the same number of heals.<P>Given the MUCH increased damage output of monk this cannot hope to be considered balanced.<P>Harlan S'pectre<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) Minimum damage on special attacks.  (3 damage is just wrong at 50+ levs)<P>2) Feign Death needs to be reevaluated for the high end game.  Should be more effective that it currently is...especially in the new lands.<P>3) Instill doubt fails way way too often.  With max skill against a mob 10-12 levs below you it succeeds maybe 1 in 5/6 tries..and even when it works it often only lats for a couple of seconds. Make this skill work 1 in 3 against low blues at least.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I feel that 3 discliplines need to be re-evaulated to made more effective: Thunderkick,  Hundredfist, Ashenhand.<P>Thunderkick:<BR>Minimum damage on Thunderkick.<P><BR>Hundredfist:<BR>If you compare damage from the haste effect from Hundredfist against the Innerflame disclipline, you will see that that it does LESS damgage than inneflame. Both discliplines have the same recycle time. 29~25 min <P>Ideally, outright replacing Hundredfist with a Evasive disclipline (ala warrior) would be excellent. <P><BR>Ashenhand:<BR>Considering a level 60 monk is capable of soloing ANY mob under 45, the instakill aspect of the ashenhand discpline is utterly worthless. It does a "suprising" amound of damage *400-500* and has a 72 min recycle.<P>Considering that you can do 1500-2000+ damage using the innerflame disclipline, the *suprising* amount of damage from Ashenhand isn't that impressive, plus the chances of instakilling the mob are so small that it's not a reliable method of using it to dispatch of a mob.<P>I propose one of 2 methods of improving this disclipline<P>1) Reduce recycle time of Ashenhand to 15-20 min, change nothing else about it.<P>2) Keep it at 72 min recycle, but dramatically improve instakill chances, plus raise level cap *around33% chance of killing the mob* <BR>NOTE: instakill leaves no corpse/no xp<P><BR>Other changes:<BR>Please evaluate some of the armor pieces that are dropping and add Monk to the list of useable classes. There are some Beautiful pieces of stuff dropping that monks cant use. (i.e. Lodizal Shell boots 14 ac 7 str 20 hp .1 wt effect turtle skin)<BR>there is NO reason that armor like that can't be worn by monks. There are Numerous pieces that give a slight armor increase over existing equipment that sould have monks on the list of useable classes.<P>Change the Monk Velious quest armor to a new texture! make it look like chain, that tazmark armor, anything but the way it looks now.<P>That's all, thanks for listening<P><BR>Torc<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are allot of good ideas already, so I will try not to be too redundant. <P>Something that I think all classe/races need, especially monks, is more choices of armor. Not better or more powerful armor, but different looking armor. There is just a bit too little individualism in the characters' looks. It boring when everyone looks the same.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After playing a monk for 51 lvls as a primary character I have to agree with all the things set forth in the original post.  <P>While I think we are a good class the post 50 game has seen us decline in power and usefulness (see SOV zones where things don't buy feign and have more HP than Bill Gates has money).<P>Although I still feel we are a viable class I think we could use some work.  It seems that those that yell the loudest get the most, but alas, that is not the way of most of those who play a monk.  In turn, we seem to have been overlooked at times.<P>All we ask is for you to make us the class that we all know we can be.  Not over powered, not under powered, just one walking can of Mob Beating (just add water).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053085&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053085&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
