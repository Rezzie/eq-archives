Because Verant says it is, plain and simple.<P>You can take your RoC, you can take your made up 'official' definition for a slang term, and you can take your cheater's mentality, put them in a nice, neat pile and set them on fire. They don't have even the tiniest relevence to the situation. Verant says fearing into walls is an exploit. If they catch you, you'll be warned. If they catch you again, you may be banned.

</FONT><HR>I have seen this argument many times before, and usually just sat back and observed.  Now, I feel I must say something.  Several others have posted views on this in this thread already, and I agree with them.<P>There is no such thing as an "exploit" in a computer game.<P>That's right.  Unless you are using some sort of outside program (like a character editor) to affect the game program, it is not possible to "cheat."  To suggest so is ludicrous.  How can I possibly "cheat" at a computer game?  The entire world is defined around you in a computer game; you can do NOTHING that is not allowed by the code.  Cheating in a sport is doing something disallowed by the rules, because the rules are a small subset of what is possible for a human in the real, natural world.  That situation is impossible in a computer game.  The game itself defines the natural world.<P>If they are upset because players are using the horrible pathing for more than just creating record-breaking trains, then they had better change the code.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Where Verant is concerned, it is best to keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth shut.  Dont bother to have any action with the GMs unless absolutely needed or you are likely to find your name changed or that of some poor bugger next to you, og od knows what.  Use the /bug command for real bugs that shaft the players.<P>I frankly dont care if people "cheat" in this game because that term is meaningless.  This is not a competitive game.  It sure would be nice if all the persons wishing to tell others how to conduct their own private business would be subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism of their lives.  Maybe then they wouldnt have the time to bother other people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think anyone here would be so vocal about defending this company if it were Microsoft's bugs.  In fact if there was a bug in Windows not letting you play EverQuest for some reason, you'd be screaming your lungs off saying they've violated your civil rights and that everyone working for them should be shot.  If Verant Interactive can't fix their software, they really shouldn't punish someone for using their heads to gain an advantage.<P>It's like pounding your head with a hammer, because it feels so good when you stop.  Why would anyone on earth want to do in game things that were harder than they really needed to be.  Pathing exploits or whatver exploits.  If they can't fix it, then they should quit selling it, until they can fix it.  Are the Ford Explorer's tires bugs?  What would you say if Ford told you, you just can't drive over 35mph, sorry, but it's a bug, but we don't care, or can't fix it.  Is a bug anything more than a defect?

</FONT><HR>Actually just for those that don't realize it, nobody not even the mighty VI can cancel a contract without cause(implied contract or no). Second VI DOES NOT define a bug, a bug is defined by the end user(us the customers, regardless of wording etc..), there is simply no way around that fact. Very simply put were this to go to court it would not last long as it is fairly clear cut, VI would loose. And I for one would welcome that, it might actually give a little kick to verant to actually fix the problems instead of just banning for abuse.<P>Just as a side note, pathing is not the only way to handle the movement of mobs, yes it takes a few cycles and yes it is more difficult to program but a dyanamic A* pathfinder could most certienly handle it. I have already seen several in principal models of a dyanamic A* that I think could handle it. Pathing is just so 90's technology when are we gonna advance.<P>I tired maybe crazy AI programer.(Yes I know I can't spell but no thogg comparisons peasle, that hurts) hehe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed: <BR>Am I cheating when my group is fearing things into a wall? Am I cheating when I can dance around in a room without getting hit because the creature can't make up it's mind how to get to me? Am I cheating when I nuke myself to break root on myself? <P>Nope, I'm playing the game. This virtual world has been created as a framework for playing a game and if the framework has problems, they need to fix them. If I get warned/banned, so be it. But, I haven't before.<P>As far as other games go, I played UO for a while. I played AC and still am playing it while I'm playing EQ(yes, I can play 2 games at the same time). You'll notice that I'm not complaining about EQ. I'm just stating my opinion which is that Verant should fix the problem if they don't want it to happen. If they can't fix it, they should leave it alone instead of banning people. I think it should be fixed, but if they are not going to fix it, the tactic will be used. It's a game. It's not a moral arena. If I were on a PvP server and doing this to you, I could see the cause for alarm. But, when it's a generic NPC, what does it matter? I'm not competing with anyone. I'm not ruining anyone else's fun nor is my group(since I can't fear too many things myself). <P>Once again, aside from wall-fearing, how many bannable offenses exist in the game currently that are dependent on a flaw in the game mechanics? I sure can't think of any  now. There used to be plenty(none of which I participated in, btw) Amazingly enough, when it became apparent that it was a problem, it was fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Here's its definition of bug:<P>"An unwanted and unintended property of a program or piece of hardware, esp. one that causes it to malfunction."<P>The full definition can be found at this link:<BR>http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/bug.html<P>Who decides what's unwanted?  You might argue that the user does... but since the user didn't "intend" anything as to the program's function, "unintended" definitely refers to the software maker, and therefore in this context so does "unwanted".<P>Was the pathing issue unwanted by Verant?  Definitely.  Unintended by Verant?  Certainly.<P>Also, the use of the term dates back to 1896... hardly modern slang.  I think it's possible to accept an official definition, from this dictionary or another, without asking the individual user what they think it means.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I recognize that the reduced risk is bad from the GM perspective when a mob is feared into a wall, but it seems to me like a bit of in-game verisimilitude.<BR> <BR>Imagine for a second that elves, dwarves, ogres, wizards, shadowknights and necromancers actually exist in an alternate world (in other words, suspend your disbelief as immerse yourself in a fantasy).  Imagine you are a wood elf ranger of the 4th season.  Now a horrible evil dark elven necromancer of the 8th season approaches you and casts a spell.<BR> <BR>Suddenly your very world dissolves in a nightmare chaos of blinding terror.  You run away from the necromancer, anywhere but here, you don't know where you're headed.  Could be off a cliff even, or through an undead-infested ruin, OR INTO A WALL OR CLIFFSIDE.  You would blindly claw and scrabble at the unyielding stone, getting nowhere, your fingernails torn and bleeding, your mind still swallowed up by terror.<BR> <BR>I can easily envision this happening.  The necromancer would destroy the ranger.  Luckily, in this alternate world, the ranger will arise to fight another day.  <BR> <BR>It is just as possible for the ranger to resist the spell and turn and start hacking at the necromancer, interrupting his gestures to break his spellcasts, or for the ranger to outrun the necro to safety, or even to stay out of spell range and arrow-kite the necro.  But sometimes, the bad guy wins.  Otherwise there is no drama at all.<BR> <BR>So if I was a Verant GM who witnessed someone repeatedly slaying a mob using a pathing bug and Fear, I would secretly buff the mob's Magic Resistance, or spawn another mob in the Fear-path that will easily slay the necromancer, or find some way of discouraging this behavior that is IN-GAME and IN CHARACTER.<BR> <BR>Seriously, the GM staff needs more 40-year-old-plus D&D Dungeon Master veterans to teach these youngsters how to balance a game.  They CALL THEMSELVES GM's, but they don't run the game, they spend every shift with their fingers in the Bug Dike like forlorn little dutch boys.<BR> <BR>The Guides should be the ones yanking corpses out of walls and re-popping zones, the GM's (especially lead GM) should be maintaining game balance and running the game on that server.  That would include modifying player behavior through incentives and disincentives.  This game is largely lawless I've noticed.  It could use a little oversight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Otherwise, they're letting it lapse from "bug" into "game feature."  At that point, to reprimand someone for making use of it is like giving someone a ticket for walking on the grass when there's an ancient dirt path trod through it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It is very likely that pathing was used in the game to make host/client interactions much less intense. If collision detection etc were done for every object in the game the network traffic in even the smallest zones would be intense; not to mention the CPU horsepower required to do these checks.<P>So, I suggest that the problems you see are not a bug, or a design flaw; but rather a design compromise. This compromise has some definate positive points, and some negative. However, the game designers may well have looked over the pluses and minuses and said... if we simply add an in game "rule" that you may not use these minuses as an EXPLOIT, then the design benefits from only the pluses, and does not require the extra network traffic and or CPU horsepower to correct the minuses.<P>In otherwords... VI is working within a constraint that allows many players on different levels of computers to enjoy a game. In order to do this they required the addition of a simple rule; don't abuse pathing... You are not willing to follow this rule it would appear. This means that you are not willing to work with them to enjoy the game, or to allow the rest of us to do so.

</FONT><HR>Is it a bug? I dunno. But I do know that Verant knows about them, and refused to fix them.<P>In Kunark, actually, 2 specific places I can remember in the Burning woods, when I was fighting with a Necro, a cleric, and some others, the necro or cleric would fear a wyrm, I'd snare it, and it would turn around...take the same path as it always does, and walk RIGHT into the side of a tree, and get stuck. Over and Over. We petitioned it of course, but as far as I know , it was never fixed. But it's the users fault for using that tactic? I don't think so.<P>First of all, all of us were around 53+ at the time, and although player level doesn't matter, even if we didn't fear the mob, it would be an easy kill. We were fighting close to the wall, but even when we pulled the mobs away from the wall..what do they do when feared? They take the exact same patch. Not only did they take the exact same path when "feared" but also, when their hp is low, and they began to run away..they take the path. But again, that's our fault? Heck, the wyrm could run straight into the middle of the zone for all I care, it's still going to die.<P>Near the crater in the Burning woods, we fought wyrms also. Fear them there? They run a certain distance..then they stop, turn around, turn around, turn around..etc. They could run...no big deal, but they don't, so we killed them. I don't make the pathing rules in the game, I just lived by them. People can argue how they're bugs and all, but that's really beside the point. <P>The pathing in Chardok..is that a bug? I mean..Verant "would" fix pathing bugs right? Even through that whole mess of weird pathing in Chardok, when my guild goes there, we work with it. Mobs disappearing, aggroing through walls, etc. Is it ever fixed, after hundreds of petitions? Nope. I'm not saying I used these "bugs" for an advantage, I don't use bugs..I just play the game.<P>Mobs getting feared into walls, is not something players should be concerned with, or be fearful of getting banned over. It doesn't make any sense.<P>And I laugh at calling that...when they're using "fear" an exploit. <P>When I was 24, and fighting aviaks in the rathe mountains, I found out that it was possible to cast on them at a certain point behind a wall, with no risk to myself. At the time, I thought it was a feature, because in many games I've played, when a mob is stuck behind something, it uses pathfinding to find it's way around. But this didn't. I killed maybe 4, before a fellow wizard I was with thought it was an exploit. Then we started rooting them and killing. It was more dangerous, but we never died.<P>Anyway, that's different I guess. I would probably call what I just listed an exploit, because I used the geometry in the game against the monster (obviously a big NO NO in this game). But, if they want to call fearing mobs into a wall a bug, or an exploit, then the fear spells themselves are bugged, or are exploit spells. In the end, all the blame lies on VI.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Taliskar: you bring up one of the VERY large problems that I have seen with VI's client-server interaction, its a rather huge thread in and of itself but I will say simply, client system could do exactly what it does now, predict the movement of the mobs.  What you have to realize is that the mobs are scripted not true AI, everything they do can be predicted.<P>Now what I would have love to see done, and something which I know would be very difficult is the mixing of cycles (explanation will follow). This would solve so many EQ problems it would not even be funny, hacking would become for all intents and purposes impossible, cycles would become abundent, and client power could be made proper use of instead of everything being client side.<P>Mixed Cycles is the pulling of cycles from various machines, (its based upon a nueral network technique) they are combined in to appear for all intents and purposes random. for example, the EQ server observes a flaw(read bug) this mob keeps running into this wall, instead of trying to fix it manually let the clients with the massive processers like me run a few thousand permentations for a trial and error solution. Now this isn't done on any one persons computer system, singular permentations would be run in small chuncks on many different systems. Now if you had a hundred of these happening at once on everyones system, flowing with the normal data, encryption becomes irrelevent. I know I am probably confusing some people but damnit my teachers understand me!<P>Please excuse the spelling, yes I know I spell like a 10 year old, but in everyother way(read most ways) I am at least at the level of a 12 year old.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Even the simplest AI routine would solve these kinds of problems.<P>If the mob cannot move forward after 3 seconds or so, it does a random rotate 45-180 and runs the that way, making a line directly for the nearest mob for help.<P>Pretty trivial to code. If I and 3 others can make a robot navagate around a building without getting stuck, surly VI and their team of programmers can keep mobs from getting stuck. <P>Keven 60 Shammy - Luclin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057408-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057408.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057408-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057408&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057408&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
