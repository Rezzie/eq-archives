&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This editorial taken from eq.castersrealm.com written by Heihachi.  A must read for all.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>There is a serious flaw in the game mechanics of EverQuest. As Verant attempts to scale up higher level encounters to give its best players a challenge, this flaw creates a giant divide in the desirability of classes and of people. This flaw throws the balance of the entire game to one side, forcing the entire tuning of areas and monsters, both big and small, around the new equilibrium.<P>The flaw, simply stated, is this.<P>Melee effectiveness increases with new equipment. Caster effectiveness does not.<P>Chew on this for a bit. You will slowly come to realize that the implications of this are staggering.<P>Under the current model of item acquisition in EverQuest, all casters can do is increase their mana pool. The mana pool is a reservoir. It has no bearing on often you can deal damage, or how quickly you do it. Melee, meanwhile, are increasing their damage every day by real and significant percentages simply by obtaining better weapons.<P>An example? Back in the first days when Fear opened, ykesha's were the hottest swords around. These were 8/28 ratio weapons.<P>Now take a look at the situation 1.5 years later. Almost every melee has something equivalent to a jade mace, a 9/18 ratio weapon.<P>Essentially, every melee class has been able to increase their rate of damage output by nearly 100%.<P>Now take a look at the caster situation. <P>1.5 years ago, a caster had 200 int.<P>Today, a caster has 200 int, and some extra mana items, and perhaps some extra ac or resist items on since the soft cap on wis/int prevents any benefit from going past the limit. Their mana pool grows bigger and they acquire slightly more efficient spells as they level up, but keep in mind melee classes also receive their bonuses to damage and defense, as well as<BR>new disciplines, when they level as well.<P>When all is said and done, casters are essentially at the same place, casting the same spells, that they were 1.5 years ago.<P>So here you are, with melee class effectiveness having been nearly doubled, while a caster is still casting the same spells and doing the same damage that he always has. And you wonder why casters can't get a group? Furthermore, all any melee has to do to improve his damage or efficiency even more is to get new weapons. What are you, as a caster, going to do? Get that +15 int eyepatch you've been lusting after? Oh wait, you're already at the soft cap. And besides that, all it could possibly do would be increase your mana reserves...which has absolutely nothing to do with how fast or how often you can do damage.<P>The downward spiral continues from here. As melee increase in effectiveness, the best groups, naturally, are formed from melee classes. The difficulty of most situations comes to be balanced around these classes, shutting out casters from groups because their efficiency is terrible relative to melee classes and has no chance of ever increasing. Furthermore, as Verant tries to create more challenging encounters, the only possible means of doing so is to provide melee classes with better weapons and armor and balance encounters around these factors, since these are the only factors which are capable of scaling under the current system. Thus, classes which support the melee classes such as the enchanter, cleric, and shaman rise to prominence.<P>Of course, by now, you're asking the obvious question. Where is the magical wristband that increases the damage output of all your fire spells by 20%? Where is the tome which reduces the wizard's casting time by 15%? Where is the staff that reduces the mana cost of your spell by 30%? <P>I don't have that answer for you. How such a fundamental omission could have been made in this game is beyond me. I have constantly suggested the addition of more innovative and creative caster items that were essentially the caster equivalent of a melee's haste item or new weapon. And truthfully, these items really wouldn't be innovative at all...they would have been the natural result of any logical thinking on a designer's part.<P>If EverQuest is to survive, casters must be able to significantly increase their damage output, speed, and effectiveness at the same rate as melee classes. The fundamental gap between melee and casting classes, where casters are left unable to progress while melee classes are rewarded constantly with newer and better ratio weapons, will destroy the game. Under the current system, each new expansion will bring melee classes new and better items, while caster classes stagnate with their virtually useless wis/int items.<P>If you play at the high level game, you will be realizing that we have already travelled down this path to some extent. Your casters are complaining how useless they are in experience groups as well as uber mob fights. Your guild is shifting its emphasis to require more healers and more warriors and rogues. Maybe you been observing these things in action, and agreed with them, but didn't really understand the underlying cause.<P>Now you do. Melee classes and the healing and buffing classes which support them will grow to become more dominant. Kunark made melee classes 100% more effective in dealing damage. With SoV we may see that number grow to 150%.  Your casters, meanwhile, have improved by virtually nothing. Each expansion will widen the gulf between melee and caster classes until caster classes are rendered completely irrelevant. That is, unless the ability for casters to improve themselves constantly through the acquisition of unique dropped spells or items is addressed.<P>The way to fix this is clear. Yes, it will require a major overhaul of the way caster incentives and progressions are designed in EverQuest. But it is absolutely critical to the survivability of this game. Can Verant save EverQuest in time?<BR>----------------------------------------------<P>Someone at VI needs to look into this, I have quit my 55 mage 3 weeks ago and already leveled a cleric upto 23 as you can see this post speaks the truth.<P>Eendyar Soulseeker<BR>55'th mage[retired]<BR>23'rd cleric[active]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hm, while he makes some good points, I think it his overly dramatic conclusion spoils the essay. "But it is absolutely critical to the survivability of this game. Can Verant save EverQuest in time?" Wow! They better hurry!<P>His best point is that caster gear doesn't do much more than improve their mana pool. His worst point is he ignores the fact that in the original game, casters were way overpowered compared to melee's. All the gear from Kunark and Velious changed that. But his solution leads more overpowered twinks as well as possible balance issues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>At this point, they could not add this gear in. It would be neat sure, but cmon, they are spending all their time trying to make the game harder for the 3 biggies, and not more fun for the rest of us. It has become SO blatent lately that Verant is catering to the ubers, it is just sad. So this nice quest is discovered for a very nice druid ranger item, everything is doable by a medium sized guild. I got pretty excited because even though the quest was long, it was doable by my guild. We are always looking for things to quest for, so I got all ready to get us started, only to find out the last peice comes out of the plane of mischief! A place only 3 guilds in the game have been to. Thanks... *sigh*<P>My point is, they could not do this because it would overpower the uber's, so we are all punished for their success. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The basic logic behind this is, in my opinion, pretty sound. In Paper and Pencil games this same type of tinkering was done, D&D became AD&D became 2nd edition became 3rd edition which is really a totally different game, for much the same reason except they were trying to keep fighters effective. I think some options open to VI are.<P>1. Pure caster only items that reduce a MoBs resistance. These could be level based. They have already done this once before when the new post 50 buff spells will not work on low level PCs.<P>2. Allow spell specialization to REALLY effect the ability of a MoB to resist a spell. Also if a caster is a master in a class of spells let the use of that class cost less mana.<P>3. Allow one spell to effect another. In essence a caster only buff that increases the effectiveness of a certain class of spell. For example add a enchanter spell that increases a Wizards spell casting effectiveness by 15%. This keeps alive the Vision of class interdependability and makes a Wizard more effective at the same time.<P>I would like to see if a Blue Name posts here with a response to the original poster, other than "It is working as intended".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is very true. Casters unfortunately have no place in my groups except where they lend important skills to augment melee. If my cleric never grouped with any other caster except enchanter and druid again I would not miss the rest of the classes one bit.<P>Magician is kind of a hybrid melee/caster because of pet and is the only other caster I would be reasonably happy to have in a group. Nec pets aren't good enough to overcome the liability of pet problems and having a vulnerable caster around. Wizards are only good in ubermob situations where you need to nuke fast at the end to prevent CH or gate. Shamans I could do without completely.<P>For that matter paladins are also screwed in this situation and SKs to a lesser degree because 2 weapons = two chances to increase effectiveness. Bards get screwed too because their song effects don't scale like melee weapons and they lose out on double attack. <P>Frankly, for 99% of the game you can cut things down to warrior cleric rogue druid enchanter monk and not miss a beat. A group of those six classes played halfway decently will outclass any other combination you can put together.<P>And meditation post 50 even with regular clarity or the 32 bard song is simply unacceptably slow.<P>On top of all this is the proliferation of highly resistant mobs that make even a full mana caster useless.<P>It's sad when I have to break the news to people I like that the post 50 game is owned lock stock and barrel by melee and the classes dedicated to support them.<P>It's well past time for items that effect spellcasting to come into the game, as well as mana regen items that stack with clarity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the main idea of the post that its hard to gather more power when the cap for int/wis is 200.  Mana pool still increases with each level regardless of int/wis.  Also you forget that other stats have some importance such as str, dex, agi, AC, and resistances.(Although pure mana is more important.)<BR>Casters draw power from spells, thus we call them casters.  Melee players draw power from the gear they own, thus the gear they have is more important.  Its easy.  A naked caster still can cast spells, a naked melee (besides a monk) is pretty much useless. So you can see gear is more important to a melee player.<BR>Another important point is that all melees do not have a jade mace or better.  Why is it that they sell for 18 to 22k?  If everyone had them wouldnt the price be much lower?  I realize this was used to try to make a point but it just isnt true.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cthon explain to me why casters are overpowered?<P>Is it because they can bind? is that it?<P>Utility spells aside it is much more effective to have a variety of melee's in a group rather than a variety of casters. Granted they should have a healer such as a cleric but they need only ONE cleric in that case. Adding another cleric does NOT increase the groups effectiveness. It rather decreses it because a 2nd cleric is like a weak spellcaster in terms of damage<P>Back to the point melee items have gotten INSANELY powerfull post rok. The mobs have been designed to fight warriors. Hence since warriors got increased ac the mobs damages were upped therefore they beat the @#$#$ out of the casters even more quickly<P>Not to mention the insane AC items that melee's get. Do you know how hard it is in pvp to take down a pure melee at high levels? I know level 60 wizards who wouldn't attack a level 60 warrior unless they were at 1/4 life because the warrior would beat the snot out of them<P>Now explain to me just why casters are overpowered.<P>Oberan Lifebringer<BR>54th Vicar of Innoruuk<BR>Gankos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Necro's and mages have pets, chanters have c2, shamans/druids have pets(kinda)/buffs/utilities/heals.  I can see your problem, but I can't agree with your complaints.<P>To be quite honest..when most groups form they grab a healer, couple tanks, and get what they can grab from there.

</FONT><HR>If Kunark weakened casters Velious destroyed them.  It was easy to justify the lag created by a raid member contributing around 10% of overall damage to a high end encounter with the 32K HP cap.  But now we have Velious and even a level 60 wizard using the new (on test) XXXbane spells with a mana pool of 3000 would contribute at most 2% of the total damage to some of these 500K hp encounters if he was allowed to cast till he was OOM.  In Kunark under that same situation that same wizard just accounted for close to 1/3 of the total health of the mob.  This being said how do you justify bringing him to Velious and possibly indirectly helping cause the link death of the warriors rogues and monks that contribute for 90+% of the damage?  Conversly, how do you tell your friend/guildmate that whatever lag he creates is not worth having him around?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nice train of thought here.  In Verants infinite wisdom, they decide to make the high level game more challenging...make mobs with more hp's and higher magic resistance.<P>Wisdom Casters and Melee's can deal with these dificulties through melee damage/healing.  Int casters are left with resisted spells and no mana.  Doesn't sound too appealing to me.  The idea of a 60th lvl Wizzy or Magician dealing 2% of damage to a mob, on a full bar of mana is quite sickening actually.  Why even bother?<P>The way the pre 50 system workes looks pretty decent to me.  When group members see the "&lt;wizard&gt; begins to cast a spell" message, there is always a little sigh of relief, knowing the the battle will end a good bit sooner.  If that same wizzard pushes too hard, he gets beat down fast.  The control of power was a key element for Int casters.<P>Post 50....chain nuking is the only option?  This doesn't make sense at all.  Even considering that while chaincasting, the melee will still do more damage all said and done.<P>I'd love to see an official response to this thread.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While the complete heal issue may imbalance the wisdom/melee vs Int casters, it is not an imbalance in the game...it is a requirment in the endgame.<P>I truely wish Verant would stop nerfing once and for all and start enhancing the player characters.<P>If accross the board player enhancements were done, alot of the class vs class bickering would cease.  I hope this isn't just wishfull thinking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the original post is dead on target.  Melee effectiveness has increased by *at least* 50% in the past year and a half --  and not just at the over 50 levels -- but across *all* levels.  Caster equipment simply does not significantly increase the effectiveness of casters while melee equipment does.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here is a thought i come up with while reading these posts<P>melee gets haste item, caster gets item that reduces cast/recast time<P>melee gets item that does a better dmg ratio, caster gets item that increses dmg <P>example casters awesome gloves of coolness: -5% cast/recast time, +5% dmg<P>I do agree the fact that the system differenctiating the melee/caster is flawed and not well thought of at all<P>also as for weapons or what ever you call what caster hold, i would like to see a caster channeling his powers throught his staff, the effect could be as like i described above<P>other variables i can think of are things like<BR>increased effectiveness(unlike incresed max damage, incresed abilitie to score max dmg)<P>variating the mana usage(decrese mana usage for reduced other effects, or incresed mana useage for incresed other effects<P>example of a weapon: narly stick found under a tree: -10% recast +10%max damage +10% +30%effectivness<P>or: rotten log fill of termites: -10%mana -10%recast  -10%dmg +10 effectiveness<P>hopefully now you see what i am getting at, maybe you could CONSTRUCTIVLY help me build this idea up<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064620-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064620-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064620-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064620-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064620&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064620&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
