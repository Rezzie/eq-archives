</FONT><HR>Well I have to say that I broke down and created a character on Rallos last night.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I created a DE Enchanter.  I was killed right off the bat...didn't even have anything except a few gold and the robe on my back.  He took my robe!  I hate the look of DE females nakid!  I was killed three more times that night.  I just can't understand the characters that are around lvl 5 or so that just hang out to PK.  I don't get it.  I like the idea of being able to PK, but when there is justification or roleplay.<P>Also tho, I met some very nice people.  I met a bard that was very nice.  She ended up giving me some plat (run..run..run..to the bank  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  )  and some help.  Several others helped with buffs and stuff.  I was buffing with my low level Enchanter buffs....was worried that I was helping my killer, but you just have to reach out, you will get no where if you do take chances.  I made some friends last night....and have some on my list for later   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P><BR>Seems to be a mixed bag on this server  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> made a char on rz..leveled to 5, died about 20 times. Most deaths came from arrows and twinked newbies w/ high level bows. Even tried to group with 2 other 'newbies'..they also killed me. I think your server has some nice people on it...to many are rl frustrated children taking out their hatred with an online persona.<P>  Takes to long to get to level 10 or so on your server..so I went to a carebear server and made my druid.

</FONT><HR>Once you get out of the newbie area, things change.  Seems like most kinslayers/twinks stay between level 5-10 and never go past it.<P>Best bet is to find someone who will assist you up untill level 10, then it gets a lot better.  You no longer have to hunt the newbie areas at all and by then you have made a few friends.<P>I started on Tallon Zek, made a druid, went to 19, got bored.  Tried Rallos.  My mage is now 24 and I've entered into a great RP guild, Teir'Dal Templar.  For the most part, I see Rallos as the best RP server yet.  I've played a little on Cazic, Lucilin, and some otherserver, cant remember, and they just dont seem to RP as much.<P>I enjoy the fear that comes on Rallos as well, plus the +/- 4 level limit makes it a lot more 'fair' play.  +/- 8 on Tallon was way too unbalanced.<P>But again, I must admit that starting is a big pain, too many jerks in the game that kinslay and PK out of pure spite.  Personally, I dont see the fun of just wackin newbies all day long.  We'd have a much better server if the kinslaying was gone, but hey, it also adds a little more.<P>Bah, play a little longer, get to know some peeps, group, figh, practice with each other, I love it.<P>Thats my 2 cp....<P>Zebel Canevil<BR>24th Magician of the Teir'Dal Templar<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>when i started my gnome a week ago, there was a really mean group of three pk's killing newbies and they had last names!  These people got to level 20 or above, and then deleveled to 5 just to kill low levels!  They kept all of their level 20 characteristics (strength especially) and would hit me twice in one attack for 30 and 35 points!  I didn't know they deleveled and thought perhaps they cheated so i petitioned to a GM, the GM said they apparently deleveled.  I asked if there was anything illegal about that and they said not at all.  I asked if there's anything they lose other than level and the GM said nope.. I said that wasn't fair, the GM just said find a group of people and get him back. ~ &gt;:&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes evil!!!! That was my argument a while back. If they lose the level they should lose everything that came with it right? How can they keep the skills etc.? Maybe for the carebear servers this is a good thing, but to keep it on the pvp servers is screwing things up. More and more people are deleveling now that word's out. Just try to roam gfay between lvls 1 and 9! The delevelers are very hard if not impossible to kill without a whole mess of people ganging up on them. Well, until this exploit is resolved I'm sticking to carebear...and it is an exploit no matter what GM's say :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>North Qeynos is one of the greatest places to goon PK newbies in the game. I have many characters that originated in North Qeynos and am very proud that they gained "character" in the goon fields of NQ. There is nothing better than to kill a fire beetle and turn to see some level 5 goon human monk charge you and roundhouse you for no reason at all other than he is a goon and this is North Qeynos. It's fantastic. Human goons punching and kicking each other for no reason 20 feet in front of the gate. What a place!!! <P>I have a level 5 paladin with a Ghoulbane, Darkwood bow and some 75 hitpoint rings. I love gooning people for 26 point bow shots and then one hand slashing them for 20. Nothing better than hacking a newbie goon and then having him bolt for the gate only to be dropped inches short by a 26 point arrow shot in his back. Gets me all fired up. <P>Live or die, North Qeynos is a wondeful place. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i think pvp is a fair system. i just think that it makes the game alot less fun if you are going around whacking people now if you had a roleplaying reason that would be cool.like you hate all trolls and kill em on sight. or you are a murdering theif, just whatever the reason play it out don't go following around a 1st cuz you can then your just a pain in the ass taking away from the flavor o fhte game, for instance i had an ogre and was mindig my own and this guy with a pet starting whooping my ass, cool maybe he is against ogres of all breed, nope maybe he wanted my battle axe, nope he was just killing me, so basically his character is insane he was roleplaying his character to be insane just killing people for no reason, it's cool because i knew the rules before i joined the server. i though it was really funny when this really large ogre came to the rescue the guy with the pet had four friends and the other ogre killed em all it was hillarious.  then he explained to me about how some people don't play to roleplay or for  character advancement or quest. some people just getr on to kill other people which if fine by me, but me personaly i think it is pretty freakin stupid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Killing newbies is so much fun. Like AztroCreep said, the crunching and moaning sound that a newbie makes when smacked with a big sword is one of the great thrills of the game. <P>To see a level 1 character fall sideways like the gimp animation they do, still alive, but unable to get up or move and then taunt them with emotes is so much fun. <P>The best is when you knock them unconscious and tell them to get up and run and they get up and start walkiing to the gate. When they are about 5 feet from the gate, place an arrow into their back and watch them buckle!

I have my good character, and I have my bad character.<P>But when people do something like newbie zone pk with twinked out items and then tell you to go to a carebear...I can't help but think, don't you have anything better to do?<P>I can understand how high levels get frustrating and often boring, so start another character and explore the other classes.  Make a new character that's the complete opposite.  Maybe even PK when it's worth PKing (you know, when people have valuables on).<P>Sigh.

</FONT><HR>Generalization is a form of ignorant bliss it appears. <P>The world we live in is about conflict and competition. Action and reaction. If someone does something you don't agree with, why not use what semblance of a mind you may have been given and develop counteractions to address this issue instead of submitting the obligatory cries of one unjustly wronged. <P>Translation: A good many people, including myself, that find amusement in abusing newbies are not children, not pawns of their parents pocketbook and not delevelers. Apparently you last two respondents have a hard time reading common english text. This thread is not about deleveled newbie killers, but about newbie killers in general. Sure, deleveling is troublesome and could be considered immoral. Refrain from lumping all newbie killers together for at least a post to potentially shed a light of more than ignorance on yourselves. <P>Newbie killing is what this served is founded on. Every great character and mighty one has more than likely been at least partially molded by countless beatings at the hand of some aggressive newbie in their formative years. Cliche as it may be, if you have a problem with this, leave this server. This server is for the strong, not the lilly livered, spineless souls that can't handle adversity. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Simple obviously you played on another server and no where to hunt or remember where you hunted as a newbie well go there. Most newbie killers NOT ALL but most hang out by the entrance to that zone IE North Qeynos Gates. Simple when you go to hunt go out from the gates and get away from the gates and usually not alwyas but usually they don't mess with and the stupidest thing you can do is SAY I AM A NEWBIE CAN YOU HELP ME PLEASE....other than that I agree with newbie killers shut up and quit whininng <P>SANMECHE NIGHT<P>its NIGHTY NIGHT TIME</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum24&number=24&thisthread=000081&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum24&number=24&thisthread=000081&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
