</FONT><HR><P>Stagnation = death of EQ.<P>EQ will NEVER be done, unless Sony has completely pulled the plug on it before the user base completely winds down.  <P>When they make the decision to stop fixing things, the end is near.  If the game is to be vibrant and have meaning to players, constant tinkering is a given.  <P>So, here's the deal.  Abashi is burned out on EQ customers and vice versa.  I thought that was why Absor was hired.  He appears to think, perhaps unconciously, that his job frustrations will be "over" once they "fix" EQ and define a endpoint.  <P>That won't happen, and from my prespective, it's a mistake.  <P>The improvements you made, and about which you express remarkable and surprising bitterness, were in fact generated from rants on this forum.  The game is better for having implemented them. <P>Don't stop there, and keep listening to your customers - in this forum.  If you do, the game will continue to get better.  You can separate the wheat from the chaff - it's why you get the big bucks.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I do believe your game design vision articulated in this thread is flawed, and if implemented, will diminish what I feel is a great game that still have some design flaws.<P>Fundamentally, it is a great game because it is dynamic, and to keep pace with that and evolving gameplay needs, you must prepare yourself for endless tinkering - or it will stagnant, spiral into some weird gameplay quirk and simply peter out before it should.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I really hate to see Verant "shut down" class issues that are obvious and have always been present.  Rangers, for instance, are known to be the weakest class in EQ.  Despite claims by Verant to the contrary, rangers are just not a viable tank class at higher levels.  The reputation they have as a class is quite negative, and people are simply shying away from the class.  The ranger "jokes" that I see on a weekly basis should be a clue that something is wrong.  <P>I see a general migration of people to classes that are considered more vital to groups and raids and that are actually playable.  Either that, or people pick a class that solos really well like a mage, necro, or druid.   The rest of the classes are pretty much not played because they really do "SUCK".  People aren't dumb.  Take a look at the breakdown of what classes people are playing on the new server Tholuxe Paells and see how they have wised up to the imbalances that are present.  If your wondering why there are so few rangers and paladins on the server, well now you know that people are not so dumb.<P>Knat<BR>(owner of multiple faces and names) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I like most about EQ is that I am in heir world. They have a great imaginiation at verant, and I have spent nearly 2 years enjoying ALL of the life and death experiences I have endured.<P>If something "sucks" please take it with a charater weakness. If somthing "sucks" sooo bad that you become irate, start a different class. If this doesn't make you happy quit playing EQ.<P>The worst part about this game social life is the constant complaints. as if 1/3 of the population is just never happy, and always poking the horse to piss it off too. Life doesn't have to be that complex. Happy = do it. Unhappy = stop. There really is no need to be in complete control of every facet of the game, let go, free your mind, the rest will follow.<P>I am going to make a "EQ is the best" webpage, so all of the deveolpers, and workers, and supporters of the product can have a little solice when they feel down from the "this sucks" mentality that is sure to beat them down some. They can just click the link, and be reminded, that there are many of us that applaud their hard work and creativity.. and that even though they have FORCED us to live double lives, leaving some relationships in shambles, etc (j/k), we will always appreciate the considerations they do give us.<P>Thank You<P>Jas<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok... the original topic here was about some file in the EQ directory right?  So whats the problem?  Your pissed because verant said they might put fake info in a file on the computer?  LOL.. your pathetic... Verant wants you to play the game without cheating!  They want you to find and learn about these spells INSIDE the game.  I think its a great idea.  They didn't "release" the false information like some of you claim, they just said that they might put false information in places that they never intended players to look. If you were playing the game as intended and not trying to dig up info on unreleased products then this thread wouldn't even be here.  In the year or so I have been playing EQ I have never felt the need to pick apart the files in the EQ directories... and I doubt I ever will.  I prefer to find out about these things in the game, and if for some reason I need more clarification (AFTER release) I will read what others have to say about it on the many EQ boards out there.<P>somehow this post turned to many other topics too... and I realize everyone has issues with things in the game, however I really dont think Shamans are quite that bad off... and I am hurt that you didn't put aq slam in for wizards! :P  I'm actually quite happy with my wizard... I'm sure there are some things that I could list that I would like to see improved, but really I think i would prefer to see hybrids improved more.  I have a low lvl ranger, and I liked playing a ranger for a while... till I made a cleric and saw how much faster the cleric leveled!!!  Ok... I can see one class taking longer to lvl than another... what I dont see is any reward for doing so.  my ranger is weaker than a warrior, and and only gets lower lvl druid spells till way late in the game.  spell lvls are hugely spaced... and I cant think of a single ability rangers have that others dont!  Ok.. maybe the bow crits are ranger only... not sure, but I dont see that as a class defining ability!  Paladins from early on get LoH, SKs get HT... these aren't super awesome abilities, but it is the one thing they can do that other classes cant!  Now... I really think that if a ranger/SK/paladin are going to have to work that much harder to gain lvls... then they should each get some ability that will make it worth it!  The abilities they each have right now dont really make up for it in my eyes... and rangers seem to get the worst of it.  The increase in dodge and parry (think it was those 2) for rangers was a nice start... but I think they deserve more!<P>Anyway.. that my 2cps on it...<P>Thank you Absor and Abashi for taking the time to respond to some of these threads.. I do not envy you your jobs (the dart boards of the EQ players)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Wrong. I don't own the design of that file, I don't even own the right to produce that file, but I darn sure own that local copy.<P>No, you don't. You license it from Verant under the terms of the shrinkwrap license agreement that came in the EQ box, and the EULA you agree to every time you use the software.<P>You own the disk it's on, but not the file, not the contents, nothing. It's called Intellectual Property.<P>&gt;&gt;Or should I start charging Verant rent for their share of my hard drive?<P>You can always delete the files if you feel they're not worth the space they're taking on your hard drive. But then, you wouldn't be able to play EQ.

That's what it is, what it's for, why they put it on your drive.<P>Here's another example: at work, we have a $1,200.00 software package that inventories the machines on our network.  It generates .dbf files (dBase format) to save the data.  It integrates with Crystal Reports to present the data.<P>I was going to import part of one of the databases into Access to create some labels.  Guess what?  You can't.  You don't have permission.<P>Did I kick and scream and let these people know that for $1,200.00 they better not infringe on my right to my data?  No.  I accepted that this was not how they ever intended the program to work, and I will have to do a little data entry.<P>I probably could have cracked the data somehow, but I will have to be content with generating a report of the data and entering it into another program.<P>So, accept that you're supposed to read the data in the .dat file using Everquest, the program, and that you are supposed to find out the information in the file by obtaining the spells, casting them, and observing their effects.  And yes, every licensed subscriber of EQ has EVERY RIGHT to use this method to read that file.  =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=030379&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=030379&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
