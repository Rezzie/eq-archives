</FONT><HR>HouseoftheRisingSun,<P>It's been awhile since I dueled on a blue server.  But, since the last time that my melee dueled,<BR>1) The duel ends when either character dies or zones.<BR>2) If you die in a duel, you go straight to your bind point.<BR>3) You can still be in dual mode (blue server) and gain exp from fighting NPCs.  This also meant that if you forgot about being in dual mode, that other person can hurt you and cause you to lose exp if killed by an NPC.<P><BR>Raventoth,<P>Before they added the caster patch for dueling.  I saw many cases where casters began dueling in order to lessen their med downtime, where 5 minutes OOM could readily equate to 2 min of loading.  Luckily Verant saw this and put an end to it.  Now after the dueling patch, casters lose all of their mana.<P>Now if you want to make a comparison of how out of hand it could get.  Imagine if you could get an exp rez back without any set time limit, except normal corpse decay?  Well, back in the days, this became so extensive to the point that many mid-high level zones (pre-50) became littered with bodies, to the point that it affected server performance.<P><BR>One thing that I will point out is that, I am NOT against an NPC binding melees in a city zone.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>lebritto:<P>Sorry, but it simply isn't part of the package. You're a fighter, so fight and leave the tricks to the people who pay for having those tricks.  Having an NPC caster around to do it for you is the best solution for all involved.<P>Unbalancing?  In a way, it is.  As a warrior or monk, for example, you fight, loot, save the money, and buy the best armor, weapons, jewelry, and so forth.  Level after level. As a caster I also need to buy the best armor (or robes), weapons, jewelry, and so forth.  I also need to buy my spells.  I just bought the level 14 spells for one of my secondary characters.  Cost me 50 platinum.  Level 14.  So much for the +wis earrings I wanted.<P>Allowing a non twink to earn some money by doing binds -is- a balance thing.  I still say that it should be offset by having NPC binders for when people won't do it, at about double the going rate.<P>You still feel yourself bound to the area, an area where you'll probably stay for several levels, when you pay the NPC to do it.  You also won't get the united opposition of all those who play non twink casters and have relied, since beta, on the money they can get for their spells by saving up the small amount you have to part with when you pay them to bind you.  This should make both sides happy.<P>...Except for the extremists who are never happy unless it's exactly the best thing for their class and their class alone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do not want melee's to self bind. Therefore the title of this thread is untrue. I also play primarily melee class characters.<P>The primary reason Verant gives for this whole thing is class interdependance and the existance of gathering places. Do melee classes solo well? Not really. Odds are melee's group regularly with classes that can bind. Contact one of these people when you need one and can't find one. Don't just sit in an empty city shouting for a bind. If there is noone online that you know to help you, go to a nearby zone that is more popular and plead your case. These empty cities often have neighboring zones that have people in them who can help you. If a caster is very rude to you (and you have not been rude to him/her) about your situation, simply do not group with them later or put them on ignore. The casting classes need us for other things and so should be more sensative in our time of need.<P>The request for NPC binders removes the class interdependence from the whole thing and just seems to impersonal to me. I like the incentive for interaction. If you are asking for these, why not ask for Teleport Vendors at all of the rings? (yes, this actually has been suggested) After all, aren't those TP's hard to find when you really need one? Or how about a SoW vendor? We all know what a pain going without is for all of us who can't cast it right? How about a Skin Like Nature vendor as well? Though would make things much easier for soloing in the lower levels.<P>Classes are going to need other classes to do certain things and I like that. It may be inconvenient at times but I think it is worth it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quandary<P>Some good points you posted.  I can agree with a casting NPC that does a bind.  Cost is a different issue tho.  But anyways,  I can see cost of spells and all.  But as a SK I have spell cost as well.  Not as high as yours tho.  I also have weapon and armor to buy as well. Like you have robes and stuff to buy.  But I dont see melee classes with some special ability to make money off of from there young days until they become higher in lvl.  I was an untwinked SK (my main) and I and others like me never had some special ability to make money that we could use to buy spells (for hybrids) or equipment.  I just got some *insert item here* for my lower lvl warrior.  There goes that much needed weapon I wanted.  The argument goes both ways. I still dont see it.  And Jaxxx get a life, if you have a problem with magical armors take it up with Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It makes no sense for melees to be able to cast a bind spell, because they are not casters?<BR>True, but the bind spell itself MAKES NO SENSE.<P>Gate - character teleports to a fixed location -  Makes sense, we can imagine it in any fantasy world with magic in the first place.<BR>Bind - as spell that changes the one location a character can teleport to -  Makes sense, given teleportation in the first place.<BR>Bind - as spell that sets your respawn location - Makes NO sense. Characters in fantasy literature do not have a 'respawn point'<P>The second use of bind affinity - to set respawn location - is entirely a game mechanic.  You can imagine a character from a fantasy story seeking healing, seeking a teleport,  seeking buffs. But you cannot picture a fantasy character seeking someone to change their respawn point. So while it makes no sense for a melee to 'cast bind', it makes no more sense for a wizard to 'cast bind on the warrior'. <P>/bind really ought to be a command for all characters, and the spell restricted to its first use. Or your bind point could be set automatically to the last location you /camped at (preferably you could still /quit to get out - with a little more risk - without rebinding) Or you could 'rent a room' from an innkeeper - setting your bind location to that inn. (for that matter, innkeepers would be the ideal NPCs to add the 'buy a bind' utility to. This would also continue to limit the ability of KOS PCs to bind in an area, or in those with no Inns - Kunark Outposts?) <P>As far as the 'interdependancy' and 'source of income' arguments: <BR>Its completely obvious to everyone except VI (well, almost everyone, a few others are being intentionally dense about it) that there is no INTER-dependancy outside of grouping situations going on. There is a one way dependancy of melees and hybrids on the casters in non-combat situations. Grouping there is interdependance, although the people with all the non-combat convinience abilities also happen to be the better soloes, go figure that one out.<P>As for the income angle, I'm not sure whether I'm an exceptionally good caster player, or an exceptionally bad melee player, but when I start a non-twinked character, the int caster ones are easilly able to afford their spells and acceptable equipment for their level, the melees have a much harder time affording 'acceptable' equipment. Clerics and Shaman really have it the worst at the start, needing to afford real armour as well as spells, although it doesn't take long to get to where the next weapon upgrade will cost a melee far more than the whole next circle or two of spells. Druids in between in the beginning, but eventually they get teleports with the potential for insane income (or enormous waste of time if they're not mercenary enough about charging) not to mention potential SoW income. Noone whos played the higher level game will begrudge a cleric a few plat for a bind, knowing how much they can lose on symbols, but why my fighter should line the pockets of a robed character, who in my experience can earn enough to keep himself in spells and decent equipment far more easilly than the fighter is beyond me.<P>As for the 'more downtime spent shouting and auctioning to buy a bind might squeeze another month out of our customers' argument:<BR>Can't refute that one. In fact, as far as I can tell, this is the only valid reason for VI to want to maintain the caster monopoly on the game mechanic of binding. I just wish it weren't enough reason for them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>'Binding' is a game mechanic, nothing more.  <P>There is no game rationale for casters being able to bind and melees not being able to.<P>From what I have seen previously from Gordon, and seen implemented in the way of no-longer Bindable dungeons, Verant never really intended for a caster to be able to Bind himself in a 'good camp' and endlessly farm Lore items (by transporting them off to mules as they drop and gating back for next pop).  Granted this is easier to do with a natural porter, such as a Druid or Wizard, but it certainly isn't a great hardship for any Gate / Bind caster to farm (for instance) Eye-Sown Bags as fast as they drop using this tactic.<P>Ultimately this is a somewhat more complex than simply allowing the melee classes to Bind themselves in certain locations.  The issue of dungeon binding and other non-city / outpost bind points also needs to be looked into.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Meele binding...<P>Well, the reason they (Brad and Company) don't want to make the meele bindable anywhere is to keep a death penalty sting.  The part about dueling and bad bind spots can both be easily coded against (example make it that when you come back your at 1/4 health and mana from a duel, full if its from an NPC).  Dueling and doing things with the brains of a turnip (hey like caster's never do things like that), are not valid reason.  Most people do not realize that anyone could have bind cast on them anywhere in beta and be bound by anywhere.  The complaints of being bound in a bad spot by some idiots of lower morals, led to the rules of town binding only.  But, there was a goof, and those that could cast bind could do it anywhere.  <P>REMBER!!! Being able to bind anywhere is actually a bug there letting the casters keep as a benifit.  If not you would be doing the naked corpse mouse-look run with fingers crossed that you make it dance of zoning.  <P>Exploiting your ability to keep people from being bound, or chargin exoberant prices could lead to your own diminish.  <P>Plus, meele binding also cuts down on a lot of what Everquest was designed for, grouping.  The longer it takes for a person to get somewhere, get bound, and get to the hunting grounds, and if a bad incident happens (oh yeah most meeles don't run for the zone when the poop hits the fan, so we're back doing the corpse dance again) it penilizes the whole group, making it a cleric/group only dungeon, or a soloing-small group dungeon.<P>I'm here to group and kill, not run around beging for someone to bind me as I wait for someone to cast it.  And no, I don't think paying for it is acceptable.  I don't demand payment for keeping the casters alive while were fighting and I don't expect them to charge me for a game function that should have been in.<P>Want a simple solution?  Put a vendor in ever zone meele can bind at that charges 2pp per bind.  Casters can still do it for 1pp or 1.9pp and make some cash and be cheaper than the vendor.<P>Want death to hurt but not as much as now and get us to use the underutilized zones?  Add a few more zones to be bindable at (everfrost, qeynoshill, butcherblock, temple of ro, Anywhere the boat touches as it really sucks to die in OOT and have to wait on the dang boat to come in, get you and get to the zone).  Want a zone to be used more?  Pathing, binding, selling, and banking.  <P>Okay rant over.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Buchenko-SV:<P>To expend your fantasy/reality sense argument, then reincarnation makes no sense.  A lot less sense then binding to a plce does since the purpose of the bind is that you'll reincarnate at that point.  <P>What fantasy genre have you ever read or watched when the dead come back to life minus only some experience and the items that weren't in the back?  Without divine intervention, that is.  Even in D&D, when you died you were dead.  Period.  Final death, unless you played with a very high level clceric that could bring you back.  <P>So to eliminate that which make no sense by your argument, we need to also implement final death.  Thus binding becomes moot.<P>This is, however, the way we play the game.  We bind, and we reincarnate.  <P>NPC binders can (or should be able to) do the job.  Anything more then that just comes down to what has long been the bane of RPGs:  People that insist on playing fighter classes, then piss and moan about the casting classes.  Casters have had their spells SO watered down over the years to come into balance with the fighters, that tricks like bind and levetate are the only reasons left to play them.<P>Take the NPC binders and let it be.  Casters have already lost enough to make fighters feel better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a FAR better suggestion then giving melees self bind (or any form thereof).  Learn to die less.  Not only will you not have to worry about running from your bind point but you'll level faster.<P>My 51 monk is bound in the EXACT same spot he was when the character was first created (the spot the game assigns you in FoB).  I very rarely die so it's not an issue.  I know a lot of you are thinking sure...he's a monk...he can FD and save his butt easy.  Well I have a 41 warrior that almost never dies either.<P>Learning to avoid death is the most important lesson you can learn in this game (for normal grouping situations).  If you are dying frequently, you are doing something wrong.  It's that simple, folks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think melees should be able to get NPC binds, and I really wouldn't care if it was free.  At 51 I refuse bind donations unless I have to run to another zone to do it.  I charged a little bit (1-2pp) at 14 to help pay for the spells, but haven't gone out of my way to make money off of it since then. I seriously doubt it would affect the economy much to have free binds by NPCs.  If the NPC charges I think a level based fee would be good. Or maybe 5p at most.  I can't imagine charging or paying more than that as a player.<P>Class interdependency is good thing when it comes to grouping.<P>Melees spending hours trying to get a bind so they can go out and fight is a total waste of time.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>kungfoomf, yup...it's true.  I've never changed it -- nor do I ever plan too.  Oh, and my 41 warrior has only changed his three times: once, because he's a dwarf and I was spending most of my time in Antonica so I bound in Freeport, second time because I was dueling in the Arena, and third time to go back to Freeport.<P>kbern4, lol.  Sorry dude but if you don't ever bother to seriously think why you died when you did, you will never learn how to avoid it.  I can't sit here and tell you how to avoid death for every situation.  Instead of being a smartass, sit there and ask yourself why you died.  Like I said, my warrior rarely dies either and he doesn't have FD.  <P>If you die frequently, you are doing something wrong.  It's just that simple.  Maybe you aren't a very good player, maybe you're in a bad group, maybe you're fighting stuff out of your league, maybe you don't prepare properly, maybe you don't have backup plans if things go sour, etc.  <P>I use to die frequently (like most players seem to do) until a buddy of mine told me that "getting ahead in EQ is more about not going backward (i.e. dying) than it is about going forward."  He was a master of not dying and I thought long and hard about what he said.  He's totally right.  The only time I die frequently nowadays is if I'm on a dangerous raid.    No, I don't play my char like a wimp.  I just know the signs and I know exactly what I can and can't handle.  <P>The ONLY reason you should ever die is because you are working a group in an area you are unfamiliar with or you are on a dangerous raid.  In either case I highly suggest you have a cleric there to reduce the risk.<P>I see so many people die for no reason.

If my lv48 shadowknight is soloing (or attempting to solo), she spends at least 80% of her gametime sitting down healing back health, or medding to get enough mana to drain a green to recover as many hitpoints as she has remaining mana, and then med again to fully recover her mana. When she dies (and she does so frequently) she has a naked corpse recovery run from her bind point (remember she is a hybrid and cannot self bind) and additionally she has to rememm. back her spells!<P>The only saving grace to the whole thing is that she does have spells to make her naked corpse recovery run less hazardous (Gather Shadows/Invis to Undead) - but these are spells and they do tend to wear off at highly inappropriate times (ever heard of Murphy's Law).<P>So a hybrid not only has to fully rememm. spells, they have to run naked from their last (melee) bind point, and then they have to loot their bodies. So in effect on dying we have both the caster issues (rememming spells), and the melee issues (multi-zone corpse recovery) to contend with.<P>My shadowknight may be higher level, but she does not have a cleric on call (to rez. if she dies) so must change her bind points everytime she has a major hunting ground change. Additionally as a gamer I play from Australia and getting binds during my evening game sessions (very eary morning in the USA) is almost impossible at times.<P>Self-bind (and to a lesser extent) self-gate should be necessary and automatic game fuctions for all race/class combinations and should be avialble to all either as castable spells, or as right-click effects from questable items.<P>Cheers,<BR>Trystwych, lv48 darkelven shadowknight<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Man  - I step away for a few hours and the topic explodes..... <P>Ok in response to everyone at once:<P>1: Binds from NPC's should cost by level... you have to remember there are people who play this game who CAN'T get 10pp at the drop of a hat.<P>2: I've noticed most of the people saying I should have no trouble finding binds and that I must just be rude seem to be mostly casters.  I find it odd that just becasue YOU don't mind giving binds that you assume ALL casters don't mind giving binds so obviously I'M being rude.  I am in fact very polite and actually never whine like the example in my initial post..... I in fact hate asking for binds so much I will usually wait until a guild mate is on and nearby or I get in a nearby group (yes this limits my hunting locations).<P>3: Finally, I also notice that the few people truely against melee's binding themselves via an NPC (or otherwise) are those who seem to use binds as a money making venture and are worried about their loss of income.  Which kind of reminds me of a long time ago when there was no real law enforcement and masked men would stop travelers and demand good to let them pass. What was that called?  Extortion?  Highway robbery?<P>No, I do NOT think melee's should be able to bind themselves everywhere casters do... I don't really see the point in that.   I'm not EVEN asking for melee's to be able to bind themselves in those new non-city places.  But to be able to bind themselves in cities so they don't have to stop playing the game because there happens to be no one with bind in town (or at least anyone who isn't going to hold them up for 20-50pp).<P>I understand the desire for class inter-dependance, but there is PLENTY of that WITHOUT the whole bind issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>kbern4, sorry about the "smartass" comment then.  The reason why I went into all that is because most people do die far more often than is necessary.  We all get screwed on occasion for LD and whatnot but from what I can tell, most deaths are avoidable with proper preparation and execution.  For example, I see people out exploring in SoV with no sow or jboots.  This is stupid for most classes.  A simple sow potion can save someone's life but I'm stunned how few people take advantage of that.  Then they go and complain about dying for no reason.  Of course there is a reason...they are not prepared for unexpected encounters.  <P>People should play their chars like Boy Scouts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Be prepared.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So how does one avoid death (and the subsequent issues of long corpse recovery)?<P>Death happens in many ways...<P>Soloing Deaths<BR>1. You go LD or suffer sudden and extreme packetloss which makes your character unable to cast spells/run/FD.<BR>2. You have one of 'those' fights in which spells are either interrupted/resisted/fizzled and you seem to miss when you try to hit, or when you hit you barely scratch the mob, and when you try to FD the mob sees though it. The mob however hits you consistantly with spells and pounds you into the ground.<BR>3. You get caught up in someone else's train.<BR>4. Invisibility wears off in a city zone and you get jumped by a million guards.<BR>5. Invisibility wears off whilst travelling through a dungeon and you immediately get aggroed by a million mobs.<BR>6. You get a tp with a druid/wizard into CazicThule/Iceclad and immediately get aggroed by the nearby waiting mobs.<BR>7. You inadvertently get involved in a GM event.<P>Grouping Deaths<BR>1. The healer and other casters go OOM and as a tank your job is to keep the mob/s onto you long enough for the casters to save their own skins.<BR>2. The group gets run over by another's train or bad pull.<BR>3. The group suffers packet loss, or loses vital members (cleric/chanter) to LD.<BR>4. The group gets inadvertently caught up in a GM event.<BR>5. Bad group (poor pulling/inappropriate spellcasting etc.)<P>Other Death Senarios<BR>1. You go to the planes.<BR>2. You fight in Velious.<BR>3. You die to a recognised bug (like logging/zoning and falling for insane amounts of damage)<BR>4. You duel.<P>To say 'avoid death' is all very well, and most of us do try to avoid death - but sometimes the best laid plans do go awry and the end result is that our character dies.<P>Self-bind should be an automatic game function available to all/all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No, I do not believe melee's should be able to bind. No, I do not see NPC binders as a solution as this detracts from player "interdependancy." However, one solution I see as viable is "bind potions" from shaman. This would create a new market for alchemists, other than the standard SoW/Shrink potion market. The potions should allow melee types to bind anywhere they can currently be bound, just as if a caster had bound them. Thoughts? Flames?<P>Personally I bind anyone who asks, but being KoS in almost every town in Norrath not many ask me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>I do usually give 3 - 4 binds in the OT outpost whenever I am visiting there as that can be a difficult place to find a caster near.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It all depends on what Verant has in store for the player base in regards to the "new" proposed bind points for melee types.  IF they are smart about it (yeah right) they would make a common spot(maybe only in cities ?) bindable. <P>The inn idea comes to mind for caster assisted binds - not melee type self binds. <P>Also, Verant could make standing stones in game bindable area with-in a limited radius about the stone/sign post - with a few of them self binding? or all of them caster assisted binds?.  <P>However, speculation about the "new" bind points aside.  I also think that it would be a good idea for Verant to install a quest for each class in their respective guilds (low level) in which it would take some short time to acquire the item(s) in return for a LORE/NO DROP (i.e. breakable glass ball) item which has just one charge and is able to be carried in any container as well as be "equiped" in the Melee class's range slot for quick activation.  <P>The code already exists in-game to restrict binding effects (think of the teleport room in timorous deep for instance) by area.  It should not be hard to place many of these small spots throughout each city where a melee type with their quest binding item can "right click" it, hit the throw key (if in range slot) to activate it and thus bind themselves.<P>I do agree however, that the new bind points should be caster-needed.  Then the melee type has several playstyle choices available to them at this point.  Do they ask around for a bind? will they do their class quest to obtain the binding item?  This is what Verant wants - more choices and more player involvement.<P>Just my 2cp  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>HOW does this detract from player inter-dependancy?  WHAT inter-dependancy?  Melee's and Casters are inter-dependant in combat and that's fine..... but not OUT of combat... OUT of combat melee's are dependant on casters - period.. there's is NOTHING we melee's have that you need while you have things we MUST utilize.  Sure in place of a TP we could walk and in place of SoW we can just take longer..... but what are we supposed to do without binds?  And then to top that off not only are we dependant on you casters for this necessity.... many of you require us give you money.  That's real nice.<P>The ONLY reason not to allow melee's to bind themselves in towns is so casters can keep bleeding us.<P><BR>Yes... I'm sure SOME of you will come back and say "oh - I NEVER charge for a bind"... well this isn't about YOU then is it?  This is about the other casters.   And a few more of you will say "Oh - I ALWAYS give people binds"  well then this isn't about you either!  The MAJORITY of casters will sit there and ignore any and all requests from non-guild members for anything.<P>I also notice none of you in the anti-bind camp offer to many solutions as to what melees should do when the city they're in is EMPTY 90% of the time!<P>What solutions have you offered?<P>Bind Potions?  There are VERY few shaman who make potions (at least on Fennin Ro) and I'm sure the components and cost of bind potions (much like SoW) will put them out of the price range for all but the high level players.<P>No Rent Caster Created Bind Stones?  How would that solve anything?  So now instead of sitting in a single town getting ignored by casters (assuming there are even any there) no matter how much we plead we will now have to wander the country side looking for casters that happen to have the right components and are willing to take the time and spend the mana to hook us up for the same exorbitant price?  That's actually WORSE.  Make them affordable, remove the No Rent attribute, and sell them at vendors then sure I'd go along with that.<P>The whole point is that Melee's requiring a Caster to bind in towns is NOT class-interdependance... it's class dependancy and often class abuse.<P>Here's a thought... you want the classes to be inter-dependant?  Make it so a caster HAS to be grouped with a melee in order to bind HIMSELF!  Even if he's not binding the melee.  Then everyone will be inter-dependant and the casters will know how we feel.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048402-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048402.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048402-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048402&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048402&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
