</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Enchanters:<P><BR>ITEM:  DoT Pet.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Something not unlike the clerical hammer spell, to add more to the ability of the enchanter to help during fights with extremely high hit point enemies.  A short duration ‘pet’ that would work essentially like a physical DoT.  To work, it would have to be immune to magic and riposte, and be for the most part like the clerical hammer in other ways.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rampage.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This line does not stack with other strength buffs (shaman buffs in particular).  Is this as it is intended to be?<BR> <BR>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion, Wolf.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf.  If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors (it is currently outdoors only).  It should be noted that Enchanters have no foot-speed enhancement spells at this time.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion Races Bug.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that some illusions don’t resize the character properly to people that enter the zone after the illusion is cast, causing some people to see giant gnomes or tiny trolls.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Undead Illusions.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These transformations could be considered the territory of the necromancer, and maybe they should be replaced with something else, or remove them from the enchanter spell list.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lull spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group.  It seems that there should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players feel that these spells are too easily resisted and too easily broken.  So much so that they rarely, or never, use it.  And these spells make PCs spin, but not NPCs.  Having it spin the NPCs would be a nice addition.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mesmerization spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There are some targets that are unaffected by these spells, either due to level or race.  The anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells don’t even cast (costing the caster no mana or aggro).  Perhaps this approach could be used for mez spells as well.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mesmerization spells and overwriting.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells?  It seems that perhaps they should.  Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite mez spells that are of lower or equal level.  Base this on the spell level, not the caster level, since the durations are not level dependent.  Someone suggested that not having these spells overwrite was intentional (according to GZ) to make playing enchanters more of a challenge.  If it is intentional, then leave it as it is.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There is a call for a change of the color of a monster’s name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know that monsters are under the affects of these spells just by looking.  If it is determine that this would be too useful, making it to easy for the group, we might consider making it so that only the enchanter sees these color changes.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Low level Evocation practice spell.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Enchanters don’t seem to have a spell like Flare with which they can practice their evocation skills early on.  This may be intentional, though, as enchanters are not supposed to be experts at evocation.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Tiny Daggers:<P>DESCRIPTION:  These items are unavailable in Qeynos.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pet Positioning.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Because enchanters can’t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way.  There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master.  This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something.  Can pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  'Charm wears off'.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players report that this message is sometimes sent long after the charm has worn off, after the creature is dead sometimes.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Reoccurring Amnesia.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell does not reoccur.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Boon of the Clear Mind.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is a group clarity spell, but it does not overwrite Clarity.  Either spell should probably overwrite the other, basically just increasing the duration (and the same should apply to the Clarity 2 spells).  It also seems that this spell has a very short useful life span.  Lowering the level of this spell would allow its use for longer before they get Clarity 2.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Failure Messages.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some spells (Lull series and stuns against giants are primary examples) give the same message on failure that they do on success. If it fails it probably should say so.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mask Faith.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while.  Part of the game is that characters have to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters.  But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic.  That runs contrary to the basic concept of the world of Norrath.. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don’t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can’t get into if they have a religion).  The players are requesting a spell that masks their faith, making them appear agnostic to NPCs.  Perhaps the best idea presented would be to create greater rewards for choosing the difficult path of being a pious enchanter.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There seems to be something wrong with the stacking of these two spells.  It seems that the bard song will stack over the enchanter spell, but the song must be stopped or the enchanter spell won’t take.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Blanket of Forgetfulness/Memory Flux.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some players say that Blanket doesn’t work well enough, and some say that it does.  But most think that Memory Flux is not effective enough.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Collaboration.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell does not seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal. Is this a bug?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusions and Link Death.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Can illusions remain up during a link death and perhaps while zoning (thought would have to go into changing it when zoning.  There are good and bad sides to that change, but if illusions zone, the players become responsible for how they handle those situations, rather than the software).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  The Essential Enchanter.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some thought should be put into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that.  If this is determined to be a problem, then perhaps allowing some of the other classes to be better at the skills where they overlap with an enchanter (such as bards and crowd control...) would be a solution.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Resplendent Robe.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The effect on this item is Rune IV, but it requires a component.  Should items require components?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>Rune IV:<P>DESCRIPTION:  The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Boon of the Garou.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The duration should probably be increased by thirty seconds or something, so that the spell can be kept up on two targets without it dropping (the duration is currently exactly twice the recast time).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Tash Line Aggro.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The thought from the players is that this line causes too much aggro.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rune Line Aggro.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Similar to the aggro with Tash spells, but somewhat less easily explained.  It seems like this might be a bug.  This spell might be getting a double whammy on aggro, being treated as a buff and a healing spell.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Recast Bug on fast spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  After casting any spell, fast casting spells (Tash line, for example) will sometimes not cast right away, and will give a "this spell is not ready message".  This is an old bug.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Global Mana Regen Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The idea would be to reduce the power of all forms of mana regeneration.  Then, increase the basic level of mana regeneration for everyone, both standing and sitting.  Alter this so that the over all effect of meding with Clarity is the same.  This would lower the value of Clarity and increase the ability of all casters that are not grouped with an enchanter.  Obviously this is a radical idea that would make the game easier.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mircyl’s Animation icon bug.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The picture in the spell book is of the little guy (for summoning) and not the wand (which all the other animations use).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Visions of Grandeur.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The recast time on this spell might be too long.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Dazzle (49) and Glamour of Kintaz (54).<P>DESCRIPTION:  Glamour of Kintaz does not overwrite Dazzle.  In some cases, Dazzle will ‘stick’ even on an NPC that won’t be affected, meaning that a future casting of Glamour of Kintaz will not stick, when it should just overwrite Dazzle anyhow.  So this is two items, there seems to be a bug in Dazzle (it 'sticks' even though it was resisted) and Kintaz might need to overwrite Dazzle.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Umbra (57).<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell doesn’t seem to be very much of an upgrade to the previous spell, Shadow (49)<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Enchant Medium Quality Ore.<P>STATUS:  It seems that some smithing recipes call for enchanted medium quality ore, but there is no spell to allow enchanters to create such ore.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Better pet control.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Not on the level of control that a magician has over his pet, but perhaps something lesser.  For example, if the enchanter attacks an NPC physically, and the pet is not engaged, the pet would attack whatever the enchanter had attacked (this is, basically, a limited form of /pet attack).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Phantom armor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  An illusion spell that allows the enchanter to look like he is wearing plate.  Perhaps a new spell similar to the magician phantom line (perhaps just like it) that has this illusionary effect that the caster looks like he’s in full armor of the spell type (and magicians should also be candidates for this spell line).  But this should be a new spell line, so that casters could choose NOT to look like they are wearing armor if they just want the AC benefits.  Obviously the two spell lines would not stack.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<BR> <BR>---<P>ITEM:  Group Rune.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A group Rune IV spell, allowing the enchanter to save some time while buffing his group.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Enchanting Items.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is on this list mostly as a reminder that we have virtually promised item enchantment to this class.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Religion.<P>Obviously religion is important for an enchanter.  The problem is, that the importance is that your character follow no religion.  There really should be some benefit to having an enchanter with a religion.  This is listed as a separate item for emphasis.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Thicken Mana.<P>DESCRIPTION:  More uses for these potions would be great.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Targeting.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Enchanters in particular would like better targeting abilities.  Being able to cycle through all NPCs in view with one key (like F8) would certainly make their lives easier.  Though it should be kept in mind that it's not supposed to be too easy.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion, Gender.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell was intended earlier, but it failed to come into existence due to technical issues.<BR>.<BR>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion, Group Elemental (or race).<P>DESCRIPTION:  A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race illusions) to the group.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion, Change Size.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller.  It should be noted that size change is, so far, the area of the shaman.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion).<P>DESCRIPTION:  A spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature.  Keeping faction issues in mind, this might be possible if this were to only work on specific NPCs in any given zone.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Major Illusion.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A high level spell (even 60th if needed) that has the functionality of the original minor illusion spell.  One that brings back the enormous illusions that were possible with minor illusion back in beta.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion face,<P>DESCRIPTION:  Would give the enchanter a random face.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Enchanters are the masters of illusions which entails all illusions.  Enchanters are able to charm everything, not just live things while Necromancers are only able to charm undead.  It's the exact same thing.  Enchanters have a broader range of illusion spells than any other class and should not be limited.  If 2 of our illusions are going to be taken away, I can assure you there will be an uproar of enchanters asking for compensation. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: DoT Pet.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Honestly, IMO, I don't see this being any use what so ever.  That being said, I haven't cracked a pet out in many levels, unless I'm goofing off and dueling or just gaining faction or something.  If our pets aren't going to be used much, why added a second version of pet?  Unless I'm misunderstanding how the pet should work.  I'm thinking clone of the cleric hammer.  IMO, I think this would be a bad idea, just because we could be doing so much more, other than summong a pet to help out in melee.  This is coming from an enchanter who charms a lot though, and I have comments for that later. =)<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Blanket of Forgetfulness/Memory Flux.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>I have an idea to help this work out.  BoF is a spell that goes off of one check.  Check Vs. Level.    I love this spell, I keep it loaded everytime I'm in a dungeon, it is the ultimate memory wiper.  The complaints I've been hearing about flux is that it doesn't work.  My suggestion, is to make Memory Flux have the same check as BoF, and make it check the one level resistance.   This spell also solves a lot of troubles for the enchanter in other areas.  The Tash aggro problem, Mem Flux/Blur etc. would help with that area if it is checked on level.  Cast tash, let Rune V eat a few shots, and blink it.    This helps out with Rune Line Aggro as well, Rune a person in need, and the mob frenzies on the enchanter, it's very possible for the enchanter to channel through the beating, or stun and blink the monster attacking you.  I do this in Sebilis and Icewell with BoF.  If all the memoyry lines are put on the resistance of the level check, I think this may help solve more than one problem.  The only trouble would be the over powering of that spell, prehaps make it so it lowers the enchanter only on the list, and not clear it completely?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Client Side info on mobs&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>I would very much like to see if we can get some of the info moved to client side, because it would take away a ton of the frustration we feel when trying to do our role in combat.  This would mean that when we cast a GoK, or Charm on a monster.  We will get the message: "This Monster cannot be mesmerized with this spell" or "This creature is too high a level to charm" before the spell fully lands and mana is wasted, and an aggro is thrown onto the enchanter for something that didn't even have a chance to land.  If we can get the message before mana; time; and aggro are wasted, this would help the enchanters greatly.   55+ enchanters have a tough time figuring out which blue mob and can de dazzled and which ones require GoK.  And if they like to charm, add more complications to that problem.  If some of that info can be moved client side, a lot of enchanters will have a lot less grey hair =)<P>-Utaman Dal'Illusao &lt;Black Tower&gt;<BR>Lvl. 53 Enchanter, Xegony.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ILLUSION WOLF<P>Forgive me for being a druid in a chanter area, but I like knowing the game.  Personally I understand SOME illusions.  I welcome and love the race illusions for Chanters, and understand why some rogue masks work with it... never understood bard masks, but I never played bard in other games.  My vision for an enchanter is an ADD illusionist with some psyonic abilites.  I do disagree with them having "Wolf Form"  This was one of my favorite benifits of a druid.  I remember going to Feerott and having the ogres call me woofie and ask for furry feets. The wolfform is a signature illusion for druid.  We get it because it totally fits in with the druidic class.  Necro's the masters of the undead also get their skeletal illusion because they are undead.  Some I've been with have even been partially undead.  It makes sense.  Enchanters should maybe be able to have a spell that randomly chooses a monster out of zone they could be, but not a wolf!  PLEASE!  I want to be my own signature wolf!  Or then give a druid a spell that turns us into an Enchanter and gives us Clarity  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alric Vanmorisson<BR>49 Cleric Tunare<P>Kordael Galathilon<BR>32 Enchanter Tarew<P>Baralo Horehound<BR>32 Druid Tarew</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ugh. After all of these discussions, this is the list we have? <P>"DESCRIPTION: Some thought should be put into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. If this is determined to be a problem, then perhaps allowing some of the other classes to be better at the skills where they overlap with an enchanter (such as bards and crowd control...) would be a solution."<P>I haven't read the Cleric list yet, but I can only assume they have the same verbage in it? And say you did take away our effectiveness, or give other classes (ie. Bards, which is my only other character, btw) more of our abilities, then what are we going to do? Nuke? <P>All in all, it's a very disappointing list. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing that I see missing is acknowledgement of our request for a 60th level "super buff".<P>One buff that wraps up Gift of Brillance, Clarity 2, and Enlightenment all in one buff and lasts for a long time.<P>There are two things that are "wrong" about the enchanter buffs, the first is that, compared to other buffing classes (and even many non-buffing classes) our buffs last for EXTREMELY short durations.<P>For example shamen, clerics, druids, and even necromancers (with DMF) have buffs that last 45 min - as long as 2 hours.<P>But the same is not true of enchanters for some reason.  Is having a long lasting C2 that much more overpowering than having a long lasting persistant HP buff?  I say no.<P>Also, of the 4 "support" buffing classes, only enchanters are missing the 60th level super buff.<P>Clerics have Aego which ties up 3 desirable buffs into one (Hero line, Symbol, and AC line) which lasts more than 1 hour, Druids have Protection of the glades (HP regen, Mana regen, and HP) which lasts for an extremely long duration, and Shaman have Focus (basically a somewhat less potent form of avatar) which also has a significent duration.<P>Why are enchanters who, particularly in Velious, are often reduced to buffers, be the only buffing/support class without these nice mutiple effect long duration spells?<P>Doesn't this seem out of wack?<P>Another item that seems to have been missed on this list was the complete lack of upgrades and variety of equipment for pure casters beyond planes gear.<P>Especially considering the disparity of not only the quanity of caster equipment vs. Melee and Priest classes but also the jumps of effectiveness that this gear gives vs int caster gear.<P>This disparity is not made up with the "power" of our spells as was probably the intention, and if that was the intention then why were priest classes given equilivent upgrades in line with the melee upgrades when they too also recieve upgrades via spells?<P>The arguement that Caster upgrades are in the form of spells is invalidated when one considers that priest classes get both gear AND spell upgrades.<P>When the robe I looted nearly 1.5 years ago in the Plane of Hate is superior to all but a SINGLE robe found in either expansion, yet melees have at least 3 full effectiveness upgrades in that same time, there is a disparity that needs to be addressed.<P>Also, when discussing items, please keep in mind that int casters don't only want int/mana items.  Many Enchanters would like stuff that comes with AC and HP, resistances, and useful effects.  Be creative, heck, for a template just look at the usefulness of priest and melee classes armor.<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>An item I saw on the necromancer list would be appropriate for ours as well.  Necromancers said they want more of a variety for spell icons besides the skull.  Enchanters also have 1 icon for just about every spell we cast in dungeons - the brain icon.  A little variety would be nice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If they are going to remove the skeleton illusion from enchanters consider removing the Amulet of Necropoletance.  It allows anyone to turn into a skeletons.  It would be unfair to remove our spell b/c it is "appropriate" for Necromancers but allow this item to remain in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Issue #1 - *** was this thread started in the casters forum instead of in the main forum??? Were you trying to slip it by us???????<P>Issue #2 - Why are group illusions not considered a priority?  As of right now there seems to be very few illusions that are granted too us that are ONLY available to enchanters.  This combined with the fact that our titles imply that we are all about illusions despite the fact that our last illusions come at lvl 44.  Group non-race illusions should be given to us and NOT *****ed about.  Just throw it up on test and see if we are out of balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm a necromancer and I don't care if you have illusion: skeleton or not.  Doesn't step on my toes.<P>Enchanters are illusionists. So why NOT an illusion: skeleton? Or illusion: any other undead, for that matter?  Does it really affect the necromancer class one bit if an enchanter can make himself look like a skeleton?  Or maybe a zombie? Or a mummy? So what?<P>As for the MR thing, that was a class-wide issue that has been brought up seperately (or so they claim).  I really hope so.<P>And finally, the pets. I can control my pet, and he still gets in my way all the time. I don't even want to think about how much trouble yours is...<P>Personally, I think giving enchanters a little bit of control over their pets is a good idea. Nothing too much, or you start stepping on mage / necromancer toes, but enough to make them halfway useful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Charms, I know 60 enchanters that dont even use dictate because in most cases their lower level charm lasts longer. Why not give us a longer mez, give wizards more damage, but leave us at dazzle... sure you upgraded speed buffs, but if we were meant to be speed buffers you think we would have started playing this class?<P>Throw us a bone here, its not like my 5 deats on every raid for tossing 1 spell per fight is really justified right now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor !<P>Why don´t you get back to your TV shows instead of pretending to listen to us while filling the commercial breaks ? Zap through the Channels like the others and tell the Developer Team to read the Enchanter talks, for you obviously don´t like to bother with our real concerns.<P><BR>Invent a /pet attack ? I HAVE a pet attack command, it´s called Tashan and works ANYTIME on ANYMOB....<BR>We need /pet back of. <P>I can´t control my pet. The last thing i want is to have it behind me where i can´t even SEE if it wanders around and get´s lost. <P>Overal better mana regeneration ?<BR>So all classes can better regain mana, while reducing our main advantage ? Great idea. Making it easyer for anyone ? Except Enchanter´s of course. Will we get a better HP regeneration for this in the Trade ?<P>In Velious Clarity is one of the things that make Chanter´s wanted, make it worthless and we don´t need to bother with it anymore, we can tell the guild: Velious ? Me ? What for ? <P>Also Clarity is the main Trade we got for dying too much, at least we can purchase a Resurect with Clarity most of the time. <P>I think Wizzards should gain more mana recovery for they got no pet and no way to affect Mob´s other than magic, all other classes are well balanced in this matter. <P><BR>Religion<BR>If you don´t want to let us mask our religion and still want us to choose one, then don´t forget:<BR>ALL essential Quests should be obtainable with ANY religion, if you start to move the Spell´s dont forget to change the Quest NPC´s for the EPIC Quest. <BR>Oh, but i´ll LOVE to see the "UBER" thing´s you want to invent to compensate for the trouble of choosing a religion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>...the other day in PoGrowth...<BR>XXX SHOUT´S: Any ENC follower of Tunare here ? We just found a Tunare only Robe !<P><BR>After all the good sugestions there´s nothing really new or useful on your list, a few bug´s adressed, thank you for this, most main troubles skipped, course you for that. <P><BR>P.S.: All of you who wonder why he posted this trash on THIS board, you may have missed it, but there´s a Post here called "The Enchanter Plague"<BR>read it and you will know where he´s got his supperior insight´s of our overpowered Class.

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Mesmerization spells and overwriting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells? It seems that perhaps they should. Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite mez spells that are of lower or equal level. Base this on the spell level, not the caster level, since the durations are not level dependent. Someone suggested that not having these spells overwrite was intentional (according to GZ) to make playing enchanters more of a challenge. If it is intentional, then leave it as it is.<P><BR>Absor: <BR>Its intentional.<P>Consider the average guk/seb/karnor pull, maybe 3-5 mobs.  The enchanter has a choice:<P>1. ae them now, continue to ae them until one or two are left, and break messes one at a time and kill or remes.<P>2. Have them beat on the party members while he single target messes one at a time, trading off the immediate nullification for longer duration.<P><BR>Being able to AOE a 5-8 mob pull with a 30 sec aoe spell is fine.  Being able to then individually pick out MOBS and lay on 96 second messes over top of that AOE mes is definitely NOT FINE.<P>I would say that in your average deep guk/karnor/seb group, an enc who aoes, then lays on single target messes with this proposed scheme could easily eliminate a quarter of all damage done by the mobs over the course of the fight.<P>Its an AMAZINGLY powerful ability you're proposing they be given.  While I'd love to see it, as I play an ench quite a bit, just realize its ramifications:  at 50, a good enc could lock down 5-8 mobs instantly for 15 secs (30 post-50 with fascination), and then WITHOUT breaking the mes, change that to a 96 second mes.<P>/drooooooooooooooooooooool</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

As it is, we die first anyway.<P>As for giving even more of our abilities to bards, that's ridiculous.  They're a melee class.  We're the weakest of the casters.  Did you even consider that?  We might have some spells that are extremely valuable in groups but there is a tradeoff.   We're weak.
