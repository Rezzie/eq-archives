</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055465.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055876.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582.html<P>Author Topic: Rogue Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-05-2001 12:43 PM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Hello again.<BR>This will be the thread for discussion about the rogue class. The idea is to look at the things that need to be changed to make the class 'balanced'. With that as the primary goal, I am still interested in hearing about bugs and other such things. But, primarily, I want to talk about balance.<P>My take on the rogue is pretty similar to that of the warrior. They are pretty well balanced. Obviously with EverQuest as a primarily player vs. environment game, some of the things that thieves traditionally do are not really part of the package. That's why, in EverQuest, they are titled rogues.<P>Again, I have had little time (actually, no time at all) to do research on rogue concerns before starting this thread. So please be as detailed as you need to be to get your point across. But, at the same time, please remember that this thread will get long. So being concise and readable is important too.<P>I do want to report one thing that we have already discovered internally about rogues that is broken and will be fixed when we make these changes. Yes, it is a nerf, but not in the true sense of the word.<P>In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at). In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list. Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically. This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs. But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list. Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function.<P>I wanted to let you know that at the outset. Please don't make it the focus of this thread. It’s certainly something we should talk about. But there are certainly other things that are worth discussion as well.<P>So let's hear what you think.<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Evade doesn't work well enough to deserve a nerf.  If I begin attacking too early, I'm the tank.  There goes roughly 33% of my damage because I lost BS.  I lose even more if you count stuns.<P>If I Pick Pocket before mez breaks and the warrior doesn't taunt, I'm as good as dead.  If you are going to nerf it, make it drop us down between the 6th and 7th person on the hate list.  Or the bottom of a single group fight.  Putting us up higher than that will get us killed over and over.<P>Soulbound Lockpicks would be nice.  Not too important, but nice none the less.<P>Try evading on a live server.  It doesn't work all that well.<P>Any rogue will tell you that failure to stop attacking after a 'successful' evade will occasionally send you to your grave(50% of the time if the taunter isn't that great).<P>If evade works, then why does that thing that was aggro pulled(never hit, just aggroed on the puller because he got too close) never get off me if I hit it for 20 points of damage and successfully Evade three times while attacking the other mob.  It takes a mez and the tank to taunt for it to get off me.<P>Negoldar<BR>44.37 Rogue<BR>Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is a list of things that should be added/changed.<P>1. Tracking:  Rogues should gain the tracking skill somewhere between 30 and 50.  It should be MUCH less effective than ranger tracking, and cap at skill level of 50 or 75.<P>2. Escape:  Even if the rogue is the only one on the hatelist,  if he is at least a certain distance away from the mob, and clicks evade, there should be a SMALL chance to completely clear all agro from the mob.  Maybe like a 1% chance for every 5 levels, and wont work on mobs over 55.<P>3. Some kind of skill to gain between levels 30 and 50.<P>4. Burning Rapier: Possibly improve the stats slightly or at least add some kind of glowing or burning graphic.<P>5. Poison: Make them stackable, they just take up too much space the way it is.  Once the poison is applied, you should get the vial back.  Also make the effect non-interuptable, it shouldn't be a spell anyway!<P>6. Throwing: Up damage a bit for crits; maybe increase range a bit  or remove the minimum range.<P>7. Hide/Sneak: Whenever Hide is broken, the button should grey.  Like when looting a corpse and such.  Should be able to Hide/Sneak through zonelines and possibly through camping and LD also.  Movement rate while sneaking should also begin to increase earlier.  Maybe around level 20 you would increase very slightly  and then a little more every 5 or 10 levels.<P>8. Backstab: The message should stand out more like warrior's crits. Backstabs that inflict MAX damage should also stun for 2 to 5 seconds.<P>9. Disarm: Make it possible to disarm magic weapons at lvl 40 or so, also offhand weapons.  Have mobs do LESS damage when they dont have a weapon!<P>10. Pick Pockets:  Make it possible to pick magic and lore items at higher levels (around 45 or so). Make it so you take a faction hit if they detect you (less than for killing though).  Make attacking grey out pick pockets for 30sec or so.  picking a mob you're fighting shouldn't happen.  Make an animation for pick pockets, that anyone around you has a chance to see.  Whether or not people around you see the animation depends on your degree of success in picking.<P>11. Apply Poison: Should stand up automatically when done-- just like bind wounds.<P>12. Illusion masks:  Zoning should NOT remove the illusions.  You should be able to click the effects off however.<P>13. Safefall: Should max around 125 or 150<P>14. Damage Shields: Should not affect throwing or archery attacks!<P>15. Instill Doubt: Both Instill Doubt and Backstab should grey each other out.<P>16. Weapons: Possibly add some useful non-piercers for rogues.<P>17. Traps: Make the traps in the old world-- like sola and b actually do damage!  they already break sneak, they should do damage too! Also make pit traps detectable (but not disarmable obviously).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel that I understand why VI wishes to change evade.  When evade was implemented, VI is telling us that the hate list was a quite a bit smaller.  It has not been indicated how large it was initially, or how large it is now... so for the sake of argument, let me assume that the previous hate list was at least 6 PC's in length.  <P>When evade was implemented, upon a successfull skill roll of evade, VI has indicated that the Rogue was placed at the bottom of the list (we are assuming at least the 6th slot).  Was that not what the dev team originally intended it to happen?  Did you not EXPECT the Rogue to go to the 6th position (or to the bottom of the list, wherever that was)?  Was the hate list SMALLER than 6 people (I suppose that's possible, but HIGHLY un-likely).<P>We will give VI the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they knew what they were doing when evade was initially concieved, considered, TESTED, and then implemented... and assume that AT LEAST the 6th position is where the Rogue was SUPPOSED to go, upon a successfull evade.  I am not going to accept that the dev team didn't know where on the list the Rogue was going, and you have already admitted that we went to the bottom, so it is fairly safe to assume that the evading Rogue AT LEAST went to the 6th slot.<P>At some point, VI is telling us that they expanded the hate list to be much larger than it used to be, but a successfull evade still moved Rogues to the very bottom.  This is bad.  I can understand changing this.  But (BUT!!!) your proposal is to move us to between the 2nd and 3rd position (to me, this just means that evade places the Rogue 3rd), OR 500 points of hate are removed, whatever is greater.  <P>No matter how carefully you guys try to disguise this change, THIS IS A NERF TO THE ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION!  If you feel the need to "fix" evade, becuase it became "broken" when you expanded the hate list, shouldn't a successfull evade be putting the Rogue somewhere around the 5th or 6th slot, or where-ever evade placed the Rogue when the skill was originally implemented?<P>If you need to fix evade, fine.  But, a "FIX" would be to return it to it's original effectiveness.  If you are going to nerf it, then COME CLEAN!  This garbage about the hate list being changed, but evade not being changed along with it, is a SMOKE SCREEN to draw attention away from the fact that you are NERFING EVADE with your proposal.  UNLESS you change evade to place the Rogue EXACTLY where they were being placed, when the skill was originally ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED and before the hate list was enlarged, then your proposed change is a NERF!<P>Thanks for reading.<P>Shadz Bladz<BR>55 DE Rogue VZ<BR>Silent Souls</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would really like to know what the real perceived problem with evade is. Absor's initial remark about mobs running off after players across the zone just does not happen in practice. Other than a desire to see more dead rogues, is there a reason for this nerf? Is the proposed nerf perhaps an extreme overcorrection for a minor problem?<P>Shadz (and others who think the proposed change will place rogues at 3rd), you should re-read the description of the proposed change. As I read it, the rogue in 1st position will move between the 2nd and 3rd position. The rogue will no longer be 1st, so the old 2nd has moved to first and the evading rogue has now become 2nd, _not_ 3rd.<P>Please do not change evade in this manner.<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 48, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I never have root up unless im soloen or theres no chanter and i have to help park, and hate to ruin it but just cause we can cast the spell doesnt mean its insta cast in any zone, dungeon = no sow fer j00...and yea if they nerf evade it could make it really crappy but stop tryen to say evade never works....amazingly even though rangers do less damage they seem to agro ALOT more than rogues and you get evade before 55 so be happy, then our evade is a spell , that sucks our mana down quickly and is usually resisted.<P>So if they nerf evade and it sucks sorry....but just remember you'll never be beaten on more than us rangers.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've only got a few issues to touch on. Some things I agree with have already been mentioned innumberable times, so I'll be brief with them.<P>1. Evade: This appears to be a main issue of conern for many rogues. Their primary argument lies in the current flaws of the evade system. These rogues are afraid that with changes made to the evade skill, they will become primary targets for creatures which will result in more death. I think that the skill can be changed as has been proposed by the dev team, but also think that it needs one small modification: the uninterruption of evade. This could either be in the form of being able to hide while being hit, or actually incorporating an evade button of some sort that works on a thread separate from hide. Many rogues would call me a traitor to my class for advocating this change, but let me make a point on this. If you have been a rogue for a long time, then you played before evade was even implemented. Knowing how to deal without an evade skill even in the game, I can tell you that it is perfectly possible to play the game without dying repeatedly, it requires you simply to exert a bit of effort in playing your class. Many newer rogues do not realize how pampered they are to even have the evade skill, which has allowed an influx of talentless and brainless rogues to succeed. Another problem with the current evade system is that rogues are able to develop themselves rapidly with substandard equipment. This change would require that rogues actually use the upper-end AC gear over the easily -obtained STR gear. Heaven forbid, you may actually have to learn how to really play and use some strategy and timing!<P>2. Poisons: Keep these as rogue exclusive skills. However, I do feel that some change needs to be made in poison storage. This could either be in the form of stacking poisons or multi-charge poisons, akin to potions made by shamans.<P>3. Safe Fall: I'm actually amazed I didn't really see anyone address this; perhaps I wasn't looking closely enough. I think that safe fall, as it currently exists for rogues, is all but useless. The skill cap for it simply MUST exceed its current substandard 94. If this comes in the form of a 50+ skill cap increase, so be it, as long as it happens. Rogues' safe fall skill should be at least on par with that of monks.<P>4. Corpse Retrieval: Corpse retrieval has always been an important job for rogues, even moreso when the change was made to allow rogues to hide and sneak at the same time, and further yet when rogues were made invisible to a vast array of different creatures (living, dead, etc.) at one time through the use of a single type of invisibility. However, a problem exists with corpse retrieval now; it is practically monopolized by necromancers in upper-level dungeons. A rogue SHOULD be able to sneak into a place like Sebilis and reach a corpse in places like the crypt, disco room, or chef without being seen. The problem here is inconsistency in creatures' vision. For instance, some shamans/wizards can see rogues invis, but some cannot. This would not provide too large a problem were it not for the fact that there are some places a rogue cannot sneak behind said creatures. Some creatures block key passageways and always face the same direction. What can be done? I really have no idea for certain and I would like some input. One idea I had tossed around with friends was implementation of a distract skill that when successful, would cause nearby creatures to face away from the rogue. Many games which focus on stealth as a primary aspect have a similar implementation in the form of throwing rocks, banging on a wall, etc.<P>5. Kunark Armor: Specifically, the Mrylokar's Greaves and Gauntlets. Though many servers have several Mrylokar's breastplates (enough on some even for alternate cahracters to have them!), nearly every server is lacking in these two pieces. Nearly every class has a problem with greaves as far as I am aware, so though it does not relate specifically to rogues, something should be done with Venril Sathir to alter his drop rates or spawn time to balance this issue. The problem with the Gauntlets is that they scarcely ever drop, their carrier scarcely ever spawns, and said carrier is in a place that is difficult to pull. I have no problem with good items being difficult to obtain, but these are ridiculous. Where I come from there are possibly four or so pairs on the entire server, despite how often people conduct raids on Karnor's Castle. The Gauntlets should either have their drop specifics altered, or should have their casting time significantly reduced to make them more worth the ridiculous amount effort required to get them. Better armor can more easily be obtained under the current system almost by simply purchasing a relatively inexpensive expansion. The Kunark armor should not simply die as a result.<P>6. Defensive Capabilities: Though I know rogues were not intended to be a defensive class, I have a terrible problem with rogues' defensive capabilities. A fully-armored rogue in plate class armor and wearing various other items geared toward AC can sometimes not even match a monk of lower level. Keep in mind that a monk is nothing more than a man or iksar running around in his underwear or a dress. I do not know what can be done to address this, if anything, but it is hurtful to see that monks can easily surpass a rogue's AC while maintaining their ATK at a good value, whereas a rogue will struggle to obtain his high-end AC items, only to fall short of the monk's AC while severely crippling his ATK power. Perhaps the answer to this solution lies not in the defensive capabilities, but in the offense:defense ratio. I would love some feedback on this as well.<P>Conclusively, rogues as they exist are a strong, fairly balanced class. However, they, like any other, have their flaws. Some previously unmentioned issues need to be considered in the rogue equation. Overall, power needs to be given back to the more skilled rogues, and a degree of strategy never hurt anyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whew.  Now that I got that Evade NERF stuff off of my chest, I can focus on other class balancing isssues.<P>Throwing weaps: <P>The damage and range of these weaps is pathetic.  So pathetic as to be useless.  Proposed balancing changes:<P>1.  Some higher damage, better dam/dly ratio throwing weaps would be great.  Make them spendy, or are only makeable by a skilled Smith or something, to limit their availability.  Also, PLEASE introdue some MUCH better range throwing weaps into the game.  All of these new throwing weaps could be Rogue only.<P>2.  Modify the damage done with thrown weaps with the damage multiplier on the main hand, and throwing skill level.  A lower lvl poorly skilled Rogue won't do much damage with a thrown weap, but a higher lvl master should be able to do appreciable damage with a throwing weap.  I'm not asking to be able to do the same amount of damage with a thrown weap as I can with a RB, but come on guys!  5-7 damage normal, with 16ish crits and 36ish Deadly Strikes with 6 dam throwing dagger is a joke, and bad one at that.<P>3.  A "deadly strike" seems to me to be a backstab with a thrown weap, because it only procs from behind the mob.  So, why not have it do backstab like damage equivalent to what the dam of the throwing weap is?  For example: If a Rogue throws a 6 dam dagger and succussfully deadly strikes, it would be identical to if the Rogue had backstabbed the target with a 6 dam weap... skill checks, dbl backstab, and lvl apply.  Make deadly strike an excellent ranged special attack please. <P>4.  Terrain has FAR too much impact on the range of thrown weaps.  Why can't I throw uphill or downhill?  If I can see my target, and they are in range, I should have a chance to hit it.  The same applies to archery.<P>Poisons:<P>1.  Please have poisons remain when zoning.  If you have ever played EQ PvP, you know that ppl zone ALL THE TIME as a manuevering tactic.  It is sad how many poisons I have wasted because I had to zone before I got a chance to use the "spell".<P>2.  Plese make poisons stack.  I know you guys have said this will take a lot of work, but give us PvP Rogues a break.  We have to carry multiple weaps for both PvP and PvE, multiple types of gear (resist for PvP, AC/STR etc for PvE), we now have a TON of soul bound keys and fangs and stuff neccessary for admittance into certain dungeons and for travel.  We are overwhelmed with CRAP we have to carry, and we have limited space.<P>3.  Please reduce the apply time of poisons.  I can understand the delay, but it's too long.  I love the "kneeling" changes suggested too, and to automatically stand when done applying.<P>Otherwise poisons rock.  Great job guys.<P>Tracking:<P>I have never understood why an EQ Rogue, when considering the fact that they are modeled primarily after an "assasin", can not track.  A skilled Rogue does not blindly stumble upon his victim.  The EQ Rogue should have additional abilities that allow him to scout, and obtain advanced information.  The Wood Elf Rogue is even called a "scout" by their guild.  A modest tracking ability, similar to that of the Druid, seems to me to be appropriate for the Rogue.  <P>Furthermore, the "evil" team on the team pvp servers lack trackers.  If they are going to RP the "theme" of the teams server, they do not have a track class available to them.  Having Rogues added as a track able class will help those on the evil team playing the pvp teams servers.<P>Hide/Sneak:<P>Please have invis remain when zoning.  <P>Please have invis remain when looting a corpse (including my own).  If I can Pick Pockets, Sense Traps, and Bandage while invis, I should be able to loot a dead corpse when invis.<P>Bind Wounds:<P>I love the suggestion to raise the Bind Wound skill cap, so that it maxes before lvl 60.  Having to wait until lvl 60 to get the bonus sucked.<P>Right click effect armor:<P>When I right click the effect of the Assasins Chestguard, or the Myrlokar Vambraces (for instance) why can I not close my inventory screen, manipulate my inventory, or target while the spell is casting.  If I am in the middle of a "spell", why can't I manipulate all of my other functions and skills while the spell is casting, with a simple interupt as the result.  These items should not inhibit the Rogue (or the "caster") while the spell is being cast.<P>Illusions:<P>Please have illusions be left-click icon removable.  This is important for the Rogue on a PvP server.  <P>Please have illusions remain when zoning.<P>Please grant positive inate racial abilities to the person under the illusion, as well as negative ones.  Primarily, the Illusion Iksar mask should grant regen, just as Ench Troll Illusion grants regen.  As it is, all any of the illusions do for my DE Rogue is make him look different.  I can sneak/hide anywhere more effeciently than I can travel under illusion, and my race already has Ultravision.  In fact, changing into an illusion REDUCES my vision abilities, especially the illusion Erudite.  Boost the value of these items to be something more than a parlor trick/faction adjustment please.<P>Traveling:<P>This is just a general rant, but with the size of the game now, traveling is just unbearable.  There is TOO much space between zones, not enough port locations, and not enough alternatives to porting.  Speed up the boats, and put in a few more "fire pot" rooms please.  Better yet, REPLACE the boats with fire pot rooms.  The boats are notoriously buggy and SLOW!  Make the lives of the pure melee just a little bit easier, and reduce the tedium of the game a bit please.<P>Bind locations:<P>There are simply not enough of them, and there never have been.  One should also not have to beg for a bind in most cities.  Simply clicking on a soul bind tower or something should be sufficient.  If there is a PC playable race born in a city, there should be a soul bind tower there.<P>More general rants:<P>I have never understood why 6 classes have to bear the burden of class interdependence when it comes to binding and travel.  It is not reasonable for only certain classes to be at the mercy of who can bind or port them.  There needs to be viable alternatives, perhaps not as effecient, but at least serviceable, to a porter and a binder.  The solutions in place are not serviceable for most ppl when it comes to travel and soul binding. <P>Thanks again for reading.<P>Shadz Bladz<BR>55 DE Rogue VZ<BR>Silent Souls<P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I would like to add my support to tracking for the rogue class.<P>The main intent of this post however, regards evade.<P>When my mid-20's rogue hits the hide/evade button and he is the only one doing real damage to the mob (sometimes I'm only grouped with a druid, for example, and they don't start doing damage to the mob till well after I have, though they may have snared it) I can never get the mob off of me. Even if it tells me that I was successful and ducked away from combat, the mob continues to pummel me. The mob does not turn to attack the druid, even though I've now supposedly gone to the bottom of its hate list...and it most certainly does not run off and attack someone else in the zone (heheheh...if it did, then evade would be like a truly evil version of FD).<P>The only time that I can ever hope to have evade work is if a tank is actively damaging/taunting the mob, or if another rogue in the group is BS'ing the mob. Even then, it sometimes tells me that I've successfully ducked from combat yet the mob still pummels me down.<P>If evade works *this well* now, how can we expect that it will be any better after Verant nerfs it some more?<P>I probably wouldn't mind being dropped to the third spot on the hate list *IF* the mob really and truly turned away from me *each and every time* that I evaded successfuly. This is not happening now. If you guys can look into fixing this at the same time you bop our hate list position from dead last to third (please, not second...give us a chance at least), then it might work...it will not work as it is.<P>------------<P>P.S.: My rogue may only be in his mid 20's, but I have hide/evade maxed out and the mobs I'm fighting are mostly blue, with the occasional white, rare yellow and even rarer low red. I would expect evade to work correctly, at least on the blue and white mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, one more thing...<P>If...<P>...when the hate list was only 6 spaces and rogues who evaded were placed at #6 and this was "as intended"...<P>...then...<P>...why not just make sure that the rogue stays in the last hate list spot, not to exceed sixth place? For example, If the hate list is 4 people long and the rogue successfully evades, then he goes to spot #4. If the hate list is 20 people and the rogue successfully evades, then he goes to spot #6, no lower (whereas now they presumably drop to 20th place).<P>Seems like a pretty simple fix and preserves our place on the list from the time when it was not deemed "broken." Any "solution" that places us higher than spot #6 in a hate list can only be considered a nerf, not a fix.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A rogue quickie:<P>Rogues solo worse then ANY other class in the game.  Why is this?  Because rogue damage is dependent on the monster having its back facing the rogue.  This becomes really apparent when a level 30 rogue tries to kill a level 25 and loses.<P>What does this have to do with evade?<P>I feel that evade was the balancing factor for rogues.  A rogue may not have the tweaking ability (to get regenerating breastplates or whathave you) to be able to solo... so when they grouped they outdamaged other melees and required no attention from healers (if evade didn't fail).<P>No matter what way you look at the evade changes to come it will result in two facts:<BR>1.  The rogue will be near the top of the hate list more often.<BR>2.  The rogue will be hit more often.<BR>3.  It becomes much more important that evade doesn't fail.<P>There is no consequence of one for the rogue as long as someone else is higher on the list and the rogue can backstab.  Except for the fact backstabbing will most likely put the rogue on the top of the hate list.  This applies to post 40 rogues because as you state the least effective evade will be will be that of a 500 damage point reduction.  And most rogues won't be able to do 500 damage during a 6 second period (evade recycles).  However if the rogue fails evade twice in a row that is 18 seconds of combat and guarentees that they will be on the top of the list again.<P>The consequence of 2 is that rogues will be less valuable in higher level groups because monsters will be hitting them more, they will be backstabbing less, and rogues make poor tanks.<P>If evade fails the way it currently does rogues are going to be very much out of luck.<P>As for having faith in your abilities to debug the game?  First prove you are worthly of the playerbase giving you their trust.  You implement without input from the players and without foresight (like the cleric breastplate).  And for something so very important to a class I sincerly doubt you will be able to do it without many many many patches.

</FONT><HR>Alright, going beyond the evade issue.....<P>New items of interest:<P>Instill Doubt- although players have been asking for an increase in the accuracy of the skill, you have already stated that you think it works okay as is, fine. BUT atleast increase the speed of the skill. I don't mind missing with skills I've capped even on greens(*cough* backstab 200 skill, *cough* decaying skeleton), I mean I'm use to that now. I don't mind that the timer on instill doubt is as same as backstab. What I do mind the fact that its more easily interruptable then almost any spell. Please look into that.<P>Burning Rapier- Upgrade please. Why? For all the trouble I went through to get it, its sad that its bearly worthy enough to go into my secondary. Many rogues share the same opinion as I. As rogues, we've dove to the bottom of OOT for the oblong bottle. We've snuck into Mistmoore and in some cases even took part in battle with its deadly residents for the blood spirits. We've plowed our ways through the goblins of Sol A to battle Lyndia the Dark Elf exile and her pet for the sparkle purse. More testing still many of us camped many a mind numbing hour for the dreaded BLACK BURROW CASK(13 myself, I've heard more from others). To top it off, we had the tedious errand of buy drinks from local taverns located through out Faydwer and Antioca. All that for a weapon that has the base damage of 7(pretty much ensures it will go into the offhand), delay of 20(this is fine, if anything people can say "atleast its fast"), 5 dex 5 agi(pretty good, but if its suppose to be our class defining quest, shouldn't it give str?), and procs ignite a 37 damage dd(which goes off about once atmost twice a fight with 150 dex, is resisted partially or fully uncommonly, plus may break root(I haven't tested it enough yet)) To say the least many rogues bother to use this weapon cause it would be a waste to put it into the bank after so much effort.(Although, as it is now, its a huge upgrade on the previous one)<BR>Possible Changes *wink**wink*:<BR>7 17 4 dex 4 agi 2 str <BR>8 21 4 dex 4 agi 2 str<BR>9 24 3 dex 3 agi 3 str(play with the numbers a bit)<BR>As for procs, make us one like that for jboots. I don't if my burning rapier procs burning rapier.<BR>Anyhow you see fit, please upgrade burning rapier or atleast put it to thought. I'd gladly destroy my current one and redo the quest for one more worth the trouble(even a second)<P>Hide and sneak- make us an icon for when hide is up. I dislike the fact that you can break hide and not know it.(i.e. briefly clicking on someone or someone's corpse, or looting your own corpse) The amount of deaths this would prevent will put smiles to many a rogue's faces.<P>Planes armor- this is something for all classes really. This is just a thought, but would it be unbalancing to upgrade all the planes armors. Don't get me wrong I don't have anything against the kunark and velious armors, but should it be possible that a lvl one character of any class should have vastly superior equipment to say a 50 plus character. <P>Here are just some thoughts I don't think have been mentioned or have been brought up in detail.

</FONT><HR>Absor, I mean of all the classes to nerf, let's nerf the ROGUES!  Talk about picking on the little guy.<P><BR>Hmmm,<BR>1. Rogues are the only class that needs another tank in the group to even play.  Absor have you ever seen a kitting rogue, it aint pretty.<P>2. Rogues have one claim to fame.  We do the most melee damage (even thou monks are a nano-damage point behind us, but are the best pullers in the game).  So let's nerf the one skill keeps us from getting killed and made useful.  Hell go nerf the freaken monks.  They can tank better than us, pull better than anyone, and hell rogue does PvP vs monk.  Dead Rogue.  But don't nerf the monks either they have a rough life to.  I was just trying to point out, ROGUES ARE NOT NECROS/DRUIDS.<P>3. What is the most group dependent class in the game?  THE ROGUE.  But at the same time being the most class dependent in the game.  A monk can replace us, a wizard can replace us, a mage can replace us, all we do is bring damage to the group.  No this nerf is because who does the most damage (even thou you are not looking at the whole picture) get's the nerf!  I mean Absor once a rogue hits 15+ level, what is first thing out of his mouth after he logs in.  Rogue LFG.  <P>Please, PLease, Please do not nerf Evade, improve it!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are the thoughts that come to my mind on the rogue issue. I am not a rogue and have never played a rogue past level 2.<BR>The first thing that comes to mind is that the change just isn't needed. Yes, that is pretty clear to me. There's no reason to change evade. Even if Verant can come up with 10,000 ideas they still won't be able to claim that the change is needed.<P>The second thing that comes to mind is that if Verant were to change the evade skill, what is their purpose behind it. Keep in mind, I have not read their justification. I only know how evade works from the stand point of friends. From what I understand of the skill it really only allows the rogue to move lower on the hate list of the mobs. This gives them a chance to live after getting the attention of the mobs by doing an enormous amount of damage via their backstab. Effectively, I believe this change will 1) not lower them as far, or 2) change the conditions underwhich they are lowered. To me, there's no good reason, as the rogues deserve just as much of a right to survive in the game as any other class. Right now, a rogue cannot operate as a tank and requires another class to help them backstab.<P>The third thing that comes to mind is that if Verant was to test this as effectively as they have tested the RANGER class for balance the rogue is in for a rough ride. Verant has done one of the worst jobs in all the gaming environments to balance some of the classes and I believe they know it. They have used hyperboil to cover up what they are doing by saying they have implemented a sliding scale of balance and some classes are on the high end and some on the low--just happens the ranger is on the low end.<P>This is very disheartening to hear Absor claim that they will extensively test the changes. The problem is that I doubt, and with good reason, that Verant has the right environment in which to test their game any longer. It is obvious that they have this vision of how the game is to be played yet, it is 100% obvious that 99% of the players in this game don't play it that way.<P>This means that no matter what THEY think their change is, no matter how good they think it is, it won't be done in a manner in which all the other players in the game use it.<P>It is very obvious that Verant doesn't know what balance is. What we hear from Verant is something called 'synergy'. Anyone with a modicum of experience in life knows that synergy does not equate to balance.<P>Because they have improperly defined the term it is inevitable their game will become more and more unstable. You can observe this by looking at Velious. The major part of this series of zones are unbalanced even against the classes played by players with a year of Kunark experience.<P>If this is any representative sample, out of all the other samples we have of their ability to properly test and balance, we know that the rogue evade will wind up as a change that is a very negative thing to the class and to the groups in which they play.<P>The question that comes to my mind is: Is Verant trying to reduce the rogue's survivability to a level which makes the ranger survivability (without any defense changes) look better? In essence I am of the mindset that they are actually nerfing the rogue to make the ranger look better. This is not just bad program design but bad politics. I believe this, being someone that has played a ranger since the game came out. I in no way resent the rogue class for their abilities. But it doesn't make sense to reduce their effectiveness just to make the ranger look better, when in reality they will be just the same.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DONT NERF EVADE.  What you're describing is a NERF.  <P>I coded MUDs for years and I know that how the code for a skill reads and how the code<BR>plays out in context of all the rest of the code (and items) are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS<BR>ENTIRELY.  Thre is MUCH MORE going on here than just the evade skill.  If you change<BR>how the post-successful-evade re-ranking occurs, don't expect to just test and deploy.<BR>You are going to test, deploy, apologize, lose face, test, deply, apologize, lose face,<BR>AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Evade is BROKEN, but it is broken because it is already too easily<BR>interrupted, making timing critical and an unfair disadvantage for people w/a slow<BR>connection.<P>Oh, and BTW, *** with having strength be such a critical stat for Rogues, and it ISN'T <BR>HIGHLIGHTED that it is at PC creation time.  COME ON.  I sunk points into AGI and DEX<BR>and every EQ site I've visited since tells me STR is MORE IMPORTANT.  Backstabs should<BR>have their damage computed off the stats your game recommends for rogues at creation time.  <BR>Now I'm a 27 rogue with a 79 strength because I'm not a twink and didn't "START OVER"<BR>to fix the mistake.  ROGUES ARE ABOUT DEX AND AGIL AND NOT STRENGTH.  Heck, do you <BR>have casters discover later that they needed strength for their damage spells?<P>And what is with poisons being so worthless?  Why spend all the time farming when<BR>you can group and get xps faster.  Make poisons stackable.  Make poisons cheaper.<BR>Make poison ingrediants drop faster.  Right now poisons are just a waste of time and <BR>money.  Go on any server.  Snoop a rogue for awhile.  How often do you see them<BR>using their "defining skill"?  I bet not much at all.  <P>SPEND YOUR TIME FIXING POISONS, NOT NERFING EVADE.<P>Oh, and give us something to look forward to between levels 30 and 50.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I have paid my dues and I see what is being done.  Verant is putting us as a upgraded Hybrid with our skills and damage output.  If you are downgrading (no one likes the word nerf), it shoud be GREATER than a hybrid skill/spell ALWAYS (as good as jolt is not acceptable).<P>Backstabs should INTERUPT spells.<P>You should incorporate new abilities and disciplines that are non hybrid available to keep not only rogues but ALL MELEE seperate from hyrbids.  <P>Being able to tank as good as a bard (wich is allowed to wear plate) and doing the same dameg as a necro is not acceptable. I am a melee class, not a hybrid or a caster. Verant needs to decide what makes this class a desirable pure melee to be included in groups.  And please don't even say solo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Rogues are up in arms about your proposed Evade nerf.<P>Frankly, I was perfectly happy to ignore the rogue talk threads until I heard about this proposed nerf.  Now I'm extremely annoyed.<P>Let's face it, you'll look at the rogue suggestions and ignore them completely.  The only item in the rogue talk threads that will be implemented is the Evade nerf.<P>Hand everyone but the rogues some nice improvements.

A lot of times when I can't get evade to work, I just have to turn off attack and step back to let the SK build hate becasue the cleric's having a hard time keeping me alive.<P>Please don't nerf evade.

I like the idea of a .ini file flag that will cause the rogue to automatically be on sneak and/or hide when they spawn.<P>Sneak/Hide can be used in water if they are in effect when you enter the water. You cannot re-activate them while within the water if something causes them to drop however.

</FONT><HR>God, when are people going to realize that Verant wants to STOP adding major new changes to the classes because they want to get on with creating new products.  Maybe your awesome suggestions for new skills will be used in other games, but you can be sure they wont in this one.<P>However, I wanted to point one glaring mistake that MUST be changed.  EVADE should never have been tied to HIDE.  EVADE is a seperate skill and has nothing to do with hiding!  Furthermore if EVADE were a seperate skill you would never receive the "YOU MUST BE STANDING STILL TO HIDE" message.  Damn, its bad enough that we fail when attempting to use evade almost 40% of the time, but to up that number because evade was tied to another skill is absoultely ridiculous.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX THIS!  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A couple of suggestions<BR>1) I agree Str is far more important to a rogue then Dex/Agi, why not highlight Str at creation time?<P>2) If Evade is changing, and I read somewhere that it would be "at least as good as jolt". That would require it to go off every 1.5 sec (casting time for jolt), rather then the current 10. My suggestions are:<BR>a) to decrease the interruptability of Evade, if we are interrupted we have to wait 10 seconds to retry, whereas Jolt requires less time (instant recast). Now with the addition (on test) of the new cinder jolt spell, you are recognising that rangers need a second evade type spell to improve their life span.<BR>or<BR>b) decrease the recycle time based on haste, much like backstab does. This would allow rogues to use their evade as effectively as they can use backstab.<BR>or<BR>c) move the rogue to sixth on the hate list, which would keep it in line with a group hate list and still be weakening the effectiveness of the rogue in raid situations (which is I assume your intent).<P>3) Either <BR>a) change the RS armour to a quest in the temple<BR>or<BR>b) move it around from Cazic Thule, it seems silly (or lazy) to give all the other melee classes quest armour and just slap the rogues into one zone.<P>4) Tweak the drop rates of poison components, to use poisons I have to sit and farm low greens or I can buy components to increase my skill. I, and many other rogues, do not have the cash to buy the components to increase our skill in poison.<P>5) Make poisons stackable. What I do not understand is that potions are spells and the code was available to make them stackable, yet poisons (which are spells) cannot be changed to do that.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About the Hide/evade/must be standing still thing...<P>if they would consider implementing a suggestion I made (others may have made it as well) it would fix this problem:  make it so that if you are SNEAKing, then you do not have to stand still to start hiding.<P>So, say you are fighting a mob, you could stay in sneak mode (don't try kiting, *snickers*, with this) and then when it comes time to evade, just turn off attack and hit hide.  With the enhancement suggested, you would never get the annoying "you must stand still to hide" message, even if the mob is pounding on you.<P>This would also facilitate Rogues being able to go into stealth mode without having to stop, wait 5 seconds for lag/server to realize you've stopped, then hide/sneak.  You could just keep running, hit SNEAK and then HIDE, and since you were sneaking, you wouldn't have to stop to hide.<P>thoughts?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, I would just like to say a few things before you guys go off changeing evade.<P>First off, i will support any change you make and try to work with ya to get evade back it its pre-Velious state. Personaly i think you, Kendrick and the head rogues from The Safehouse( Shadowcross, Vaslin, Kezzek, Zato, Glip and a few others) should assemble a met in an online chat room and disguss the up comeing changes. This would properly represent the rogue comunity and give of a shot of puting forth a little more input towards the up comeing changes.<P>Now, with that said let me get down to my point. Curently I am level 49, I have played eq since the release and have other higher lvl chars as well but rogue is my life. I have played a rogue back sinces the early days but I took my time to feel my way threw all the classes. When I made my original rogue it was a good bit before evade was in. And life was maddining. I had a horrible time trying to get a group or keep a mob off me so I wasnt hurting the groups overall progress. To me, and many others in the rogue comunity evade was a godsend for us. I remember doing /who all rogue back in the day and seeing a max of 5 or 6 ppl on the server and only 3 of which were in the higher lvls. Now days you can do a /Who all rogue and the list is so long its entirety can not even be displayed. Evade made the class popular, ir brought alot of great ppl to our ranks along with a mass of moronic twinkers. <P>From what i have read, your current plans to change evade will destory my life. I have a hard enough time as it is keeping my self off the top of the list. If you change evade as currently planed, we will work ourselves back up to the top of the list in 5 seconds max. I beleive that evade dosnt need to be changed. But instead you need to go back and look how the new hate list is configured and change it instead. The sorce of our current problem is that at higher lvls evade is over powering BUT that is only because of the hate list changes. The hate list needs to be fixed, not evade. But thats just my view of things.<P>But i REALLY do think you should get together with Kendrick and the lead rogues of The Safehouse and disguss this to find a viable sulition. They represent the whole comunity and generaly know more about the situation than the majority. This will simply stop all the worthless bickering and spam and get down to the real issue at hand without all the bull you have to deal with here on the boards.<P>Thanks, Caio</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, rogues don't have a lot of power in this game.  I mean if VI are going to nerf one of the weaker classes in the game.  What does this say about VI and balance.<P>I played a rogue in the bad old days.  I use to go up to GMs begging them, please fix the rogue class.  Believe it or not the GMs felt sorry most of the time for the rogues.  This is just so depressing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First I'd like to say that I have read most of parts 1 & 2 then part 5 now. So some of what I say might be a repeat.<P>evade- I'll wait and see. I played before it and after it. I have faith that if they break it they will fix it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Poisons-nothing going to change. no biggy to me. It is almost useless as it is, so I don't use it much. But make me stand up after I apply my poison when I do use it.<P>Big items that I see a need for - <BR>better frontal damage. Can't tell you how many green mobs (don't even talk about blue mobs) have aggro'd on me that I died at the hands of. Maybe introducing a "side stab" from the front that stun or interrupt spells. It could be like 30-40% of the BS damage. To compensate I wouldn't object to a slight decrease in damage from the BS. Currently about 40% of my damage output is fron BS.<P>An additional discipline at like level 40 -45 for escape - give like a sow speed for a short duration i.e 15 20 sec. just enough to gives a chance to reach the zone(call it an enrenaline rush), or alternatively a hiding mode that could act as a mem wipe so we can hide/sneak out give it maybe a 30-40% chance of success.<P>Need hide/sneak to ramp up faster in speed sneaking/hiding through Nek forest at level 50 sucks... Ran through last night with a sow on a CR to sol b and went LD. The sergant(he's green BTW) aggro'd on me and I died. 8( <P>Stun/interrup/paralize ability- maybe coupled with BS or the afore mentioned side stab. This could be tied to a close to max. damage output for these attacks, maybe a 85% of max damage to do it.  Let's face it if someone attacks you from behind and stabs you good you're going to be stunned(paralized) for a few seconds.<P>Final words<BR>If the front damage isn't increased the possibly adjust hp up a bit, adjust the ac for the rogue equipment, or an increase in ID success and duration so you can use that new discipline and run like a branded banshee.<P>Evade should be hasted like BS as well when hasted by item or spell.<P>Those are my 2cp worth on making minor adjustments to rogues. Not a major overhaul IMO, but i think would tweak the class balance a bit better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057510-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057510-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057510-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057510&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057510&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
