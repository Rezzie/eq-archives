</FONT><HR>You can follow the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795.html<P>This is regarding the clerical Plane of Growth breastplates, the ones with the ability to cast Celestial Elixer (the Chestplate of Stability, Akkirus' Chestplate of the Risen, the Breastplate of Forbidden Rites and the Templar's Chestplate). For many of the same reasons that we made recent changes to the Donal's Breastplate, we are going to make some changes to these items with the next patch (which will be next week).<BR>Existing instances of these Plane of Growth breastplates will have the casting time for Celestial Elixer increased to one minute.<P>No new instances of the Plane of Growth breastplates will occur (they will stop dropping).<P>In places where the Plane of Growth breastplates were being created (off of NPC corpses or as the result of quests) new breastplates will be created.<P>Basically, the existing breastplates are having their casting times increased and they won't be dropping anymore, new breastplates will take their place.<P>I'm sorry that these items are being changed so long after their introduction. But this is something that we feel needs to be done for the integrity of gameplay in EverQuest.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dang... Auric is on the ball...  Anyway, here's the few responses that I posted to the other thread.  Let me preface this repost by saying that I'm not trying to get into an argument.  I'm just trying to give you an idea of where this stuff comes from before I go home for the weekend.<P>-Gordon<P>Abashi<BR>Station Member   posted 03-03-2001 12:44 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Items that were impossible to balance? <BR>Yeah, we've pretty much agreed all the way around that high HP heal items are a bad idea. These items were in fact created by a guy who plays a high-50s cleric in an "uberguild" and even he didn't realise the impact. <P>In any case, while I personally agree that 1 minute more or less makes the effect useless, these items are such that there's not really a middle ground. Usually somewhere between "Overpowered" and "Useless" there's "Balanced". I don't think there is in this case given our current limitations.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not make the recast time to 3 minutes but leave the cast time alone? <P>That might be a good option, but unfortunately we can't put recast times on items. It's one of the things that we want to do at some point, but it's not a small undertaking. There's so many things that have to be taken into account to enable recast times. To liken it to spells, having to wait the full recast time when memorizing a spell is one such feature that was necessary in order to get them working there. Getting them working right on items would require much the same type of constraints. We have to account for what happens if you remove the item then put it back on.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please call Absor, wake his ass up, and ask him to respond to this thread. <P>He's usually playing EQ about now  In any case, in all fairness he wasn't involved with the decision up until the tail end, where his concern became just getting the word out rather than by everyone getting 'surprised' when they heard the reports from Test over the weekend. <P>Anyway, I'm not going to try defending the items or the fact that they were put in game in the first place. They were a bad idea. It unfortunately didn't become appparent just how bad until a significant number of people had them. As for just stopping the drops, versus swaping and nerfing the old ones, we didn't want a situation to arise that would make the clerics without those BPs "useless" as sometimes happens. Given the outcry over the announcement, and the fact that people are saying that clerics are useless because of the change to these items, I think our worry was a fair one.<P>Anyway, as far as the healing hate stuff on Test goes, here's what's going in:<P>1. The healing-hate cap is being reduced. (less hate max per spell)<BR>2. The calculation of hate is moving a ratio of less than 1:1. In other words, currently if you heal 1000 (assuming the target is over 51), you gain 1000 hate. After the change you'll gain less than 1000 hate.<BR>3. We're fixing a problem with the temporary hate from sitting. Sitting was causing an extraordinary amount of hate making it nigh on impossible to med when in combat.<BR>4. Heal spells assign hate on what we call an "assisted" basis. In other words, any NPC that sees you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy (someone on their hate list) will add hate since they saw you doing that. They do this whether or not they are the primary target. This is why in multiple-attacker scenarios *everything* jumps the cleric as soon as he heals. This is also why everything that's mezed jumps the cleric as soon as mez breaks. We're fixing it so that critters that are mezed or stunned only add enough hate to prevent exploits of mez and stun, rather than the full load they do now when they see you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy.<BR>5. Along the same lines, we're fixing that problem whereby hate lists would propagate across zones. Everyone has been sitting in the dread lands between combat when something ran from half way across the zone to slap your cleric, right? Basically the same thing.<P>That's basically it for what's on test at the moment.<P>-Gordon<BR> <P>Abashi<BR>Station Member   posted 03-03-2001 12:56 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Our current spell designer, Lawrence Poe, sent me this. Thought you might be interested in his opinion on the subject.<BR>----snip----<BR>The problem with the breast plate is not if you cast it on someone whenthey are low on health.<P>The problem is when you cast it on the tank when he first enters combat and continue to Chain cast it throughout the fight. Because of the low taunt value of Heal over time spells you will not get aggrod on even for chain casting. The casting time WAS 20 seconds. the spell effect lasts 24 seconds. This means the primary tank could have a<BR>CONSTANT flow of 300 HP every 6 seconds for the ENTIRE durration of the fight. This means of a MOB Can not do more than 300 damage to the<BR>Warrior every 6 seconds he can never win. Also because Celestial Elixer is an over time effect you could skip one application of it and use<BR>Complete Heal instead, then start over having only lost 1.6 pulses of Celestial Elixer.<P>----snip----<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi as a class we're not the most vocal. We've endured the Hate fiasco, the Donal's nerf and now you guys come up with this.<P>I remember a great discussion about what would be nice to help each class. A lot of good ideas were put forth. <P>Then after a great discussion which I'll admit I had a lot of hopes for we get slammed with the Donal's nerf. Ok we can agree it was overpowered so fine nerf it. Next the Hate/Aggro disaster, well we knew it was broken. Took you guys 3 weeks to believe us but thats normal. <P>Now we come to today's feature, the PoG BP nerf. /sigh What happened to all of the constructive posts? What about all of the ideas? <P>You'd think after the two previous nerfs it was enough. How about instead of rendering something which I blew huge faction and tons of hours for you do something constructive? How about a diferent effect? Something like oh I dunno, self invis maybe? Please don't just destroy it and tell us all we did was a complete waste of time.<P>Lunason Celestium<BR>56 Cleric<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, for the love of...Clerics med at about 28 mana per tic at 60.  CH costs about 350 mana per cast averaging in spec.  Clarity II (which a cleric basically always has) adds like 12 mana per tic.  So the cleric meds at 40 mana per tic, and can cast a CH every 9 tics.  On the warrior I group with, a closely cut CH heals about 5000 hp.  Following still?  CH, the spell Velious was DESIGNED AROUND that cannot, by definition, be overpowered (unbalanced vs other classes, yes, but not overpowered, which is relative to the environment)...will let a warrior and cleric kill any mob that does less than oh...250 damage per tic.<P>If that cleric has a difficult to get bp, that number raises to 300 hp per tic (more with supplemented heals, so maybe 350).  What's your POINT?  A warrior with crap armor would take 3x the damage our's does...why can't our cleric heal at even 1.3x the rate?  Are you so hellbent on giving casters and priests NOTHING to look forward to, that their items are NOT allowed to improve their performance?<P>Gathu the Tactician, Xegony.<P>PS:  Someone at Verant please print out the guide to mudwimping...the URL is http://www.best.com/~tenarius/mudwimping.html<P>Got it?

You say one thing and then do another, yet you want us the consumer to trust you?  <P>You, Verant, didn't plan on people getting to Sleepers tomb as soon as they did, therefore exposing the unfinishedness of the zone.  Same with VT, same with PoM.  Now that people are in these zones, VI is scrambling to do everything in thier power to gauge the game to be more difficult for the player becuase certain people, "beat the game", too soon.<P>Sounds like sore loosers to me.  <P>TO honestly tell us any of this is inaccurate would be hypocritical.<P>Drin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As with the Donal's BP, I agree this one also needed to be nerfed.  With that in mind, the question is how to do it, and, since I supported completely changing the Donals BP effect to something useful, rather than nerfing its effect to the point of uselessness, it would be inconsistant for me to object to this approach here, ......As long as the _option_ to switch the nerfed BP for the new drop in that location is given to those who currently have the BP.  They worked hard to get an item, only to have it heavily nerfed....They should not suffer for Verant's lack of foresight.<P><BR>No, as to how to nerf the items.  Obviously, the goal is to slow down the casting frequency.  The obvious solution (increased recast time) is apparently not an option at this time for coding reason.  The approach being taken (increased casting time) is a bad one because, in addition to preventing rapid casting of the BP effect, it effectively prevents the caster doing anything else either.  The question is....Is there any way to slow down recast without immobilizing the caster?  The buff icon of the Donal's BP was one approach, but it was disliked due to the shortage of available buff slots in raid situations.  <P>However, the spell effect on this BP already creates a buff icon.  Since I dont doubt that these changes are already being made, and late opinions are irrelevant, this is prob pointless, but....Why not change the spell effect to a new spell that Heals identically to the Cel Healing effect for the same duration as cel healing,but has a persistant effect which lasts for one minute.  Because a buff slot must be open for the Cel Heal, a need for a buff slot is not a factor.  By making it a persistant effect on the recipient, the caster is not immobilized for 1 minute while casting and can resume medding after casting.  This should solve the stated problem (chain casting on a tank) while keeping the item useful.<P>BTW:  Based on the description of the fixes to healing aggro, it sounds like you did in fact listen to the specifics of our complaints.   Whether the changes will fix the problems or not remains to be seen, but thank you for reading and addressing the problem.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, you ARE aware that 300hp in 6 seconds is an absolutely rediculously low amount of damage for anyone actually wearing these BPs?<P>Example: Velketor. Hits faster than every 3 seconds. Quads for 850. That's 6800 damage, if not more, every 6 seconds.<P>Statue of Rallos Zek: Doubles for 1250, at about the same rate. That's 5000 damage every 6 seconds.<P>The way these mobs are, the ONLY way to keep a primary tank alive is to have a rolling chain of cheals on that tank, every few seconds. Even a fully buffed warrior with defensive can BARELY take 2 rounds of hits from Velketor. That means you have to be hitting the tank with a cheal roughly every 5 seconds. That means a cleric must be casting a cheal on the tank before the tank even enters combat, if you want that tank to live.<P>Even with the slight improvement of hate you're doing on test, do you have any idea what levels of hate clerics are getting up to? That cleric who has to do that first cheal on the tank is GOING to die, there's nothing you can do, as there is NO way to build up enough aggro in 5 seconds to overcome the new hate impact.<P>I realize this may not be a big issue for you, but with all the healing nerfs going on, you are loosing your highest end players in droves. I know an entire guild, one of the best in EQ, Da`kor, who really don't play any more. My own guild has lost likely at least 2 clerics, and more are teetering.<P>You put mobs out there that are rediculously overpowered, balanced them based on the original hate method and using donals BPs, and now you have vastly nerfed clerics AND the Donals BPs, yet the mobs are still the same. We are supposed to beat these? HOW?<P>These changes have made one fundamental difference in EQ, beyond what I have mentioned: They've destroyed almost all the FUN to it. When half your cleric pool dies every single even remotely difficult fight (like, say, every single Wurm in the testing halls in the TOV), and you have to continually be CRing, rezzing, rebuffing, etc. It's not fun any more. It's work. And for uncertain and little reward, especialy in those testing halls, as to finish ANY quests, you have to kill Dozekar, who was grotesquely overpowered before the nerfs, and is pretty much unkillable now.

</FONT><HR>A mob that does not have the potential to do 300 damage per 6 seconds shouldn't be able to beat a high level player (the ones being healed by those Bps). I myself can do 300 melee damage in 6 seconds. That is a really bad way to justify the nerf.<P><BR>If you really want to make Clerics rejoice:<P>Change the effect to Aegolism. Maybe make the casting time 2X the normal cast time of the spell, with a per target recast delay like the CH bp nerf, to prevent chain casting on one person as a heal. And allow the clerics with the old CE Bp to trade them in to Gms for the "fixed" ones.<P>That is what you call compromising, you give a little, and you take a little.

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>I don't usually post... I'm pretty disappointed by this (and the other) recent changes. Something I don't get:<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; This means of a MOB Can not do more than 300 damage to the Warrior every 6 seconds he can never win<P>I'm a 50 cleric. Most clerics I know who are wearing these BP's are level 55+. Some a little lower, but on average, they're much higher than me.<P>The ONLY mobs that "can not do more than 300 damage in 6 seconds" are green to me at 50. Anything blue is hitting for double (or more frequent) 80-90 per attack minimum. This is at 50, mind you. At 55+ blues are hitting easy for 100-130's minimum, and double or quad attacking, probably casting as well...<P>So are you worried about a high level cleric Power Leveling a low level warrior with this BP? Cause that's the only warrior I can think of that would be taking less than 300 damage per 6 seconds. Of course if they're splitting the damage between multiple tanks...but then, darn, you gotta at least use mana to heal one of them, right? so no indefinite heals there neither... no... Maybe if a Shaman slows the mob... but there's still resists, and mana and strategy still being used in that situation as well... I don't see it Abashi--this nerf is not only bogus, but it's really not necessary.<P>This cleric, you mentioned, who designed the original spells, he wouldn't have happened to have gotten on your bad side lately or something? Does he still work there, or was he fired (perhaps by you, Abashi)? Because it really feels like you've got the live team geared against us clerics lately for some reason. /sigh<P>Even after your pretty thorough description of how these BP's are unbalancing, I still don't see the need to do this really--this breastplate effect allows a cleric to SLOW the damage on mobs of levels FREQUENTLY fought by the clerics old and strong enough to wear them, giving them time to get the *real* heals off.  These same clerics will use the SAME tactic without the breastplate... it'll just cost 300 mana and they'll have to wait till level 59 to use it... I would also think that with a cast time of 20 seconds, using such a breastplate during battle without killing one party member or another would be a matter of superb timing and tactics.<P>By the way, did you consider the fact that MOST clerics aren't healing one warrior fighting a mob that does less damage than 300 in 6 seconds, and are actually healing *an entire group* consisting of a bunch of different classes.<P>Since you're nerfing it anyway, could you give me an example of what mob/setting/situation we're talking about abusing here? Are you saying that one cleric and one warrior can break and hold (mana free), say, the Shroom King in Sebilis with this breastplate or just Flippy Darkpaw outside Qeynos? What's the scenario, cause I can't think of a real and reasonable one that warrents this change.<P>Wow... longer than I expected...<P>I'm really disappointed, and totally dont see the reasoning behind the "this is necessary for the integrity of the game" PR line. I really believe something else is going on here that we're not privy to, nor will we ever be. <P>Vaxiin<BR>Cleric of Innoruuk, 50th Rank<BR>E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What possible point is there to even have an effect on the BP at all?

</FONT><HR>I really fail to see how 300 hp every six seconds is a big deal. Anything that can't do more than 300 dmg in 6 seconds will have no chance of winning against againt good players with or without this breastplate. What, like some trash sebilis frog has a chance against a couple people who know what they are doing? This breastplate does nothing that a cleric couldnt do safer and better by using complete heals on the tank and then medding til it's needed again. The mob still has no chance so I guess it medding wil be nerfed too. I'd really love to see a real example of how this breastplate is overpowered. Abashi's explanation is very silly beacuse trash mobs will always have no chance against decent players.<P>The best use this breastplate had was healing people who were just rezzed so they don't have to sit around with no life and no mana. Basicly it reduced downtime a little. Now that will be impossible. There is absolutely no reason to do this nerf.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"The problem is when you cast it on the tank when he first enters combat and continue to Chain cast it throughout the fight. Because of the low taunt value of Heal over time spells you will not get aggrod on even for chain casting. The casting time WAS 20 seconds. the spell effect lasts 24 seconds. This means the primary tank could have a<BR>CONSTANT flow of 300 HP every 6 seconds for the ENTIRE durration of the fight. This means of a MOB Can not do more than 300 damage to the<BR>Warrior every 6 seconds he can never win. Also because Celestial Elixer is an over time effect you could skip one application of it and use<BR>Complete Heal instead, then start over having only lost 1.6 pulses of Celestial Elixer."<P><BR>Excuse me. Would you please be courteous enough to explain why this very basic math was not applied when the BP was first designed?<P><BR>Also, 300 HP in 6 seconds... mmm... well... that would mean that:<P>a) One cleric per tank<BR>b) Mob do no more than 300 dmg per 6 seconds<P>That just is not happening, unless you are twinking.<P>Either way, it clearly shows serious lack of math skills, foresight and/or testing.<P><BR>Noc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
