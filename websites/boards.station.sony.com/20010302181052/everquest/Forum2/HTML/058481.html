&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Currently in Vellious there are ONE to TWO ways to get class specific armors, depending on what class you play (Rangers, Druids, and Paladins only have ONCE choice). <P>(1) You can go to the Plane of Growth and farm armor all day long (unless you are a Paladin Druid or Ranger) and get your armor.<P>(2) You can quest in one of the three cities for your armor.<P>I'm SURE when Verant put this on paper, it looked WONDERFUL. I'm sure high-fives were exchanged over the masterful work done by the designers to give players such VAST choices, then, just like almost everything Verant puts on paper and tries to execute in game, it failed TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY.<P>But Furor, WHY doesn't this work? It sounds great... <P>Reader, yes, it sounds great, until you realize what each QUEST requires.<P>Thurgadin armor quests are the easiest of the quests to complete yet easily 100x more difficult than simply enterring the Plane of Growth and farming class armors. In order to complete a piece of armor in Thurgadin, one must kill Kromzek - these are level 52 and above giants that spawn either in the arena or in King Tormax's chamber. Just to get a PIECE of armor is rare enough, unfortunately there is FAR more to the questing process. I will go into this more when I describe the other two cities and their respective quests.<P>If you are allied with Giants and have high enough faction with King Tormax (a chore that takes at least a weeks time to raise high enough) you can do Kael armor quests. The Ancient Armors that are required for Kael quest armros drop in the Temple of Veeshan. This is a zone that words simply cannot do justice to in describing. It is TOTALLY bugged in regards to pathing, mob AI (mobs are untauntable completely 100%), and worst of all almost ANY mob in there would kill anything in the Plane of Growth (where class armor actually DROPS, no quest required) within 20 seconds. Add to this the rarity of actually aquiring Ancient Armor and you have a problem.<P>Lastly we have Skyshrine Armor quests. If you are allied with Lord Yelinak and have proper faction (again, something incredibly mundane and difficult to raise) you can participate in these armor quests. You are asked to bring back Unadorned armor pieces to the quest givers in Skyshrine. Unadorned drops in ONE place and one place only, the Temple of Veeshan. Not ONLY that, it drops in the Testing Halls of the Temple of Veeshan. ANY mob in the Testing Halls would wipe the floors with ANY mob in the Plane of Growth (some would wipe the floors of Tunare herself) within seconds.<P>SO, to summarize, the three cities have the FIRST part of their armor quests drop in three very difficult areas. As IF this wasn't bad enough, the quest armors ALL require gems. The gems for certain parts of armor drop with some frequency, enough so that one would be able to reasonably complete their piece of armor within a few days once the primary armor piece was obtained - HOWEVER, the gems for the Tunics are SO rare that not ONE breastplate/tunic for any class has yet to be completed on my server (Veeshan). My guild, arguably the most powerful and resource heavy guild in all of Everquest has a total of THREE Flawless Diamonds, TWO Pristine Emeralds, and THREE Black Marbels. These are the gems that are required to make tunics. Each TUNIC requires THREE of said gems. Since Velious open, the most resource heavy guild in EQ has obtained enough gems to make TWO breastplates/tunics. TWO! Meanwhile, we could spend ONE day in the Plane of Growth and farm five tunics - ONE DAY. Add to this that Paladins, Rangers, and Druids CANNOT even go to the Plane of Growth for their armors and you can see that this is a major issue.<P>Was it the intention of this company to make the entry of armor from quests SO rare that the ratio of PoG class armors to quested armor was literally 500:1? Is there a concrete reason for this? We have seen the armor pieces, they range from identical to Plane of Growth pieces to MARGINALLY better.<P>My request: Increase the armor drops for ALL quested armor significantly and Increase the gem drops for ALL quested armor significantly. ESPECIALLY taking care to increase the drop rate of tunic/breastplate gems 10 fold.<P>Oh, and if you were wondering where tunic gems come from, they come from, again, mobs that would decimate mobs in the Plane of Growth in under a minute.<P>Furor Planedefiler<BR>www.firesofheave.net<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Along the same lines it appears that killing dragons is heavily encouraged since they seem to have the best drops.  So you can be friends with dragons and do their long, torturous, and complex quests, or just genocide their kind and get lots of neat stuff.  Which do you suppose most people will choose?  Now add to that how hard it is to get dragon faction up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I went along and helped the guild get gems today in Sirens Grotto.  I was there for the better part of six hours.  In that time one, maybe two (I can't remember) gems dropped.  <P>Acquiring the armor pieces in Temple of Veeshan and then the gems in Sirens Grotto/Velkator's Lab/ThurgB is vastly more difficult and time consuming than making a day trip to POG.<P>This is not a call to nerf Plane of Growth drops.  This is a plea to increase the drop rates of armor pieces and gems.  Perhaps increasing the quality of quested items (primarily Kael and Skyshrine quests) to be more in line with the risk v reward.  <P>If you have ever made a trip to Temple of Veeshan, you know what a nightmare that place is.  Hell, the journey getting there can sometimes cause more death and disaster than a trip to POG.  The extra effort should be rewarded.  <P><BR>Nino McHammer<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

An entire day in the halls of testing in Veeshan's Temple; NOT ONE SINGLE PIECE OF LOOT AT ALL.   NO UNADORNED, JACK SQUAT.  Dunno bout Kael quests, im alligned with Dragons.<P>My suggestion.  Up the drop rates in VT a TON.  PLEASE!  The mobs there are so hard, they pale in comparison to anything else sides maybe Sleepers (Dozorek could probly wipe anything in sleepers cept maybe the Sleeper himself}.

Where is the risk vs. reward logic in this?<P>Why quest when you can farm complete sets in a day or two of Growth? As if to add insult to injury, the Growth armor is arguably easier to obtain that pieces of pre-Kunark/Velious planar gear.<P>Yes, the quest armor pieces and gems should have their drop rates increased significantly. But in addition, I'd think it only fair to reduce the AC and stats of the Growth armor by a large margin. This stuff is easier to obtain than original planar armor, and therefore should be better than said original planar armor by only a fraction AT BEST.<P>I'm sick and tired of seeing complete morons walk into Growth equipped in accordance with their skills and walking out equipped like gods.<P>~Millie Angelfire~<BR>[Veeshan Server]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Trivial mobs drop loot for gimps who could not kill Trakanon in their wildest dreams.<P>They talk of how my Donal's BP somehow threatens the balance of the game with a 30 sec CH (which I almost never use) ... and yet there's a zone where BETTER armor drops like bronze in unrest for people who can barely handle Fear.  PoG is 1000x more unbalancing to the game in the short-term than Donal's BPs will EVER be.<P>Fix PoG to cater less to farmers.  Fix the quests so that the people who earn their armor are rewarded for killing mobs which are far more difficult than PoG.  Fix the gem drops so that you don't have to endure endless hours of killing in zones like Siren's Ghetto and Velketor's Labyrinth in order to get a single gem (let alone 3 of that same gem).<P>--Xy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The quest designer (assuming its not either a trained monkey or a random number generator) really ought to realize that folks would actually like to do these quests.  Sure, some individual pieces might be particularly hard.  But to make the entire set depend upon random drops from mobs that the uber-guilds have trouble with, is just stupid.<P>And it's too bad that Rangers and Paladins got stuck along with us Druids on the "screw 'em cause they solo" kick.

</FONT><HR>Couldnt agree more<P>Im a 57th ranger.<P>No armour in PoG, 1 quest that involves killing giants which i can't do because;<P>My guild and i are aligned with giants only, yet with "only" 30 players averaging 56th level i have no chance of killing the mobs in VT needed to get armour pieces, yet would be able to hunt some of the Kael drop pieces. VT mobs are insanely tough and kill-able by a *tiny* percentage of all EQ players on all servers.<P>The faction issues in Velious simply dont work at high level, every class/race needs to be able to chose one faction in order to be able to complete quests yet that cant be done as mobs that need killing require entire guilds to do so. There might be a guild out there with 30-40 dorf killers, 30-40 giant killers and 30-40 dragon killers but that is an extreme requirement in order to be able to complete quests for all classes/races.<P>Every faction choice should have equal amount of realistcally completeable quests for each race/class. As a guild we have to choose 1 faction to align ourselves with, that choice ends up screwing over people within my guild, a different choice would ruin it for others. The mobs require a guild to kill... <BR>Its catch22. A lose/lose situation.<P>Gems must be made less rare.<P>Kael armour parts should drop in high level dorf and dragon areas, not just VT. Dorf armour parts should drop in high level giant and dragon areas and the same applies to dragon armour parts. The quests shouldnt be any easier (in terms of mob toughness and the force and organisation required to take them down) but they should be so rare and in the case of Kael, soley in VT which is completley inaccessible to most, totally untested, bugged and insanely difficult.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The increased skill caps and spells for SK's and Pally's, as well as healing for shaman/druids are necessary.  I'm sure FoH has all you need, but you guys ain't the majority (of even a single percentage point) of the player base.  I'm sure you guys have passed over and blown off hybrids (but a select few) and have twinked up clerics for your epic encounters, but the rest of us would like to play the game and were prevented.
