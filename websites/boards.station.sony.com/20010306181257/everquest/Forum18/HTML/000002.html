</FONT><HR>This is a re-post, in short form, from the pre-wipe boards.  Trayler is a Warrior who used to be a member of Sanguine Psyche Fellowship, but appears to have been booted.  Do Not Trust Him.  He will scam you and not live up to his bargains.  Get all payments up front, and do not do him any favors for he will use it against you.<P>Another member of SPF, Jihahd, also should be avoided for his general anti-social behavior around the Frontier Mountains, especial at the Fortress.  His running buddy Rinbil is of the same ilk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not 42, never lived in Phelan.  Been through there, but that's it.  42 is just my "lucky" number, and I like the word.  Someone once told me it was Gaelic for wolf, but I think that's wrong.  I still like the word though.

</FONT><HR>Recently observed Jihahd back at Frontier Mountains.  He is in a new guild now, but can't remember the name.  He pulled a train of about 5-7 MG's out of the Fortress, and trained them right into my group.  Caused the death of two of us.  He claimed that someone trained them on him, but that did not excuse his pulling them right into us.  As he'd been fighting next to us on prior pulls, and was chatting up our enchanter, there was absolutely no excuse for his action.  He escaped, while two of us died.  Pretty lame.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I frequently still call girls "love" and use other similar britishisms.<P>Is Phelan "wolf" in some dialect that you are familiar with?  I'm not familiar with battletech.  I picked it up because something I read said that it was Irish, but my Irish dictionary says it is "mac tire" or "faolchu."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

He goes by another name too, tho I cant remember what it was.

</FONT><HR>What Cleric site, Lenia?  I'd be interested in the stories about Trayler.  I saw him online the other day, and he is now guildless again.  I think he's been through three since he was part of SPF.  <P>I'm glad you had a decent experience with Jihahd.  From what I've heard, he's good to people in his own group, but a pain in the butt to everyone else.  He seems to think that he owns every mob he sees.  <P>His buddy Rinbil tried to KS me the other day in WC on some wisps.  I was hunting for MQ pelts while trying to improve tailoring, and saw a stack of wisps.  I cast a AE on them, and all three go running off.  While I'm swinging at the first, Rinbil ran by and wacks on the other two.  Thankfully, my AE had done 3/4 damage to them, so he didn't get the kill.  When I called him on it, he claimed he thought he was saving me from getting killed.<P>A couple of points:  I'm a L35 druid in wolfform, 10 wisps couldn't have bothered me, which was patently obvious.  Also, all three were running from me, and were down to 20-25% health.  What was there to fear?  Finally, he paused at both of them that he killed, clearly trying to loot.

</FONT><HR>And Jihahd is now a member of Aurora Infinitum.  At level 47 he was bottom feeding at the MG Fort in Frontier Mts.  Kept pulling trains, and when they'd get too big for him, he'd just pull them into other groups.  Since he hadn't hit any of the trailers in the train, they'd pick other targets of opportunity.  He did it to us twice, in 10 minutes.  Then acted all indignant when we called him on it.  The twerp even ran his train right in front of two groups in front of the entrance.  With all the space in FM, the only reason to pull there is to drop off on other groups.

</FONT><HR>Trayler is no longer a member of Ne Plus Ultra.  Spoke to Tidan this morning, and they had ditched him last night.  Reputation counts.  They'd heard horror stories about him before I got to them.<P>I've seen Oddjobb at the MG Fort before.  Never had a problem with him.  Grouped with him once or twice.  Knew what he was doing, and was a good player.<P>And I agree with ya Shardmoon, the MG Fort is a mess.  Way too many people grabbing mobs, and that gate makes things even worse.  Easy to make mistakes there.  I've tagged a couple people here based on their conduct at the Fort, but that's been after multiple encounters.  One encouter is generally not sufficient.  Folks like Jihahd, Rinbil and Trayler, have earned their bad reputations based upon multiple bad acts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tommy/Vaalik:  If you'd been at the Fort Monday, you would have seen lots of bad conduct by Jihahd.  He was pulling trains right through a couple of groups, for the sole purpose of dropping off the extra's.  What the heck is a 47 Ranger doing bottom feeding at the Fort any way?  And it's not like he can kite more than one, so why is he running around with so many giants after him?  Dropping his extra's off on other groups, who were resting after some serious fights, is just plain wrong.  Pulling a train right past the gate, during two laps of the combat zone, can only be intended to drop off stragglers.  There could be no defense of that conduct, and he was getting chewed out by everyone around him for doing it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I have to say, is that, I was that enchie Jihahd was chatting up. lol=) Hes a good guy trust me, I know him very well.  Sometimes, he makes bad pulls but yes, we all do. He never does any of it on purpose; I promise you that. If you noticed that all the remarks about him that were bad stationed only around the MG fortress in FM. I think the problem with this is... everyone likes to sit right in front of the fortress to hunt. So, if he makes a bad pull... they run into other groups... Right outside the Fortress. And I have seen this happened With many different pullers... If a group was sitting too close.  Maybe, if everyone would back up a bit... No more trains would happen. =)<P>From what I have seen, having hunted with him since April, that hes a good guy and knows his character well. Sometimes mistakes happen... But they happen to everyone. If you noticed, theres only one guy complaining about him on here... I personally know that there are a lot of people who love Jihahd and who know that he is one awesome ranger.<P>As for rinbil, I have hunted with him many times as well... And have never seen him do anything wrong. I feel that these guys are getting blaime for things that just arent their fault. <P>And as for the pulls on Monday at FM Fortress I was there with him for a little while. He was kiting that one MG, and trying to save my little butt. I know he had no intentions to drop them off on you. Personally, I feel that Everyone just needs to back up. There are way too many groups in a bit little space. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No, I did not ensnare a second MG that Jihahd had and claimed it was trained on us.  Every time I picked up a few from him, I was medding in my group, and had the MG start whacking on me.  I didn't cast on any MG's, as I was acting as the healer in my group.  Neither snare nor anything else.  Perhaps the ranger in my group snared it, but only after it was pounding on me, their healer.<P>No, we weren't camped right in front of the entrance, but at the base of the hill.  He was the one that was camped at the corner of the fort, and kept grabbing pulls from others when he'd chase down his MG into the gate.  He wasn't assisting any one at the time he was dropping trash on my group, he was sitting there by himself.  <P>Sure, he didn't make a bad pull on purpose, but his method of escaping the bad pull sure was purposeful.  That's a shame that he picked up three instead of just one, but that doesn't give him the right to come pull them through the middle of us.  He knows where the zone line is too, has snare and SoW and Root.  He can escape just fine without trashing another group, but he chose to take the easy way out on several occasions.<P>I'm glad you guys were able to listen to his side of the story while the events were transpiring, without actually seeing what was taking place.  That's really neat.  It also means you don't know squat about what happened.  <P>"Hey guys, I just accidentally picked up three MG's.  I think I'll pull them through the middle of this group of low 30's next to me.  That's the ticket!"  Like he's really gonna admit to you guys this is what happened.<P>And no, I don't need to look for things to complain about.  There's plenty of actual idiocy around without me having to go make stuff up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Binxs:  I'm sorry you are late to the show here.  I wasn't rude to Jihahd thereby creating his anti-social behaviour.  Jihahd and Rinbil kept accusing my entire group of KSing, when we had pulled the mob from the gate.  It seemed that if he'd seen it, it was his.  Jaeden was part of the group that this occurred in.  He actually KS'd from us once in another of his silly claims that he saw it, so it was his.  He and Rinbil then trained us on purpose when we stood up for ourselves.  This was several months ago.<P>Jihahd, then trained another group of mine over Labor Day.  He did it more than once, before I ever said a word to him.  And it wasn't accidental because it happened more than once, when he knew exactly where we were camped.<P>I'm glad that I know you sanction training.  I will be sure to let all the other guilds I know that you, as the guild leader, encourage this type of activity in response to something as subjective of whether someone was being rude.  I don't have a short fuse, but I do respond when people act badly.  I understand stuff happens and mistakes are made.

As we all now know, he has no friends, and rightly so.  When I met him, he was auctioning a Yak and a Mithril Staff.  Yet for 3.5 hours of powerleveling, all he paid me was 50plat.  I'm a trusting fool and should have cut the deal before powering him, but he suckered me.  The surprising thing is I still see him playing, and as a mid 30's warrior, he's got to be in a group, so people are trusting him.  I've visited where he was when I could find him and warned the groups, but it's rare that I find him.
