</FONT><HR>Lets clear some misconceptions up.<P>55th druid.  Snare kiting, root/dot/med, quad-kiting, if its a solo technique, I have it down pat.  I'm also adept at grouping.<P>When soloing, the _only times I will die is if I:<P>* lag out.  This will kill you no matter what, solo or group.  And of course its never the server's fault.<P>* Screw up, say by snaring myself.  When you fubar like that you have no one to blame but yourself.<P>* tag a mob, and find out it was higher level than you thought, and summons you, and for whatever reason gate didn't get off.  One reason I don't like soloing in SF.<P>Soloing before the DoT nerf, after, and with this recent snare/root change, is extremely safe.  And extremely efficient.  And can be boring, thank Karana for /gu.  Needless to say, I rarely if ever die when solo, and gain exp at a much greater rate than grouping.  And lets not talk about raids.<P>The official veRant line, how soloing was too safe prior to the DoT nerf, is correct.  However, all the DoT nerf did was _slightly slow down the lower level players, for whom root isn't as reliable.  For higher level players, the DoT didn't do much, just forced a slight change from single kiting to root/dot/med.  And why single kite, when you can quad?<P>The snare/root change is great for all snare capable classes in a _grouping_ situation.  It has little effect on my druid _soloing.  This is the change that took all the risk out of root/dot/med:<P>/sit off<BR>/cast 4<P>My stand&root hotkey.  With that, I root, dot, back off to the range needed to get a root cast before the mob reachs me and med.<P>The snare/root change adds little to that.<P>As for soloing in dungeons, the good spots to do this tend to be taken 24/7, due to the extreme crowding at the 45 to 60 levels, on Bristlebane there seems to be at _least on 45+ character to every 35-.<P>For those that claim soloing is worthless at higher levels, go tell that to my 59th druid guildmate, who spent more time solo than not post 50, and did it _very quickly.<P>So, Absor, your reply simply reinforces veRant's disconnect with its player base.  We may be in your world now, but you aren't in the same one we are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;The REAL benefit of this fix, in my opinion, is actually that it minimizes the damage done by idiots who root snared mobs in dungeons. Invariably, there will be someone who does not realize the benefits of snare and thus roots the mob I've already snared. When root breaks, the mob gets away and it brings back 23904 of its closest friends. This is usually followed by the idiot who rooted demanding to know why the heck I didn't snare. :P Then I have to choke him and that's unfortunate. As a grouping druid, I am thrilled about this change.&lt;&lt;<P>Sorry guys, but Sarra hit the nail on the head.  We have already been using the Root + DoT method since Verant fixed our roots.  There is no *need* for a druid to snare his prey first when soloing if using Root + DoT.  I soloed fine last night with no snare and plenty of Root + DoT.  =)<P>This change really only affects druids in a group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First poster: Peeved class envy bard <BR>Anyone who agrees with him: hasn't played a HEF Druid with 90 base wis and no ubergear...<P>Ok. 51 druid with about 120 days played here...<P>This does nothing to affect kiting. This is a change to how two spells relate to each other, and an enhancement to the game to promote grouping. <P>Let me point out the obvious here that the class envy posters are missing: <P>1. Have you ever played a druid? Do you know how infuriating it is to be the primary snarer to prevent runners from grabbing all their relatives and coming back en masse and opening a can of whoopit on you, and some ranger uses Ebony Blades and breaks your snare?<P>2. Have you ever been grouping in Rathe Mtns taking down HG's and the cleric keeps rooting the HG you snared?<P>3. Have you ever done Karnors, where one runner can clear the castle of all players by simply going back for relatives, and some goober passes by and roots a mob you snared?<P>4. Have you ever played the Green Room in Blackburrow as a youngun and have the same thing happen? <P>If you can answer yes to any of these questions, then you have no business saying that this change needs to be undone. If you aren't a druid or a ranger or any other class that can "snare" type effect that is changed by this, you have no right piping up and saying a word, because you just don't know what it's like. <P>Anybody that tells me "kiting is risk free" is also showing their rear... ever had a mob green to you by sayyyyy 20 level resist a snare and root 6 times in a row? Ever heard of Porcupining as a 'kiting' technique? I've lost levels kiting in my teens. I've never had the stupidity to run for a half hour to kite a red... that's just plain idiotic.  After quad kiting four blues i'm down for 15 mins on my butt doing nothing if I want to go that route. BOORRRING... Plus, with the group xp modifiers they're going to be implementing and zone adjustments, just who is going to be "nerfed" by this? The solo kiting folks... and not just DRUIDS... Wizzies, Enchanters, Necros are also affected... <P>Walk a mile in my shoes people... and stop being so petty when something good happens and you don't think you got enough of it!  <P>I hope you negative nancies out there that think this is a bad thing get killed a few times because of a rooter overriding a snarer, that'll change your mind quick.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just to support the druids, my druid secondary has been successfully using root/dot ever since level 24 (Ensnaring Roots), which was well before this patch.  Being able to ensnare a rooted mob will make it a little safer, but it was already pretty darn safe.<P>Druids have lots of solo techniques available to them, and some people seem to be combining them in their minds.<P>- Snare, run away, and nuke.  This is kiting in its simplest form but gives you no med time, so your full mana bar needs to be sufficient to kill the mob.  It is possible to run away and med for 1-2 ticks, run away, etc, to regain mana, but I only did that when things went wrong.<P>- Root/DoT.  Druids have been able to do this ever since they fixed druid roots to do damage prior to rooting.  Before that fix, druid roots would break themselves way too often to be useful.  The technique is to either snare the mob to lead it to a better location or just root it, stack your DoTs on it, then sit down and med.  Many months ago they made it so we get messages when spells wear off, which helped root/dot tremendously.  Being able to keep a rooted mob snared is nice but hardly integral to the tactic.<P>- Quad kiting.  Ensnare up to 4 mobs and then blast em with AE spells.  Very efficient, tons of exp fast, root has no part in this strategy.<P>- Fear kiting.  Animals only, same principle as necro fear kiting, but druids don't do it very often due to the lack of animals in lots of zones.<P>- Porcupining.  This is where you buff yourself up, damage shield yourself, and melee the mob while it kicks its own ass.  Back off as necessary to heal if you can't channel through its hits.  Add DoTs if desired, root not necessary.  It surprised me that this works but it does, even at high levels.<P>Druids can even charm animals and use them for their dirty work but animal distribution isn't very good and if the charms wear off fast it would have been more efficient to use a different method.<P>But no druid uses dots when kiting (at least, no druid who is aware of the dot penalty from movement) because it's a big waste of mana.  Level 34 drones of doom is 141 mana for 340 damage, but if the monster moves and only takes 66% damage, it becomes 141 mana for 224 damage, which sucks.  Better to use the level 29 nuke combust, which is 110 mana for 182 dmg.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Oh yeah, I think I used it once kill some ice Giants.<P>Other than that I prefer the good old quad kite.  Nothing is more mana effecient than 1908 damage for 250 mana.  At 54 I have been quading the Wyverns in Cobalt scar with great success.  The Raptors in Timorous deep are good also.<P>BTW root/dot only works well vs. melee type mobs. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would first like to point out severel things.<BR>1) Druids/ necros use to snare/ dot as a tactic to gain solo exp.  Just as there are many tactics people us.  Root/ DD, fear/ pet, snare/ dd, etc.<BR>After the nerf to the way dots worked on moving creatures, all we as druids did was switch to a more mana efficient way of kiting. It didn't make sense to cast a dot on a snared mob just for it to do 2/3rds its damage, when for the same amount of mana, you could do more damage just by dding them.<P>2) When the dot change was made, many druids use the root/ dot tactic.  So what, its another tactic that is used so we can enjoy a game and gain exp. The change that is now provided, will make me so much more likely to use my snares in dungeons, mages may use one of their best pets in groups and not hear from your local wizard "if your pet kills my snare one more time, your out" message, etc.  And as most know, there is nothing more frustrating then having your snare brake, and have the mob run off causing a train.<P>Do I as a druid get more exp by snaring/ rooting/ doting then warrior/ tank type or another non-soloable class?  no  By the time I mem between pulls, a party of 6 can pull 6 mobs, in effect giving approximatly the same amount of exp.  And now with the group exp rules in effect, I don't think this concern you all have with druids/wizards/ necros etc being able to snare/ root kite should be a concern.

Quad kiting is not affected.<P>All that is affected is rooting, regardless of whether you DD or DoT while rooting.  The bug makes DD rooting work exactly the same as before the patch.  Root, DD, mob comes running at full speed, re-root, repeat.  (Yes, druids and other rooting classes use this tactic.)

</FONT><HR>Druid: 52 to 54 in 49 hours played.  54 to 55 in 28 hours played. Oh yea, all solo and was done by quad-kiting, snare/AE DD tactic and before this little patch.<P>Why do I mention this?  Because I see alot of posts whining about this changes the game for druids.  Hardly the case at all.  It saves us up to a couple hundred mana, at best, a kill and makes it a little safer to Root/DoT/med.  That is all this change does.. we just have to snare once, instead of reapplying it several times and we get to med a little bit safer.<P>Yes, it is a nice change, but as you can see, Druids can still level faster Quad-kiting.  Wizards are even better at it and I believe that bards may be better quad-kiters than druids, too.<P>This is such a non-issue people, try playing more instead of whining in forums about unimportant crap like this, that you aren't even well informed about unless you have at least a 39+ druid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, this patch is heaven for my druid. No more risk at all when root/dotting a target. I ensnare it (11 minute duration), which lasts the whole fight then root safely without caring if the target resists or root breaks early. <P>Using root/dot I can typically solo a high hp target like kunark Forest Giant Ancients while medding and typically use less  than 30% of my mana after the fight. The ability to stack snare means zero risk. <P>If I were a necro it would be even better. Full damage on a rooted target + I keep it snared and get to stack one more DoT if I so choose. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i have noticed something and i am wondering if anyone else has too. i play a 35th necro on E'ci and i use the new root change with darkness (because of the snare effect in addition to the DOT). to my knowledge, darkness has a set duration, unlike a druid's snare (or so i beleive a druid's snare works), so technically, even if root breaks, darkness should stay on the mob up until it's usual duration expirees. i have noticed now that when i cast root on a mob, when it breaks, it often drops the darkness also at the same time. <P>any other necromancers noticed this?<P><BR>~Daemonwolf Bonecrafter -35th Circle Necrocromancer<BR>~Coravix Starcaller -34th Circle Warrior<BR>~Areth -15th Circle Druid<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LordJarek, that's a bug that should be fixed with the next patch.  As for druid snare/ensares, they are fixed duration, and ensare is the longest lasting snare in the game.  Even though I do play a druid, I do agree that this change makes kiting Monsters much easier. Pre patch, The highest I could kite was MAYBE level 45, before I would run OOM.  Nowadays, I am kiting level 49 (gorgul Paclock in BW) with no troubles, although the time it takes is upwards of 20 minutes.  I can finish with about 50% mana.  Personally, I like the root not canceling sow change, but I agree with the original poster, root should cancel snare (I'm going to get flamed for that one, already know it).<P><BR>Sal, 51 Wanderer, Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>thank you Salicia, i thought it might be a bug considering it occurs too often to not be, but i wasn't sure if it was deliberate or not. it also helps to know the effects of snare for when i am grouped.<P>and while i agree that from an RP perspective, it might make sense that root would overwrite snare (both spells supposedly involve plants entwining the victim's limbs and hindering their movement) i don't know that it would make sense for it to overwrite darkness, and i sincerely doubt that Verant is capable (technically) of making the change effect just one of the spells (snare) without mangling the other as well (darkness).<P>as for my fellow neecro, no one said anything about nerfing it, only that it would make more sense from the plant perspective.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046544&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046544&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
