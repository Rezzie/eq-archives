Trotting across the plains of Karana with her scaled wolf close behind, waiting for her commands and getting anxious as it smells humans over the horizon.  Then getting her release to run off, dragging down the farmers in the field before returning to get its mistress's nod of approval.  I make a point of hunting the good aligned creatures; treants, druids, farmers and the rest of them.

Due to his father's nature of running off without notice, Muta never had much of a father figure in his life.  A mischievous child, his mother suggested that he visit the Soldiers of Tunare to keep him busy.  Thus, Muta began to learn the ways of a Druid.<P>While he was a tad foolish when he was young ("Hello Mr. Orc.  How are you?"  *growl*  *runs in fear*), he has wisened up quite a bit.  However, his childish tendancies still can overtake his common sense from time to time ("Hey, griffon, let's go make those guys at the tunnel think you're after me."  *casts Allure of the Wild*).  He holds no grudges against other races or classes as a whole.  Rather, he passes judgement on a person-to-person basis.  However, if someone's tried to kill him, he'll get his revenge sooner or later.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The elder ranger was forced to retire due to a bizarre disease he received from the Bloodsabers which made him allergic to steel. Since the elder ranger was from Surefall Glade, the younger ranger grew to hate gnolls and orcs alike. As his knowledge of the outside world grew, he discovered that the dark elves were assisting the Crushbone orcs in the destruction of his hometown. Therefore, the ranger developed a hatred of dark elves as well, and refuses to help them except in neutral territory (e.g. the Nexus, Plane of Knowledge).<P>His desire to travel and learn new things led to his keen interest in languages. He has mastered several tongues and seeks to learn the few he has not yet heard yet. He is willing to share this skill with others who ask... provided they are not dark elves.<P>He had invested considerable time and money into fletching and other trade skills in the desire to make himself a Faydark Thunderbolt. When he discovered that "his people," as he had viewed them, would not let him construct the items due to his half-human heritage, he was devastated. He now spends much of his time wandering the wilds of Kunark, increasing his skills and plotting for the day he can venture into Neriak to "persuade" the dark elves to leave the Faydarks alone....<P>Alt 1: Iksar Necro<BR>Unlike the cruel, dominating approach many of his kind have towards outsiders, this necromancer believes that his race evolved more from a practical standpoint, and the dominant attitude is a byproduct of their forced isolation. With the discoveries of Luclin and the Plane of Knowledge, he seeks to test this theory by learning as much about other races as possible. He is known for his tendency to take out a book and pen and ask strangers, "So, why do you hate my kind?"<P>His idea of a practical standpoint is often viewed as "evil" by others, but explaining this can be difficult for the young Iksar. For example, he sees the custom of burial to be wasteful, not only of good wood used for coffins, but also for a perfectly viable corpse, which could be animated to perform menial tasks and make life easier.<P>On a constant search for knowledge, he has found an abundant source of interviewees on the moons of Luclin - that and the Vah Shir don't want to kill him instantly. Lately, he has been visiting an area known as the Warrens, near Paineel. Hearing of the Erudites storehouse of knowledge, he hopes to get in their "good" graces so that knowledge can be exchanged.<P>Alt: Troll Beastlord<BR>This troll embraces his cruel nature almost as much as he embraces his warder, whom he refers to as "Snappy." Generally, those around him are viewed as a food source, either to actively kill and consume, or to provide him with what little is left of nearby corpses so he doesn't consume them. In groups, being able to have what remains after all others get what they want is enough to keep him content.<P>His favorite food, actually, are pickles. A handful of these items, regardless of their source, is enough to keep him happy for hours.<P>After the invasion of the Frogloks into his home of Grobb, the troll beastlord has vowed revenge and trains to become skilled enough to kill the frog invaders (and make lots of froglok pickles). As a result, he will never help or group with a froglok, if he can help it. However, he was uncomfortable in Neriak, since he had to resist the compulsion to try and eat the guards. He has since moved to Shar Val, home of the Vah Shir. He doesn't have the same compulsion to eat these noble felines, since he gets terrible hairballs afterwards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

He will not group with the so-called evil races (ogres, trolls, dark elves). However, he did meet an Iksar once before he knew they were evil and the lizard man made a good impression on him, so henceforth he regarded most Iksar as friendly. However, he has now joined a guild that is comprised only of good races, and one of the restrictions of the guild is not to group with evil races, including Iksar. He will still greet and talk with one, but since he honors his guild's practices, he will no longer group with them. To me the best roleplayers play their characters in such a way as to give them personality and substance even to the detriment of their character. That is what I believe makes role-playing a challenge.<P>And since we're on the subject of role-playing, how about anothing RP-preferred server besides FV?

The dismal rage people and opal are indifferent to this and greater good is served by killing that evil priestess!<P>My dark elf cleric I like because she lives in the world in a way that mainly serves her. She is out for number one, which also includes interacting with good sometimes. Due to these interactions she is even despised by the warrior guild at home, which is easily avoided. Through her networking she is now able to interact with all other schools of healing throughout norrath, except for the high elves which have not yet accepted her and the halflings, which never will since they are impossible. She also takes this as open license to kill every halfling she wishes, they are of no use to her.<P>My troll sk of cazic simply doesn't care. She cares about her empty tummy and bashing things.<BR>She doesn't care much about politics, being indifferent to the loss of Grobb since she had moved on from that place long ago feeling she outgrew it. She finds it more convenient to visit her old friends in the first part of the neriak city, noticing that in the move they got brand new spiffy armor (which she finds rather suspicious(you only notice this if you are using old models with velious textures, har!) )<P>So basically they all kind of do what they want, but its roleplayed in different ways. One does what she wants for the cause of good, one for the cause of her own advancement/ease of living, one does what she does based on where she can get good food and lodging the most conveniently and anyone else gets bashed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

He plans on proving his love to her by walking into Riverdale, without invisability and buying her pies.<P>Alt 1 : Wood Elf Druid<P>She's a sly one, bordering almost on the evil side.  She is always looking for ways to trick men into marriage (she actually got married at a raid when someone foolishly used the words "I Do." she then bribed a cleric and said the words herself.  The cleric then pronounced them husband and wife.)  Want some more excitment?  She is apt to stripping when she is bored!<P>Alt 2: High Elf Enchanter<P>An Agnostic Enchanter, she spends most of her time for no reason whatsoever plotting to Overthrow the guild leader of the guild she belongs to.  She makes no attempt to be covert at this, and has quite often had the guildleader come kill her for good measure.<P>Alt 3: Human Paladin <P>She strives to kill ALL evil, but has made the distinction that not all "evil" races are evil.  Her speech is grand and robust, bordering on cheesy comic book superhero.<P>Alt 4: High Elf Cleric <P>A wizard hater for sure.  He will go out of his way to avoid wizards.  If they are in his group he will make sure they know he doesn't like them, and will even let wizards die.  (He doesn't get many wizards in his groups anymore!) He doesn't mind any of the other casters, but wizards just annoy him, always acting like they are better than everyone else.<P>Alt 5: Erudite Necromancer<P>Oh yeah, Paineel made him choose to be either a shadowknight or a necromancer.  So he chose necromancy so he wouldn't have to lug around heavy armor and weapons.  He really wanted to be a dancer tho, so he dances will his pet kills.<P>Alt 6: Barbarian Warrior<P>She hates the dark.  Hates it a lot.  She will drop her offhand weapon while fighting to put in a lantern when it gets dark.  She constantly carries around extras as well ... just in case. And just to add salt to her wounds... she hates being indoors.  She always feels like the walls are closing in on her.<P>Alt 7 : Barbarian Shaman<P>She hates animals, flowers, snow, rain, sun, day.... Ok it might just be easier to list the things she does like:                  . <BR>(Get the idea?  She likes NOTHING)  She won't talk to you, and your better off walking the other way when you see her as she won't tell you she doesn't like you, she will just find a way to speed you to your death.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

She inadvertantly had a hand in her mother's murder (her mother was murdered by the Freeport militia as revenge for her own slaughtering of their forces) Her first marriage ended badly and her current husband is on trial for murder and failing to heed a call for help (he's a paladin) She's distant and difficult to get close to, some would call her cold. In reality she yearns for close friendships, she just doesn't know how to let people in. She has a sense of humor but it's often used only in sarcastic ways.<P><BR>Halfling Druid (Karana):<P>Adopted younger sister of the Human Mage. She's been spoiled her whole life and has never grown up. First her adopted mother spoiled her, then her sister did the same (out of guilt) and now she's under the impression that the whole world loves her. She hides any intelligence she has behind a wall of childish speak and innocence. She's very generous of nature and willing to go to great lengths to help people. She giggles almost constantly and has died her armor a rainbow of colors in an attempt to be "prettiful" Her relationship with her sister is one full of arguments and bickering, but in reality her deepest love is for her sister. She finds males confusing and understands little of "adult" relationships, although she finds herself having a crush on a troll beastlord (this is my favorite storyline, two very childlike characters playing out a romance. It's too cute)<P>Vah Shir Shaman (no god):<P>She is the pet of the druid. Some aspects of her feline background have left her with a rather masochistic nature. She enjoys being injured, bleeding, cannibalizing herself. She often disturbs groups greatly with her seemingly obssessive desire to be injured. Non feline customs both confuse her and intrigue her. She loves males of any species, flirting in her own way with all of them, but would never consider "mating" with anyone but another cat. Monogamous relationships are foreign to her (she's a cat) and she's completely comfortable with the idea of taking many mates and her mates taking many mates.<P>Roleplaying is an aspect of this game that I found rather late (my magician was 55 when I joined a roleplaying guild) but it is an aspect that has kept me playing when I would have quit. I have no roleplay background at all (prior to EQ), but being in a roleplaying guild is like being a part of an ever evolving novel. The characters in this guild have long histories and backgrounds that interweave with each other in ways that make them seem as real as any other person. This group of characters, out of nothing, has created a living world of stories and history that is truly a wonder to behold. It always amuses me when someone challenges roleplaying in EQ. I'm surrounded by some of the best roleplayers in the game every day. There isn't a single thing we can't do while staying in character. Roleplaying isn't dead or impossible in Everquest, not by any stretch of the imagination.<P><A HREF="http://www.lastexodusxev.com" TARGET=_blank>www.lastexodusxev.com</A> (guild homepage)<BR><A HREF="http://www.lastexodusxev.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=incharacter" TARGET=_blank>http://www.lastexodusxev.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=incharacter</A> (in character boards)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

His greatest pleasure is chilling out with his buddies the Othmir in Cobalt Scar, occasionally enjoying a snack of shellfish or clam chowder with them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And I think a cat-Shaman is a very compatible combination from a roleplay point of view.  I think a cat is a very contemplative animal, even if driven by instinct to be a phenominal hunter.  And, from the very little I understand of the various Shaman traditions, self examination and exploration seem to be a very critical to thier role.<P>Additionally, my kitty Shaman has the appearance of a snow leopard.  So I picture her religious beliefs, at least in part, to be based on Buddhism.  Actually, I picture her beliefs to be a combination of Native American Shamanism and Buddhism.  And they seem to me to be very compatible in many of their beliefs as well:  respect for nature, desire for balance in all things, and in many ways a desire for quiet solitude.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

She's vastly more a follower of Bristlebane than a typical Dark Elf.<P>Here's her little bio:<P>Nightseer is an adventurer, a seeker of treasures and amusing times -- and a nice wardrobe. With a wink of an eye, the snap of her fingers, the quick draw of a dagger from her boot, she's ready for action -- be it a hearty bar brawl, a fat purse that begs to be lightened, a bit of mischief to take an arrogant merchant down a notch or two, or taking pity on a fine lad who's in need of a good tumble. (Aren't most fine lads truly in need of a good tumble?)<BR>A queen among thieves, she is a true follower of Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, earnestly seeking all things fun, clever, witty, charming and mischievous. She'll count the cards, find a stray Ace at just the right moment, repair an errant die -- ensuring that, at the gaming tables or in battle, the luck of the draw and the house odds are always in her favor, whether they were meant to be or not.<BR>Contrary to her Dark Elf heritage, she is never truly evil or wicked in her intent, but focused on fun and adventure. She eschews the ways of the followers of Innoruuk, though he is considered the father of the Teir'Dal. Instead, she seeks welcome into the highest -- and lowest -- circles of Norrath, places she can best make use of her unique set of talents (including those of a scantily-clad barmaid or rouge -- amazing what people let slip when they're drinking). And while some consider her no better than a common cutpurse and others fear her growing reputation as an assassin, those who know her best rely upon her loyalty to her friends and her willingness to assist those in need -- especially when that help comes at the expense of the complacent and corrupt.<BR>Hers is a friendship to cultivate and an enemy ill-made. When she's around, no one need fear boredom or a day just like yesterday. Just keep your hand on your purse when she's around -- her hand is far quicker than your eye....<P>I took inspiration for her character from author Anne Logston's character Shadow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
