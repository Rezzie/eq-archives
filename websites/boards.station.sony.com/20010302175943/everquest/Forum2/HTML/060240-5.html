</FONT><HR>Oh yeah...deleveling is a VERY large oversight on your part.  It should be eliminated by limiting the total amount of levels lost to be 3 or something(have you ever, EVER of anyone losing 3 levels by accident?) but still lose exp so getting that exp back is just as hard as it was before.<P>That or delevel skill increases as well as magic resistances along with the players levels.  &lt;--MUCH easier to implement</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Invulnerable healer by levels is a reality that can't be changed.  That or grouping will be SEVERLY limited at higher levels where you can happily group with players 1-10 levels above or below you.<P>Remember that PVP shouldn't affect PvE.<P>Invulnerable healer by race is laughable.  Those servers are supposed to be TEAM servers where TEAMs are divided by race and not by the humans behind the keyboards.  If you want to PVP along side a dark elf and you are a gnome, play on Rallos Zek.  If you don't want to be attacked by a fellow gnome, play on a blue server.  Blah blah blah...yes I am ranting here.  Sorry.<P>A good solution would be to offer a movelog to the teams where one allows xteaming and the other doesn't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A post supporting REZ affects instead of item loot.<P>The problems with item loot have already been clearly detailed.  When you think about it, item loot is really a penalty of time,  the time that a person spent in order to acquire that item.  Why have item loot?  Why not just penalize the time *directly*?  Rez affects do just this.  I believe Rez affects are a viable alternative for the following reasons:<P>1.  All players share the same risk.  (no bagging, no wearing all no drop, no differences based on item necessity for melees)<P>2.  There will be retribution for cheap kills.  With item loot, if you are killed in a less than honorable fashion there is no retribution because the killer wears nothing and risks nothing.  With Rez affects, the penalty for death is unescapeable.<P>3.  Reward.  Items are vital, at least in the perception of the players, to the game.  This is why item loot causes players to go out of their way to exploit the rules in order to receive the reward.  I firmly believe that rez affects (ie. having the offending player be put out of commission for ~30 minutes) is a much more appropriate reward for the killer, and introduces the dynamic of zone control.<P>Concerns:<P>How would the rez affects impact corpse retrieval and therefore corpse decay?  I would not advocate a rez penalty that was so harsh that it would not allow you to retrieve your corpse.  A player should be able to retrieve their corpse (but not have a chance in hell in pvp) while still under the affects.<P>Lastly, a question for Absor.<P>You said this was not a topic where we were likely to see a list.  Does this give an indication as to the amount (or lack of) resources that will be committed to these issues?<P>What of things like Deleveling, where not a single poster is in defense of such a tactic?  <P>There are many differences of opinion in this thread, but there are also many areas of consensus.  I hope the topics of agreement will be heavily considered for implementation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     ---ITEM LOOT AND RISK VS REWARD on RZ---<P>     There is GREAT risk and effort in trying to obtain items like a cloak of flames . . or a cobalt breastplate.  There is ZERO risk in being a random PK and stealing items from other people. <P>     Lets face it, EQ is about items.  People spend hundreds and hundreds of hours to get some of these items and then cant even use them.  Whats the point? The only items people wear on RZ are the no drop items.  <P>     Its really depressing to have to spend so much time and collective effort to get such a dazzling item as a cloak of flames and know that you cant ever safely use it except on a few rare occasions when youre on an isolated large scale raid in one of the few safe lpaces in game like . . plane of sky.<P>     Youd be a fool to wear it exping in seb . . or gating place to place .. knowing that some gate-camping ***** gankeis gonna get lucky and catch you off guard, theres not a thing you can do about these people ..  it happens to everyone, and its totally "unbalanced."<P>     Again . . there is no risk in repeatedly attacking people over and over, camping corpses and zone lines etc etc.  .(social ostricization, yeah right, these people are outcasts to begin with).  There is tremendous risk in fighting uber mobs, organizing large scale raids etc. .  Where is the BALANCE here? <P>     MAKE RZ ITEM LOOT ONLY - it makes perfect sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For all of you saying the way to fix the servers is to make them blue, go back to your blue server and let the people who play on the PVP/PVP-teams servers discuss here.<P>Are there aspects of the PVP environment that could be better?  Yes.  Though I think the major part of what needs to be fixed is the players themselves.  I personally love playing PVP-teams.  It adds to the environment.  Seriously, should a DE necromancer be able to wander around a city filled with human paladins simply because he killed a lot of gnolls or something similar?  Plus you don't have the spam in the affectionately titled "merchant zones" because the control of things like the tunnel in EC changes hands frequently.  My biggest complaint is about the players themselves and some of their definition of cross-teaming.  Humans, gnomes, and dark elves are all different teams, yet if I have a gnome necromancer helping my dark elf enchanter, the human ranger complains to the zone in /shout about the gnome being a cross-teamer for not helping him out.  Hello?  Why for any roleplaying reason would a gnome necro help a human ranger take out a DE, when the gnome needs to be able to get in and out of Neriak?  The game is not purely good vs evil, remember there are 4 teams, not 2.  <BR>My only suggestion is to increase lower level corpse decay time so that corpse camping becomes more of a hassel.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They should help the defender. Or disable PvP in towns.<BR>5) PvP bind should be enabled.

</FONT><HR>***Every person who ever logged on to a race war server..did so because they liked the idea of having war between the races.***<P>I don't know why so many people think this. It's entirely untrue. I came to Tallon from Rallos because of the 16 level pvp range, it had nothing to do with teams.<P>Tallon has created it's own community. There are friendships and alliances formed. By hardcoding the teams, it would destroy the community that TZ has created over the past 1.5 years and force people to sever friendships or leave the server entirely. The people who want hard coding of the teams do so simply because they want an advantage in PvP. The darks are one team, and they're the loudest advocates, as well as the one team guilds who have the most to gain by the teams being hard coded. On Tallon Zek, roughly 70% of the people who play on the server are members of the "light alliance", who regularly group with members of other teams, save darks.<P>Tallon Zek is a "teams" server, but people seem to have different definitions of how the teams should be played. There was or is not a rule stating that the teams cannot cooperate together to get things done. After playing hardcore dark for over a year and now playing in a crossteaming guild, I believe I have an objective oppinion on both sides, and I believe that hard coding the teams will be to the detriment of the server. Our guild has been in existance for about 3 months now, in which time we've killed 3 major dragons and taken down a slew of other uber mobs. This could never be done with a single team. Can the Elven team take down a dragon? Certainly not. Its been stated that EQ is a pve game with pvp as an option of certain servers. That being said, a great deal of people enjoy pve on the pvp servers and would not wish for that aspect of the game to be taken away from them.<P>I like the idea of a Guild War server. I think this is the best option. It would allow friendships to continue, alliances to remain. Of course with this fix there will have to be some work done to fix the major guild war bugs that are prevelant, but I think it would be very worthwhile and would be a great fix for every major problem with Tallon and Vallon Zek.<P>Selphie<BR>Circle Noir<BR>Pandemonium</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Once someone turns gray they stay gray for a brief time (3 minutes or so).<P>2)Put in a small EXP loss for the agressor ONLY, if they die while gray.  Simply put. .  if you wanna start a fight youd better be intent on winning.<P>3)Anyone that attacks a person flagged agressor can do so without themselves going gray.  Anyone that assists an agressor gets flagged gray.<P>     See how simple it really is? See how many problems this solves??<P>Think joe schmoe the random solo loser level 53 wiz is gonna come AE rain your exping group . . 20 times in a row now?

At the same time I recognize that those players that choose to PVP pure teams are at a disadvantage.<P>Here are my suggestions:<P>1) (Optimal solution) Create a Good versus Evil server - allow players who play good versuses evil do a movelog.<P>I ideally, Good versuses evil would be defined in terms of religion; hence, Erudite shadowknights would be able to fight Erudite paladins, or an Innoruk worshiping halfelf warrior could kill a Tunare worshiping halfelf warrior.  If this is not possible, then code light races versus dark races.<P>This is the way EQ should have initially been setup.<P>2) Allow no beneficial buffs on members of a different or your own team outside your plus/minus 8 lvl range.<P>This doesn't completely cure immortal healing, but prevents a lvl 50 from keeping a lvl 20 alive and godbuffed.

</FONT><HR>First off theese discussions are getting too long, Please split the dissusion into quistions conserning player balance and server balance for the individual servers.<P>I only play on Tallon and thus my suggestion are not conserning other servers.<P>I think the biggest problem is the exploit of race based coding on who you can tuch and who you cant. The only sollution to this problem is to code the teams in to the program, thus enforcing teams, or to undo all team coding to have constantly changing player determined teams. If its possible to make satisfactory functioning server with no coding, I dont know.- (Im petty sure that an aggressor fraction hit will be needed though).<P>The problem of coding teams are the lack of development in the teambuilding it causes, no more odd little guilds that tries to spread their ideas, I would miss that with all the color it gives the server.<BR>Another problem with coding the teams are that the current population on Tallon are based on:<P>approx 90% GvE<BR>       8 % intended teams players<BR>       2 % cross teamers<P>So an enforced coding will have at least 10% of the poppulation having their EQ World dramatically changed, I dont think they will hold their tounge, quiet the opposite.<P> If you seriously are going to enforse teams in coding, Please give the largest ammount of players a chance to get their charecters out of Tallon and to some other alternative than the enforced teams.<P>Another problem is deleveling on Tallon (I dont think its a problem at higher levels though), the simple sollution is to have players loose skill points as they loose levels. It will hurt players not deleveling a little bit, but not much I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wont re-hash ideas that i've seen here about the disparity between classes as levels progress as they have been explained in detail.<P>I've played on rallos for a year and a half and my main complaint is grief players who exploit you simply so they can recieve an item. PvP might be about risk vs reward but when one player risks nothing and takes minimal effort with the possibility to gain everything...That just doesn't work. <P>My primary character is a paladin and my gear is my lifeblood. First of all, I can be less effective by a significant margin if key peices of my equipment were lost (haste items specifically). This means I do not gear up unless with a trusted group but that just isn't enough. Exploits, are there, and will be utilized with sole intention of cheating me out of my hard earned gear.  *shrug* I find that unnacceptable.<P>On the flipside if i'm not being exploited but I am fully geared up I spend most of the time i'm being attacked BAGGING the gear I simply cannot afford to lose and that prevents me from being very effective at defending myself, and retaliating.<P>Some tactics commonly used by the grief player are -<P>--Rooting you, then training mobs to aggro on you (using FD or other aggro reducers to accomplish this) and dealing the killing blow or causing XP loss.<P>--Forcing the trade window open to prevent you from taking action while another player lands spell after spell on you (used to be a bug where they could cause LD, think this is taken care of)<P>--Levitating out of a melee's attack range (and archery) and blasting away with no risk to yourself.<P>-- Hiding yourself from view and blasting away from a place anyone without lev can reach.<P>-- Exploiting the guard's bank aggro in a few select banks.<P>-- Any pvp death resulting from a linkdeath from player usable items (spells like lull staff can lag a player to the point of the game either becoming 1- unplayable or 2- generating so much lag on a slower connection they get disconnected or Packetloss becomes unplayable.)<P><BR>These are all ways i have been killed. Some are avoidable (trade window bug) through the interface but i had to learn that the hard way...<P>I for one am in favor of res effects in the stead of item loss just because exploits and bugs exist and WILL be exploited to recieve items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pvp Teams server fixes<P>-Mezmerize series of Spells:  When mezzed players can meditate and bandage.  make it say "you cannot use this command rigth now" when trying to meditate or bandage while under mez spell<P>-Fear vs pets and Fear in dungeons:  Make fear in dungeons vs pets work like npc fear2 (i beleive that's teh resist message).  Stun the target for the duration of the fear spell.  If this happens maybe we can bring fear back to pvp to a lesser extent (last 66% of the time maybe?). Hoorah for Chanters<P>-Melee's in PVP:  To make Tanks more viable make it so a succesful taunt on a player of alternate team either a)  makes them target taunter  b) clear targeting.  Of course this shouldn't work all the time as it would overpower but make it work still (only in melee range).   Evade in pvp.  Make evade and spells like jolt/ feign death on successes clear target screen if out of melee range.  This would make a bunch of rogues happy as well as making feign death a nice accessory.<P>-if Fear is back make a succesful Instill doubt work the same way.<P>-Crossteaming:  Easy enough solution do 1 of 2 things.  make either Vallon Zek, or Tallon Zek a pure Good vs Evil Server (we've been asking for this for as long as I can remember).  Or Add a seperate Server that's good vs evil only.  if VZ or TZ is turned do movelog.  if fresh server either make everyone start over (for balance) or movelog.  Simple way GvsE would work..  If you have a dark background you are evil.. if you have a light background good.  (so Necromancers of any race, and Shadowknights of Anyrace are evil.  Those that worship dark gods are evil.  and Evil races are... Evil).  Lights would have their druids  Darks would have their necros.  No more paladin and Shadowknight getting along.  After doing this Hardcode it so you cannot buff or heal anyone of the opposite team.  Make Bards that worship Veeshan evil so the darks can have tracking for once!  Those that worship good or nuetral gods (bristlebane, rallos Zek, Solusek Ro, and Brell Serilis[he created gnolls right?] all be chosen by class and race).<P>-Dot's.. These should also do 66% damage in pvp if regular nukes do.<P>Well hope you read and consider this.. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay right from the start. We alreayd know that the MAJORITY of people playing pvp DON'T want item loot. I played on pvp from lvs 1-18 with several charecters while item loot was in effect... It was awfull, naked casters ganking people hideing all over in combat areas just waiting for people to drop to low hp, and there were TONS more kewl doods around <BR>(as invariably those are the types of people looking for item loot) <BR>( I left until coin only went into effect)<BR> Now I am back on the Tallon zek server and can honestly say from lvs1-22 I have not run into nearly half as many doods and for the first time there is ROLEPLAYING  I even found a guild that ONLY roleplays even in guildchat. <BR> Pvp needs to be changed in a number of ways.<BR>(Faction, Guards to strong for raids, Slight unbalance with spell casters versus Pure no spell warriors at lower levels, travel routes are sometimes chopped up due to light/dark control more bind points are needed to compensate, High level greif players in twinked out gear, such as lv 12's with jboots or lv 8 warriors with armour so twinked 3 or 4 fightes of comparable lv are trying to attack him him and only doing 1-3 dmg a hit...<BR>  and finaly halfling druids killing human paladins, high elf clerics of the love goddess slaughtering good god worshipers... the last problem is large and I honestly dont know the fix other then a detialed rpg one which would be to long to disscus here)<BR> playing as a Human shadow knight I think I have seen things that give me a unquie perspective.<BR>  at lv 22 light "evil" charcters have an Awfully hard time getting into kunark, we cant get bound in FV and the overthere is like a death sentence becuase it is dark controlled, I hope at lv 30 with invis I can sneak in to the overthere Fv has see invis beings, so it is very very hard. I like that some areas are off limits to me becuase of my race and some areas are dark controlled, but haveing an entrie continet closed off to me is kinda annoying and unfair , in a real table top rpg I would have a chance to hide my identity in a number of ways while sneaking into a forgein enemy port...<BR>  Pvp could defiantly use a few more bind points, escpcialy for the "evil" types.<BR> I love the idea of a good/versus evil server, from what I have seen the light/dark fighting on Tallon zek is very well balanced Both have areas they can easily lv in from 1-50 and both <BR>(except for the few outcasts) can travely freely anywhere on norrath as long as they know the backtrails  (sewers,long routes, ect..ect..)<BR> Switching Tallon zek to PvE would almost be a natural change the only real fighting betwean the good races comes from the few and rare Kewl doods and the assoctiated kewl dood guilds, but they realy are few and far betwean and whenever they try to show in the open they are useualy quickly crushed by eveyr nearby player reguardless of team ect, I found That phenomon most rewarding, it shows what the general inclination of most players to be <BR>(good, helpfull,social and group oriented).<P> A good versus evil server would suffer but one problem , Where to put all the "Light"  evil god worshipers, they migh not like the idea of hanging with darkelves, trolls, ect,<BR>    also, not only may they want to not hang with dakrs they might want to pk the darks,<BR>Also they most likely still want to get into human cities to train, buy food and goods (which is useualy already more difficult for them then other charecters) making them pvp to some humans might cuase major problems escpacily with the few greif players who try just to ruin faction.  Faction would also be a major problems on all sides, in the end it would take a well and thought out plan for a diffrent team pvp, due to faction and travleing you must always rember traveling, buy, selling, or entering any area is VASTLY diffrent then on the blue servers, and this must/should be taken into account, UNlike how it was ignored with human shadow knights who cant not enter kunark <BR>( I'll live though +)<P> I think one idea that should be strongly looked at is Pvp Choice, you would have to set up the teams before hand good/evil, god/god , but  certian race/class combos have to choose what team, they would like to be a part of, and they might want to work on a switching system where in game factions and quests ect, you could change teams, again only ideas, I dont go further becuase it is u to the big guys to realy make any choices or do any work to bring any pvp changes about<P> gl all , and thank you verrant staff for actualy makeing changes to improve the game, pvp is highly overlooked and as a hardcore rpger I can honestly say it is the only real place for rpers on EQ, there MAY be a FEW scatrred rpers on the blue servers but pvp is the ONLY server where I have seen numerous hard core rpgers AND hardcore rpg only guilds, gl again<BR> (the blue servers dont even come close with there level of rping and 80% of my time was spent on blue servers)<P>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Selphia said this<BR>"On Tallon Zek, roughly 70% of the people who play on the server are members of the "light alliance", who regularly group with members of other teams, save darks."<P>This is simply untrue.  Verant can look and see what portion of the server is on the "light" team.<P>Corran said this<P>"1- you can still play light vs dark. have your elf team guild allied with human and short team guilds. <P>2- Your guild could stay made up of numerous teams. when you go on a raid, say to a plane, bring 3-4 groups, each of a different team, each playing a different role.<P>3- You can still be friends with other teams. you can still drink an ale with them, adventure with them, and guild with them.<P>you just cannot heal/buff them.<P>If your freinds are determined by who heals/buffs you, what kind of friendship is that?<P>We all have friends in game that are now out of range from us so much that grouping with them is not plausible, experience wise... yet those are still friends."<P>This is a very good point.  Our server's personality won't be destroyed because of a hard-code 4 team change.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No drop on Rallos I think could be eliminated, I mean we do self regulate fairly well. How many level 5s do we have in bone caster robes? the idea behind no drop where players of a certain level shouldnt have access to buy/acquire things out of their level isnt needed on Rallos like it is on blue servers. Anyone wearing gear outside their peer level group will not have it for long.<P>Yes i have almost full shiverback on my monk so I know what I would be risking.<P>As far as melee range thing would it be possible to have some check with the client to see if the combatents are within some tolerance(to compensate for lag) to be able to hit instead of having precise locations on the server that are usualy .3 seconds from my client(out of range). If you could put in some fudge room to compensate for average lag that would help melee immensly.<P>Coan DragonClaw 53rd monk on Rallos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The fix is so simple, I don't know why you guys are debating...<P>One of TZ and VZ stays 4 team (and is hard coded that way)...<P>The other switches to light vs dark (either by remaining as is or is hard coded that way).<P>Then, the 5% of the population that actually likes true 4 team race war (HR, LotU, FS) can fight eachother on their max server population 800 while me and ALL my friends play on the other server (peak population rivalling that of bluebie servers).<P>I love the idea.

</FONT><HR>One thing you can do now is hard code TZ or VZ for 4-teams, but not both, leave one as it is and allow the /movelog. <P>Whatever change you make, players who leveled to 60 on VZ and TZ have the right to keep going on xteaming and kill the uber Kunark and Velious mobs. If it ever happens you hard code both servers, you MUST offer these players the possibility to switch to a blue server if they want.<P>Changes to the PvP that affects directly PvE are the worst things that can happen to TZ and VZ, most of people whining here are not 55+ OR never went on a Velious big raid and don't know the assle of high level playing. In fact on VZ and probably same for TZ, only X-Teamers know what Velious is all about and Absor, you know like me a guild made only of one team will NEVER kill Lord Yelinak or Zlandicar, no matter what, they just don't have the number. <P>Even the Dark Team that is obviously the strongest team is not able to kill a Kunark dragon or didn't even bother trying. The light team made of 9 races kills from time to time some of the Kunark mobs and don't even care going to Velious. Now imagine you break the light team in 3 as proposed and taking the highest members of it, you finish with 50 players in the teams, unable to do anything but PvP, is that really what we want for our servers ? <P>Imagine you are 60 and the only thing you are able to do is kill other players in a game meant to be a challenge in PvE, in a game 100% made around the PvE. Will you really keep playing on a server like that ?<P>As it is now you have the possibility of doing big stuff AND the possibility of massive PvP wars.<P>This is what it should be, EQ is not meant for 100% PvP. <P>So fix bugs yes, change the PvE world mechanics, NO WAY !</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, let me explain alittle about Harm touch and how the nerf was the wrong thing to do, before our disc, HT was doing the correct amount of damage in pvp, but when using both our disc and HT combined was doing alot of damage, not actually overpowering due to the fact we only get it every 72 minutes. but what the nerf did is to lower all HT damage, thereby nerfing HT from 1 to 55 unless you could use the disc (which i would rather use on other things anyway) to do the normal damage we where once doing. the only thing that needed to be fixed was the bind rushing and this was not the way to do it. in pvp, this neuters SK's in many ways. please send this back to the team to fix... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to add something that has pissed me off for the whole time ive been playing EQ. Newbie players that come along and ninja loot our deserved kills. I do not like wasting my time killing people so that newbies can get rich, I do it for myself and because I enjoy it. I have a simple solution that can fix ninja looters. PvP kills should be treated like NPC kills, i.e kobalds, frogluks etc. Say I kill someone, and it says "so and so has been slain by Teef" I should have the only right to loot the corpse, noone else but me is able to until the time limit on the corpse runs out and the corpse unlocks to anyone wanting to loot it, just like NPC kills. Same deal goes for groups, if i am grouped with 6 members, they have the privilege of looting the corpse as long as they want to until it unlocks. A simple suggestion that I hope to see implemented over the next few monthes, or patching days, whatever. Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bleh, necros dont get any good spells that cant be dispelled. <P>People talk about nerfing us eh. Well shamans get better dots than we do people. Pox, and bane of nife for christ sake. Look at wizards in pvp, lures are almost un resistable and do deadly dmg to players. Melees get items to give them like 125+ resists easy, plus still have 3 times my HP. All we have is lifetap. Its nice, but it doesnt do much dmg, and isnt mana efficient. So I dont see how necros should be nerfed in PvP. All you people who say that should actually try playing one to over 55 and try random PvP. I dont want to hear "I have a lvl 22 necro and its sooo easy to kill blue melees, they should be nerfed."<P>Anyone who says nerf necros in pvp has no skill at pvp, sorry.<P>As for some balance--Give chanters better save to their spells. Clerics dont need it because they are too hard to kill and that is their balance for not doing good dmg. Chanters do need it tho, even with tash, its easy to resist anything they have dmg wise.(I think ONLY the DDs they have should get better save in pvp, not their debuffs)<BR>Mages got their balance with the pet fear thing....THANK YOU for nerfing SK harm touch. It was way too powerful.<P>Dunno, other than that, i think pvp is pretty balanced. Every class has its lvl where it gets to be uber. rogues it is 55+. Warriors, its when they decide to buy resist gear. ;p   Necros its low lvl. Wizards its when they get lure and stop using ice comet. Monks--see warrior.<P>PS-Please think about removing faction from PVP teams...That or reduce the faction hit you take from pvp. This stops people from doing pvp because they "dont want the faction hit"...Do you really want people to not have fun and pvp because they want to save their faction?? Faction is for PVE, not PVP! :/<P><BR>Termin- 56 necromancer of VZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060240&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060240&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
