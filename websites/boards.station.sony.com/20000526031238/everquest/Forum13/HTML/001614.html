</FONT><HR>Also another reason why a monk makes a good tank is the fact that FD lets a cleric or other healing class heal a monk without affecting the mobs hate list. Of course you still need a secondary tank to hold the mob while the monk feigns. But this way 3 people can handle multiple mobs without worrying about the second, third, or even fourth mob jumping on the healer. Plus monks get a good ac bonus and do not lag much behind other tank classes. Throw in block(much better than parry), dodge, and riposte(thought it was a useless skill till i got it myself) and monks also avoid alot of damage that way.<BR>Of course when in a full group situation with an enchanter you will want to go with a warrior simply for the fact that his higher ac will save the healer mana in the long run.<P>ps. Monks also have very low hit points for a melee class. This makes it look like they take alot more damage than they really do.(100 damage to a monk takes almost twice as much off the hp bar as off of a warrior)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is the funniest post.<P>First off, Monks are LAST in damage at 30th level when compared to a rogue and a warrior.<P>Second off, Rune has a component, no?  Of course, money may be no object, but if that is the case, a fully twinked warrior at 30th level would woop a monk's ass in a heartbeat.<P>Thirdly, a bard and warrior of the same level would do MUCH better at that room than a monk and enchanter, or even a druid and a warrior, but with a little more of a scare.<P>It is just an example of a 2-team combo that works, and that is great.  But, dont say that monks are the best tanks based upon this lone scenario.  That is insane.  I can only hope you're joking, and I think you are, so I won't insult you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pezz Kneecrusher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>yes rune does takes component - 5 gold point but with getting 2 plat from a mob fine steel weapons and bronze to sell that was not a problem second i do agree that fully aquped warior or rogue can do more damage then monk but for rogue to be effective he will need to backstab and u can't backstab and tank at the same time and though wariors can tank they have terrible downtime withou healer- no bandage will not cut it comparing to monk healing skill. I am more then sue that i will not be able to hold raiders room with rogue or warior ( ps i don't think that level 30 warior will outdamage level 31 ragers buy a lot)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ahh,<P>The point is that this is 30TH level, people.  Monks dont do more damage than warriors at 30th level.  They TAKE more damage, have less HP, lower MR, and less AC.  Trust me.  A warrior, with bandaging to half between fights, along with a druid (regen, dmg shields, healing, root, harmony, etc) can take that room JUST as easily, if not easier.  Furthermore, a warrior at HALF health at 30th level does more dmg and STILL has the same or more HP than a monk of the same level.  Dont let the "percentage of bar" fool you.  The monk "seems" to be at 3/4ths or full health, but he still has less HP than a warrior at half health. *sigh*<P>The bard would ALSO rule at 30th with a bard.  Healing between fights, AE mes, buffs, dmg shields, fighting, etc.  Man, this is just a good piece of proof of "not having your ass in the know".  Hey, if it works for you, great.  But dont think it is special, by any means.  If it aint broke, dont fix it.  But, dont act like its the best thing out there.  It isn't.  At 35th and higher, a monk will do more damage than a warrior (usually), but again, he is taking more damage, and so mend only helps negate the need of more healing he'll need compared to a warrior.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Furthermore, mulitple warriors can "disperse" damage evenly through a group.  This allows downtime to be much less. Monks have no control how much they get beat on, and since they get beat bad, they NEED mend.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pezz Kneecrusher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> Rosta Fal'Zexus on the Karana Server, I am a level 37 Monk and I have to reply to these posts... Monks are NOT the best Tanks..first off, we do not get a Ac bonus, we have sucky Ac because we have to wear armor that weighs nothing... Warriors are the best Tanks but do 2/3 the damage that a Monk does in a fight... at 37 with 115str un-buffed, I can flying kick for up to 100, sometimes more.. I can punch for up to 40(but not much) and with my Flowing Black Silk Sash I hit very fast and my duel weild/double attack works alot... Rogues have flat out No hp whatsoever...Warriors do O.K. damage, with so many hp they do good for themselves...for the hybrid classes I think that they do just great in there roles...if Paladins stick with undead, and Rangers with...snaring crap...Bards are great for groups, but they get stuck with doing celerity and mana song... Shadowknights flat out suck unless they are Voltayr on Karana with a Bloodmoon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Ok.ok. I will stop ranting.. Just had to say that monks aren't the best tanks, but we do outdamage a Rogue, and a Warrior and all the Hybrids(accept SK's with HT)..<BR>  Have fun with Everquest  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If at level 30 a monk is a worse damage dealer than a warrior, than that says you never grouped with a monk IceToner...  An untwinked monk vs untwinked warrior, monk will own damagewise.  especially with a speedbuff which was the case here.  A twinked monk vs a twinked warrior may not be the same case, but still, I remember seeing warriors having difficulty taunting off me.  Btw, monks at 30 get their flying kick, which hits for a good 50-60 damage, and they punch for triple and quad 20-25s (not all connect, I know, but there are those rounds).

</FONT><HR>Yeah, I dont group with monks very often, I just played one to 41st and my warrior to 43rd.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>You bring up a good point...untwinked vs untwinked.  Yeah, a monk would probably do a little more damage.  Seeing as I've always been well equipped my entire career, I tend to forget that.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Just remember something:<P>Monks have a 30 dly atk speed until post 35th level.  Flying kick almost never does more than 70 pts of damage at 30th (critical hits are more frequent).  Also, if you throw in buffs like haste and dmg shields (along with taunt), warriors are much more effective in a group UNLESS there is already 1 warrior.  If you already have a warrior, then a monk is probably better to add, but if there is no warrior and it is up for grabs between a monk and a warrior, a warrior will always be a better choice.<P>Pezz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Monk is not all equiptment like a warrior. God wepons overpower warriors where monks do not have a fair shot at beating them from that point.<P>2.) Monks can pull mobs from a fully spawned camp, ie: King, Frenzy POH ect... A warrior can not do that. <P>This is how i look at it, i dont need 2 yaks, fbss and a dragonscale bp to kick some butt ;-)<P>Laters-<P>Angelhope Healings 50 Cleric<BR>Glooming holiday 45 Monk<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Dabigboom, keep playing your monk, you'll see why monks rock after lvl 42 or so, when all the other classes are capped, and your skills are still going up.  Monks get way higher ac than warriors  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Icetoner, you just proved that you have no clue what you're talking about.  Monks have a 36 delay up till lvl 25, when the built in haste kicks in.  At lvl 50 our bare hands delay (no fbss) is 30.  with fbss it drops to around 25.  with a cof or rashuka or rbb, we drop to about 22 delay.

</FONT><HR>Foster is correct. I am lvl 49 Warrior. My ac with one poh armor is about 823 I can be buffed by casters to over 900 ac. My monk friend has 255 dodge making his ac over 830. Regardless who has more, or I dont have the ubber equipment, that is perty freaking good for a monk only wearing cloth without any pof armor. I wield 2yaks 1fbss and I dont even come near the damage a monk does. Lvl 50 monks rock. Yet I still put my money on a mage or necro pet over a monk if they fought equaly and not nerf the pet on pvp. Dont tell me well you suck because you dont have any plane weapons. I have been doing the planes over 3months now and there just not easy to get. I know of 3 warriors on my whole server who has blood fire. 2 more that have 2hand weapons. Thats it, the rest wield yaks like me and there is alot of lvl 50 warriors on my server still wearing mostly crafted. Hell and we live in the planes.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Let me point out what many of you seem to have missed.  <P>Pezz is saying that at level 30 a monk will not outdamage a warrior with good equipment.  He is not saying that monks are worse damage dealers than warriors at level 40 or 50.  Just that prior to getting speed increases and big damage increases they are not as good at dealing damage (though close) and are definitly not as good tanks.  <P>As for the vaunted 14/22 weapons.... that is effectively 30 damage per second total with your fists.  <P>Warriors with SSoY's are doing 21/second plus procs at that level.  You have them beat.  But if they have a Spined Dragon Claw and an SSoY they pop up to 25 damage and a proc.  If they also have bloodfire they are up to 27 and a proc.  Yes you have them beat, but not by enough to make up for the extra HP they have.   <P>I agree that monks do more damage at high levels, but upto level 30 warriors still have the advantage with good equipment.  They do fall off rapidly from there.  However as a level 47 cleric I have a hard time using complete heals on monks effectively.  Basically I would rather CH a warrior with 3000 HP than a monk with 1800.  Overall as a tank goes the warrior wins by a long shot.  Prior to level 40 of course the monk is better because he gets hit less and has less HP so I can use superior, or even greater heal on him and restore a significant number of HP.  <P>At low levels it doesn't matter which you have, you can make it work.  At high levels every job needs a specific class.  Monks and warriors are equally valuable, so why worry who does more damage?<P>Mathilda<P>Cleric of Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I just find it hilarious that a lower level non-melee type caster that hasn't fought the Ghoul Lord or frenzied ghoul or Naggy or VOX much less been to planes has the experience to rate the best tank in the game.

</FONT><HR>Another thing I wanted to mention.  The other day I was in SolB doing bats and bugs.  At first we had a full group of 6 people.  Our tanks were a level 49 Monk and a level 42 Halfelf warrior.  <P>The monk tanked constantly and refused to Feign Death or back off ever.  I was constantly healing him and could not keep up very effectively in the larger fights because he was consuming massive amounts of my mana.  After he over pulled twice and got us chased out of there he suddenly went LD and never returned (Like we really believed he was LD... He even feigned death one second before going LD to keep himself safe while LD).  So we went with 5 people.  We ended up getting 90% of the kills we had been getting before and didn't get overpulled and trained out once.  I was usually able to med more mana back than I used CH'ing the warrior too because he took far less damage than the monk and had more HP.  <P>If the monk had listened to me and not tanked constantly then we would have had the mana to survive the overpulls.  At level 40+ monks definitly cant keep up unless you have no cleric to do CH.  (i.e. if you are stuck with a druid or shaman then the monk is better because they have less HP to heal).  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ruklaol, unfortunately, when it comes to monk equip, if we get pof equip, most of the time we lose ac...  the only thing that does come from pof and does have the highest ac out there are the boots.  If you will see any sane monk, they're only wearing the tunic, boots and maybe gloves (not if they have guants of fiery might tho).  Anyway, with my equip I reach about 867 ac unbuffed, and that's with a fbss and white wolf cloak (need to change to rashuka/cof and tbb  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  I can get to around 940 ac buffed, maybe more, havent tried since I got my runed lava pendant.  Btw, you should check out the rathe, and see how many peeps we got with plane weapons... it's sick =P.

</FONT><HR>The warrior's strengths show up a lot earlier than level 45. It starts showing up in the mid twenties when their HP's and magic resistance starts to pull away from other classes.<P>I know from playing my warrior that there was more than one time that I was the glue that held the party together just because I could fight longer without a heal and was resistant to roots, HT's, debuffs, and other spells when every other classes would be in need of constant attention from the healers in the group including Monks.<P>Warriors are the best overall tan, bar none. Monks are offensive melee individuals, when they get whacked, they get whacked HARD and need a heal almost immediately. When my warrior hit the uppers twenties I could take a full HT shot from RedWind for 350 hp's when I didn't resist a good % of it, fight to the end, resists his fears and engulfing darkness and not need a heal. Every other melee class would need an immediate heal, be feared through most of the fight, and have the healer aggoed by getting that heal right after the HT. Then people would be scampering about to save the healer. More than once I would hear,"Thank God you logged on! We need a warrior BAD!" I also know lots of clerics that would be hesitant about joining a group without a warrior in it. That huge HP tank makes a complete heal insanely mana efficient.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001614&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001614&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
