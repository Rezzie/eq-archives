</FONT><HR>   Some people think this is a roleplaying game and act accordingly.  Unfortunately, many people seem to think that this is a pretty chatroom.  Just about every real life woman in the game has gotten married in game to a character.  Obviously, a great place for women to meet men, but that's not what I'm playing for.<P>  It'd be nice if Verant could make up its mind what to do with these two groups which do not get along.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Goofu, thank you.  You provided me with an example of the Role Playing Dictator as good as any I could make up.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><BR> <BR>Mr. Disco, yes, there are two groups of players, one that prefers to roleplay (a very small group, but important Fantasy fans nonetheless), and the other one comprised of people who prefer to socialize in a non-traditional sense regarding roleplaying.  Sort of like there are people who prefer Shakespeare, and others who prefer Andrew Lloyd-Webber musicals.<BR> <BR>The difference between the two is that one group hates the others merely for existing, but this animosity is one-sided.  What I'm saying is that Role Playing Dictators go out of their way to annoy and harrass people they think don't fit their vision of High Fantasy.  So we get people who /petition someone else not because their name is truly offensive (like a racial slur for example, or a curse word), but because it isn't ARTISTIC enough to suit their burgoise pseudo-intellectual idea of High Fantasy.<P>MacRae, I'm not offended by a little generalization or sterotyping of my own identity group, and I tend to agree with you.  You sound like a real man, one with compassion, one who cares about women, nothing wrong with a gentleman like that.  That you managed to grow up with such a fine masculine attitude in today's America is nothing short of a miracle.   You're right, these guys who insulted Managirl for her emotions are obviously never going to have any sort of long-term relationship with a woman unless they either change their attitudes or unless they find women with incredibly low self-esteem who will take any loser.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After reading many of the postings, which included snippets of the rules, one thing is apparent to me...<P>The GM used personal discretion on choosing to force Managirl's name change.  <P>Whether "Managirl" is in direct violation takes a learned judicial tribunal capable of studying both the letter and the intent of the rules. Aside from that, some very persuasive arguments have been put forth on both sides indicating that there is some ambiguity in the rules.  Such ambiguity gives those with authority leeway to wield there power in a different manner on a case by case basis.<P>Since the GM has been given the authority and chose to wield that authority, Managirl is now not Managirl whether the deed was just or not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hee heh, LionelHutz, that was a pretty funny little parody, except for it's WRONG!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><BR> <BR>There is no rule that we all roleplay all the time.  We have been provided with a flag (/roleplay) for this purpose, and a channel (/ooc) for zone-wide out-of-character chat.  The law-abiding in this case have made up their own laws without bothering to consult the majority of the population, apparently.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>I personally roleplay everywhere except in /ooc and in Guildsay.  I roleplay a rather puckish Wizardess who sometimes even speaks in rhyming couplets.  I LOVE roleplaying.  But in an environment which I am sharing with other real human beings, I also like to "live and let live."

</FONT><HR>BigJP24, it's funny you should mention the "Rule of Thumb."<BR> <BR>That phrase is pretty old.  It came from Merrye Olde Englande (everything back then had a silent e at the ende).  Back in those days, there was only one ruler, and he was NOT made of wood.  That ruler was the King.<BR> <BR>You see, one day, the Kinge ofe Englande decided that a standard of weights and measures would keep people honest.  Up until then, if someone sold you 50 "feet" of rope, the merchant would actually walk off the length with his own feet.  This meant that the merchants with the smallest feet made more money.<BR> <BR>Since Kings hate whenever anybody else has a better scam than they do, the Kinge decided that he would make a standard of weights and measures so that everywhere in the Realm, an inch was an inch, and a pint is a pound the world 'round.<BR> <BR>The measurement for the "yard" became the distance from the end of the Kinge's nose to the tip of his outstretched middle finger (no jokes now), the "foot" was his own foot's length (I think he was wearing shoes that day though), and the "inch" became the length off the Kinge's thumb from the second joint.<BR> <BR>Thus we get the story of the "Rule of Thum."  It is actually a rigidly-measured standard length based upon the physical person who represented the entire Realm.  If anything was publically-known and published, it was the exact standards by which to measure everything.<BR> <BR>No judgement calls.  Absolute printed certainty.  That is what the "Rule of Thumb" was REALLY all about.  When people refer to the "Rule of Thumb" as if it means "an obvious choice," they are ignoring the origin of the concept.  What the real meaning of that phrase is SUPPOSED to be is that standards are arbitrarily-decided upon, but then set in stone.<BR> <BR>Nothing could be further from this situation.  This is all judgement call, and I don't have any faith in the judgement of a person who would change Managirl's name in the name of the Naming Policy, when that name does not violate the Naming Policy as written in any way.<BR> <BR>If Verant wants to have a naming policy that is vague, they need to have a true system of arbitration so that people like Managirl have some recourse of appeal when they are /petitioned.  A jury of her peers would not be a bad idea.  Why doesn't Verant set up a system of Ombudsmen, who can be elected in each server, to arbitrate behavioral and PnP issues?  Why set up guides and GMs to have to be Judge Dredd with the entire rulebook?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Look at this. I change my stance. Nowhere in the naming policies does it state that Managirl is against the rules. Also they shouldn't have changed it so quickly even if it was against the rules, which clearly by their own rules its not.<BR>"For category 1-2 offenses, your name will be changed immediately. The Senior Staff person will then contact you to discuss the change. Please be aware that if your name is changed due to it being obviously offensive, any corpses owned by you will not be lootable, and no reimbursements will be given. <BR>For categories 3-10, the Senior staff member will contact you to initiate a discussion about the name change. When you have chosen a new name and have looted any outstanding corpses, the CS representative will perform your name change.<BR>Please be aware that if you do not choose a name within a reasonable amount of time, a new name will be assigned to your character. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to inform the Senior staff member of the existence of any unlooted corpses that you own. After your name is changed, those corpses will not be lootable, and no reimbursements will be given."<BR>Is a few seconds a reasonable amount of time to change your name?

</FONT><HR>(okay this is going to sound callous and cold but hey dont take this personal its just a rant because I am sick of this naming policy stuff) <BR>Just because she got away with a name for a year does not mean its right. The reason EQ has a naming policy is to prevent this kind of thing, and to help maintain the game as a fantasy enviroment. Whatever little bit of fantasy is left that is. I believe EQ should have a more strict naming policy like FaerunMUD (very strict policy and for the best I believe). Now people say oh these names are original or they are imaginitive. No they aren't look at the name Managirl come on that says it right there I bet it took her 2 seconds to think of that, sure if this was a superhero game that would be acceptable, but its not. And as for using the nickname excuse, nicknames are givin to you by others, they are earned sometimes for the best or worse, they are not self given. The name Managirl Beachbum is just plain chatroom nonsense, if you want that go to MSN chat or something lol. And a more simple thing, if one can not play by the rules, then do not play at all. And do not whine about it when you get caught. I have never petitioned anyones name, but I may start if it weeds out the imbicules. And as for names these are all of my characters, all of which I came up with myself and yes, &lt;gasp&gt; used my Imagination! and do not violate any naming policy<P>Aidia Strohem - 20th Enchanter<BR>Wilam- Ranger of some lvl<BR>Ratrraz- 9th lvl Iskar SK<BR>Cavelra- 4th lvl Pally<BR>Qour- 3rd lvl Rogue<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's hard to find nice, mature, non idiots in Norrath sometimes.<BR>-----------------<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with you here.  Unfortunately it is far to easy and common to find people with stupid, non-RPG names which go against the rules.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have also been involved in a lot of EBay threads as well, and something just caught my attention here.  Technically Managirl isn't her name.  She doesn't own that name, Verant does.  Therefore Verant has every right to change it.  Too bad she got so attached to something that didn't belong to her.  That would be like me leasing a car that I loved, failed to make the payments and the repo man coming to take it from me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If somebody else complains about the name, BAM you will have to change it again.<P>And for those who petition name changes that are not offensive... it is sad that you have to find power over other people in a silly game.

If America still belonged to the Indians, you might have a valid point.<P>Maybe we should have a McDonald's Walk Thru in Karnors with a Drolvarg Sentry serving up, keep it in line with that 'American' feel.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why? For enforcing a company policy that he had nothing to do with as far as it's conception? Or maybe you feel he is the one to blame for making this girl cry. I mean, he is the one that chose her name and then a year later made her change it right? Or is SHE the one the picked the name without actually reading the rules? So who is really to blame here?<P>Where in the rules does it say that her name is invalid ?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry officer, I didn't know this highway had a speed limit of only 45 miles an hour.<P>Your national speed limit is a black /white issue whereas naming a character in EQ is a grey area and to say the least.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with you here.

</FONT><HR>"Remember, players are required to follow the rules, not NPCs, items, or spells."<P>Kiron,<BR>That's where most of us have a problem with the policy.  If the idea is to have a fantasy setting, shouldn't the environment follow the rules?  If not, isn't the basic environment violating that setting?<P>I used to like the idea of the naming policy (and for policing vulgar names, I still do).  Now, I would like to see them get rid of most of the rules for it (the rules that VI doesn't apply to their own names within the game).<P>Looked at in that light, Managirl would not be a policy violation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow..  I shut this Monitor off go home... Come back with my cofee...  And realize the people I was hoping to see in day time yesterday got on Last night... I missed the GOOD Responses.<P>I'd like to say I love the way FridayJones, NymuwraithTevlyn, MacRae and Elminster joined in... Cause it's true there is so much Ignorance out there.<P>I'm a Man, and I'm French Canadian (1/2 Italian).  Raised by my Grand Mother in the Italian ways... where Emotions weren't but in the back door... and you were told to stop crying cause you're a boy.  Well, my Father couldn't deal with it when I was a Teenager or an Adult.  I went through some hells, where he couldn't be around me.  Why ?  Cause it hurt so bad, I did cry.  Well, I have firmed up quite a bit in the last 10 years and control that better...  But I'm not going to get sick cause I'm not going to let myself feel what I REALLY Feel.<P>Well, the sad things in North Ameria and probably many other places...  Crying is considered weak, or unstable.  Parents think that, teach it to their kids... and the cycle goes on.  So people can be sad, but crying... God Forbid!  They probably have problems.  Damn people don't get it...  They are probably being more HUMAN than the rest of us...  Weeping is natural when you're sad... no matter what it is about.  A game ?  EQ is way more than a game for most... it's a social event, meeting place... and an enjoyment way past the "Game" concept...  Those being so Negative and clueless can't see that aspect of EQ... to them this is another "VIDEO GAME"...  Well, EQ is way more than that for many, so Wake up.<P>Lisset..  If you're a man, sorry to say... You're an @ss Hole.  If you're a woman, well... you're exactly like my X-Wife which was a Femenatzy.  Woman are stronger than Man, if the woman cries...  Damn the Man, and He's all at fault... and Damn the woman cause she is so weak...  ?!?  Woman like Man are allowed to be weak, and it has nothing to do with having problems or being unstable.  And a woman crying does not mean a Man isn't doing his job (Even though that does happen).  Are you having problem with your man Lisset ?<P>As for A_HerooftLegend and Goofu...  Clueless marks the spot.  Nothing wrong with being weak...  It's called being human...  We're seeing a race of Heartless people coming behind our Generations...  Not Human... Heartless.  It's really scary if you think about it.  I hope to God my kids don't get that way, I'd be worried to be put in a home before I reach 50.<P>We play this game creating 3, 4 and more Characters.  Some only create 1.  They really put themselves in their Char's skin... and enjoy the ride.  This is their way out of reality, and a place where Stress and problems don't exist...  A place where you feel safe being with other people, and enjoy their company and talk to them.  That's how she enjoyed EQ... and Problems came to them in a form of a GM that changed it all for her...  Why would a name change matter ?  It was her Identity.  Who SHE was in EQ.  And the comment about a phone # changing... LOL  How more Idiotic a comparison can you get.  People don't realize that EQ has evolve way farther than just an RPG...  It's a Chat line with Graphics, and some action added to it.  You're Identity becomes more personal... mostly when you've been playing for as long as she did...<P>Any of this make any sense ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 20 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-17.html">17</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-18.html">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-19.html">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053946-20.html">20</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053946&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053946&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
