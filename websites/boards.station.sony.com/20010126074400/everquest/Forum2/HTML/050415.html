</FONT><HR>What I find very strange is that Clerics currently have been very replaceable in Kunark.  We do cast Complete Healing, but rarely do we depend on it for all fights in a normal group.  (pardon me if I get the ratios a little off)<P>Pre-Velious mana efficiency :<BR>Greater Healing - 1.9 hit points per mana<BR>Superior Healing - 2.4 hit points per mana<BR>Remedy - 2.5 hit points per mana<BR>Divine Light - 2.6 hit points per mana<BR>Celestial Elixir - 5 hit points per mana<BR>Complete Healing - "Feeling lucky punk?"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>A Druid/Shaman pair or combination can outdo a Cleric very easily, IF they were willing to try.  Before we receive Celestial Elixir, we get 2.6 hit points per mana at best?  Two Druids/Shamans get 3.6 hit points per mana with Greater Healing and can outheal a pre-CE Cleric for everything except Complete Healing.  This does not even consider the regeneration spells they receive, nor does it consider the faster mana regen that Shamans are capable of beyond Clarity even, nor does it consider the advantages of spreading the buffing between the two, nor do I consider the group heals that are very rarely used by Clerics.<P>Post-Velious<BR>Same deal except : <BR>Celestial Healing - 3.3 hit points per mana<P>Woot!  I can personally heal almost as efficiently as that Druid/Shaman combo with Greater Healing can!  With Complete Healing, I can take them hands down.<P>Post-Druid/Shaman healing boost :<BR>Druids and Shamans will gain the ability to heal at 2.4 at 49 (or 44) to 2.6 at 59.  They will now be able to equal a Celestial Elixir Cleric who is not using Complete Healing.<P>The trend seems to be to allow a Druid/Shaman combination of two to heal as well as a similarly leveled Cleric.  Complete Healing skews this, and the possiblity of a nerf to Complete Healing has too much of a ring of truth to it, particularly in light of the healing upgrades being discussed for Druids and Shamans.  The ideal seems to be to force groups to have two healers rather than one as is currently prefered.  Based on the assumption that Complete Healing is going to be nerfed, we have to ask ourselves.  "What do we want the other healer in our group to have to work with?"  My feeling is that I want the best healing possible.  I think that is what is happening at Verant.  Clerics will still be primary healers due to getting the spells at lower levels, being able to cast while being beaten on, being able to stop the beating with invulnerabilities and simply because our instinct says "Heal dammit!" rather than "Run!" or "Evac!" (I mean no offense to Druids.  I pay more attenion to the health bars than to whether it is time to run or not.  Evacs often pleasantly surprise me due to this.)<P>On the plus side, we may get to group with other Clerics.  I believe I can tell an old school Cleric from a powerleveled one relatively easily.  It might be nice to get to group with another Cleric to compare tactics.  I have no clue how good I actually am compared to other Clerics because I don't get a chance to group with them.<P>On the down side, classes that have a difficulty grouping that aren't healers will have a harder time finding groups with a Complete Healing nerf.  There will be one less spot in the group for them.<P>The new groups will ideally consist of :<BR>Cleric/Druid/Shaman<BR>Cleric/Druid/Shaman<BR>Melee<BR>Melee<BR>Melee/Magician/Wizard/Bard/Necromancer/Druid/Shaman<BR>Enchanter/Bard/Necromancer<P>A post Complete Healing nerf EQ will be a good time to be a Druid or a Shaman, it will be a bad time to be a Wizard, Magician or Necromancer.  Basically, the same as it has been.<P>I haven't gotten to group with many of my fellow Clerics.  I often meet you at raids and have seen you all around the game.  I look forward to grouping with you and discussing tactics and showing off to you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Complete Healing being nerfed will be the worst thing that could happen to the casters since highly resistant mobs.  Clerics will NOT be the losers (except when that Cleric only item drops and we have to lotto against each other.)  Besides, it will be nice to have an experience Resurrection back to the camp rather than a Paladin Revive from time to time.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>If Verant wants to nerf Complete Healing.  I would suggest increasing maximum group size first.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really dont care about CH.  One thing I have to agree on is the group size.  Group of 6 was good to go on any exp/loot camp besides planes in the old world.  In Kunark group os 6 is barely cutting it in Charssis and Chardok (noone does anything besides zone line with one group) and even Seb.  In Velious this turns into a nightmare.  Group of 6 cant kill ANYTHING on its own.  Mobs have TONS of HPs and hit for TONS of dmg.  With severe limit on group size people are forced to chose "best" classes.  With group of 9, players will have ability to chose more different classes.  Those 3 extra spots will not be filled with another clerc (small marginal efficency added) and probably not another chanter (why would you want another chanter when you can add bard with stackable manasong and great comba haste songs?).  Those 3 extra spots would allow more different classes to group without conflicts.  If you read boards you see that people outlined 5 out of 6 classes that should be used in a good exp/loot group(im not talking about AE groups).  And then many argue about all other classes being forced to fight over last spot.  Upping amount of people in a group would certanly solve a lot of problems.<P>Zania</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The mana efficiency of the healing is only one part of the equation.  You also must consider the healing over time.<P>Clerics (with CHEAL) heal 10K of damage in 12.5 seconds (counting recharge time)<P>Druids with SHEAL (at 53) (assuming  a 20% fizzle rate) heal 10k of damage in 151 seconds<P>If you assume you've somewhat less than 10k to heal, say 4k,  the cleric STILL takes 12.5 seconds. the Druid takes 60 seconds.<P>The cleric is capable of healing 800 damage per second.  On a 4K target, it's only 320 damage per second.<P>The Druid is capable of healing about 66 damage per second.  If you thow in the Regen the druid can add, you add 2 or 3 damage per second healing.<P><BR>If your mob is doing significantly more than 66 DPS, or you have more than one of them, then the druid can't keep up.<P>I assume the numbers for Shamans are similar.  <P>However, (IMO) if you give groups the opportunity to replace the cleric with a druid or shaman on a one-for-one basis, they WILL, for all the OTHER things the druid or shaman bring to the group.  The cleric, IMO, should EASILY outheal any single other healer, or they will have no place.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

However, I also think that two non-cleric healers should be able to replace one cleric if necessary.<P>As a druid, I will always, *always* welcome a cleric into my groups.

While I didn't do this, nor did I go to this site, the word was spread to a board that I do go to.  Verant has been known to do this in the past, but the balancing that EQ is looking to undergo seems like a good opurtunity to "balance" Complete Healing by making it a 60ish spell and putting a different spell in it's place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>gestalmind- I think you're a little incorrect on your statement.<P>Sure, I'm a Cleric, call me biased, but I'm not let into a group for ressurection purposes....hmm....Let's see now:  If I were let into a group for ressurect purposes, would that just mean I let my group die?  "Oh yay!  Let's get a Cleric so we can get ressurects!"<P>That's SO inaccurate.<P>It was posted somewhere (don't remember where exactly), that in the spdat file, there was a new spell descovered within the file.  I didn't look at the file myself (since I don't violate EULA rules), but I read this post online on some message board.  I also don't know if I am in violation by posting what I am about to post, but I learned this from somebody else:<P>Level 60<BR>Healing Complete<BR>10,000 Hitpoints<BR>12.0 second cast time.<P>I think that's what got Benelorn to post, he may have seen what I saw, and thought it might be a step up to "nerf" complete healing.<P>However, I doubt this is going to be the case.  If Verant takes away complete healing from Clerics, changes the level of it, or even adds an upgrade and makes the original 39 complete healing spell less effective: that would be the one move that will destroy EverQuest.

</FONT><HR>Well, I doubt Verant is dumb enough to move a 39th level spell (Complete Heal) to a 60th level spell.  At the same time, I do think they miscalculated when Complete Heal was needed.  My experience is that Clerics don't use CH much at 39th.  I think that some true upgrade to Superior Heal (call it Grand Heal and let it cost 400 mana and cure 1000 HP) should actually be a 39th level spell and Complete Heal a 44th level spell.<P>I also think that Verant was not considering the 51st to 60th level game when they stated out Shamans and Druids Heals.  I think Shamans and Druids should get Superior Heal at 44th and Grand Heal at 59th (15 levels of separation between their last spell and the upgrade for each).  Druids and Shamans should never get Complete Heal IMO.  Pallies should get Superior Heal at 54th (15 levels after they got GHeal) and would not get Grand Heal.<P>Oh, and reduce the fizzel rate.  If you have a spell, you should be able to use it with a decent level of dependability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didn't say that a Druid and Shaman together equal my class.  I didn't say I wanted to equal two of them.  If you actually read what I said, I felt the changes were a good thing.  Read first THEN react.<P>What I am saying is that under proper circumstances I can equal them even without Complete Healing.  Those circumstance being my having Celestial Elixir (59 spell I believe) and the timing to cast it and let it do its job.  Before I reach Celestial Elixir, I will be competing at a 3.1 (Celestial Elixir) as a Cleric to the 4.8 to 5.0 to 5.2 of two Druids/Shamans.  I will still have the advantage over either singly, but the two combo will always out do me.  Even now with Druids and Shamans using greater healing, they are at 3.6.  The problem is that they don't use what they have even in Kunark.  The upgrades being discussed are needed for Velious.<P>Can Clerics compete?  I think so.  We will still be able to achieve that twenty-five percent advantage (discounting regenerations and all the others things) even without Complete Healing.  Is it worth the extra time needed to reach this level?  That is another question.  Would I have anyways?  Probably I would have.  I wanted to be the best healer that I could be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But remove the chanter and a necro and you have a group that I have played with from day 1 in May 1999. Not because I want to, mainly because of numbers of people on, and these are RL friends. I can tell you now, the cleric gets very OOM teying to keep us 2 tanks alive using Sup. Healing. Also she has noticed another thing, not sure if it true, but i have noticed it. Using CHeal she gets less agro than Sup heal. I can tell you know, CHeal is the OGRE tanks best friend. Now that we are in the high 40s game this is the only heal spell she has as she can let us get down to 1 bub of health before healing, so it gives her the chance to throw a couple of blasts in and get off her grass stained butt.<P>Dogstar Manasponge<BR>47th Lvl Ogre Tank<P>PS the last name was given to me by the cleric due to the constant state that she was always in before she got CHeal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Complete Heal as it stands right now is the most efficient healing spell (even considerably better than Celestial Elixir). Druids and Shaman won't ever get that. Clerics also get groups because of Res. Take Sebillis for example. If someone dies and you are using druid or shaman healing well then you have to go beg a cleric for a res (and groups don't want to do that). That's just for groups fairly close to the zone where the dead person can get back easily (oh assuming they're a caster bound at the orb also, forget it if they're a tank). <P>It gets even worse for some of the deeper in experience camps. Once again if a tank dies forget about getting them back in under half an hour. Besides that, since a lot of stuff sees invis pretty much forget about getting anyone back into a deeper experience camp if you have a druid or shaman as healer, maybe you can clear a path but it's a big hassle. <P>I think what druids and shaman really want is to be a substitute for a cleric if and only if a cleric isn't available. I don't see anything wrong with that.. as a warrior I'm supposedly the best "tank" but hybrids can easily take my place. Even if druids/shaman were given Divine Light they're still very far behind Clerics for healing tanks, and they can't res and don't have as good of buffs and can't stun, etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm<P>The new heal complete spell is a little worrying, from 2 points of view.<P>As a cleric I would be sincerely unhappy if the spell I have been using since August 99 was to be replaced at such a late stage of the game.  Unless it was replaced by spell that healed a fixed amount of hp's that is equivalent of the max possible hp's of tank as it currently stands then the end game would be even more unbalanced than it currently is.<P>2nd worry, currently complete heal is not actually a "complete heal", it is capped at a maximum of 10,000 hp's, ever noticed vox cheal herself and only regain a 3rd of her hp's?  <P>The new spell may have been (or about to be) put into the game as an uncapped complete heal, imagine now taking out the boss mobs in velious that range from 250k to 1m hp's, 1 cheal and they are fully back in business.....<P>On that scarey note, I bid you goodnight :-)<P>regards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few quick comments....<P>Benlorn: The changes to the Druid healing spell line up are mearely possible suggestions, not definate changes as of yet.  I was talking to a mid 50s druid friend of mine yesterday that didn't even want his class to get divine light at 60 because he though it infringed too much on the cleric class.  These proposed suggestions are still in the early brainstorming phase.  Personally I wouldn't mind dru/shm getting SupH at 49/50 and Remedy at 55ish, and that being the end of it....<P>I occasionally play a cleric amongst my other characters, and I can honestly say that if a tank has 3k+ hps after full buffs I won't use anything else, except CH, unless his/her hps are dropping too fast for the spell.  Under about 2800 celestial Elixer is probably better.<P>At sub level 59 I went with CH on anyone over about 2k and divin light/remedy for persons under 2k.  Never had Celestial healing before obtaining 59+ since sov is relatively new.  But, if I had to do it again....<BR>I'd probably use CH for anyone over about 2.2k and Celestial Healing for anyone under that, with Casters almost alway getting Remedy during fights and Celestial Healing if warented, tanks can usually get a mob off a caster before they take more damage than a remedy can fix.<P>Zania: Not a flame just a recomendation.  Test the waters again in some of the harder places.  You state that no one does anything except zone line fighting in Charssis with only a 6 person group.  I hope you were refering to that with a Druid or Shamen as the primary healer.  If not be a bit daring when you have a cleric and an enchanter along and try some of the wings.  I was just there last night with: 54War, 55Rog, 55Dru (half asleep), 55Ench, 55clr, and 56wiz and we were in south wing doing fine.  South being one of the harder wings to enter into.  Sure if you go there sub 50 it may be zone line only but give north wing a try if your all 51+.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Uhhm you said <BR>A Druid/Shaman pair or combination can outdo a Cleric very easily, IF they were willing to try<P>So Clerics are easily replacable are they. <BR>Regen and your heals help but in no way replaces a Cleric when mobs quad hit for well over 200. Superior heal heals 600 with Chloroplast we will say 800 (not true)a round(LOL). Thats easily beaten out of most in 2 rounds or less. Ohh and thats if you dont pull 2 or more. Considering the amout of HP mobs have your OOM then dead shortly with those weak heals. Now in normal EQ it may cut it but in Kunark or Veliuos your OOM or evacing. NO spell replaces Complete Heal as of yet.<BR>YOUR post is flawed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I mean that Complete Healing aside, a Druid/Shaman combo can hold the job in Kunark, and with the changes they can hold the job in Velious.  For mobs doing massive amounts of damage without Complete Healing (assume NO ONE has the spell), you will need multiple groups with healers that know what they are doing on raids.<P>Yes, it is possible that this is a Druid or Shaman level 60 spell.  One can only hope that is the case.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050415&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050415&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
