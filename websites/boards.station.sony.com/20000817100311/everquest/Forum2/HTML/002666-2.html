&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I am running through a zone when I observe a PvP fight. A dwarven palladin is laying the smack down on a poor dark elf. I check the health on the DE and seeing he is about to die, I heal and SoW him. This allows him to run away. Both combatants were in their low teens, whereas I am level 27. Am I going to be warned?<P>No.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;My guild runs to Nek forest and starts laying waste. We have 6 members, 5 of whom are level 20, and the sixth is a level 40 cleric. The cleric is only there to heal the other 5 and no one in the zone on the opposing team is high enough to attack him. Is my guild in trouble?<P>No.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;A group of Evils is attacking a group of Elves. Everyone in the fight is of equal level. However, the darks have brought with them a cross-teaming Elf, who heals the Evils, and can't be attacked by the other Elves since he is on the same team as them. Is the cross teaming Elf going to be banned?<P>No, there are currently no rules againt the "invulnarable healer", whether its due to an "out of range" healer or a "cross-teaming" healer.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;No one should be invulerable in combat and you shouldn't have to call an enemy to kills guys of your own race. A design flaw to be sure and this should at least be commented on or addressed by Verant. <P>Brega, you can say that the system is flawed and should be fixed, but none of the solutions that have been presented have been endorsed by plurality, much less a majority of the players.  There are certainly some pretty rash and obscure things that we could do to try and "fix" this to your liking, but what of everyone else? <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I've never seen this addressed by Abashi either. Most players just want Racewars to be coded as Racewars. Invulerable healing and buffing to help "Racewar enemy teams" defeat your own team should be coded out as impossible.<P>Sure, that seems simple, but what is the reasoning behind, for instance, a human paladin and a high-elf paladin to "refuse" (cf. be restricted by code) to heal or buff each other?  Why *must* there be animosity between them?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;1) Make the healer attackable by his own team for say the next 2 minutes everytime he heals (this happens in guild wars, so it should be possible); <P>Can't do this with the way that attack rights are handle.  In EQ, if I can attack you, you can also attack me.  There's no way around that mechanism.  The exploit that pops out is that all I'd have to do to be able to go kill my own team would be to cast a beneficial spell on someone of another team.  EQ also can't handle a persistant agressor flag.  We know who is casting the spell and who the recipient is at the time the spell is cast, but not after.  The same is true with melee attacks.<P>These are the options available to us:<P>1. Do nothing.<BR>2. Disallow beneficial spells across teams. (handles cross-teaming problem)<BR>3. Disallow beneficial spells out-of-level (handles, for the most part, the out-of-level situation)<BR>4. A combination of 2&3.<P>The difficulty is that while we want to support PvP and the Teams servers, we cannot in that process harm the PvE aspects of the game.  It's still going to be EverQuest, but will be EverQuest with PvP, rather than PvP EverQuest.  <P>There's another possible solution (if indeed people feel that there is a problem) that one of the programmers and I were just brainstorming about.  Please let me know if you feel that there are any unacceptable problems with this....<P>How about... If a player takes damage from another PC, they can only receive beneficial spells from someone in their own team for X-minutes or until they zone.<P>Let's apply this to the 3 scenarios that the original poster mentions:<P>Case #1:  Dwarf is attacking DE1.  DE2 is over 8 levels above DE1.  Since DE2 is out-of-level with DE1, DE1 cannot take his beneficial spells since he's being attacked  by the dwarf.  DE2's only option would be to attack the dwarf if he was in range, but in this case, he's not. <P>Case #2: The level 40 DE cleric would not be able to support he level 20 marauders since he is out of range.<P>Case #3:  Evils are attacking elves.  Assuming that the elves have done damage to the evils, evils could not be healed/buffed by the cross-teaming elf.<P>Other scenarios:<P>Human is grouped with 3 elves, they can buff each other all day long.  However, a troll attacks the human.  The human can now only be healed by other people on the human team.<P>Human is grouped with 3 elves, and can buff, etc... The troll now attacks one of the elves.  That elf cannot receive direct support from the human, but can from the other elves.  The human could, of course, attack the troll if he was in range, just couldnt' heal the elf.<P>Any problems with this idea that you can think of?<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmmmmmmmmmm...<P>I like it, I think.<P>It'd be even cooler if you could take Tallon Zek (the server that's already evolved along these lines) and make it into 2 teams, Good and Evil... EXCEPT, make anyone who worships an evil god, or is a necromancer, or is an SK, regardless of race, evil for the purposes of PvP. That evens out the "9 races against 4" bit, but still allows lighties to help each other.<P>Then again, that's just wishful thinking.

</FONT><HR>One problem, if all you had to do was attack someone to make them invulnerable to healing or beneficial spells, then groups in dungeons would be in danger if someone wanted them to be.<BR>Lets say a group of elves and one dark elf was in a dungeon.  Then another elf comes along and wants the dark elf dead.  He could then attack the dark elf, making him invulnerable to all healing and beneficial spells.  Even if you made it only last for 2-3 minutes it would greatly effect the group as they could not pull anything during that time should the dark elf get attacked he would die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Valid concerns. I just have a couple points to add.<P>1. GMs / Guides need to get a general ruling on _any_ and _all_ issues such as those listed above before handing out warnings. Especially if they are spouting off what is against the PnP. If VI is truly dedicated to customer service, they need to ensure that their in-game CS representatives are all working with the players and not against them.<P>2. On first impressions, Abashi's idea seems like a very good one. However, it should be tested out and possibly modified as deemed fit. For example, the time limit could be altered and or buffs and or heals may be limited in scope ( but not completely ) once a player has been engaged in pvp combat, etc.<P>3. As to Hastel's (sp?) post stating what if 3 elves were teamed with a dark elf and another elf wanted to try to get the dark elf killed by attacking him. If the light elf attacked the dark elf, then they would duel as is the norm for a pvp server. If the light elf simply attacked the dark elf to deprive him of buffs and or heals and then immediately left this wouldn't necessarily be as bad as you made out. The dark elf wouldn't necessarily be in that much greater danger because any mob that would attack him could still be killed by his 3 light elf groupmembers. All in all, if light elves and dark elves want to group, this isn't that heavy of a consequence. In fact, its definitely preferable to light elves and dark elves never being able to group and or buff and heal eachother.<P>Good post and glad to see Abashi responding to it with a well thought out reply.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There's another problem with this change from a "lightie" point of view that would totally make evils own on PVP teams:<P>A group of 2 highelf casters, 2 barbarian warriors, 2 dwarven clerics (class doesn't matter, but this is just an example).  Group is suddenly attacked by a group of 3 orcs.  Highelf caster tries to get an AoE spell off without hitting group, but accidentally hits one Barbarian warrior.  Barbarian warrior is taking heavy orc damage as well and dwarf cleric is trying to heal him...but wait.  He was just attacked by a player and cannot be healed.  One dead barbarian.<P>Another scenario, same group.  Barbarians go in to tank.  One of the dwarf clerics decides he also wants to melee, but accidentally clicks his groupmate instead of enemy.  Barbarian is hit once by cleric, rendering him unhealable by group.<P>This scenario only works to the advantage of darkies. (especially on Tallon, where darkies are as huge as all other light teams combined.)  And greatly impacts PvE for light teams, since they really need to group with each others teams to be effective sometimes.<P>I see the other instances mentioned to be problems, and (at least for tallon) Xteamers are labeled as such and hunted.  <P>Perhaps you can use the over 8 levels and cannot cast benificial spells on teammates (which would aid in curbing powerlevelers too)<P>As for the suggestion of no benificial spells if person is attacked by another player...you can see by my examples that I'm not so sure if that is a good idea.  Light teams need each other.  Humans support elves who support dwarves against the dark threat.  A team of differing light teams are already severely disadvantages due to AoE spells.  If you add to that a team of darks who can take any lighty mix team due to the fact that the lighties can't support each other, you've got some real PvP problems that are now worse than the ones you started with.<P>So now you have grave impact with PvE for lights, and PvP for lights with the proposed change.<P>Impose an 8 level limit for buffing and healing.  That's the only suggestion that has been mentioned thusfar that would not have a negative impact on PvE or PvP as it was intended to be implemented.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personally I like Gordon's idea (6 more signs).  Ive only been on VZ a few weeks now, but was amazed at how often i would run into a elf or halfing in the middle of Halas, try to make him run away or die, and have a barbarian brother healing him and verbally abuse me.  I look at it this way, if you wanna be on the same side as other team membersm you pay the price and take the risks.  Much like playing a Iksar.  A penalty must be assesed for the advantages you recieve.  This is not a blue server, its a team oriented combat intensive server.  <P>Khargas<BR>Shanks<BR>Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok... I havent read through all of this but I get the idea of it and thats what counts...<P>Same Team Healer - Just get someone of another team to kill them (hard for dark races but I'm sure most darkies have a lighty secondary thats decent levels to beat on or their darkies are theri secondaries). Keeping in mind that a DE healing my other non-evil races are gonna be getting some woopass opened up on them after I get back to full  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Out of range Healer - How do you determine out of range? Out of your attack range? Within the range of the person your attacking? Someone standing up on the top of a roof that you cant get to? Personally I'd rather this just STFU, go for the spirit of the law not the letter for this one. If some guy has a level 50 cleric sitting behind him and he's level 5 or something then petition, if its a level 20 getting heals by a 30 or so then dont *****. As for making it so you can only heal/buff those on your own team that is rediculous, it would far greater affect the PvE game than the PvP game (At any given time in HH you will have members of the three light races in your group and my Woodelf Druid wouldnt be able to heal any of the other two).<P>Heal/SOW - I personally think this is honorable, unless the the fight is close in which case dont intervene. If its pointless heal the one on your side, give'em SOW and tell them to get lost or you'll let the other guy kill them. They can settle their differences on a different battlefield *OR* settle their difference with you when they level up some.<P>Please dont make an official rule about this. An unofficial rule will be fine enough. The problem isnt with the x-teaming healers as much as it is with the SUPER out of range healers (level 50 with a level 20, ect..) since they sit and med while their friend fights then heals when they're low. Neverending mana supply for heals because he can just sit and med right infront of you they can never run out of mana at that rate thats what I feel is against the rules.<P>Keep in mind that the higher levels you go the bigger your level range with which you can group eventually it gets to where 10 levels difference are still getting XP.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt; How about... If a player takes damage from another PC, they can only receive beneficial spells from someone in their own team for X-minutes or until they zone.<P>I can see 2 scenarios of exploitation that can occur with this...<P>Exploit 1 - Elf/Shorty/Human go to kill dervs, DE comes along while they're fighting and casts an AE on them thus they have all 'taken damage' from another PC and cannot heal/buff eachother and are all low on health so the DE moves in for the kills.<P>Exploit 2 - While not directly related to the scenario above, if you attack a darkie group (and keeping in mind its a Light vs Dark server) they can offer full heals/buffs to their group but if your in a mixed group you get the shaft. This would only seek to cause the darkies to become the supreme team on the server to the almost exclusion to the other races and it becomes an all evil-blue server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nice idea! The only possible problem I see is that lights group together often, so they might be in a little disadvantage. The server Tallon Zek used to be purely good verss evil, but it is now changing a bit because the dark team is crumbling a bit, so there are more race-only teams now. So this might be one of the best solutions!<P>Just another idea, if someone of say 20 levels higher than you casts a spell of healing or buff on you, it is swapped for a spell that is more appropriate of your level. For example a cleric casts complete heal on a level 4 char, the clerics mana drains like he would have casted complete heal, the recast time is exactly as i he caster complete heal, but the effect that the level 4 feels is only that of a minor heal. The same goes for swapping breeze for clarity and so on. This would cut down on powerlevelling and the invulnerable healer problem becomes a lot less (though it still exists).<P>I like your solution better though.<P>Neferti<BR>TZ<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Still I'd like most if we would have a Good vs Evil Server. Many people play it this way already on TZ and quite a lot do on VZ, too. With the changes Abashi mentioned there would be no more immortal healer on a GvE Server. On a normal Team Server many people would not be very happy about it because many lightie Guilds are mixed from all three lightie teams. And for me (Shortie) there would be no more chance to help the Elven newbies against the Shortie Raids. As long as there is no Level Limit for PvP for Newbies the elves have no safe newbie zone. So many people posted that they tried out a Team Server but were killed over and over and so left again. Sure - these people are often more roleplayers than PVP-Fans and hardcore PvP-Fans would say "these guys are too blue for our server" but I really would like to welcome some more roleplayers on our server. <P>The main problem I see is the one that Abashi posted: "Brega, you can say that the system is flawed and should be fixed, but none of the solutions that have been presented have been endorsed by plurality, much less a majority of the players. There are certainly some pretty rash and obscure things that we could do to try and "fix" this to your liking, but what of everyone else?"<P>Ok ... so show support for the Good vs Evil Idea if you like it or it will never happen. I already posted my Ideas about PvP, Roleplay-Server and GvE here :<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003211.html<P>You can't make all people happy. But what I posted there is a solution that comes close to it in my eyes and should help Item loot fans, roleplayers and coin only fans to have "their" world...<P>For sure Verant will not bring up a new server with special roleplay settings after the "Teams-Desaster"...<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I am sure that the population would be much higher if Verant had implemeted a lvl cap for newbies. This was suggested months ago but there never was an official statement and nothing happened. So i am sure that many people (some also posted here) looked in the PvP-Servers and were killed over and over and returned to their "blue" server. I personally play on Teams because of the realistic environment and usually only defend myself and my group. This might be a "blue" attitude but I like Teams (especially GvE) much more than playing on a "blue" server. And the big majority of players plays on a blue server because they don't know how great environment is here. As long as the people that just start over on a PvP-Server are "easy meat" and have no time to find friends until they re killed the first time a large percentage of players quits the char after the first few levels...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Go for it, I like the idea.  If you are NOT going to support this, then you might as well change Team PvP to straight PvP, Rallos Zek style.  The current implementation has just gotten to be silly -- the "crossteaming" is purely used as an exploit, it serves no other function in the game whatsoever.<P>If you can put this functionality on a 2 minute timer, that should be sufficient -- If I hack at an elf, then his dark elf friend should not be able to do anything to help him for 2 minutes.<P>(Having the flag stay set until you zone would just promote harassment... people doing a "run by slashing" purely to make the elf have to zone to clear his flag.)<P><BR>As a further note, support for this feature would probably be about 50-50.  BUT, if you change the teams, I think I can guarentee about a 90-10 support ratio in favor of it.<P>New teams:<BR>Team 1 -- Iksar, Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre<BR>Team 2 -- Everyone else<P>This is essentially the way both TZ and VZ are being played now.  If you officially rework those teams AND put in an "anti-crossteam heal/buff" code, I'm sure at least 80% of the server population would go for it.  It's been brought up on our message boards many times.  Since team 1 already has about 40% of the population, it also shouldn't create any serious imbalance.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I do not like this idea at all.  There is too much potential for the "invulnerable healer" fix to become an "unhealable party member" nerf.<P>Xteaming is a phenominon that we, as the server community, have created for ourselves.  I do not think that any kind of code band-aid will fix that.  The social community created xteaming, let the social community handle it and evolve on its own.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, people do get warnings from GM's on Tallon Zek for some of those invulnerable healer cases which you said they shouldn't be warned for.  It happens all of the time.  You need to talk to the GM's and Guides and explain to them what the official Verant policies are regarding PvP.  <P>Ob the proposed fixes:<P>I personally don't think Verant should do anything about invulnerable healers, because it simply isn't as big of a problem as people are making it out to be, and most of the fixes being proposed would be worse than the actual problem IMO, because of their effects on PvE combat.<P>That said, I think your proposal to make it so that people could not be healed by an "invulnerable" healer for a set amount of minutes after being attacked by a PC would work for ther server.  I think the time limit should be short, like no more than 1 or 2 minutes.  That would solve most invulnerable healer situations, without too seriously limiting players' ability to buff and heal group-mates.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yes there are problems with that suggested fix.<P>One of them would be that a smaller group could kill a single member of a bigger group then run away before the bigger group can exact revenge.<P>For example a DE sees a gnome and high elf all within the 8 level limit. The DE kills the gnome and then runs away before the high elf can kill the DE. The high elf couldnt prevent the death of his/her comrade because of the inability to heal.<P>Other problems too but just this one should be enough reason to not change it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=002666&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=002666&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
