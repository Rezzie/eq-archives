</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower than a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other changes that went in. <P>So now people who used to have large exp penalites to offset their general usefulness in a group will in fact be leveling FASTER than Monks?

</FONT><HR>After sweating blood and tears and ungodly long nights for the last year, I finally hit 60 with my troll SK earlier this week.  Reading these changes makes me want to vomit.  The entire concept of being a hybrid was to have a longer road cause we were 'better' then the average player.  Of course those abilities were never put into the game, but that is another issue entirely.  I was so proud to  have conquered the longest road to 60 in the game.  Why the change NOW?  Is VI becoming so weak they must cater to every whim and wimper of the casual gamer to make the game easier and easier?  Plane of Growth is an absolute joke yet wields unheard of items and armor for little to no effort.  This is just another step in making the game so user friendly that every bob, joe and mike are even in terms of items.  That should not be the focus of a world wide game in which competetion and risk vs reward are supposed to rule the game.  I cannot tell you how disappointed, nothing new with you guys, I am over this action.  I would like to see some reward to those who actually took the long road, but I guess that is too much to ask.  I am saddened by the joy this change brings, and I feel sorry for you all.  I hope the revenue is worth it, cause that is all it boils down too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Amazing... One day Shamans are told many of their classes concerns are going to be brought up to the live teams on the coming Monday, and the next day, there is a post saying all classes are now evenly balanced.<P>How anyone can consider a class that for 49 levels makes it mark by having some of the DoT spells in the game, best debuffs/slowdowns in the game, second best healing capabilities, second best buffs, decent pet between 34 and 49, etc... and then post 50 loses all of these abilities...  balanced is unbelievable.<P>Some classes are still in need of changes.<BR>Some classes are still in need of changes.<BR>Some classes are still in need of changes.<BR>Some classes are still in need of changes.<P>Oh and some classes are still in need of changes.<P>Esperience bonuses are nice. I may even try a few more dungeons now myself.<P>But as I head to lvls where I can participate on planes and dragon raids, I wonder more and more about IF anyone will ever invite me on one more than I do about when. I know I will take my Shaman to at least lvl 50. But will anyone even want a shaman on their raids?<P>From what I am seeing now... not very often.<P>WAKE UP VERANT! IF YOU ARE NOT A WARRIOR, ROGUE, CLERIC, WIZARD OR ENCHANTER, YOUR CHANCES OF GOING ON A RAID ARE SLIM!

</FONT><HR>Hummmmm,<P>The only part I don't agree with is more xp for the higher level players in groups. A good counter example Verant's post would be a lvl 29 druid vs. lvl 33 druid. For all practical purposes they contribute equally to the group.<P>Maybe if this was done in mutiples of say 5 or something it would be ok, meaning that if you had a group that was all within 5 levels of each other xp would be the same for each.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I personally love phat l00t, and love the merchant aspect it adds to the game. But some equipment {see wurmslayer example} is just overpowered at lower levels, where a majority of the items seem to end up.

</FONT><HR>Well, after reading every single post.  This is a VERY good change, and one which will have me much more excited to play the game.<P>My only question has to do with hell levels.  Before, being in hell, you would receive a rather large chunk of the XP per kill.  With these new changes, that will no longer be in effect.  My question is this, will the group bonus's and such offset this so that hell levels won't be more difficult?  Or is it not enough?  Will hell level's now be a MUCH more daunting task?  Anyone here that could hopefully help me, would be helpful.<P>Thanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thing to consider...<P><BR>You must realize that a huge number of level 50+ encounters must be done with mutilple groups, which means that not everyone participating in the event will earn xp.  But they contribute just as much as anyone during the event.<P>As it is post 50, you pretty much have to camp a set of spawns in a single group to gain xp rather then 'Doing' a dungeon.<P>There must some way to give everyone involved with a raid xp for every kill.  Also in this situation, considering the difficulty and the amount of organization it takes to pull a mutigroup event off there should a considerable xp modifier added to each kill.  An addition raid channel should also be considered.<P>The post 50 game is whole different animal, and suggests like these should be considered.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, nice work verant, but i have a question, most of the dungeons you added experience bonuses for were lower level dungeons... Perhaps you should look into some of the upper level dungeons such as charasis and city of mist, perhaps even chardok, because if you look at those zones compared to say sebilis, its just hard to get there and get groups together... Plus the fact that sebilis has far better loot (including trakanon of course) that everyone goes there to group, get experience and get really nice quality loot. I have had my charasis key for well over 6 months now, and I've been there once, the reason I don't go, is that people don't just zone in and look for a group, people only go there if they physically look for players whether they be friends or random people on the /who all xxx class listings, to go there... So if there was a place close to charsis to bind (for good races or basically anyone who decided to fight in karnor's castle (if they are evil)) Walking to charsis from Fiornia isn't really desireable, so people tend to stay away from places they can't get evaced to and find a pickup group inside. Chardok is another place where the loot does not exceed the risk, that is a one way zone, with monsters that can attack you at zone in, and bad pathing which makes for some very big (bad and unwanted large pulls) that cause trains that are more risky than sebilis, for example if you died in there you would have to run all the way back, because you can't just have your necro zone in and summon corpses and relax while you get rezzed, the tanks are at their bind location and in the meantime you have to zone in, while most likely being attacked and perform a corpse retrieval which is much more difficult to sebilis. So what I'm saying is that for the extra risk involved chardok should have a higher experience bonus as opposed to sebilis. My main concern is that you didn't modify very many of the higher level dungeons, sebilis is becoming so crowded, and sebilis and karnor's castle seem to be the hot spots, lets spread some of the higher level players out some too, by providing some bonuses on higher level dungeons with more risk and less reward. Look at it this way, one well balanced group can venture pretty much anywhere in sebilis, given that they are carefull, I don't think that is true for chardok, you need more than one group to venture anywhere inside the zone as one party, anyway i'm rambling and I know I don't know how to start new paragraphs, what can I say, I'm an ogre, thanks for listening.<P>   Machismo Sirpuntalot<BR>Level 56 Warrior of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I want to know is, what will be done for those of us that have suffered the entire time Veriant refused to listen? I'm a casual player, something that has hurt me severely. But I now have a lvl 42 ShadowKnight. If all these changes are being made, what will be done to convert all that wasted experience? I should, by all rights, be past 49 by now. But was penalized, and it's just now that this is being fixed.<P>I doubt I'm the only one angry about this. So I propose a soloution:<P>Set up a converter much like you would your polls. Add to the patch the converter itself, so it resides on the client. Leave it operational until the next patch. When a user logs on, it will retrieve from the server all of the characters on that server, much as it does during the character selection screen. Convert this experience, and send the updates to the server. It will be the users job to get the new spells/etc.<P>It IS possible. So don't bother saying it isn't. And if it's too hard, I don't care. Some of us have spent thousands of hours playing this game, getting screwed by those refusing to listen to us. Take the 5 hours it may require to program a simple, tiny converter, and add it to the patch. I can guarantee you, people will be much, much happier than they are now. And you may get those people that don't play anymore, back.<P>Like I said, I'm not the only one...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>2 things I wanted to touch on here.<P>First off, what happens to the hybrid penalty when fighting a solo creature?  Not that most of us have any prayer of soloing anyway, but the current system has us paying a 40% experience penalty on the if-come chance that we occasionally solo something.  I don't really care one way or the other as it is so infrequent, but I thought I would ask for completeness sake.<P>Secondly, correct me if I am wrong, but the exact change you made to Hybrids death loss is very similar to the change you decided to bypass with making Warriors and Rogues level at the same rate as everyone else.  In other words, in the instance of the Warrior and Rogue quicker advancement, you cited 'didn't want to nerf anybody even though it is probably appropriate...' (or words to that effect), while when considering the Hybrid Death Bonus, you decided to do away with it.  So, in an effort of equity, I question why you would remove the Hybrid Death Bonus and NOT remove the Warrior/Rogue Leveling Bonus.  If it is a technical issue, please state it as such, for it looks rather unfair and unequitable to do one without the other, from where I am standing.<P>Lastly, I am very pleased with the changes you are making, regardless of my two concerns noted above.  I also wanted to reinforce that I think there is still some inequities in the high level game between Hybrids and everyone else, and would hope that you haven't closed the doors finally on researching and evaluating these issues.  Bravo on some very needed changes to the game.<P>Derringer Labyrinth<BR>58 Knight of Pak'Cafan<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aradune, you really need to do something about how unfair this change is to any 50+ hybrid. I don't need to point out how big of a rip this is to any 55+ hybrid.<P>As far as the race penalties, you have got to be kidding me. 20%... HALF of what was so broken(40% hyrbid penalty) it NEEEDED to be fixed to protect game "balance" and you can just shrug it off?? Why don't you just upgrade the abilities they have and let them be a more powerful character in the end. Afterall, they PAID the exp penalty you set(all you really need to do is let trolls regen at the same rate they would be as if they are sitting ALWAYS... then take away the totally unfair resist heat on the troll geez.) Trolls are the only race that have too many negatives and not enough positive to balance it. <P>Also take a look at all the incredible items that small/medium races can use and large races cannot(you know like granite spaulders- the best shoulder item in the game).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
