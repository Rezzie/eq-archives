</FONT><HR>well first off, whenever something disrupts you, either hits you or a trade attempt or anything normally needing your attention, the game automatically pauses and exits, so the whole 'oh i didnt see my hp going down' excuse wont work...secondly, have you ever been on a long camp? i mean really long, like 20+ hours waiting for 1 person to spawn (not talking dungeon camps cause there are other mobs to kill, but waiting for gynok or that chick that drops the gbs). By the way you wrote your article i am assuming not, EQGems, dare i say it, is one of, if not _the_ best addition they have made to the game in its 2 year existance. This makes long camps not so long, it makes medding not so horrible, it makes regening hp not so painful...it makes eq not so ****ty.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>actually i have no problem with the time it takes to regen hp/mana, how long the uber item camps are, or any of the downtime related to everquest. <P>The game isnt supposed to have everyone at lvl 60 with exactly the same items, fighting in so called 'dangerous' dungeons very easily because they regen their hp and mana so fast that they can beat out the pop time of mobs without getting owned at low health...<P>there needs to be diversity in eq, there needs to be players that are lvl 60, with the best items in the game that took them x odd days to camp, and there needs to be people that are lvl 60 with mid class items, then there needs to be ppl at lvl 20 with awesome items, and ppl at lvl 20 with crap items...everyone cant be the same, and the downtime for all these different aspects is the only thing that moderates it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, from a role playing point of view, it kind of makes sense that your attention would not be focused on what is going on in the world of everquest.<P>When you are meditating, you should block out all external stimuli.<P>When I proposed this idea:<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056923.html<P>The idea was for the "game" to be more like power meditating.<P>Instead of it being just something to do during down time, it would provide a distraction from the world of Everquest, and would allow you to gain mana at a faster rate then just looking at a book, and watching the conversations and health of your group.<P>If your in a group, low on mana, and you are in a situation where you need to be focused on the encounter, then you SHOULDN'T be in /gems.<P>If your group just finished an encounter, and you want to get mana up fast, then go into /gems for a few minutes, to get your mana back faster.  The better you do at the game, the faster you will get mana back, but if sheets hit the fan, and you are not ready, well, that's the price you pay for being able to get the extra mana.<P>If you are soloing, and you don't really need to pay attention to the group dynamics, then /gems just relieves the boredom of meditation.<P>I don't know if they implemented /gems to provide for faster mana generation then normal medding.  But, it sure seemed to go a lot quicker to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Medding IS downtime...whether you're in a group or solo, whether you're doing it while the rest of the group is fighting (or while your pet is) or during a lull in the action. It is not downtime for everybody, it is personal downtime. It is unavoidable. No matter how you play, unless you never cast any spells (and if you play THAT way why are you a caster instead of a tank?), you will eventually need to med to regen your expended mana. Downtime.<P>Nobody (or at least very few) wants downtime eliminated entirely, but it WOULD be nice if it were reduced to a more comfortable level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Since I can only at best ask them to not play it (and they could refuse and I'd never know they were playing it) IT DIRECTLY CAN IMPACT ME... <P>I do not wish to die due to this, and if I can't count on a Cleric not to dump all his mana on nukes, then how can I count on someone to not play this game and endanger me??<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if im in guk or karnors i cant simply go, hey you know what, ive got 25hp, **** this i dont feel like waiting, ill just run out of karnors until my hp goes back up to 2000...<P>I see no point to go somewhere just to get and item, and sit there waiting for it as well... I get maybe a total of 10 hours per week to be IN GAME, and I want to spend them having fun and killing things (preferrably in a group) and not looking at a mini-game while I wait for UberItemguy_00 to spawn... Items I need I save money for, and I earn money by killing things I get experience for (not farming items).  <P>I also go in and roleplay my characters, and meditating could be explained as a mental exercise in the realm of a game, but I ceratinly want people to pay attention in a group situation (and again I would have no real way of GUARANTEEING they were)... <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;When players begin dying, then complaining, petitioning the GMs, and getting upset because of deaths I see this blowing up in Verant's face... <P>So what is the difference between watching tv and not paying attention to your health and playing gems and not paying attention to your health? There is no difference.<P>I've played a healer in group. Most melee's don't give you time to get bored while medding. They pull as fast as they can get away with, without killing the whole group. Don't know very many experienced pullers that wait until every caster is at full mana before pulling again? 60%? ok pulling.<P>Boredom in this game comes from the soloists using a full load of mana to kill something, then having to sit for 5 to 10 minutes waiting for full mana again. Groups pull something about 1 every 40 seconds to a minute. Good groups do anyway. Healers are usually kept quite busy.<P>And since you are looking for an excuse to blame healers and verant for negligence, how about those pullers who don't even wait for 20% mana before dropping a train on the group? What is their excuse?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fist of all I was not actually making a comment that I would petition the GMs about it, but I do not see the GEMS feature actually breeding harmony between players, and that THE ANGRY FEW would take death at the hands of Tetris addict reason for a direct confrontation, and with the added stress of a corpse run this could breed bad blood between players (especially those who are stuggling compared to those who are say "well equipped", carefree, or fall into the bad player realm already)...<P>Seriously from a role playing standpoint I want the person meditating to be trying to say in tune with the environment by paying attention to the chat (and focusing his energy from the environment) rather than playing Tetris (or reading a book, vaccuuming, or whatever)... The reason that it bothers me is that from a Roelplay standpoint we will see zonewide arguements about deaths by this, as well as spam about scores and COPETITION (like EQ doesn't already have enough of that)....<P>I think that Verant has finally destroyed EQ completely (with GEMS) and is completely abandoning their "vision", even in the light of the naming policy enforcement that they were trying to use to retain their integrity of the "World"... In the world of Norrath I envisioned was for "playing your role" (ie RP)and I personally didn't want any reminder of the outside world, and the names (and rampant twinking) were a major detraction from that. <P>GEMS is even worse of a detraction and reduces EQ to the level of a chat room, meaning that Verant has abandoned their "vision"... Not only will they need to hire more GMs when people start complaining about GEMs spam, but they will also be making competition and in some cases disputes between players worse....<P>For those of you saying that GEMs is the perfect thing to alleviate "downtime" when waiting for things to spawn, well then what happens when someone comes in and steals the spawn?? <P>I already think that "sitting" a spawn is an incredible waste of time, that breeds arguements, removes exp from people who should be earning it and destroys the economy, and Verant (who has been opposed to this) is now encouraging it. For a group camping experience this is obviously different, but Verant adding to the competition and arguements is what I don't understand.<P>Maybe Verant just admitted "It's broke and we can't fix it" and decided that they didn't care anymore and want it to end so they want everyone to leave, because I as a roleplayer would've probably stayed when the mass migration happened (ahem new games), but this was seriously not created with the intention of retaining the "immersiveness" of Everquest....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
