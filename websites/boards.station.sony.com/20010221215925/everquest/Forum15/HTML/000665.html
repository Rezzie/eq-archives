</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>BARDS:<P>ITEM:  Drum Animation.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Bards look like they are carrying a flute when they are carrying a drum.  And when they play that flute/drum, the strum it.<P>STATUS:   None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Song Damage Post 50.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Most bard songs are intended to be used throughout the life of the bard.  But bard damage songs don't seem to grow enough in their damage for levels over 50.  Considering the difficulty of these levels, and the dramatic increase in the power of the monsters at those levels, perhaps a damage increase is warranted.  And example from a player:  "Chant series as an example (a targeted DoT), from level 40 to 50, the song increases from 39 damage for 3 ticks to 48 damage for 3 ticks (+23%). From levels 50 to 60 it'll go from 48x3 to 57x3 (+19%). You designed the level 50+ spells to represent a larger increase in power than just 10 levels."  The damage increases as a flat number (9 points) over both level ranges.  But levels 40-50 are much more linear, both in experience and in difficulty, than are 51-60.  So perhaps increasing the damage of bard songs in this level range is in order.<P>STATUS:  None<P>NOTE: Chords of Dissonance, Brusco’s Boa****l Bellow, Denon’s Disruptive Discord, Denon’s Desperate Durge, Fufil’s Curtailing Chant, Tuyen’s Chant of Frost, and Tuyen’s Chant of Flame.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Cassindra's Insipid Ditty.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is a level 57 song, and it's a single target.  It drains 1.5 mana/sec at level 57 (according to a player).  This does seem low.  I am told that this song would take four minutes to drain the same mana that an enchanter can drain with one spell in 11 seconds.  It also has a wis/int debuff component so it will not stack with itself (and it is therefore more useful than just a drain), that means that only a single bard can be using it on a target.  An increase in the mana drain does seem warranted.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Resists.<P>DESCRIPTION:  One of the key things that bards offer their groups, especially at higher levels, is resistance boosting.  Bards would like to see a greater value for resists that get up to or near 255.  There is also a rumor that there is a roll-over bug when resists exceed 255 that should be dispelled.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEMS:  Haste Song Stacking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Haste songs don't seem to stack with spells in the same way that other songs do.  The problem seems to be that only the largest haste will actually work (though the icon will appear for lesser haste effects), and the bard song is never the largest haste.  They would like haste songs to add in all cases to other haste effects.  The thought is that since there is a cap on haste anyway, why not just let songs help them reach it sooner.  Another idea would be to reduce their haste and let them stack, or make a new line that parallels these songs and is stackable, but with a smaller haste.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Song Effects on Items.<P>DESCRIPTION:  With the way bard songs work, putting them on items is really rather annoying to the bard.  They have to re-click the item every time the song stops, which in many cases can be only a few seconds.  Bard song items are, essentially, just extra spell gems for them, which they need to make hot keys for and twist just like any other song.  Perhaps these items could play until clicked off, or at least greatly increase the duration of songs on items.  But doing so would, basically, allow bards to have tons of songs up at once.  This would be a huge imbalance for the class.  So, I guess, this item is listed to point this problem out and hope that someone has an idea about how to fix it.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bard 'Snare' Songs.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Chain, Largo's Absonant Binding (51), and Assonant Strane (L54 AE movement slowdown) are all random in duration.  Bards would like to see at least some minimum duration on the effects of these songs.  They are also of the opinion that Selo's Consonant Chain it too easily resisted.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pick Locks.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Bards get pick locks rather late in life, and they also have a skill cap.  They get it at 40th level, and the skill caps at some number not much higher than 40.  The problem here is that they get the skill so late that there are no locks for them to pick that are not either trivial or beyond their reach.  Obviously this would be less of a problem if there were more mid-level locks to pick, so further content alone might fix this situation.  This may be something that can be left as is with the intent of fixing it with additional content.  But it might also be a good idea to raise the skill cap on this skill.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Singing Steel Boots, Greaves and Breastplate.<P>DESCRIPTION:  If there are going to be items that summon food and water, how about letting them summon a larger amount of food and water.<P>The boots give an error message when used, even though they deliver their summoned item properly (annoying bug).<P>The breastplate does Invigorate, which heals far less (when you include the casting time) than could be healed just by singing the song.  Considering that bard songs cost no mana, and healing songs are almost always memorized, the effect on the breastplate isn't going to be used.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  The "song ends" "song starts" "song ends" bug.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is still around.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mana Regeneration (Meditation).<P>DESCRIPTION:  Denon's Desparate Dirge uses 800 mana.  Death uses up all of it… Because bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, 800 mana takes about 40 minutes to regenerate sitting.  Perhaps we should allow bards to meditate like other casters to reduce that downtime.  Keep the restriction on mana regeneration songs and spells, but give them full meditation and the benefits from that.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Song of Shields (49).<P>DESCRIPTION:  This song has no message. Previously it was spamming the group with messages, and now it gives none.  It would be nice if to have it generate a single message like all other bard songs.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Aria of Eagles (31, levitate) and Song of Travel (51).<P>DESCRIPTION:  These songs don't give any message when they're about to expire.  The message were removed in response to complaints about the spam.  From a player:  "The correct fix is to increase the duration of these songs by one tick so the message isn't generated for at least one tick, by which time the song's next pulse will refresh it. You had this correct fix in place with Aria. Then you removed the message entirely from both songs when you "fixed" Song of Travel."<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Kellin's Lucid Lullaby.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some players feel that this song is far too resistible, that the secondary resist is too high.  It seems to be useful enough at the lower levels, and becomes nearly useless later.  If this is intentional, then that's fine.  If not, lowering the secondary resist a bit might be nice.  A bard gets this song at level 15.  It becomes relatively worthless at 30.  Most bards songs either retain their relative usefulness, or actually increase in power as levels increase.<BR> <BR>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Old song fades and cancels new song.<P>DESCRIPTION:  If a song ends at the same time that the new version of the same song starts, the new song will fade out when the old one does.  This also happens to spells, but it’s much less common because they overlap less frequently.  This is annoying the heck out of the bards.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  ‘End of Song’ Spam.<P>DESCRIPTION:  When a bard stops singing, people see "%t's song ends" twice.  This seems to be unnecessary spam.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bardic Charm.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There seems to be a bug where the bard gets a success message from a charm song, but he still does not have any actual control over the pet.  The pet will also occasionally attack party members, but the party can’t attack it back because it is a pet.  Also, bard charm seems to be capped at a level lower than enchanter charm.  Is this how it should be?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Song Twisting.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The problem is, the ability to twist songs is what separates the bad bards from the reasonably good bards (it takes more than the ability to twist to be a great bard, though).  So while some bards are calling for us to come up with a way that they can twist songs without all the repetitive motion, others consider it part of the challenge of the class and want us to leave it as it is.  Perhaps songs could keep going once started.  Allow more than one song to run at a time this way, restrict it by either limiting this to three at a time, or have the number that could be sung at the same time by level, perhaps one at a time to 19th level, two at a time from 20th to 39th level, and three from then on.  But also allow songs to be turned off as they are now, to continue to allow twisting.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mid-Level Instruments.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There are not enough mid-level magical instruments for bards.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Brusco’s Bombastic Bellow.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This 55th level song does about 222 points of direct damage, and has a recast time of five minutes.  Perhaps the recast time could be lowered.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Travel Song Range.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The range on some of these songs was increased recently.  But it might be a good idea to raise the range even further.  Also, folks would like Shauri’s Sonorous Clouding to have a 4 tick duration like levitate, as well as a larger range.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Casting Animations on New Songs.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that some of the new songs have casting animations attached to them, not singing animations.  It would be nice if to have song animations on all songs.<P>STATUS:  None<P>NOTE:  Songs affected include, but are not restricted to:  Chants line 30/38/46, Nivs level 47, Shield of Song 49, Selos song of travel 51, and I perhaps the 55th level cantana.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Psalms of Purity (29) and Vitality (37).<P>DESCRIPTION:  IF these two songs are supposed to cure poison and/or disease eventually (after much singing), they do not.  If they should, then let’s look into this as a bug.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Song ‘Stacking’.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Cantana (of Replenishment - 34 and Soothing – 55) and Clarity (and Harvest) will stack, sort of.  If the target has the effects of a Cantana on him and someone tries to cast a Clarity (or Harvest) spell on the target, the Clarity (or Harvest) will not stick.  But if the Clarity spell is on a target, the bard Cantana will take effect just fine.  The Cantana(s) also have the same problem with regeneration-type spells.  This appears to be a bug.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Particle Effects for Songs.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice to be able to turn on and off song effects as a separate toggle.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mesmerization and Fear Song Stacking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that bard mez songs, as short lived as they are, overwrite all enchanter mesmerization spells.  It seems as though they should not take affect over any other mez spells.  The same thing applies to bardic fear songs, they probably should not overwrite fear spells, and should probably be overwritten by them.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Cinda’s Charismatic Carillon.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that wind instruments do not improve the power of this song over just singing it.  A player mentioned that this song seems to be increased by stringed instruments.  Perhaps this one is just labeled wrong as needing wind instruments, and should just be changed to be labeled as using string.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Fufil’s Curtailing Chant.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that this song doesn’t really reduce damage and resists at a level on par with the others of its line.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Song Icons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  For everyone but the bard, bardic song effect icons are constantly blinking.  It would probably be better just to have them remain solid, it’s less bothersome.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Instrument Building Skill.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It sure would be great if there was a skill for making instruments, including ‘cultural’ instruments.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bard NPCs are wimps.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice if NPC bards at least sang their songs when under attack.  They also do much less melee damage than similar level NPCs.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Firiona Vie Trainer for Bards.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There is no bard trainer in Firiona Vie.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Temple of Solusek Ro weapon quest.<P>DESCRIPTION:  One of the bard quest NPCs says something about checking back later for information on a special bard weapon.  Since this has been his speech for over a year, we should either add this quest or just remove the text.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lute of the Howler.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Perhaps there is a story reason for giving bards the ability to turn into werewolves.  But we should be very careful when we give the more class defining abilities to other classes.  The ability to look like a werewolf is the signature illusion for enchanters.  Even if we don’t remove this lute, we most certainly should think twice before giving such abilities to classes in the future.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Spell Gems.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be great if spell gems just turned gray rather than blanking out when in use.  This would allow bards to see what songs they have running at any given time.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Hit Points.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Bards seem to have caster hit points, lower than any hybrid.<BR> <BR>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Puretone.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some players think that it is not having the effect it should and is not making a difference with the songs they sing.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  New Mez Song Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about a mesmerization song that actually makes the target dance?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Incandescent Bracer:<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems this item is only wearable in the waist slot.  It should probably be a wrist item.<P>STATUS:  None<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM:  Melee damage doesn't scale appropriately at high levels.<P>DESCRIPTION:  We get no add-ons, so it doesn't scale up as fast as other meleeing classes.  Perhaps giving us a watered-down version of extra damage for addition STR would be nice.<P><BR>ITEM:  Party buff songs don't scale appropriately at high levels.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is the same problem that we have with Haste, DD/DOT songs and melee.<P><BR>More trivial but still annoying:<P>ITEM:  Level 54 songs have a 12-hour limit.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A 12-hour limit is a cool idea, and it works fine for a static buff or for a downtime spell.  But for combat spells, it's pretty useless.  It's not even very reasonable to swap these during downtime.  Nobody wants a Bard to stop singing, and these take 30 seconds apiece to mem.  Plus, it isn't in any way obvious when these songs are and are not effective.  You have to keep doing a /time.<P><BR>ITEM:  AC on Bard armor<P>DESCRIPTION:  Roughly half of all new Bard armor has been released with AC equal to the equivalent Ranger armor.  Rangers are a chain class.  I know it seems silly in a roleplaying sense for Bards to clunk around in Plate, but we're a Plate class for a reason.  Our defensive skill set is the worst of all classes other than pure casters, our hit points are low, and we get pounded a lot due to the way our songs work.  Perhaps the AC is lower for a reason that I don't get, but it's also possible that it's lower just because people keep forgetting that we're a Plate class (the fact that the AC has been subsequently raised on a lot of items suggests the latter).  Could you please review the Velious items (and SS, and the Imbrued Bracers)?  Also, quite a bit of Velious Plate is usable by all Plate classes BUT Bards.  I don't see a good RP reason for this, and again wonder if it's a mistake.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All in all, a good list. I echo others' desire to see melee skills given a boost (post 50-52). I like the caster animations very much. Please leave these as are, knowing that any additional animations would be welcomed. A single high-level (54-56) haste song that stacks and can be woven in with other songs would address the haste issue, imo. Solid overview. I look forward to the fruits of the Live Team's efforts.

</FONT><HR>Two things:<P>One. Dance of the Blade, the proc from our epic, prevents the casting of the new Velious spell: Boon of the Garou. However, if Garou is up, dance can stack with it. This is another stacking issue like cantana and clasity. Basically, this is our EPIC weapon proc. We'd like to be able to use it.<P>Two. Haste items + Enchanter spells already hit the haste cap. Adding bard haste stacking isn't going to do anything to the usefulness of a bard on a raid unless we get songs which go over the cap. There are already things which do this, like monk innate haste. All we are asking for is a way to be useful if there are enchanters around.<P>Creediki Starsong<BR>Bard of Veeshan<BR>Chronicler of the Fires of Heaven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well Great list as far as our songs are concerned but I cant believe there is nothing mentioned about our melee skills.<P>Absor I remember you stating in the initial Bard Talk that someone asked for Duel Wield and you stating that "Here is where you will get in trouble with me because Bards are a Defensive Class" And went on to state that when stating an Issue we should give arguements to support the issue.<P>I didnt post to any of the Bard Talks because I thought that the issues would be covered by other people.<P>But I have to post now becuase its very important and I think that Verant is overlooking some things.<P>Well in Regard to Melee skills only here goes:<P>Double Attack- It seems logical that Bards should have this to at least keep up with the other Defensive Hybrids that we are so often compared to.  <P>Yes I know that Paladins, Shadowknights(and I am just using these two for comparison purposes I am not calling for any kind of nerf ever) dont Dual Wield but all other Hybrids have a secondary attack. Bash for the Paladins and SK's and Kick for the Rangers. While these seem small they do add up overtime.  Also all three of the other Hybrids are able to use 2handed weapons.<P>Also Parry at 53 and Riposte at 58? Just doesnt make since if we are "Defensive" as you say we are. Not even taking into account the very low caps of 75, these seem to be something of an after thought. Especially when when compared to the hybrids that we are so often compared to. I am just going to use the SK as and example. Sk's get Parry at level 17 with an original cap of 175 and Riposte at level 30 with an original cap of 175.<P>And even Rangers who are the Offensive Hybrids get Parry at level 18 with a cap of 185 and Riposte at 35 with a cap of 150?<P>I am sorry I should have posted this earlier. And dont take this wrong I am not saying that we should have the exact same Defensive and offensive Skills as other hybrids to make us balanced. I am just asking for a bit of help in the Melee area in addition to what you have listed above.<P>Thank you<BR>Tilani</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Although twistig does get cumbersome, especially during downtime, I am VERY against the idea of making bard songs twist or play at the same time based on level. This would, in effect, nerf all younger bards. The survival of a young bard is often BUILT on his ability to twist his song, and I don't mean just in battle, but also in retreat. The ability to twist selo's with hymn saved my life on more than a few occasions, as eventually hymn would get my hp above the 1/3 mark so I could actually then outrun the creature.<P>I'm a level 32 bard. I don't know anything the higher level concerns of bards. But I do know that nerfing abilities in younger bards to try and help older ones is NOT the way to go.<P>If you are going to limit twisting by level, to compensate for sore hands, don't do anything at all.

</FONT><HR>Wonderful list!  I'm happy the drum animation is at the top... even though I know it doesn't mean anything  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>A couple comments.<P>- We have better HP than casters.  At level 30 my bard had about the same HP that my fiance's mage had at 40.  But ours *is* lower than other hybrids.<P>- For the clickable items, it might be useful to think in terms of what the benefits are for clickable items for spellcasters:<P>-- Free spell slot<BR>-- Mana-free<P>We don't have the mana concern (for the most part) that casters do.  What we have *instead* is the time issue.  Giving us free "time" songs is similar to giving casters free "mana" spells.<P>Solution: make these effects last 2-3x regular songs, so that we can pull one or two into a twist and get 4-5 songs going at once.<P>- On twisting: the new /pause feature helps a great deal on this.  You can cut the work of twisting in half by replacing the song gem hotkeys with socials that have a /stopsong, followed by a pause, before the /cast command:<P>/pause 5, /stopsong<BR>/cast 1<P>I use 5 because it works well in all environments for my system.  In low-lag situations I can use 3 somewhat reliably.  People with better systems than my PII 300 may be able to use 3 or 2 even in most situations.<P>However, the idea of "built-in" level-based twisting is fabulous, and would also help us catch up on the power curve at higher levels.  If you can sing two songs at once, you can twist up to 8. Or maybe you can twist 4 while keeping manasong up constantly  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Can't wait to see what comes of all of this!

</FONT><HR>Absor, a good list I think.<P>I'm in the camp oppossed to putting in any kind of auto twisting.  A good bard has to learn how to do it and be effective.  Giving some kind of auto twist will really hurt them later.<P>Also - I'm also gonna fully support the Lute of the Howler sentiment from my fellow bards.  If you feel that illusions are the sole domain of the enchanter, please give clarity back as the sole domain of the bard.<P>Finally - I unfortunately do not see any need to increase the bards melee ability.  At 55th my true strength lies in my ability to sing and twist.  My melee will never be as good as any of the other hybrids and I have no problem with that.  I dont even mind the low def caps, I've learned how to dodge behind tanks to transfer aggro.<P>Just my couple o'coppers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>gethane - at first I felt the same as you about 'auto twisting', but if you read closer, you will realize there is no nerf involved:<P>All bards would still be able to twist as normal, but mid level bards could have two songs twisting themselves automatically if they wanted, and higher level bards could have three songs going automatically if they wanted.<P>Any bard would still have the manual twisting abilities they have now though.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Song stacking issue is not limited to clarity. I think it's catana that both heals and gives mana.   I can cast regen on a target if the bard has stopped singing the song.

</FONT><HR>I really think its time to increase buff slots.  Currently I can never benefit from bard songs because there is no room for their icons.  And please don't tell me I should refrain from getting symbol, hero, kragg etc, so I can benefit from songs.<P>Perhaps add a separate buff window so there are no problems.<P>Basically if I have only 2 buff spaces and the creature I'm fighting casts 2 Ae's which use buff icons I have to ask the bard to refrain from singing so he doesn't fill up my buff slots causing my first 2 buffs to be overridden by the creatures AE's.<P>Having a separate buff window for just songs would prevent this from happening, but I'm also hoping for a general increase in slots.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  Bards have the most work of any class when it comes to using our songs.  We juggle 3, and sometimes 4 songs by quickly beginning and ending songs.<P>Let's take this example.  Song 1, 2, and 3 all have a hotkey on they keyboard.  Currently, in order to "twist" these songs, you must hit 1, wait for the song to take hold, hit 1 again (to end song 1), then hit 2, wait for 2 to take hold, then hit 2 again (to end song 2), finally you hit 3, wait for 3 to take hold, then end the process by hitting 3 again.  To repeat the process, start the sequence over.<P>I'd propose this.  Let the client work so I can hit 1 so the 1 song takes effect.  Then, when I want song 2 to be played, please make it so I only have to hit 2 once.  Translation:  make it so that when a song is already being played, simply hitting another song gem once would immediately begin playing that second song.  If this change were possible, it would REALLY make it easier on our poor frantically dancing fingers.<P>Thanks for the consideration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
