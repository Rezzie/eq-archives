</FONT><HR>Why on earth is it so hard to get money at low levels.  I'm only season 10, and almost 11, but can't do much to get money.  I'm a human ranger, and gave rep with most merchants, but can't get enough money to get any upgraded weapons or armour.  I purchased the Adept's Long Sword at Sayers, and it's great.  I need to badly to find some armour I can use, and some way to pay for it.  What would be the best way to get money at my level.  I can solo pretty well, and enjoy small groups, but make no money that way.

</FONT><HR>hmmm.... the big question. how do i make money?<P>I can tell you what I did, I don't know if it will work for you...<P>When I was your level, bears and bonechips were my best friends.  HQ bear pelts were fetching 30p each, and bonechips sometimes as high as 5p per stack of 20, depending on the zone.  There is also the less savory way to go...begging.  I know most people hate beggars, but it worked out good for me.  If you set yourself down at the zoneline to some high level area, many people give stuff away to newbies brave enough to make the trek to the zone.  This helps them out because they don't need to lug this stuff around, and it makes them feel better by helping out some poor slob such as yourself.  I got many goodies this way, most of which were useless to me, but can be sold for a tidy profit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hunting dervs can be great way to make cash since they carry bronze weapons which sell for 2 -3 plat each at a merchant.. They are also around your level so you get exp at the same time ^_^ There is always uncamped dervs too, making it easy to find a spot.. just beware of Dorn..

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry, I did not mean "begging" in the homeless bum sense, where you stop and pester every mid to high level PC who happens to be running thru your newbie zone, asking for "spare change" or running around shouting "I need a weapon!".  I meant begging in the sense that if you look shabby enuff, somebody might feel sorry for you and give you something they don't need, and can't sell because nobody who has the money wants to buy it.  I don't know how many times I've been in a position like this, where I try and sell an item, a good item, but the only people with the money to buy it, don't need it because they already have better equipment.  So the item gets given away...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Three thoughts.<P>Cuburt in the Qey sewers drops a dress that can sometimes be turned into Zamel for a plus 3 INT earring.  I sell this earring in East Commons for 30pp each.  I made about 180pp by doing this at lvl 8 to lvl 9.<P>Wisps in Erudin's crossing sometimes drop Greater Light Stones.  You can turn these GLS's in to one of the gypsies in NKarana for a research tome.  You can then sell the tome right back to her for about 8pp.  AND you also get exp.  I made about 200pp at lvl 12 to 15 doing this.  I also got about 4 or 5 bubs of xp.<P>Lastly.  I never give anything to people under about lvl 10.  Why?  Well, I once gave 10pp to a nice and intellegent newbie necro.  No problem.  But then the REAL owner of the account came on and started playing.  She wanted to play the game entirely different from the person who was originally playing the account.  She wanted to use EQ as a large chat room.  At lvl 3, I watched her die continuously for about an hour.  She had no desire to recover her corpse.  My hard earned 10pp decayed with one of her corpses.  Until you show dedication to get to at least lvl 10, I won't give you anything.<P>Lita.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pay attention to the high level players.  They have the money and they might happen to be looking for something.  When I'm in town or happen to be standing next to someone who appears (or through /whotarget reveals themselves to be) high level I usually start up a chat, being friendly primarily, asking what they're up to, what they do, where they've been.  Most importantly, don't beg.  If the conversation routes itsself toward some information on something they need, you might be able to help them out by getting it.  That might be a fire beetle eye or it might be a buyer for some plat jewelry.  But no matter what it is, if you can help them they usually aren't adverse to throwing a few plat your way.  I know that's what I do when I'm looking for something.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I get a tell, "HiYa !!!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  How is it going?<BR>It goes ignored, the person is acting like AN OLD friend how nice...... look over at my other monitor.....same sorry message.... I reply wondering whats up...Just a SORRY beggar going through every name in the zone begging for crap.<BR>I log on TWO different characters now (doing loot swaps)... AGAIN same messages to both...I log on again the next day and SAME MESSAGES!!!! I explained nicely GO HUNT something and leave people alone, you where level 5 yesterday and you are the same level today. go hunt something!  He explains he is begging folks so he can buy an Exe Axe and he has 200 plat already and needs some more........Anyways that is the way a majority of the losers are that beg. They want Phat loot at low levels from begging and not having to do anything.<BR>My first character had a splintering club until level 14 or so and crap armor. Not the way everyone starts albeit, but I made it to a high level so can you. Make the plat on your own and have repect for others, High level characters are not there as support for the entire EQ community and have unlimited wealth as you might think.<BR>You say well geesh man one tell does not hurt, get over it....well try a lot of tells every day from low life beggars.  Go anon man.... ummm why should I have to do that? I play a high level cleric (Among many other characters)and I rather have a person or friend in need to be able to request assistance (within reason)I also get many tells like...Where do I start the shaman uber weapon quest? ect ect, I love answering and helping people with that type of stuff. <BR>You say...you suck man... this is a multiplayer game.......I will tell you this, on occation I have met a person by chance and given them 1K plus in plat worth of stuff.  I will never EVER give a beggar anything.  I see someone that appears to be nice to others by watching OOC or whatever and I help them out.<BR>A beggar is NOT always a player with a REAL need for anything.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm almost to level 13, and have found that just an attempt at leveling has been sufficient to provide for almost all my monitary needs.  I am in the Death Squad, and they have helped out greatly.  Many high level folks in my guild gave assistance in getting my Short Sword Of Morin.  I love it, and I'm making better money each day.<BR>Thanks for all the thoughts.  You've all been very helpful.  I wish you would all include your names when you post replies.  At least I would be able to give a "hey" when in game.  I rarely have done any begging, as mentioned by most of you, and when, and if, I needed something, I was always willing to work for it.  I offered a 49th season Necro, to collect an entire backpack of bone chips to give them, for 100pp.  They were more than happy to do this.  The key I have found is, know what different people will want, and what you are able to get.  Once you find out this info, people are even a little suprised when you send tells offering things like this, then are more than happy, because it keeps you from annoying them, and they feel a little more "roleplayed".<P>Thanks again all.<P>Ellesiduil &lt;Death Squad&gt;<BR>Almost 13th season Ranger of Sure Fall.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to chime in and agree with pritcc -- wisps are great hunting - they give good exp, aren't too hard to kill and drop Greater Lightstones with pretty good frequency. You can find them in West Commonlands and every once in blue moon in the west end of East commonlands as well. I think you can turn those GLS's into one of the gypsies in Oasis, but I'm not sure - I never go all the way to Oasis, I just sell the GLS in the tunnel in ec for 7-10 pp. <P>The only drawback is that you have to kill wisps with magic - as a bard I just use my combine scimtar, since you're a ranger you might be able to kill them with your spells if you don't have a magic weapon, I don't know, I've never played a ranger before.<P>The dervs in North Ro or WC are good too - although you'll have to be in a group to fight them, most groups do alpha loot for bronze. You can also sell the derv rings for 1-2pp each and they tend to drop human and elven blood which can be used for making armor and will sell well.<P>Either way, good luck to you, making money is never easy but can be very rewarding. Just don't go begging! :-P<P>Lanianae<BR>Wood Elf Bard of the 13th song<BR>Maidens of Isis<BR>Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The best way to get money is to figure out the quest and how to use them.<P>For example: in Mistythicket, clerics will be popping in from time to time looking for honeycombs.  By the time they are on this quest they will have the pocket change to buy them (they'll get no exp for Bixies and nuking a newbie zone is considered bad manners.)  A newbie halfling who stocks up on these will find that clerics will GLADLY give them 2-3plat EACH for them.<P>For little money, you'll find the tailor skill is your best low-level money maker.  Get your tailor skills to 20 and make silk swatches for Monks that pass through. Save the spiderling silk to make bandages for the tanks (and you thought they were useless didn't you, hehe.)<P>Eventually, you'll find the trade skills will net you more money than fighting.  Later, you can get 100plat together and get Blacksmithing to a point where its VERY lucrative.<P>Use your character skills to your advantage.  If you're an enchanter, selling enchanted bars is very lucrative at any level (most players haven't figured out you can enchant metal with beetle eyes yet.)<P>Use your imagination and the plat will flow, kill-loot-sell and you'll find yourself poor well into the 30s.<P>***Word of Warning:  Charging for ports will come back to haunt you.  Do what you feel is right, but remember that other characters keep lists.  Later, you may find yourself paying 1000plat for the REZ, 5plat for a breeze, ect....***<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Speaking of trade skills, cooking can turn a profit.  At level 3 (enchanter) I did a Dark elf a favor and bought him food.  In return he gave me 3-4 plat.  I used that to buy Jug of Sauces (11cp each) at Parthar (1st inn in East Commons) and fish (27cp) at East Freeport docks.  Combine 1 jug and 1 fish to create 2 fish fillets.  The fillets sell for 55cp each, or 110cp for each success (72cp profit).  That recipe trivs at 82, I've since raised my cooking to 100 and I can make fillets at about 80-85%.  So, now at level 4 I have a full set of cloth, a Sr Apprentice Robe, Giant Snake Fang, all my level 1 and level 4 spells, 5 backpacks, etc... And 15pp in the bank.<P>Its not a fortune, but it gets me by.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I made alot of money and xp from lvls 10-14 at wisp Island (Erud's Xing).  You can kill willowisps and they drop Greater Lightstones.  Can sell Regular lightstones for 1pp each on the island.  Save the GLS and take them to North Plains of Karana.  There is a gypsy camp there that you turn them in for decent xp and a Concordance of research.  You can sell them there for 7-9pp ....GOOD money GOOD xp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/preach on<P>As a lowly level 2 Ranger, I won't beg.  If someone, like the nice person who buffed me last night does so without my asking.  I will thank them and get out of their face.<P>Nothing beats the excitement of selling a skin for 2 silver :&gt;  Hey, I've almost got my first plat, and its all mine, deaths and all.  Beats begging it, thats what its about.  I've learned more in one night than a lot of "beggers".  Got a bag off a kill sword off another, and that again made the game fun.  I guess what I'm trying to say is don't cheat yourself, you'll be happier with a little patience, and when some nice person comes along and gives you something for nothing - (Like those buffs, totally unexpected)  WAAAAAHOOOO!!!<P>OH yah, Im playing on (*&( Server and my name is *&$( if you have anything for me :&gt;<P>/preach off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>HQ Bear pelts are great (30-50 pp)<P>LQ and MQ pelts will sell via auc for about 1pp (make leather padding if necessary - at least 20pp per stack)<P>Bonechips 2-5pp per stack (depending on how desperate)and batwings (2-4pp and once 10pp per stack) In EC last night somebody was whizzing through the newbie zone killing everything in sight but not looting the corpse.  I was able to loot 2 stacks of bat wings in a couple of minutes.<P>Also bank runs for KoS can be lucrative.  I once made 30 pp when conducting about 5 serial bank runs for a KoS Ogre.<P>OTOH, you can't have too much money  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah, the age old question of how to make money.  Heh. Well, I can honestly say that with only one exception all of the neato things I have came soleyl from the sweat of my own brow.  Which as a monk is sometimes no easy feat.  Since begging is not an option to me under any circumstances, I applaud those fellow Terris-Thulians who agree with me.  Although looking pathetic will usually make me give up some hard earned cash anyway.  Hey I am a sap what can I say.  It does not mean that I do not make fun of them amongst my own circle of friends.  I can agree with the idea of killing wisps though. And silks have also been a great help.  Especially since even one bronze weapon will put me close to my poor monks 14 stone limit.  Not to mention all the copper that usually comes with it.  Make sure you know what to sell to merchants and of course what to buy from them as well. Armor from a merchant is usually a big nono.  Buy it from one of your fellow Terris-Thulians.  It will work out better in the long run.  I am poor, but I know why. I can say though, that a great number of people that I group with are more than willing to loot everything and share the proceeds afterwards. <P>Of course having a relatively low intelligence does not help my skill abilities, but Heady Kiolas sell quite well in a stack (or as I refer to them "Fuzzy Koalas".)  Hunt hard and try to be creative, I think that is the general spirit that this game was created for.  Oh and don't let the twinks get you down. A character with the same training level as you who has equipment 10x better than yours probably did not earn any of it for himself.  Just take pride in what you do have because you earned it yourself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Setminka<BR>22nd circle monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ruined Pelts = GOLD!!!<P>  Find a critter that has a pelt that you can reliably kill and kill em.  <P>  You can auction off your High Quality (HQ) pelts for big dough, sometimes 10-30 pp for a HQ bear skin.  You can either auction or sell your medium and low quality pelts also for gold, sometimes plat.<P>    Take your ruined pelts and combine the suckers with a pattern in a sewing kit and you will soon be making patchwork armor to cover your hide.  If you cant wear the stuff you make, sell it to a vendor and you will get 1-2 gold usually.  The components are only 2-3 silver (ruined pelt = 8cp pattern = 1-2 silver).  <BR>  <BR>    Like thousands of others I was able to cover my massive Barbarian Shaman (with a pitiful intelligence of 60 or so) with PW armor by the time I was level 6.  All the ruined hides I got after that I was turning into gold. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum7&number=7&thisthread=000032&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum7&number=7&thisthread=000032&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
