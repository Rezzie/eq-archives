</FONT><HR>SkyFighter,<P>Ok, since you seem to think I must work for Verant to like them...<P>I'm 27.  I live in Los Angeles, where I was born.  I am a Technology Administrator for the Los Angeles offices of an Atlanta-based cable television network.  In this capacity, I handle the Help Desk, ordering from outside vendors, and tracking equipment, among other projects.<P>Before this job, I worked for Kinko's for four years, mostly out on the floor with the customers.  During that time, I helped everyone from homeless people making 7 cent copies to corporate executives paying us $20,000 to take care of their presentation for the deal that's going to net their company over $2 million.  Now THAT is customer service.<P>I also used to serve as a volunteer "sysop" on a popular gaming site.  This consisted of occasionally helping someone use the site, and mostly listening for bad words and cheating.  Then muting and booting players who said bad words.  That was enforcement.<P>Which is the job of the GM's?  Mostly the latter, actually.  For one thing, they spend far more time dealing with problems that players create than problems that are actually game malfunctions.  This makes their job primarily enforcement, with some CS on the side.<P>This means that we can't expect them to act like shop clerks.  If you're talking to a GM, nine times out of ten it's because you either did something wrong or are reporting someone else doing something wrong.  If you're on the wrong side of that, it's not YOU who's the customer, it's everyone else, and you're the one they need to take care of to provide service for the general population.<P>Instead of looking at the poster's situation like it's a clerk in a shop talking to a snotty customer, think about it like a 16-year-old (in the States, where the drinking age is usually 21) trying to bluff their way into a club.  How much patience should the bouncer have with someone who has the intent to break the law?  Should the bouncer back down and be nice because they said "I know the owner, and she said I could come in!" or would that just smack of manipulation and taunting?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Well, In England:<P>Piddle = urine<P>So, while many GMs might not get the reference, one familiar with the word would (correctly) ask for a name change. A friend was asked to change a second name of 'hornybird' after 20 levels... and several interactions with other GMs who hadn't noticed the parody name. I believe 'fair cop' was the answer. I guess it's about perspective. If I had a character with a surname 'Merde', I would expect to be asked to change it as soon as a GM who understood it saw me.<P>As for 'Tigergirl', well I guess that's a ok name for a barbarian, but is it really keeping for a necromancer from a civilised society? It's a matter of opinion. The name is pretty harmless and non-offensive, so many would let it slide. Perhaps a GM who was very 'into' RP would not like it. It is also technically in breach of the naming conventions; the 'rules'.<P>Perhaps the GM was getting very frustrated with claims of 'I can get your calls overturned and I'm going to tell your boss'. Having known Tigergirl/Starwolfe I can say that she is very adamant and stubborn on some occasions and is not the most diplomatic person when there is a problem (although is a nice character on most occasions). I have myself on one occasion logged in frustration and disapointment after an interchange with her, so I can in some way sympathise with both parties. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>And given that Randonloggin is correct, how does that indicate a slump in society?  If anything, its an over developed sense of morality.  Which in itself is problematic in terms of strictness but certainly its not a decline in the society to deal with distasteful or offensive names so that no one is caused concern.  The behaviour of the parties involved notwithstanding.<P>For you see, there are so many names that clearly can express your identity without having to choose one that is distasteful or offense.  So, an inadvertent off-color name will one day be exposed by those aware of its nature and requested to be changed.  Advertant selections are just bad gamesmanship and those players have no place in what Sony and Verant want for EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I am going to draw some serious flames with this one...<P>Names like what phoobrak suggested are patently obscene.  At least the first one, since I have no clue as to what the second one, in french, means.<P>As such, those who choose names like that are boorish, juvenile, and sociopathic.  They display a total disregard for anyone elses sensibilities.  Those names are not clever nor amusing to any mature individual.<P>It goes beyond the pale so much that I find myself in violation of my personal ethics and principles if I do not report them.<P>So, if I do encounter someone with a name like that, rest assured, a GM will become aware it it as soon as I can type petition.<P>A name like Tigergirl Piddlemaker I find distasteful.  Would I report that?  No.  Distasteful warrants just turning away and not paying any further attention.  But the totally disgusting names like the ones pointed out are just asking for trouble.<P>Okay, since those who use names like this, read these posts, I expect to be blasted by all sorts of crase remarks.  I don't care.<P>EQ is designed, and the policies state, to be a nice, fairly clean environment where people can play and make friends.  Not some slum where denisons of immorality lurk.  So, take your screwed-up anonymous alter-egos elsewhere.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; For you see, there are so many names that <BR>&gt; clearly can express your identity without<BR>&gt; having to choose one that is distasteful or <BR>&gt; offense. So, an inadvertent off-color name<BR>&gt; will one day be exposed by those aware of its <BR>&gt; nature and requested to be changed.<P>So... in Theory... any name is problematic. At any time, anyone can give a valid argument based on their customs and have a name removed. For this game is worldwide, and there are many cultures/identities playing. What is acceptable to one, may not be to another from across the globe. Be it for a translation of a word, we'd never know, or the different definition of a word.<P>I understand the concept of this, but I have a problem with it. We aren't all knowing, nor should we be expected to be. Nor should we be penalized after playing a game for 2 years, because one person sees something wrong with a name or catches a GM on the right day.<P>I'm for a naming policy. I think it should be strict. But I think it should be consistently applied and enforced across the boards. That it's the GM/Guides to ferret out the most offensive and change them. That they not sit around and wait until someone finds it objectionable for whatever bizarre reason/definition someone can come up with.  It's not that hard a job to get a list of players on and read through the list. Make notes, visit the players, politely explain why the name will be changed. give some time for a new name, and then get it changed.<P>But this random, hunt-n-peck in the dark because someone has a bad day and petitions? It's gotta go. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, there has been so much of this occuring that to be it seems obvious what should be done with the next game.  All names will have to be approved by a GM.  They could make it so you could not level over 8 or 10 or something without having it approved.  At least that way you wouldnt have people having their identities taken from them at level 60, etc.<P>There won't be guides in the next game anyway.  There is a case involving AOL that will probably give presidence that for-profit companies can not use a volunteer labor force.  It was made illegal back in the early 1900's.<P>The GMs in the case above were wrong and only acted out of a power trip.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So Again, they rely on<BR>&gt; players.<P>Exactly my point, and problem with all this.  So a player claims because they are having a bad day that name X means such and such.  So the GMs believe the petitioner and change it.  Well, maybe the petitioner was right, or maybe they were just upset for whatever reason at the player and decided to have some fun.  Meanwhile the GM still has no clues what the word means, other than 1 petitioner claiming it's X.<P>Same thing but from the perspective of the person picking a name.  I pick some random letters, come up with what I think is a cool name.  Never saw it used before. Play for 45 levels with it, and then BAM, oops, nope sorry you can't use that name. Someone has a problem with it, being a swear word in some ancient language. Opps! better change that name. How dare that player ever have picked that name! Or it phonetically sounds with a stretch like an insult. <P>Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not ALL-KNOWING, nor should I be expected to. Nor, should I be punished and forced to change my name because ONE person has a problem and reads my name as an insult.<BR>I picked that name in good faith. I'll keep it thank you very much.<P>Now, of course, generally acceptable insulting/rude names that the average person would know should be changed.<P>Because I'll tell ya, with effort any name can be made into something to be changed, and WE DON'T want to go down that road in EQ...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rando,<P>They petition system works, like a junta govt in a bananna repubplic works, because it's the only system tried yet. No gms cannot be expected to have a master in lit, nor even common courtesy in many cases, so I think the logical result of your thinking is, take the gm's out of it. They are not competent to make these decisions, just have one guy who is qualified, and have them make all the name decisions. They will be consistent and more equitable.<P>Then you will at least know that the decision made for you was not just luck of getting a good or bad gm.<P>The regular CS staff can be taken out of the loop of blame, and maybe can do things that make people like them. Whenever a gm has to enforce this rule it is always going to be a bad scene. It would at least be made better by the gm being able to say "look it's not my decision, i don't have a problem with your name, but the name god has ruled, and it is my duty to enforce the ruling, I am very sorry". The way it is now the player KNOWS it is the gm's discretion and the gm does not HAVE to be doing this mean thing (unarguably from the players perspective) they are doing.<P>FK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Once vetted by the database, or by the name god, obviously you are good forever.<P>(no one in their right mind would petition themselves under the current system, since even if they were approved by one gm, another could later have a different opinion, which is the crux of the problem)<P>GM's would no longer have this nasty job.
