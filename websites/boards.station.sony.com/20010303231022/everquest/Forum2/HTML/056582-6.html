</FONT><HR>Here are the thoughts that come to my mind on the rogue issue.  I am not a rogue and have never played a rogue past level 2.<P>The first thing that comes to mind is that the change just isn't needed.  Yes, that is pretty clear to me.  There's no reason to change evade.  Even if Verant can come up with 10,000 ideas they still won't be able to claim that the change is needed.<P>The second thing that comes to mind is that if Verant were to change the evade skill, what is their purpose behind it.  Keep in mind, I have not read their justification.  I only know how evade works from the stand point of friends.  From what I understand of the skill it really only allows the rogue to move lower on the hate list of the mobs.  This gives them a chance to live after getting the attention of the mobs by doing an enormous amount of damage via their backstab.  Effectively, I believe this change will 1) not lower them as far, or 2) change the conditions underwhich they are lowered.  To me, there's no good reason, as the rogues deserve just as much of a right to survive in the game as any other class.  Right now, a rogue cannot operate as a tank and requires another class to help them backstab.<P>The third thing that comes to mind is that if Verant was to test this as effectively as they have tested the RANGER class for balance the rogue is in for a rough ride.  Verant has done one of the worst jobs in all the gaming environments to balance some of the classes and I believe they know it.  They have used hyperboil to cover up what they are doing by saying they have implemented a sliding scale of balance and some classes are on the high end and some on the low--just happens the ranger is on the low end.<P>This is very disheartening to hear Absor claim that they will extensively test the changes.  The problem is that I doubt, and with good reason, that Verant has the right environment in which to test their game any longer.  It is obvious that they have this vision of how the game is to be played yet, it is 100% obvious that 99% of the players in this game don't play it that way.<P>This means that no matter what THEY think their change is, no matter how good they think it is, it won't be done in a manner in which all the other players in the game use it.<P>It is very obvious that Verant doesn't know what balance is.  What we hear from Verant is something called 'synergy'.  Anyone with a modicum of experience in life knows that synergy does not equate to balance.<P>Because they have improperly defined the term it is inevitable their game will become more and more unstable.  You can observe this by looking at Velious.  The major part of this series of zones are unbalanced even against the classes played by players with a year of Kunark experience.<P>If this is any representative sample, out of all the other samples we have of their ability to properly test and balance, we know that the rogue evade will wind up as a change that is a very negative thing to the class and to the groups in which they play.<P>The question that comes to my mind is:  Is Verant trying to reduce the rogue's survivability to a level which makes the ranger survivability (without any defense changes) look better?  In essence I am of the mindset that they are actually nerfing the rogue to make the ranger look better.  This is not just bad program design but bad politics.  I believe this, being someone that has played a ranger since the game came out.  I in no way resent the rogue class for their abilities.  But it doesn't make sense to reduce their effectiveness just to make the ranger look better, when in reality they will be just the same.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why do you ask our opinion if it means nothing to you which is so obviously the case?<P>The rogue population has given you ideas and thoughts which you have basically said "Are not good enough for us to care" ala poison stacking. Or because its easier to nerf something than make something better.<P>Get a clue. Verant is not the only MMORPG developer in the land, more and more are coming and the company that listens to the people they depend on for their salaries will be the successful one, its called Darwinism and you my dear Absor are going the way of the DoDo with your current attitude towards players. <P>Remember *one* thing. You need us, we do not need you. Perhaps with the release of games such as ShadowBane, Neverwinter Nights, and Horizons and your own unemployment you will eventually realize that you are not the EverCrack dealer with the hundreds of thousands of impatient addicts.

</FONT><HR>Here is what we should have to make the rogue ballance to the other class. 2 words feign death.<P>let's look at what the other class can do when they get in trouble:  <BR>SK, monk and necro: feign death.<BR>The pure caster: root and gate, or for some root and memory blur then run. <BR>Druids: well they have everything, sow, root, gate, port, whatever.<BR>Chanters: Mez + mem blur.<BR>Ranger: root, sow, and they have lots of HP...they can run.<BR>Paladin: with lay hand he can survive a long time.<BR>Warrior: mmmm well they have lots of HP..they can run to zone.<BR>Rogue: 1) Evade?? NO!! the mob always hit you even if the hate list is at the bottom and you don't hit them(and I have tried a lot on really low mob)<BR>2) Can we hope to outrun them? not enough HP, no sow (I guess that a rogue with SOW or jboots can outrun)<BR>3) Die.<P>I can already ear you say: But you have sneak/hide...with feign death you will be able to go everywhere without even risquing you life. True maybe, but ain't that what a rogue is...they can go where they want when they want?  Just make the skill top a little bit lower like safefall.<P>So now the rogue will be the Ultimate recon class...like he should be.<P>So what do you think...do we deserve feign death?  I think so.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My biggest concern with Evade is our role in EQ as "highest melee damage dealer in a group."  This is correct, right Absor?  If so I want to point out that a high level Monk with Epic can often outdamage a Rogue with Epic.  If you reduce the effectiveness of Evade, you will also reduce the effectiveness of our damage output.  I hope you don't think any element of Rogues' melee damage supremacy is based on standard melee -- it is all the backstabs.  Reduce Evade marginally and you will see a drastic reductions in backstabs landed and we could even drop to 3rd or 4th on melee damage output.<P>Another consideration: messing with Evade will only hurt groups with Rogues, making them less desired in groups.  Already we are one of the least sought after group classes (on the Tarew Marr server at least), often taking hours to get a pick up group.  Evade does not allow us to solo or anything, so what is the problem.  Why nerf "all players."  That is the effect of taking away a group benefitting ability.<P>Hana Baba</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another thing I forgot to mention:<P>Mob agro is based on things besides the hate list.  I think anyone who has played a caster who got attacked every time they sit knows this.  One thing that many high level mobs use to determine their target is Armor Class: they attack the lowest AC in range.  This is often the Rogue.<P>I mention this as just another example of how Evade is not a "miracle cure" to melee agro.  I am often forced to entirely back off or be the sole focus of melee, Evade or not. (and my Hide skill is maxed so I am not a poor Evader)<P>Hana Baba, 52 Rogue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ho and i forgot about some things<P>1) sense trap...ain't a invisible hole in a floor a trap?  You walk...bam you fall in a hole...you're now in a cage, locked. No you're right this ain't a trap I shouldn't be able to sense it.  Common make that sense trap see those things. A big axe that is moving across a corridor that I can sense...hey I can see it, it's not called see trap it's sense trap!<P>2) poison make then stakable please ho pretty please. (I read that Verant responded to that: well it would need some programing. What? Of course it will require some programing that's what a patch is about.) So it's doable, then please do it. It wont make us any more or any less powerfull..just more practical.<P>3) Could you just not make rogue only items with Wisdom bonus...it's just a insult to my intelligence.<P>4) Instill doubt should be as reliable as fear. And maybe a evade done during a fear could work as a memory blur. That way maybe we wouldn't need feign death (As i suggested on another post) but only if instill is as reliable as fear, if not as reliable as fear then i want feign death. Instill just isn't working 19 time out of 20 at a skill of 150 on a rat. Test it and count.<P>I think that all I can think of for right now.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I currently have a 23 rogue.  In his first life, he made it all the way to lvl 13 before being stuck for over a month.  Why?  Because he could deal out ok damage with BS, but had no way to avoid the uber taunt it caused.  I gave up on him and created a Wiz.  I recreated the rogue less than a month ago.  Lo and behold, he suddenly had this slick evade skill.  And look, he survived fights occasionally.  What a novel idea.  I know I've not had experience as a lvl 50+, but I can tell you that as a low and mid level rogue, there is no way evade is "uber".  I've lost count of the number of times evade worked and the mob just kept on beating on me.  I don't think it's possible to count the number of times it has failed.  Don't make it any harder for me to find a group.  It's next to impossible to solo with my low hp/ac.  It was bad enough soloing a wiz to 40, I don't think I should have to do it with a rogue too.<P>Now that I've gotten that off my chest:<P>Poison: Stackable poisons would be nice, agreed.  There have been many good ideas posted, take a look, eh?  Beyond that, it would be nice if the drop rate of poison components could be upped significantly.  I mean, 1 basalisk eye stalk every 45 min is just plain absurd.  It's bad enough I have to travel halfway across the world to get the components I need, let alone have to spend umpteen hours farming for them.  Why are spell components so much easier to find, when most of them are found at a vendor?  Would also be nice if the price could be lowered.  3pp for a 1 shot 97DD, (IF I succeed making, IF I succeed applying, IF it's not resisted), also absurd.  The only reason I've been able to even TRY poisons is because I've had my entire guild saving any drops they find, and my wiz makes poison vails.<P>Armor: I'd LOVE to have a full set of ravenscale.  I would also LOVE to earn it, instead of having to buy it for an obsene price from someone who can't even use it.  I totally agree that it should be questable.  I know I could just twink with my wizard, but what fun is that?<P>Hide/Sneak: Been said, make it stick between zones/logging.  Also been said, I'm not invisible, I'm blending.  One of the few useful rogue-only skills is being invis to everything.  I'm not a PvP player (tried it, someone killed me before I could even turn in my guild note), so I'm sure mods would need to be made, (rogue sees rogue, questable items, etc).  See Invis should NOT see me.<P>Safefall: 94 skill cap?  Maybe it's 95, I just never saw it go up.  No matter, it's just plain silly.  Aren't rogues Thieves/assasins?  Don't we need to drop from high places a lot more than monks?  Cap it at 150 AT LEAST.  Sheesh.<P>Sense/Disarm Traps: I don't think I've ever even SEEN a trap, save that swinging axe in SolA.  Ok, you added a bunch in SoV.  Whoopti-doo.  Now give me one in the old world I can practice disarming.  Shouldn't each rogue guild have one anyway?  I've never run into the problem obviously, but I've read the sense range/delay concerns, and I think they should be addressed too.  We wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't a problem.<P>I've ranted enough.  Speaking as a twice rogue, I say that I think it's a very fun class.  Currently much more fun than the first time I tried, mainly because I have tools for survival.  It's still hard to find a group, who wants a sponge that can't tank?  If you do plan on screwing us as a class, then make it possible for me to solo.  Yes, I'm hinting to the evade subject.  Why is it the most talked about thing in this (4x) thread?  Because the class is already so close to balanced.  We do damage, and do it well.  We can't solo for beans, so we are most certainly dependent on the other classes.  Please don't alienate rogues from groups they way you did wizards.  Also try to remember that by "balancing" the few lvl 50+ players in each class, you are "nerfing the living hell" out of the large number of players 1-49.<P>Chromus - 23 Rogue<BR>Zorfnab - 40 Wizard<BR>Elders of Time - Saryrn<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>Listen carefully to the words you say and then compare it to OUR history with Verant.  The fact is that there have been a NUMBER of changes that were poorly done and substantially broke chracters for weeks at a time.  The most memorable (for me) recent one was the inability of instruments (drums) to affect Selo's Accelerando.<P>Add to that a NUMBER of /bug submissions I've made that have NEVER been addressed.  One of my most recent was that NPC-cast engulfing darkness overwrote SoW even though snare doesn't.<P>You guys simply do not have the history to claim that 'we're testing it enough' and expect us to believe it.  When we say we're nervous we have facts and history to point to that bolsters our claim.  I think you would be hard pressed to point to a single completely successful new feature in EQ in the past 18 months.  Even evade was tweaked within a couple of weeks of introduction and it is the closest I can think of to a complete success (it worked from the git go).<P>The change to the length of the hate list is another example of your designers simply not understanding the game well enough or the implementation team not being careful enough in understanding ramifications.  EVERYTIME you change the hate list you need to consider all classes and all affects on it:<P>1.  Warriors, SKs, Paladins, and Rangers taunt<BR>2.  Rangers jolt<BR>3.  Monk feign death<BR>4.  SK/Necromancer feign death<BR>5.  Necromancer Screaming Terror (is the mez gone yet?)<BR>6.  Bard mez and charm songs<BR>7.  Caster DD spells<BR>8.  Caster DOT spells<BR>9.  Healing spells<BR>10. De-buffs against the monster<BR>11. Buffs for the party<BR>12. Caster Rain spells<BR>13. Bonus damage and bonus reverse damage spells (damage shields, mark of karn, etc.)<BR>14. Enchanter mez series.<BR>15. Enchanter mem blur series<BR>16. Enchanter charm series<BR>17. And near the last but not least:  Rogue evade.<P>If your design team does not have an intuitive understanding of how all of these abilities interplay to manage hate, then ANY thing you do to the hate list is more likely to break it than not.  Start with my list, please, for your test planning.  You need a test for each specific combination of abilities at LEAST at a general level.<P>You want us to trust Verant for a major change that allowed the class to be playable when introduced (YES...I had a rogue before evade was available and my ONLY hope of managing hate was to group with warriors AT LEAST 3 levels higher than I was.)  We honestly believe that you don't know what the effect will be of the change, particularly in the high level game.<P>Your past proven abilities with regards to 'thorough testing' do not assuage our disbelief in any way.  I'm not trying to be mean, this is just the way it is!  I love the game and the rogue class MAY be overpowered at high levels, but that is a fault of doing too much damage with respect to other classes, not necessarily in how evade works.<P>There is a major balance issue that you are simply NOT discussing that is more powerful than evade:  warriors are too good as tanks compared to other classes and melees (particularly pures) do WAY too much damage compared to all other classes.  This area of imbalance is not even being touched by the evade changes unless you see rogues as being less able to do damage after the change.  Until this imbalance is fixed, everything else is just a tweak.  Unfortunately the 'evade tweak' is at the heart of giving the players tools to deal with the 'simple minded' AI and is CRUCIAL to the class.<P>You have yet to reflect that notion back to us:  that YOU KNOW that evade is crucial and that breaking it breaks the game for Rogues.  If you said that out loud, you'd go a MUCH LONGER WAY to fixing our concerns than you have so far.  And claiming something is 'broken' when we know it works is a bit disingenous as well.  It is NOT broken, it is too powerful.  The game is not broken because of evade, it is imbalanced.  The class is not broken because of evade, there is just not an appropriate point of check or point of balance to the ability.<P>Deal with it as a relative power topic, and you'll get a better hearing.  Tell us it is 'broken' when we know it makes the game fun for us, and you won't get any traction.  Understand your audience if you want to influence it.<P>Does evade need attention?  In my opinion it is sufficiently unreliable as it is.  Maybe the reliability of it becomes too high at higher levels, but right now (29th level) it is not something I can easily depend on and certainly not something I can take for granted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
