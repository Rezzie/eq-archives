</FONT><HR>Depends whose point of view you want to take.<P>From a players perspective, its a dirty word because classes that can do it well want the convinience to be able to.  This is also one of the reasons for the druid bashing lately.  Poor/Non solo classes have had to go through the hastle of finding a group for the entire game.  For solo classes it has been an option, not a requirement.  The non solo classes now feel like high level druids want to have their cake and eat it to being both a group AND solo capable class.<P>Now, from Verants point of view.  Its a dirty word because a soloer is taking up a resource (read, MOB) that could be entertaining 2-6 paying customers....instead of just one.  With overcrowding as bad as it is on some servers, I suspect they see soloers as a waste of resources pure and simple...thus the huge push to make us group...specially at the high levels where more and more of us are finding ourselves as time passes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Umm...'cause it's a 4 letter word?<P>I think there are two contributing factors:<P>a) Some people have been known to quite inconsiderate while soloing.  They train other people.  They steal pulls and/or kills, etc.<P>b) Some people have been known to solo to 50+ then decide to group.  Now, since they've been solo their career to that point, they don't have the skillset necessary to be a good groupmate.  These people tend to get others killed.<P>c) Jealousy.  They won't admit it, but they feel it's unfair that someone else can solo when they're group dependant.  Now, I'm unwilling to debate the ethics of such a thing, but that's my observation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"it is just about as clear an indicator as we can get of how powerful a class is"<P>I don't necessarily agree with this.  How can soloing be an indicator of power when no group can enter a dungeon without a cleric, sometimes a rogue, (and formerly an enchanter)?<P>Soloing classes are never necessary.  Can an unnecessary class really be powerful?  Ever hear that you can't enter a dungeon without a necro?  No?  Isn't that supposed to be the most powerful soloing class?<P>texture<BR>DE druid<P>.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Texture;<P>Actually, you hit the nail on the head.  There are two kinds of "power" in this game...grouped and solo.<P>The classes that are heavily group dependant tend to feel a certain "right" to preferential group treatment....primarily because they really cant get anywhere without one.  The three "necessary" classes (cleric, chanter, tank) are pretty much totally helpless alone at the higher levels...so they see the ability to actually solo for exp as power.<P>On the other side of the thing are the solo capable classes.  They can get by and get exp just fine on their own....but are not as desired on the big events.  They see the support classes getting snapped up for raids...and thus see group desirability as power.<P>The fact is both are correct.  The game has been around long enough that at this point folks should no longer be complaining.  When you pick a class your pretty much picking, "Do I want life to be easier earlier on in the game...or later?"  <P>Your also picking your play style.  It's my honest opinion that the folks who enjoy the solo classes would go absolutely insane doing cleric or enchanter work....and visa versa.  They are just totally different types of play.<P>Just my two cents.<P>P.S.  I play an enchanter as my primary....and when the game gets too frustrating for one reason or other I log on my twink necro for "stress relief : )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>soloing != power<P>Let's look at the most POWERFUL classes in the game:<P>#1 Cleric<P>As the game currently stands, if you want to group at level 55+, you need a cleric.  If you don't have a cleric, you don't have a group.  I can't think of anything that defines power more than the ability to end the gameplay of 5 other people when you log off at the end of the night.<P>#2 Enchanter<P>There are several exp and loot camps that simply cannot be broken without an enchanter.  If you don't have an enchanter, you don't break that camp for exp or you don't get that drop.  That, my friends, is power.<P>#3 Rogue<P>There are a few exp and/or loot camps that are much more difficult to get to without a rogue.  Without the rogue you must spend much more time getting to these areas which leaves open the possiblity of someone getting the camp first, or simply not having as much time to camp the exp or item.<P>#4 Warrior<P>It is excedingly difficult to do any epic event without a warrior.  Yes, this isn't as important as the above three, yet it is still powerful non-the-less.<P>Now balance that against the ability to gain exp while waiting for a group.  Sorry, soloing just dosn't stack up under the definition of power.<P>Frankly, people gripe about druids as druids chose a class that arn't as relyant on other players to be able to advance during a gaming session.  What they don't understand is the following:<P>If you want POWER, play a cleric/enchanter/rogue/warrior, if you want to solo, play a druid/necro/shaman.  Remember that the bassis of Everquest is grouping, and that all classes should be capable of grouping and bringing something meaningful to the group.  If a class honestly wasn't intended to be in a group, Verant wouldn't of added the class to the game.<P>Anyone who complains about soloing is just letting the kid inside of them whine, "I have to wait for a group, you should have to also!"<P>--Demonspawn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I agree with that statement wholeheartedly.<P>But clerics are never the dictator, never the quarterback, never the boxer, never the cop, never the surgeon.<P>Clerics have no power. Zero. The worst "soloable" class in the game. In PvP, 13 other classes can wipe the floor with clerics.<P>No power.<P>The ability to find groups is convenient, yes. Is wonderful, yes. Is due to an unfair monopoly on healing, yes.<P>But it is not power.<P>I don't think soloing is an awful thing.<P>I just wish druids and shamans would remember, that after they get remedy and their improved superior healing (fizzles), they will be taking some of our group spots.<P>Dont' think so? They why even get the improvement? Don't need it soloing. They must want it for grouping, so they must expect to get invited to groups.<P>While they are in groups, we clerics won't be soloing. We'll be sitting at the zone, waiting for a spot in a group.<P>At least as it stands, when we are grouped and they are lfg, they can solo, shamans with some effectiveness, druids very well.<P>So no, Solo is not a bad word. Soloing is wonderful. I am glad for druids who have this wonderful opportunity to port anywher, look for a group, group when they can, solo when they can't.

</FONT><HR>Wayward-<P>I don't even pretend to think that I should get the same group selection ability as a cleric or wizard.  If there was a group of 4 waiting for more and I zoned in along with a cleric and wiz, it wouldn't hurt my feelings at all that they were chosen before me.  Groups are more powerful when specalized classes are in the makeup.  One of the good soloing classes, shaman, also have a specalized ability that makes them very group friendly (and quite honestly, why I think people gripe less about shaman getting improved healing).<P>Yes it is a two way street.  I have no problem with this two way street.  The reason a lot of people are picking on druid currently is due to the increased healing abilities on test.  I don't understand how players think that two more classes being able to heal post 50 is such a bad thing.<P>I admit, I have less of a problem with this two way street because I am a kick ass grouping druid.  My guild has refered to me as the only known Wood Elf Cleric on the server :)  I've done raids in fear/hate when I was the primary healer for my group and had very few deaths.  If the changes from test go live, I am going to have to sit and think long and hard about giving up my 184 spec evo and start over with spec alter.<P>And before anyone says anything about me being spec evo, I made 30 long before kunark came out.  At level 50, druids were nukers.  In fact, I created my druid 3 weeks after release, when I gave up on my ranger because I wanted less melee and more spells.  Man did I make the right choice ;)<P>To sum it up, Everquest is a grouping game.  All classes should bring something to the group.  Some classes will bring more, and therefore be chosen first.  That is no excuse to say that classes that solo well shold be excluded from grouping.<P>--Demonspawn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, all classes can solo at some point in their career.<P>Here are some examples:<P>Warriors can solo into mid 20s withou much difficulty - then the downtime gets to be too great.<P>Mages can solo through most of their levels but really come into power in their 40s and 50s. - High level mages rock  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Shaman can solo throughout their entire life, however it is more difficult for them at lower levels, but somewhere in the 30s they start to get much better and stay theat way into the late 50s<P>Shadowknights can solo throughout their life with lifetaps and fear.<P>Monks can solo at least till early 30s and probably beyond. bind/mend.<P>Necros are probably the number one solo class.<P>Druids get strong soloing ability from level 14 on.<P>Clerics can solo when they get their undead DDs.<P>Rogues - well.. I don't know about high end game on rogues, but they are darn hard to solo in the 15 range.  Although I did see a 43 rogue soloing an even con the other night (Does EVADE currently really work that good?)<P>Anyway. .the reason people use Druids to rant about soloing is because druids get travel spells as well.. so they can get to places to solo easier.<P>Aleator Level 51 Wood Elf Druid/Tradesman<BR>Keepers of the Sliph<BR>Master Alcoholic (200)<BR>Master Blacksmith (187)<BR>Master Fletcher (163)<BR>Master Brewer (150)<BR>Master Baker (137)<BR>Tailor(92)<BR>Potter (75)<BR>Etc.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You're right.  It is indicative of a few bad players.  Which is, of course, why I prefaced it with "some people".  However, because They're SOLOists, and quite often druids, those KSers, Trainers, pullstealers are all lumped together with the considerate skilled players. <P>When a death can lead to the loss of multiple hours of work, people are less likely to take chances.

</FONT><HR>DemonSpawn<P>Sure, the racecar won't win a race without the mechanic. And it won't win without the driver.<P>The mechanic makes it run, but the driver makes split second decisions, reacts to changing road conditions and to the cars around him. <P>The only power the mechanic has is before the race, or minor tweaks during pit stops. Important, yes. Vital even, yes. But not power.<P>The driver has all the power.<P>I agree that at 55+ a group does not exist without a cleric.<P>But let me ask you this? How many clerics will get that far when they spend half their play time sitting at zonelines LFG from 45-55?<P>I spend too much time at 48th level LFG. Hours some days. And right now it takes a 53 druid to cast the healing spell I use the most (Sup Heal). Move that to 51, and there will be plenty of groups more willing to take that 51 druid with sup heal and snare and DS and buffs.<P>Maybe if that druid and I both zone in and LFG at the same time, I will get picked. But if I zone in a couple minutes after him, I'll be LFG at the zone that much longer because now that group is full.<P>I have already started playing an alt. Primarily because after LFG for an hour or so, I get tired of sitting and chatting. I am certain that once competition for healing spots in groups gets more fierce, my alt will get more play time.<P>If my alt becomes more fun than my cleric, then my cleric will never reach 55+. Not worth it to spend that many hours LFG just so I can reach the lofty 55+ game and become required again.<P>Brell, it's almost not worth it now.<P>I love my cleric, but too much LFG time is not fun. Not fun at all. And I have no other real options. Blowing a full bar of mana to kill a greenie sand giant for a handfull of plat and no exp, then medding for 10-15 minutes, is still mostly just sitting on my butt lfg.<P>Druids 12 levels lower than me kill the same sand giants for the same plat and tons of exp. Druids my level kill them 4 at a time for 4x the plat. And they usually do it with less med time afterwards. And more avenues of escape if things go wrong.<P>And now they want to compete for my healing spot. Not my 55+ healing spot. But my 45-55 healing spot. At levels they can still solo very well and I can't really solo hardly at all. <P>I have no illusions about what adding healing to druids and shamans does to my game 55+. It is the long, and about to become much longer, road to get there that worries me.<P>Morodullin<BR>Worried Priest o Brell<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aleator_KotS<BR>no, it does not work that well or in that way at all. evade lowers the rogue to the bottom of the hatelist but NEVER removes you. so if you are soloing evade is useless(aside from stopping a killstealer). What they were probably doing is using a serated bone dirk (necro slow spell procs off of it) and instill doubt (works 1 time out of 3 at best once it nearly maxxed out,BTW backstab is not useble in conjunction w/ID)<P>This is the only way a non-uber-twinked rogue can solo even + mobs in higher level ranges. rogues can solo (sort of) very low blue mobs with the standard warrior type of tactics.

My brother has a 55+ cleric and has never, in his career as a cleric, had much difficulty finding a group or something he can solo.  Yes, quite a few specs has fallen to his hammer, but it got the job done.<P>I guess what I want to ask is: do you 'solo' as a cleric?  Are you a cleric who just gets pickup groups, or are you part of a good guild or strong friendships with many players?  I'm a druid.  I do solo every one in a while when I won't be on for long or when I have something in mind I want to do.  When I want a group, however, a '/gu hey guys, what's up?'  is all I need to do.

I was still able to solo my warrior at Level 35, though the downtimes of 15-30 minutes were pretty horrendous.<P>But I'm always confounded by the complaining that goes on about the way the classes are -currently- set up. I can understand people getting upset about nerfs, but why complain about a class' already existing abilities? If they were there when you chose the class, then you have no one to blame but yourself.<P>If you want to solo well but virtually never group, pick a necro. And don't whine when you get to higher levels and find that most of the good loot requires a group to obtain.<P>If you want to solo well AND be useful in a group, pick a shaman or a druid. And don't whine when every Level 20+ group would pick a cleric (even a lower level cleric) instead of you.<P>If you want to be highly desired by groups at the expense of soloing, then grab one of the other classes. And don't whine when you are -forced- to start grouping after Level 20-30.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
