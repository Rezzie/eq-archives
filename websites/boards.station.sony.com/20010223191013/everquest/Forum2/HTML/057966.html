&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have a Level 56 Barbarian Warrior.<P>14 months ago after playing a few different classes to level 10, I decided that I'd rather focus on being a melee class, in particular the melee class charged with focusing the mobs attention on me. I chose to be a warrior.  Why is the warrior the best at this?  Well at the time it was supposed to be because of the fact that we had superior HP and AC.  Why could we attract the attention of the mobs?  Because we could do enough damage and taunt, so we could stay on the mobs hate list.<P>Why did I choose a Barbarian?  To have more HP.  What did I sacrifice and gain by being a Barbarian?  I sacrificed decent night vision, I have a hard time moving around in certain places and I have an xp penalty.  I gained more HP and the ability to slam, thus interrupting spells, without using a shield.<P>What did I sacrifice by being a warrior.  I sacrificed every form of independence possible.  I am completely dependent on a group, for both travel and combat.  I have no spells.  I have no skills other then taunt, disarm (when does a warrior use this other then duals?) and slam.  I can't invis myself, heal myself, fall dead, snare or root a mob when I'm in trouble, sneak or hide, harmony, SoW, etc.<P>What were supposed to be the rewards for these sacrifices?  To be THE damage taker.<P>What happened to me because of this?  Until level 50 when I really began to shine I waited on lists, sometimes 4 hours to get xp.  Hybrids, druids, necros, shamans, mages could solo at these levels, not efficiently, but I would have loved to have spent those hours sitting in the corner of the tiger room waiting, to be instead killing something every 15 minutes.  I died frequently traveling because I had no get out of jail free card.<P>So now I'm level 56.  When I go to a dungeon people want me in a group usually to take one spot out of the 6 available.  Because I can take the damage and stand. This supremacy in the damage taking ability was supposed to be (according to what verants stance used to be) my reward for having no independance, no spells and no skills. <P>Post level 50 I found that I could not taunt anymore.  So what did I do?  I killed 20 dragons and camped Drovalrg Tower until level 55 to get jade maces and an RBB.  Two of the fastest weapons in the game and one of the best haste items.  Without weilding these weapons I can't taunt to save my clerics life.  I have had Sunderfury for 6 weeks now.  I've used it a total of 6 times.  I do a lot more damage with it, then dual wielding, but I can't taunt with it.  Thus it sits in my evil eye bag for the odd times when there are two warriors in the group and I want to increase damage output.<P>Druids and necros are constantly throwing fits now that they are not more "desired" post 50.  Go to skyfire and burning woods in kunark.  What are these two zones filled with?  Druids and Necros, soloing. I'd love to be able to Quad Kite in BW and get solo xp when I can't find a group (which happens all the time due to the sheer number of people that play).  I'd love to have a pet that can tank in skyfire and get me xp.<P>This uncompromising supremecy in HP/AC that every non-warrior is flaming about is untrue.  I group with paladins, rangers and SK's frequently from my guild.  A 54 human paladin in my guild has 200 less HP then me (a barbarian warrior) and 12 less AC (yes this is unbuffed).  Go tank a frog in sebelis with that difference in stats and tell me the difference it makes.  Yes I can dodge and parry better, but how often does that really happen?<P>The pallie and I both have several planar pieces...but he has FOUR DW pieces while I have one cobalt piece.  Why?  Cobalt NEVER drops, ever.  I leveled 5 times in DT to get cobalt gaunts.  I've killed 200 callers of sathir, never seen boots.  I've seen 5 sinoches partisans though.  I've seen countless pairs of singing steel gaunts, DW gaunts/boots, jaundiced bone, druid vambraces etc.  There are less cobalt bracers on my server then cobalt BP's.<P>Yeah we have better AC items...you try and get them.<P>I had to level 5 times and increase my AC by 120 to see a big differece in the damage I was taking in KC...the AC difference after these proposed hybrid defensive increases will be 40 AC (which means about 60 in actuality) between an SK/Pallie and a warrior (the pallie/SK and warriors being in full kunark class armor).  They will be close to me in damage due to the fact that they can use 2h and do their jobs, while I MUST do 1h to do mine.<P>"A warrior has SUPERIOR choices in armor and equipment"<P>No not really, we have more choices but not superior ones.  And if I have to dual weild 50k worth of weapons such as 2 jade maces, 2 lamentations or 2 blood points to do my job and taunt, how is that a choice?  Further, I have 960 AC now...I'll be damn near the 1100 AC soft cap after I get full planar and level a little more.  What is the point of my class defining cobalt then?  It won't do me any good.  The spells on it are useless except for the greaves and the bracer...the planar stats are more useful.  A Pallie/SK WILL reach the AC soft cap with their kunark armor, which is easier to get.  They WILL get the same effective AC in the end.<P>There are many Ranger/SK/Paladin weapons that are superior to warrior weapons, they just don't fall off of trees.<P>"Warriors have Disciplines"<P>Yes we do, most of them are useless.  So I can land every hit for 14 seconds, so I can riposte every attack for 15 seconds and then wait an hour to do that again.  So what?  The only warrior discipline that is very useful is the 55 discipline, defensive.  I take less damage when I use it.  It will be useless soon though.  They are going to reduce the damage out put of a warrior.  Less damage = less taunt = I can't take the damage I'm supposed to = useless discipline.<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF EVASIVE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 52 <BR>Duration: 3 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 7 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>The warrior is hit by his opponent less often but also will hit his target less often. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR>	No good to me if I can't taunt.<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF CHARGE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 53 <BR>Duration: 14 seconds. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 30 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 23 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>When using this discipline the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent. In other words he will not miss. This discipline lasts for 14 seconds and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR>	Yeah this is really use full, I can use it 14 seconds every hour, might increase my damage 	output by 30 percent against a blue mob.<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF MIGHTY STRIKE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 54 <BR>Duration: 10 seconds. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 54 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>When using this discipline all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows. This discipline lasts for 10 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR>	Same as the charge disciple, 10 seconds of every hour I can crit every hit I ACTUALLY LAND, and 	for all you non warriors out there, a crit does not mean I do 4 times max damage every hit, it's 	random and it really equates to about 30 percent more damage<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF DEFENSIVE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 55 <BR>Duration: 3 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 10 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>The warrior takes less melee damage but also deals less. This will not reduce damage taken by the warrior from any form of magic, damage shield, or weapon proc. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR>	Useful now, as of one week from now...not all that great<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 56 <BR>Duration: 9 seconds. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 56 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on them by the opponent they are facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR>	9 seconds of every hour.  I get a few more hits in if I'm able to keep the mob on me.<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF FELL STRIKE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 58 <BR>Duration: 12 seconds. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 30 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 28 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>When using this discipline all hits landed by the warrior will be for at least four times the base weapons damage. For example: If you used a Short Sword of the Ykesha with a base damage of 8, then you would receive a bonus of 32 damage on every hit for the duration of the discipline. This discipline lasts for 12 seconds and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR>	12 seconds of every hour.  Yeah I can do some damage with this.  Is that my job? No.  That's 	what damage dealing classes are for.<P><BR>THE DISCIPLINE OF FORTITUDE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 59 <BR>Duration: 8 seconds. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 59 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>When using this discipline the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This does not alter in anyway the ability for the warrior to have damage inflicted on them by magical means. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR> <BR> <BR>	Somewhat useful, but once again 8 seconds every 60 minutes...A lot more efficient for me to use 	defensive.<P>THE DISCIPLINE OF AGGRESSIVE <BR>Class: Warrior <BR>Level obtained: 60 <BR>Duration: 3 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay: 27 minutes. <BR>Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 27 minutes. <BR>Discipline Description:<BR>The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed but will also take more damage as well. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 27 minutes.<BR> <BR>	Pretty cool discipline.  I get it at level 60.  It still isn't as useful as defensive, which 	augments my roll as damage taker.<P>So there are the disciplines. Only 3 of them are usable more then once every 60 minutes.  Only 2 augment my roll as a tank.  Those two that augment my roll will not be as useful to me when they are nerfed and make me do less damage, one of the main factors in taunting which makes the mob hit ME and makes ME take the damage.<P>"Warriors HAVE BERSERKING"<P>So what, I go beserk at about 200 - 400 health.  If a cleric doesn't heal me within about 5 seconds of that occuring, I'm dead.  So I hardly ever see it benefit me.  I can make a crippling blow while I'm berserk and do some insane damage.  I've Cripped FOUR times in 56 Levels.<P>"Warriors HAVE CRITICAL HITS"<P>So what, I can count on the fingers of my right hand how many crits I get during a standard fight with a dex of 130.  Even with a dex of 255 I might get six.  These do not equate to UBER damage, usually they are around my normal max hit.<P>"Warriors HAVE DISARM"<P>So what, does a mob hit any differently when I take his prized FS sword from his paws/hands/whatever? Nope<P>"Warriors HAVE HIGH MR"<P>Yep, and if I didn't I'd get slowed and nailed by a lot more of the spells cast on me because I AM TAUNTING AND DOING MY JOB.  It fit's the job description.<P>The main problem with hybrids, is they all want to be warriors and have spells.  Everything is compared to warriors.  I invite hybrids all the time that actually know how to play their class.  Paladins can heal in a pinch, tank when I'm LoM, root, undead nuke.  Rangers can out pull me anyday with their spells and they do good damage.  SK's can out pull me as well with their invis, FD, and tank when needed.<P>If hybrids want to be improved I think their spell casting abilites should be enhanced.  They have unique abilites that almost none of them use (in my experience), that is supposed to be their advantage.<P>If you want to "balance" the warrior and other classes, making the hybrids shift to better melees is not the solution.  Give them more mana and more spells.  As it is they are 80% melee and 25% their parent caster class.<P>As far as what I would like to see balanced for warrior:<P>1)  You have to do something about how taunting is computed.  I'm a fairly high warrior, I have some very good equipment.  I can't taunt a lot of times.  There is something wrong with that if taunting is supposed to be one of my strong points.<P>2)  The epic weapons.  Risk vs. reward for starters.  The delay is too high for the 1h weapons.  Not condusive at all for taunting until it's lowered.  People keep saying that the proc will make it taunt. Procs are too elusive and unreliable to be depended upon for taunting.  I have one of the 2 hardest quests and my class defining weapon will not be condusive to my one purpose for being?  That's not reward for the risk.<P>You need to increase the drop rate for the maestro and the queen.  Yes epic weapons are supposed to be difficult.  Try to form a hate raid these days.  That's difficult.  It's camped 24/7.  I've killed the maestro 5 times and never seen a hand.   One of the uber guilds on my server gates up like clock work every 24 hours to kill the maestro if hate is not occupied...they still after months of doing this haven't got enough hands for half of their less then 10 warriors.  The queen of chardok and a 15% drop rate?  You gotta be kidding me.  It's hard enough to kill the queen.  I need to find 30 people willing to sit in a tunnel for 24 hours (and die a few times) to cough up ONE blade?  Even if the drops on these items were more common the warrior epic would still be one of the most difficult...the drop rates make it hands down most difficult and I would argue insanely difficult.  <P>One other issue with the epic blade that doesn't really concern me, but many warriors is slam.  Why do pallies and SK's get the ability to slam with their epics and a small race warrior wielding his does not?  This is balace?  A parent class weilding their class defining weapon does not have the ability to do something that the hybrid can? <P>3) Increase Cobalt armor drop rates.  If this armor is supposed to be our advantage then we are definitly not seeing it's advantages.<P>4) If you increase hybrid offense/defense and don't fix a thing, then things will become unbalanced.  They will have much easier access to equipment to make them have very silimlar stats to warriors as far as AC/HP in the SK/Pallie arena.  If you increase Ranger offense and don't fix taunt they will die.<P>5) Make our stats mean something.  My strength is usually around 150 to 255 depending on my equipment choices and buffs.  Does a 60 percent increase in strength do much?  Absolutely not, maybe 10 damage on a max hit with a good 2h weapon.  It increases my attack by 50 or 60 "less then 5 percent), does that make me 5 percent more damaging?  Nope<P>Agility at 200 versus 100, that's 20 AC<P>Dexterity at 255 versus 100, MAYBE one or two more procs if I have a proccing weapon, and I see no significant increase in frequency of critical hits.<P>Charisma is significant to me.  I make a lot more money from vendors and get charged less when I'm buffed for charisma.  How often does that happen?  Not often, I don't have a pet shaman or enchanter.<P>Now, let's look at what 200 Wis versus 100 wis for a level 55 druid.<P>55 druid with 100 base wisdom = 1210<P>55 druid with 200 base wisdom = 2310<P>Mana gained 		      = 1100<P>Damage that can be done with breath of Karana in a fight due to this increase?  Around 3200 points if they use all mana at 100 wis, about 6400 if mana dump at 200 wis.<P>Hmm, stats really only mean a lot to casters.  100 percent more mana, the prime regeant of their effectiveness.  Maxxed melee stats increase the effect of that stat on average of 5 percent for a 50 warrior.<P>Things are balanced now for the most part.  Give hybrids a reason to use their spells and abilites more, that is what they are supposed to be, melees/casters not mostly melees/very little caster.<P>Once again, with the same defense cap the difference between a full planar warrior and a full planar (similarly epuipped) pally/AK will be 40 AC (60 effective ac, 10 AC is 15 AC when you wear it)  200 HP and 60 AC MEANS NOTHING in the big scheme of things.  THEY DO MORE DAMAGE WITH 2H WEAPONS THEN A WARRIOR, because they can weild 2h and still do their job.  That is not an advantage worth ALL THAT I SACRIFICED TO BE A WARRIOR.  Once again I have 2 skills, SLAM/KICK AND TAUNT.<P>Hybrids are fine the way they are now as far as their melee stats.  They have UNIQUE abilites.  They can heal, life tap, snare, root, debuff, DoT, nuke, summon pets, fall dead, track summon corpses, invis, the list goes on. They aren't totally group dependent like warriors are.  The have spells.  They should learn to capitolize on their abilities and spells.  90% of them do not.  The should get the superior class only equipment available to them.  Giving them more spells and mana would benefit them the most.  They are supposed to be a challenge to play.  They have already had their xp penalty removed.<P>Absor and the EQ Live team.  You really need to get with your own program.  You are looking at this game on paper. You obviously aren't hearing us, or hearing valid arguments.  You are about to kill the warrior, and make all the sacrifices I made for 56 levels significantly less worth it.  5% more AC then a hybrid in the end game (50-60 AC out of 1100 is about 5%).  200 HP more (about 10 percent), which against a double 100+ hitting mob IS NOTHING.  Rangers will do as much damage as me and have spells, and that is a fact, since melee stats mean nothing as I have pointed out, and their skills will be the same.   And on top of ALL THAT, you are giving them more spells and making their spells more effective.<P>You SHOULD AT LEAST REPOND TO THIS POST AND PROVE TO ME I AM WRONG, OR AT LEAST TRY.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know... my vision of the warrior has always been of one who take AND deal damage. As it stand now, with gear of similar quality, a warrior can absorb damage significantly better than a SK/Pally, and still deal a ton more damage. With those change, a SK/Pally will be as good in tanking, but will deal significantly less damage but will have some spells to make up for the difference, and it's how things should always have been. <P>You're completely neglecting your damage advantage in your post. This is really important. In most xp groups, warriors are 3rd best damage dealer overrall and it's pretty valuable IMO.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Paladins would be so lucky if DW was even half as available as cobalt.<P>you can't taunt? bah wariors can taunt, the only way that a hybrid can out taunt a warior is if he taunts/roots/snares/roots etc. but why in the heck would we want to?<P>ok Paladins and sk's have comparable hp/AC to you, minus the fact that your armor is way better, and is easier then heck toget and your parry, repose etc etc is way higher. but you don't just rule defensively, you also rule Offensively.

Yes, we have close defense, but compare your damage output to that of the Paladin. Okay now take Rangers. A Ranger has close to the same damage output as you but.. you guessed it RANGERS ARE OFFENSIVE TANKS, try comparing the acs of those two classes.<P>What I don't get about a Warriors point of view is that Warriors think that they should be far superior in ALL aspects of melee fighting, that would be stupid. Warriors are still superior overall in all aspects over Hybrids but in some parts the Hybrid is closer to the warrior.<P>Here is a little math problem:<P>1 defensive hybrid + 1 offensive hybrid (two players) &gt; 1 warrior (one player)<P>It should not be the other way, otherwise why would a group want a paladin or a ranger in ANY case if a warrior was vastly superior in everything.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have to agree with everything the original poster has said.  I am a 56th human warrior and have thought, posted, or argued about all the same points this guys has said.<BR>For all of you who do not think paladins have almost as much AC and hps as a warrior you are dead wrong.  My brother is a 46th lvl paladin.  His AC is 61 points less then mine at 10 levels less then me.  He has more Deepwater pieces then I have cobalt to top it off.  With SELF BUFFs, he has only slightly less hps then a warrior his level.<BR>To try and summarize major points he made that I totally agree with is.<BR>1.  Hyrbrids should not ever have the same defensive abilities as a warrior.<BR>2.  Hybrids spell casting side is what makes them unique and is what needs the fix.  Not the warrior side of them.  Warriors have never been able to cast spells there whole life.  Please Verant do not MAKE WARRIORS NONCASTING HYBRIDS!<BR>3.  Stats and how they mean nothing.  Effects all melee types.<BR>4.  Most disciplines we have suck, and have insane recycle times on them.  I would take HT or LH for all of my disciplines combined.  <BR>5.  Taunt works off of maintaining a constant cycle of blows on a mob.  This makes us have to use certain weapons to achieve this.  High dmg hits dont do anything, but 4 quick hits of 21dmg does. <BR>In closing, warriors are feeling slightly cheated with this upcoming patch.  Almost all classes are getting a upgrade of some sort, and warriors get told we are nerfing your defensive discipline. (The only one that is real good.)  How do you think we would respond.  Take a look at how many warrior posts are being made now!  We all read the hybrid posts and many of us supported that a fix was in order.  What we didnt think was you would take away our niche in EQ and make us noncasting hybrids.<BR>Things warriors have gotten since EQ came out:<BR>1.  Critical hits (Rare, approx double dmg hit)<BR>2.  Crippling blows (Extremely Rare, at the point of near death when we can go beserk)<BR>3.  Minor Hitpoint increase<BR>4.  Natural MR increase with levels.<P>Things Paladins have seen since release:<BR>1.  Layhands increases three times.<BR>2.  New spells.<BR>3.  Mana change equal to casters.<BR>4.  Lowered mana cost per casts.<BR>5.  No Exp penalty now.<BR>6.  Taunt increase.<BR>7.  Hitpoint increase.<BR>8.  Disciplines.<BR>9.  SOON: Defensive abilities same as a warrior.<P>New things for SKs:<BR>1.  Harmtouch increased multiple times and almost unresistable now.<BR>2.  Hitpoint increase.<BR>3.  Taunt increase.<BR>4.  Mana same as casters.<BR>5.  SOON:  Mana exspense removed for hyrbid.<BR>6.  New spells.<BR>7.  Disciplines.<BR>8.  Exp penatly removed.<BR>9.  SOON:  Defense increased to Warrior level.<P>Rangers:<BR>1.  Mana cost removed.<BR>2.  Mana pool like casters.<BR>3.  Dodge parry rate increased.<BR>4.  SOW spell.<BR>5.  Disciplines.<BR>6.

</FONT><HR>"Reward for our sacrifice, ie. HAVING NO SKILLS OR SPELLS, was supposed to be SUPERIOR in OFFENCE AND DEFENSE to hybrids. Not marginally better."<P>But, you do.  Vastly superior damage over the classes that can tank almost (but not quite) as well as you, and vastly superior tanking ability over the classes that equal or exceed your damage.  Hybrid spells are great for versatility and self-dependence, this is true, but they get a lot less useful when the parent class is around.<P>So, any hybrid will have one area of melee they come pretty close to a warrior in (offense for rangers, defense for shadowknights and paladins), but they will be greatly outclassed by a warrior in the other.  This makes them roughly half a warrior.  It would be daft to play the "half-a-warrior" class without their being some benefit, so they receive spells--those spells can be either incredibly useful, or nearly useless when the parent class is around.  To me, that implies that there is versatility added, but not raw power (because of the times when a given spell will be virtually useless).  I think there are some neat checks and balances.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

"<P>If I am full mana I can go oom and still not have compeletely healed a warrior.  Yes, we can tank and cause maybe 1/3 the damage of a warrior.  We can undead nuke, yes, but they are so puny that even tanking a nuking with all my might a warrior will still outdamage me, and we are supposed to me masters of fighting undead.<P>"Hybrids are fine the way they are now as far as their melee stats. They have UNIQUE abilites. They can heal, life tap, snare, root, debuff, DoT, nuke, summon pets, fall dead, track summon corpses, invis, the list goes on"<P>Paladins can heal, root, and debuff from your list.  Heal is pretty much useless and we can debuff one buff at a time.  This spell is hardly ever used for two reasons, 1) at this level there is almost always someone that cast a better debuff spell and 2) if we do cast it we end up getting rid of a dot or a slow or some other spell that someone in the group has cast on the mob.  Ok, that leaves root as a usefull spell, so in exchange for having root, stun, dispell magic and a really weak heal we should give up 2/3 of our ability to cause damage, dual wield, critical hits, ac, hp, defense, riposte, dodge, etc, etc, etc?  That's not balance.<P>"I sacrificed every form of independence possible. I am completely dependent on a group, for both travel and combat"<P>Hmmm, sounds like a pally to me.<P>"Hybrids, druids, necros, shamans, mages could solo at these levels, not efficiently, but I would have loved to have spent those hours sitting in the corner of the tiger room waiting, to be instead killing something every 15 minutes. I died frequently traveling because I had no get out of jail free card."<P>How many pallies do you see soloing at lvl 50?  Maybe some greenies.  Getting killed travelling?  Warriors can buy sow potions, just like the pallies do.<P>"What is the point of my class defining cobalt then? It won't do me any good. The spells on it are useless except for the greaves and the bracer"<P>You should be a pally with dw armor that casts spells that you never use because you can memorize better ones.<P>"They will be close to me in damage due to the fact that they can use 2h and do their jobs, while I MUST do 1h to do mine."<P>A warrior dual wielding will always outdamage a hybrid with 2hs.  Trust me, I'll never even come close to causing warrior type damage.<P>"The main problem with hybrids, is they all want to be warriors and have spells"<P>No, we want to be the 3/4 warrior we were promised.  As of now we aren't even half.<P>You complain about how bad your disciplines are, well, I'll trade you straight up warrior discs for pally discs any day.  Want to take me up on it?<P>and finally...<BR>"You are about to kill the warrior"<P>Not hardly.  The only thing they should kill, and hopefully will kill, is the lack of balance between warriors and hybrids.  Should a warrior be preferred to a paladin in a group that needs a tank? Yes, sometimes.  Should a paladin be preferred to a warrior in a group that needs a tank? Yes, sometimes.  What is the situation now?  Warrior preferred in just about every single situation to a paladin.  As of now paladins are the class that people settle for when there are no warriors available.  There is not one thing that we do that another class cannot do better.  This is not balance.  Balance would be warriors and paladins spending roughly the same amount of time lfg and right now in the post-50 game this is definitely not the case.<P><BR>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Darkwen:<P>Cobalt: As a whole is incredibly more rare then deepwater. Our helm is an uber rare drop off of reet knights. Know how many reet knight spawn points there are in the game? 4...yup 4...and each one has a 33% chance to be a knight. Know where they are? right before Trak. Bracer..yeah...I know of maybe 10 on our server...which probably means theres more like double that...we have 4 warriors in our guild...2 cobalt bracers....4 paladins in our guild...all have bracers. Boots and Gloves in Karnors are the rare drops...little tough to do but I can live with it. Arms in Sebilis...uber rare drop off of a semi common spawn....<P>I have a DW bracer, helm, and arms in the bank right now....no paladin in our guild needs them, they all have them. Saying DW is less common then cobalt immediately says you have no clue.<P>Now the all encompassing hp diff between warriors and hybrids. You hear a warrior at 60 can have as many as 1000hp more then anyone else. I hear that alot. Not gonna argue the point. Its flat wrong. Please dont say otherwise until you have had a 60 war and a 60 paladin standing next to each other both with same buffs and close on stamina. Couple hundred hp diff. Sure, take an ogre warrior in full hp/stamina gear and compare it too a human paladin and you might get a sizable difference.<P><BR>Overall warriors are pretty well balanced...the overiding problem in EQ that will never go away is THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY CLASSES. You cannot have 14 different classes with set abilities (meaning they are preset, you dont get to pick and choose your abilities) and try to make them all the "best" at something or even to make them all unique and desirable. The goal in EQ for 99% percent of the people playing is to kill stuff. Why they kill it might differ (loot, xp, fun, something to do with friends whatever), but killing mobs is the reason people log on day after day. To do that you have to only do one thing...inflict damage....thats it. <P>Players are gonna find the most efficient means to do that one thing...once they find it...they are gonna do it whenever possible only doing it differently if one of the "ideal" classes isnt available. Why take a hybrid thats not as good at melee or spellcasting if the parent class is available? I mean really? Why? I group with paladins and sk daily...well played they are an asset to the group...but if I didnt know the people playing them...if I had to choose between a druid and a ranger...druid 100% of the time. SK and Necro...necro 100% of the time. Paladin..id take a druid, necro, shaman first..etc etc. I might take a hybrid instead of a 2nd warrior...in that case they bring something to the grooup...namely some flexibility. Hybrids will never be as desired in groups or uber mob encounters because they are hybrids...they are not designed to be the best at anything....and uber mobs require the best...period. If hybrids ever cast as well as their parent class (i.e. meaning mana efficiency and spell selection) the castng parent class becomes obsolete. If they ever tank as well as a warrior (or even 90% as well) warriors will become obsolete. As far as damage output...who cares...warriors, paladins, rangers, shadowknights are not nor were ever meant to be primary damage dealers. In daily group situations monks, rouques, wizards, mages, necros, druids etc far far far outdamage us. On epic encounters we are still outdamaged by rouqes and monks (and if its a old world or Kunark mob most casting classes outdamage us as well).<P>Sorry you cant have hybrids that are 90% as good as either the caster or melee class and still have them retain all of their current abilities. You want to be "almost" almost as good as a warrior you hafta give up a hella lotta spells...want to be 90% as good as a caster...give up a hella lotta hp and ac and melee skills. <P>Think of a paladin who can take damage 80-90% as well as a warrior (what it will be when their defensive skills are raised) can out taunt a warrior with a couple stuns (stuns are mega taunts) can do 50-60% of the damage of a warrior (can get even closer if they use 2hs because they dont have to dual wield to taunt but a little lower damage isnt that important because the primary tank takes damage not dishes it out) and can LoH, heal themselves for a decent amount of hp (i mean at 57 they can cast superior heal how many times? 3, 4 or more depending on fizzles..add that to their total hp and wow), root etc and now the warrior is obsolete. <P>*IF* ac is soft capped at 1100 and it seems to be, paladins can achieve almost as an effective an ac as a warrior. With self heals, more hp then a warrior. With defense equal to a warrior they become very close to being as good a damage taker as a warrior, a better taunter, an average damage dealer...why have warriors at all, or shadowkinights, or rangers....see the problem? if oyu have an answer lets hear it...because verant doesnt have one thats for sure.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They can heal, life tap, snare, root, debuff, DoT, nuke, summon pets, fall dead, track summon corpses, invis, the list goes on"<P>And most of these so called "UNIQUE" Abilities can be easily attained by warriors through potions and items.<P>"I sacrificed every form of independence possible. I am completely dependent on a group, for both travel and combat"<P>Hmmm...Paladins don't have an Invis method, and Paladins and SKs don't don't have a movement increaser...And none of em have ports. Seeing as those are the three prime travel type spells, they pretty much as dependent as any Warrior. I mean, I SUPPOSE you could count snare or root for slowin sumpin that would be chasin you as something, but chances are that's gonna be resisted. And since you hafta stop to cast it, the thing could overtake you pretty easily.<BR>As far as Combat? Yea, so Maybe an SK or a Pally or a Ranger could solo a low blue, but chances are its gonna use most of thier mana and they'll hafta sit down for a long while. Meaning that if they got into a good, competent full group, they'd get so much exp it's not funny.<P>Anyway, Absor owes warriors nothing. And I don't know why I argue. Ah well, when these changes go in and Warriors are still clearly the superior tanks and are still just barely behind monks and rogues in melee damage, maybe then you'll see.<P>And Dual Wield being for taunt only?

</FONT><HR><BR>Something that strikes me as just too funny is that since Kunark was released, monks and rogues enjoyed the SAME Defense skill cap with HIGHER Parry(or Block)/Riposte/Dodge skill caps.<P>Did we see the warriors ***** and moan then ? Noooo it was all fine and dandy, even if those classes could reach and exceed a pally or SK's AC with comparable equipment, both plate-wearing classes.<P>But now that VI is bringing our defense, and our defense ONLY up so that at last we can get somewhere in between rogues/monks and warriors, you guys are crying us a river. You guys have really short memories. That's the way it was before Kunark, and then warriors weren't *****ing and moaning like you are now.<P>Getting soft, are we ? Maybe it's high time hybrids get improvements making them equal to you in some areas of the game to replace you cry-babies...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>And tell you what, because you now feel threatened in your little monopoly over tanking, you guys are lining rows after rows of HP and AC numbers... What you fail to see in your short-sightedness is that the BEST equipped hybrids, before the upcoming changes, are already able to replace you as tanks in everyday grouping. Only problem is it takes us the very best stuff against average xarrior equipment to get there. The upcoming changes will bring some parity back, and this is GOOD. Another funny thing is that you don't want us to get an AC boost, yet you're also the first to claim AC does hardly make a difference... SO WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM ???<P>On the subject of equipment. Speaking for SKs, some pieces are just as hard to get as yours. Helms are ultrarare drops off juggernauts. Boots are rare drops of one of the most difficult mobs to get to in Karnor, Knights of Sathir. But hybrids tend to get their Kunark armor sooner than warriors eventually. Can't you guess why ? Because the lvl 50+ number of warriors alone is MUCH SUPERIOR to the lvl 50+ population of ALL hybrids combined.<P>You guys may have your issues, especially in Taunting, and maybe you can get some more HPs if you want, but stop bringing up the stupid argument of hybrids having spells to offset our Defense and Offense deficiencies. You guys have NO experience of what casting means during combat, and their real effectiveness. Let me break the news to you, post-55 especially, hybrid spells are worth jack but for one thing, TAUNTING. That's all. Their damage component is too laughable to be mentioned.<P>Don't bring the issue of travelling either. Jboots and Sow potions are there for everyone to get. Invis potions too. If you die so much while travelling, well, you suck, plain and simple.<P>And I'm sick of that "hybrids can solo" fallacy too. Yes we can solo. But not in any way much more efficiently than warriors with comparable lvl of equipment. Because during downtimes, while you're sitting on your butt regaining HPs, we're also sitting on our butts regaining our HPs, AND our mana. And for hybrids as for warriors, soloing is one of the least effective way of getting experience.<P>Do hybrids a favor, once and for all, because this is really getting sickening. Instead of whining over the improvements we're getting, and hoping to keep our heads under the water so you can stay happy on your little pedestal, just focus on YOUR needs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
