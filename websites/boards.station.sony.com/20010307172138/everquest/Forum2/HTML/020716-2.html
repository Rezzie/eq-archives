</FONT><HR>1.) Certainly within their rights to ban her.<BR>2.) Possible that they could even sue her.<BR>3.) Almost certainly a bad idea to do either.<P>This was no more objectionable than 1,000's of other bad Fantasy/Horror novels on the market today.  Their are excellent books like White Wolf Publishing's clan novels are far more disturbing than this material.  Looks like VI is trying to set an example and establish a precedence.  Good luck Mystere.<P>Player diaries help to enrich the "mythology" of a world and should be encouraged by an RPG manufacturer.  TSR used to crack down very hard for copyright infringments and it really stifled their products.  Now that Wizards of the Coast owns the company, they have made D & D 3rd Edition an open source lisence.  Anyone can publish anything using their copyrighted game system.  3rd edition has been a huge success at least in part due to the willigness of WOTC to allow others to write fiction/game modules based on their system.<P>If the material written by Mystere was truely offensive by the reasonable standards of the computer game/RPG industry, I could understand this action.  Given the relatively mundane nature of the material (once again within the context of the computer game/RPG industry) a banning seems overly harsh.  A simple cease and desist order would probably have protected their copyright and put an end to Mystere's writing career.<P>It may be their world but if they don't share it with others they may find themselves lonely in the future.<P>Akhbar Ali <BR>Magician of the 45th Gate<BR>Brell Serilis<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is better Bloosage, we are in disagreement again . . . <P>The story in question was well written and not as blatantly disgusting as some would have us believe. There is no justifiable reason that is should have resulted in the author's banning.<P>Had the story been written by a 'famous' author instead of an 'amatuer' I wonder how much Verant's position would change. Say Piers Anthony or R.A. Salvatore for instance. Most likely in that case Verant would be expressing their utmost pleasure that these literary 'stars' would deign to make mention of their product.<P>This is a blatant example of censorship, and possibly an illegal one at that.

</FONT><HR>/whew<P>I don't necessarily object to the subject matter of the offending story.  That said, however, she is in clear violation of VI's copyright.<P>A "famous" author would never write something in someone else's milieu without first obtaining permission.  A real author would query the copyright owner with the story idea.<P>We can either approve or disapprove of VI's actions, but it is, by definition, not censorship.

</FONT><HR>Traken:  I sincerely hope that you weren't serious about a lot of what you wrote.  However, I fear that you were serious... and that is what makes me a misanthrope.  <P>I can't resist commenting on this line though.<BR>"People may write about fiction, but within all fiction the core foundation of the stories come from experience, whether obtained first-hand or heard second-hand."<P>So what you are saying is that there is no such thing as an original thought.  EVERY piece of knowledge and every story ever told or written is plagerised in one form or another.  Utter and complete hogwash.  <P>That said, I fail to see the problem with the story she wrote (The one that she wrote, not the other, that was written by someone else).  It wasn't any more graphic than a slasher movie, and was less so than watching surgery on The Learning Channel.  It was less graphic than many scenes in various books that I have read.  It was written using examples from the game, specifically the god of hate, any of the lifetap series and dark empathy.  If this story was inspired by the game (and it was), then every single necromancer and shadow knight that uses lifetap at all, ever, is immoral.  Any person that chooses Innoruk as a god is just plain wrong... <P>*sigh*<P>It's a game, people are allowed to enjoy it, it inspires some forms of creativity and expression, which is promptly, utterly, squashed.  <P>*sigh*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"I am a big believer in free speech but her story is downright sickening."<P>That statement is a direct conflict.  Free speech is okay unless it disturbs you?  Please.  You're either a proponent or an opponent.  You do the math.<P>I agree that the story was out of line.  But I don't think that a tasteless story on an unofficial board should have any bearing on your account status.  This girl writes mediocre (at best) gothic fan fiction in an unaffiliated public forum and is banned from the game for it.  Why?  Many writers portray sickening or despicable circumstances to get their points across.  Terry Brooks is one.  Stephen King, Dean Koontz, every horror writer and most fantasy writers do this.  Well, I suppose that makes them the kind of players you don't need, either.  Nor the people who read those books and enjoy them, as I am sure a great majority of your playerbase has.  I didn't realize there was a strict moral code we had to adhere to in order to subscribe. :P<P>Ask yourself if you want to set this as a precedent that other companies will follow.  You may be on the wrong end of it one day, and you'll have only yourselves to blame.  At most, the proper action would have been to ask EQVault to remove that story.  Perhaps you also wish to issue a document stating in what manner it is permissable to express yourself when it pertains to the game?  Or should we just assume that any opinion, story, or thought I might have that offends or disturbs someone is going to get me banned?  <P>Where is the line drawn when it comes to things like this?  Is there one?  I really don't think it's unreasonable to want at least a rough guideline of how you handle these out of game bannings.  How can we know what's permissable and what's not when the only way to find out is after you've been stepped on?  The boundaries keep getting pushed back more and more until I can't see them anymore.  It's not unfair to want to know what is allowable and what is not, and if there's anywhere on the internet that we can exercise that nifty little free speech thing without repercussions.  Just because you reserved the right to axe all of us at any time for any reason, do you really think that you should exercise that right on a frivolous thing like this?  Once you start down this road, where will you stop?  <P>--Sarra<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The only thing I saw that comes close to any copyright issue is the use of the name "Innoruuk", and the use of that MAY not be a violation of copyright. Tricky legal issues involved.....<P>It also must be taken into account that Verant has allowed other posters to use the same EQ related material for other works of fiction without objecting. If Mystere were to contest this action through appropriate legal means that might well be used against Verant.<P>It IS censorship though, because Verant's own statements to the author make it clear that they were not objecting to the use of EQ related material but rather the WAY in which it was used. The subject matter, not the characters. No gray area here, blatant censorship.

</FONT><HR>Name I can't remember: Sorry, Vhasst and Mystere are two different characters played by the same player. This is well known on the message board, and obviously Verant would have seen both characters on the account.<P>Freedom of expression only goes so far. It's well accepted by most of society that depicting rape and sexual abuse of children is reprehensible, unless there is some serious artistic and moral merit to the work. I suppose the player could try to argue in court that the material is of good artistic integrity, but that nonetheless does not mean that Verant wants them playing their family-oriented game - and it is indeed their world.<P>Picture this scenario: outraged parent sends this story and complaint not only to Verant, but various newspapers.<P>Verant... no, SONY's choice: ban the kiddie porn writer, maybe tick off him and a few of his friends, or have half the country come down on their head as promoting child rape pornography? It's a public relations nightmare, and their decision is sensible and perfectly understandable, as well as consistent with the EULA.<P>It's not so much the acts depicted, although perverse and disgusting, it's the fact that the writer goes explicitly out of his way to discuss just how young his victim is. This is hardly an isolated case, either; most of the stories I have seen come out of this person were along these lines.<P>Once again, kudos to Verant, and thank you. I know I sure as hell don't want my kids playing this game with people who are so open about their sexual deviances.<P>If this is what they post in public, God knows what they do inside the safety of guild, group say or tells.

</FONT><HR>What bothers me the most about this is that it smacks of oh-so-much "big brother".  <P>As far as copyright infringement, will they now go to each and every guild site, fan site, news site, etc. to judge the stories and/or general posts to see who should/shouldn't be allowed to play?  Also, if it's a matter of infringement, why haven't their been more bannings like this?  (There are plenty of sites where EQ folks rp their characters in Norrath).  Simple, it wasn't a copyright issue.  It was that they saw something they didn't like on a forum they have no control over.  So what did they do?  The over-stepped their bounds.  Don't think VI is capable of that?  Remember the patch where they sacnned folks' hard-drives to see if they had any 3rd-party programs installed?  I do.  Funny how they stopped doing that in the time it takes, say... a C&D order to be sent.<P>"Power corrupts.

</FONT><HR>Frankly I thought the story was excellently done.  It stayed "in character" and purveyed the message it was meaning to with great success.  I'm sorry but to post a story on a message board with the sole intent to share your writing ability is not copyright infringement.  If she had this published and attempted to profit from it without asking Verant's permission, then yes, it would probably be such, but to post a writing sample on an RP-message board that is made up of similar type stories is a joke.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree bloodsage, you included references that belong to EQ. On the other hand I see they are setting a double standard here, if they banned her because of references to EQ then what about EBAY, sorry to bring it up but that is also a clear violation.  How can they ban one and not the other. Come on Verant lets see some consistency in what your trying to do. Send us all a clear message instead of picking on one or 2 people. You pick on the individual because it costs you no money. You could start a legal proceeding towards Ebay but that would cost too much. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I just read both those stories that Arcadian posted. The first was not written by the one who was banned. The second, which Mystere was supposedly banned for, was fairly tame. I imagine it's a pretty safe bet that a lot of folks here have read far more graphic things. Sure, I would think sharing that story in /shouts inside the game would be grounds for suspension... but posting it on a fan site as fanfiction? Please. It's so maddeningly wrong, I just have trouble believing it's true.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well folks...I am a friend of Mystere.  I called verant and after much fussing spoke with Mr. Scotto &lt;biggun' of customer service&gt; regarding the situation.  Here is a tiny bit of information:<P>Mystere was banned because they feel he is not the 'kind of person' they want playing Everquest.  I swear by all that is dear to me, THIS is the excuse he gave.  Now, as for their back-up?  This:<P>Mystere posted a story &lt;contents aside&gt; to a non-official Everquest Board.  The part of the TOS agreement they sited to me as having been breached is #6...<P>6. We may terminate this Agreement (including your Software license and your Account) <BR>immediately and without notice if you breach this Agreement or repeatedly infringe any third <BR>party intellectual property rights, or if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you <BR>provide to us, or upon gameplay, chat or any player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole <BR>discretion, inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game as set forth in the player <BR>rules of conduct, which are posted at www.everquest.com. If we terminate this Agreement <BR>under these circumstances, you will lose access to your Account for the balance of any prepaid <BR>period without any refund. We may also terminate this Agreement if we decide, in our sole <BR>discretion, to discontinue offering the Game, in which case we may provide you with a prorated <BR>refund of any prepaid amounts. <P><BR>In particular &lt;because I asked...&gt; Mystere was banned for this part - 'chat or any player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole <BR>discretion, inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game as set forth in the player <BR>rules of conduct'<P>Well, after some quite displeasing discussion and some non-definitive answers from Mr. Scotto, I took a good long look at the Rules in question.  Imagine my suprise when the first thing there in print is:<P>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE BASIC RULES OF CONDUCT THAT GOVERN PLAYER INTERACTION AND ACTIVITY WITHIN EVERQUEST AND IN THE OFFICIAL EVERQUEST FORUMS. <P>Not just once does it say this in big capital letters, but twice.  Verant has some serious charges to answer to here.  If it is about 'copyrights' as Blood mentioned, then all of us over there at the VN Boards will be banned.  We write stories everyday involving intrigue, murder, mahem and yes, even sex.  So, we are looking at censorship and discrimination under the guise of a 'god-complex' as far as I can see.<P>From my conversation, I will say this.  I asked if that meant that at any time someone could come to them about anything in my personal life &lt;ie. a real life event that involved EQ&gt; and they would 'investigate' it and deem me worthy or not.  The answer was yes.  And that my friends, is simply unsatifactory to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Most of you supporting her are all forgetting one thing.  You speak of Free Speech, but you forget that free speech has NO bearing on contracts with private sector companies.<P>Think about this.. A woman and man fall in love, get married, all is great.  Then one day the man starts abusing the woman verbally.  He never hits her, but he mentally torments her.  The woman, by being married, is in a contract with her husband, just as he is with her. <P>Now, by law, at least in the US, he has every right to say what he wants to his wife, but does she HAVE to take it?  No, its a contract and she can break it if she is no longer happy with it.  She files for divorce.  Now, this man has been banned from his wife, but society sympathizes with the woman, as it should.<P>In this case, a company (Verant) read a publication (it was a story, posted to a public forum, therefore it was a PUBLICATION) by one of its customers under contract.  The company decided it was not in its best interest to be associated with this person and her PUBLICATIONS any longer and chose to end the contract with her.  Is that within their right?  Of course it is.<P>There are many things I think Verant has been wrong in doing such as making this forum so strict that the simpliest of complaints could cause a person to be banned.  However, that being said, it is within their right to ban anyone for any reason on any day.  People do not have the right to play EverQuest.  If you are banned, your rights have not been violated.<P>Sarra:  I do agree that Verant should be a lot more detailed and forthcoming about what will get a person banned both in Verant forums and outside.  Still, whether right or wrong, they do have the right to terminate any contract with any customer at any time without warning.<P>Traken<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I did my research and read the offending article.<P>This is quite an interesting case.  As an aspiring author, it concerns me that someone could be banned from the service for writing an objectionable piece of literature.<P>I can quite well imagine that others inside Verant completely understand this point of view.<P>The problem though, is that the game content has been combined with what could easily be considered objectionable material by someone not liscenced to do so.  I believe that Verant would have had a fairly tough time making the decision to ban the author over this, however they are well within both legal and moral rights to do so.<P>It *is* very unfortunate for Myste, as the story itself is well written and obviously something (s)he worked hard to put together.  I'm actually quite impressed from a literary persepective - without an editor, the piece is easily as good as a comparably long section from the average book inspired by the RPG genre (be it computer games or pen and paper style.)<P>Myste has I think made a large oversight in combining EQ content with a story of this nature.  Many others might make the same mistake - creative people learn not to be wary of these types of things, usually it will stifle creativity.<P>In summary I'd have to say nice work Myste.  Keep working on these types of stories, and don't let something like this hold you back.  I think that you too can understand why Verant have taken the action they have taken, but don't let it stifle you - choose your subject matter more carefully and keep going  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Verant - well I guess it was a tough call you had to make one way or the other.  George Scotto - if you really said what was quoted, shame on you.  You have no right to tell someone that 'people like X are not needed' - it is demeaning and potentially detrimental to their art.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You know what would have made this whole issue very interesting?  If the author pretended to be another character on the everquest.  In other words, suppose I write a very disgusting and sick story on a seperate web site not owned by said proprietor.  I then sign it as, say "GnomeHud on Karana".  Suddenly GnomeHud finds himself banned for writing a disturbing story he didn't write.<P>It is unfortunate for both the company and the player, but the company must share the fault that this situation arose.  You see, there is very little the company can do to establish said credability or authenticity above.  As the story was not in their own message board, they have no resolute to investigate or know of such evidence.  It puts them in a bad position because then they cannot make a clean judgement as to who did what and what action to take.<P>In many countries (democratic anyway), their constitutions, or charter or rights/bill of rights/Individual rights act - they have a section that stipulates not only "every persons have the right to due process", but also that "persons will be deemed innocent in a court of law until proven guilty".<P>... However, we are not dealing with a country here - we are dealing with a private contract.  If the contract does stipulate that the company can terminate the contract at their own whim without penalty and the indicidual signs that contract, they are bound by the terms agreed.  <P>The only problem is that by reading the contract, it does not clearly stipulate that the company can cancel said contract for the reasons aformentioned above.  If the individual did feel up to it, they could have a small-claims court case cased on this.  They would have to investigate the Californian "contract laws" - under common law, to find out more.<P>- And the company could countersue, so it could end up in a lot of fun and games!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I read a lot of bad fiction here to try and find something shocking, and I can't. Story in Oasis? Story of disection? This stuff is no worse than you'd find in a PG-13/R rated movie, or even on latenight TV. With the references to EQ things like "root" spells and such, it was just funny to me.<P>Sorry incident and a poor move by Verant CS folks. Weak, lame power corrupts weakly and absolutely.<P>I'm not a lawyer, so I have no idea the legality of it, but I will say writing something in your EULA does not make it law. They might say "If you cuss in game, you're obligated to pay $10 per offense" or "we'll kill you", and of course, these things aren't legal. No more can you open a restaurant and serve only whoever you like "based on your sole discretion". Free speech is a not a small thing, and since none of this appeared on any Verant affliated webboard (or in game), it seems extra problematic for someone to try and justify it.<P>Fortunately for Verant, this is an isolated issue and getting stupidly/unjustly banned from a game is hardly something worth spending time on. However take not all you little EQ'ers - be nice EVERYWHERE you are, or someone might just get wind of it and ban from the game!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Copyright Infringement would involve them worrying about taking the story down. This has nothing to do, and is totally seperate, with getting banned from the service. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020716-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020716.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020716-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020716-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020716-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=020716&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=020716&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
