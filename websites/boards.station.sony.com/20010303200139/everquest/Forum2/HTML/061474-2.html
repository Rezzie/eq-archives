</FONT><HR>No drop items don't fall on the floor. If they were, it could allow some one to do a part of a quest and managed to make the item fall on the floor for someone else to pick it.<P>No drop items poof.<P>Just imagine if your bowl did not poof and come to your mouse cursor. You could switch it with one your bags. Now if there is a No Drop item in each of your bags, or have No Drop conteners you can hand it to a friend.<P>You don't need to be omniscent to figure that out. You just have to ask yourself the question: What will happen if he tries to give me a container? What will happen if he tries to give me a lore item I allready have? What will happen if he gives me an item that can't fit in any of my bags? I don't think it takes a genius or a fortune teller to feel that troubles can occure in these situations.<P>If you think about it the problem is not very easy to solve: What should happen at the moment the NPC is about to give you your No Drop container and the code notice you cannot hold it in your inventory? Should he give back to you the quest items saying something in the line of "You are not ready to hold the reward of the quest". Great idea! But what if you multiquested the quest and don't have room for all the quest items?<P>Writting this It gaves me an idea: what if the Npc hands a Note (tiny item lore No Drop weight 0.1) if he can't hand the reward? You can trade the note for the reward with him after you made some room in your inventory, and the Note will allways found a place in it as you just gave the NPC one or several items.<P>The only flaw I see is that a clever guy can manage to do a quest twice at the same time, as the reward and the Note are two separate lore items (this case is very specific and might not be something unbalancing...)<P>Now the fix may took so long for VI to do that, seeing the benefits, I doubt they will aver consider it. In EQ 2 maybe...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If you turn something in and you cannot accept the item into your inventory, then give them the stuff back.<P>I realize that with the current game wheezing and about to fall into disuse that collecting your $3,000,000 per month prevents fixing things like this, but please consider in future games how the game designer has more power to solve problems like this than posts to message boards do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have had this type of situation happen to me numerous times, the way in which the quest works is you dont know the next item until you get it. Which sucks if you dont have a open slot or open container slot. <P>I disagree with the thought that its all or nothing, either you have a slot or you lose everything. Is it really so hard to code in for the npc to give you back items if you dont have room? Or a ok or cancel box when your about to recieve an item from a npc that tells you this is a item or a container?<P>Stick with the "vision" verant and stop making the npcs mindless robots, if you do something for a npc in the game the npc should give you the item or say you dont have a slot open  and give you back your stuff nuff said.<P><BR>E-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agreed- you MIGHT have a no-drop item in every bag or you MIGHT have lore items that all your friends have.<P>But if it went to the cursor (Has to be EASY for them to fix because they already have code that does this) then you can choose your pain.  Or you can call for help- get a mule sent to you.  <P>Did you know that items on your cursor remain through logging out and zoning?  <P>So you could go to the BANK even.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm. I've no idea what you guys do but I never walk around with less than 3 slots empty on my characters. Food and all the other "stuff" i have to keep on me goes in one backpack then I have 3 or 4 emptys to put "loot" in if I so desire to keep it.<BR>Course, as a cleric with just a 81 str this makes sense to me. Of course I'm also not at the level where I could go buy 8 weight reduction bags and be able to tote a butt load of loot around. BUt then again, if you're that high level you should realize that if you're doing a major quest you SHOULD always have at least 2 slots open. regardless.<BR>Sorry to hear you lost it man, but it happens. At loosing 30 hours because of a bug/bad call on your part, or whatever does stink. But at least the 2nd time it will go faster because now you know what/when to do things :P<BR>Good luck with it.<BR>Mystrak</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>this is just one of the many problems with verants idea of a quest system.  You give mob x item and y item and he they arent correct so he says this isnt what I need. *POOF* bye bye items. How hard would it be to code it so if an npc hates you or doesnt like the items you give him he returns them to you and tells you to go away. I have watched so many people turn in items for epics and have npc eat them for no reason. You cannot even kill the npc to get this stuff back. Annoying. I have all the parts for my epic and I am afraid to turn them in after I watched 2 members of my guild loose their epic items because the NPC was having a bad day.

</FONT><HR>Grrr...I have seen this 3 or 4 times. Its bad coding, Verant error and no stretch of twisted words will ever make it "player error." GM Leycrow knows this...problem is it is official company policy to not reimburse in this situation.<P>Had you read the spoilers, and read this board heavily...you would have known...but that kinda takes *ALL* the excitement out of the quest. Verant through their CS people on this board have even posted you should always have an inv slot open (warrior epic requires this also). Of course they have never quite been able to grasp that this makes no sense realistically. I mean...you can hold a bowl in your hand while you drop a backpack to make room? Its not even consistent with other items in the game...I buy a backpack and have a full inv...it drops to the ground. An npc gives me a non epic quest container...it stays on my cursor...shrug.<P>The biggest problem is GM staff have in many cases been so limited in some situations as to be almost powerless. GM Leycrow has always been helpful to me...but rarely has solved the problem because of "company" policy.<P>EX: Fighting in Howling Stones. Across the board spike on all servers about 4 am resulting in all servers going down briefly and most people not being able to log back on for 15-20 minutes. I was in the 2nd room past the south door(4 spawns in room all dead at time of spike), rest of party was in the first room (no spawns except for the nice aggro you get from the golems thru the locked door). I finally get back on after being told in chat gm's were going server to server to do rezzes etc. I see in the Chr select screen im still in HS(meaning alive) but will be dead soon as I log in so log a secondary on and find 3 of my other 5 party members on secondarys...our druid has posted on our website he cant wait and has logged for the night....same for the cleric...yippee...rogue, enc, and sk left...they log in and with mezz, charm, lifetaps etc manage to kill golems and 2 rovers get to zone in where I log in my druid and port them out. I wait another 90 minutes (been over 2 hours at this point) for a response to  my petition and go to sleep. About noon the same day i log back and petition again. GM Leycrow responds. keep in mind this is noon CST in the US. total sever pop was about 500-600, maybe 5 people on in my guild of 80. I explain what happened. First he says he cant help with ld issues. I explain again it was across all servers and GM's were giving rezzes...he says hell check....comes back and says yes, verified the trouble but he cant help me!?!?! What he is allowed to do is let me log in and die...then summon my corpse to the zone in. I ask if he can just kill the mobs in the room so I can use a gate potion...nope, not allowed...hmmm....He suggest I get a cleric to rez me (hehe...good idea!), I explain there is all of maybe 10 clerics on at the time and all the ones i know and/or have asked are either zones and zones away or in groups or have no HS key. I finally get across to him, that I want to be able to use this chr now for something, sure i can wait 3 or 4 hours and have a rogue cleric etc come get me...but that doesnt help me now, I just need to get out. Nope sorry...cant move someone from a keyed dungeon...hehe...even though im stuck there because of a confirmed verant tech issue. When I kinda say exactly that he then backpedals a little and says theres no way he can confirm when my chr went ld so he cant help me at all really, but he would be willing to have me log-in and die and summon me to the zone.....<P>Well, overlooking that I know character records are stored for more then 12 hours and he could easily have checked to see when that character was last logged in/out i dont argue and just wait the 6 hours to get my character back. Verant has said "not allowed under any circumstances (even of our own creation) to remove a player from a keyed dungeon." So he has to follow it or possibly lose his job. <P>Shrug, Leycrow in my experience has been polite and courteous, but helpful rarely. I dont blame him, I blame Verant for having policies that leave him no room for interpretation or action.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From Alan:<P>"I'm sorry that you lost your item. But in the case where the NPCs is going give you a container you must have an open inventory slot for that container. This is something that most people understand by the time they've played long enough to be trying to complete an epic quest. We've posted about this, and I'm pretty sure that this was also placed on a patch message.<P>I wanted to take this opportunity to stress this again. If you are completing a quest, any quest, make certain that you have an inventory slot open to receive any items that are given to you by the NPC. It is recommended that you keep a few open, just in case."<P>Alan, this is JUST PLAIN WRONG.  Why does the game have such a destructive feature?  It would be so easy for you to code in a little defensiveness to this.  If your inventory is full, stick it on your mouse pointer.  After all, didn't stuff used to go on your mouse pointer?<P>The game conspires against you on every turn at this.  Who realistically keeps a primary inventory slot open at all times?  It's IMPOSSIBLE to do!  Every item you put in your inventory automatically goes FIRST to that empty primary slot before going to a bag slot.  Every time you pick something up the game tries to fill that slot.<P>Try being a foraging class who automatically, by reflex, hits the forage button whenever it becomes white.  Woops filled up a stack and started a new one?  It just went in that primary inventory slot you were trying to keep free.<P>What's more, there are other similar situations where you have coded into the game to prevent this from happening.  Try to loot a corpse when your inventory is full?  It won't let you.  This has been changed since EQ was released, so obviously someone thought it was bugged enough to fix it.<P>This is SO EASY for you to fix, and there is NO EXCUSE in putting this burden on the player.  How realistic is?<P>"Here is the quest item you requested."<P>"Well done, Howwl, here is an ancient artifact lost through the generations, of great power."<P>"Hold on I don't have anywhere to put that."<P>"Oh, well I'll just destroy it then.

While I agree that Verant shouldn't have to protect everyone from mistakes, there are some cases where the mistakes are not the fault of the player but of unexpected results of the code.  It's not logical for an NPC to destroy an item if your pack is full.  It's not realistic.  In fact, NPC's shouldn't put items in your pack, they should hand you the item for you to do with what you like.  Just because a "bug" is common knowledge doesn't mean that it's okay.  Not that this bug is all the common to begin with.  You warned people once and that's what you call good enough?  This will continue to happen and continue to tick people off until you get it fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I find it rather appalling that Verant would classify this sort of occurrence as a Player Error. <P>This is really a result of an atrocious user interface. EQ is a throughly unforgiving game and this is one particularly bad instance of it. <P>It would seem incredibly easy for the program to prompt the user before their item is destroyed by telling them they must drop/destroy something from their inventory before they can receive an object they are being given. If at that point the user doesn't do anything then the item should be destroyed.<P>Either programmatically this is difficult and Verant cannot admit this, or no one @ Verant has enough interface design savvy to realize that it's the game designers at fault here, not the users.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I myself wonder why some quest items do come up on your cursor, and others go directly into your inventory.  <P>A very good example of this is the stomped jumjum quest in Rivervale.  Speaking to a particular halfling will get you a note to take to a deputy.  Upon saying the correct phrase, the note appears on your cursor, and you can then put it in your inventory.  When you give the note to the deputy, he gives you a coin to take back.  The coin does not appear on your cursor, but rather pops directly into inventory.  Why are both different?<P>And container quests also appear on your cursor as well.  In Cabalis, for the curescale armor quest, you say the correct phrase to the NPC and he gives you a container to combine wolf skins in.  The container appears on your cursor, not directly into inventory.  Same with the beetle eye quest in Neriak.<P>Maybe it has something to do with the zone?  Both the coin and the bowl quests are done in Misty Thicket, and both go straight to inventory.  Hmmm...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is actually affecting alot of people. After I had this happen to me, I then found out from 3 other druids/rangers on my server, then started reading about several others all over the message boards on EQVAULT, etc., that have had to do this part of the quest over again because of this bug.<P>The real sad reality of this all, is you can only do this part of the quest over so many times because of NEGATIVE FACTION changes to Gix in Kithicor, so combine this bug with druids that have possibly helped other druids or rangers kill the Dark Elf Corruptor in East Karana, then you have someone that is completely unable to do their epic quest, EVER.<P>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket NEEDS TO BE CHANGED so she gives you the Tin Bowl **Container** into a MOUSE CURSOR.<P>Instead of dropping the Tin Bowl into the MOUSE CURSOR like most other quests would, it tries to drop the item into an "assumed" inventory slot. (Thus losing the Tin Bowl completely if you have all your slots filled up with backpacks, jboots, Manastone, etc.)<P>While there is a good lesson to be learned from all of this, an EPIC QUEST, ESPECIALLY ONE WITH FACTION HITS is not the place to do it.<P>There are countless other quests that MOUSE CURSOR DROP correctly. (For example, when the Shakey Scarecrow Quest in Rivervale gives you the Wraithing Hay Bag)<P>Why penalize the player-base for a programming fault? There is no excuse for continuing to leave this the way it is.<P>Please fix this, or at least exercise good customer service and give the Earthstained Notes back to the people that lose them.<P>By not fixing major bugs like these, Verant is clearly encouraging people to read quest spoilers as the original post stated.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's the situation as I see it:<P>- The code for handling automatic inventory isn't very good.  Two things happen: main inventory slots are filled up first, making it difficult to keep them open; and quest items are forced into the inventory, causing them to disappear if it does not have the right-size slot free.<P>- This is a fairly well-known fact.  See many posts on Wurmslayer trades gone bad and quest containers poofing.<P>- It is not a difficult matter to have a space free in your main inventory for quest results, but it requires conscious effort on the player's part. However, it is *completely* within the player's control to maintain this.  It is Verant's policy not to reimburse for any losses that are either (a) within the player's control or (b) completely out of Verant's control and the player's (i.e. linkdeath).<P>- This increases the mechanical complexity of the game, and many people find that undesirable.<P>What it boils down to is nothing more than bad interface design.  It's not a bug, it's not bad service, it's just more awkward.  It's fine to ask for interface improvements; I have done so more than once, even started a thread on it after losing my tin box the first time.  But you're not going to get the issue addressed if you mislabel it and slander (er, libelize?) a particular GM who is doing his job just the way he's supposed to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
