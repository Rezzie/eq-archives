</FONT><HR>As far as Out of Range healing/buffing.  A character on an opposing team, who is out of your PvP range, is healing a character of thier own team while, you are engaged in cambat with, the player receiving the healing/buffing.  I don't have much of a problem with this.  It is team combat.  The stronger team is the deciding factor.  Limiting the PvP level range reduces the team aspect of the PvP.  If, any change is made it should be to increase the level range, to allow for greater team play.<P>If, different teams want to group for exp or even guild together, fine, let them.  However, they should not be able to cast benificial spells on an opposing team.  This will tell you how strong their alliance really is.  Will they still band together if, they are restricted in the level of aide they can offer each other?<P>As for not wanting to have to watch, as a group member dies while not being able to get involved, that is the risk you take when grouping outside your team.  Either close your eyes or try to persuade the attacker to give the opposing team member an opporunity to leave unharmed.<P>Team PvP is about zone control.  It used to be about which team could loot the best gear.  Now it is about which team can hold the best zones.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are several major problems right now in the teams environment on TZ and VZ:<P>1)Cross Teaming. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do whatever you can to eliminate this. Make it so that crossteam healing/buffing doesnt stick, and guilds can only have members of a single team. My main character is dark, and it is so annoying that it's 3 on 1. You might even go so far as to eliminate the ability for members of opposing teams to group for exp. There are so many people on these servers that don't participate in the PvP, and have good friends on other teams. These people should have the option of moving to a carebear server, where they belong, if these changes are implemented.<P>2) Rallos Zek needs to have some kind of system for not dealing damage to party members or guild members. And as for the people whining about wanting this on team servers, well YOU SHOULDN'T BE GROUPED WITH PEOPLE OF ANOTHER TEAM ANYWAY! So deal with the fact that your ELF Wizzie does damage to a DWARF guildie/group member.<P>3)OOR Healing. This is very, very low. But there are still people out there who do it. Make it so you can't heal someone, say, 10 levels below you. Yes this would almost eliminate Power Levelling, that's just another advantage.<P>4)Exp deaths. Why aren't player kills handled like mob kills? If I am fighting someone for 5 minutes, we are both down to 10% health, and some Sarnak walks up and plasters me, I will lose exp. If I was a MOB, the kill would go to the person who did 90% of damage, not the person who got the finishing blow. This won't fix exp kills where someone walks up and roots you while you are running from a mob, but that'd be really hard to fix, and I have no ideas on that one.<P>To sum it up, the biggest problem is crossteaming. You force people to group for exp, so you shouldn't have any problem forcing people to play with their team.<P>Thanks.<P>Mogbob Midgetbane, 40 Troll Shaman<BR>Mozen Darkbone, 22 Roodite Necro<BR>T A L L O N  Z E K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Unresistable DDs (including lifetaps) are completely overbalancing.<P>four lures will kill me no matter what, a 54 ranger, a wizard can basically just stand still and channel through to kill me , there is nothing at all I can do about it...same with necros and lifetaps. <P>SK harmtouch is also WAY overpowered, one SK lifetap and a harmtouch will kill me. <P>Anything unresistable and instant (lures, lifetap, HT) is ridiculously overpowered PvP...<P>PLEASE make it so these spells can be resisted. I understand that being able to land nukes and lifetaps is important to these classes, but not full damage EVERY time, it makes resist gear pointless and the outcome of most battles pre-determined. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Q:  What do these have in common?  World Peace, cure for Aids, end of world hunger, cure for cancer, Verant fixing PvP<P>A:  They all about have the same chance of getting done in my lifetime.<P>Listen up folks, Verant has one of the most debatable patches in months; and the same DAY they start this thread as cover fire.  It is working well too, or we would have tanks coming unglued all over Verant; coupled with their healers.<P>I play on Vallon, only characters i have on EQ (over lvl 4).  We need to let this one die, because in another month/or so, or after the next wierd patch; Verant will start this thread up claiming they need more input and research.<P>BLARG.  Nothing is being said that was not said a month ago, was not said a month or so before that, and has not been a continual beg for justice on this board since PvP came out.<P>Someones job at Verant/Sony for the last two days was; "whenever the PvP thread gets to about 5 pages, close it, start another with some nice BS, rinse and repeat; until they get tired and stop posting".  Absor's job was; "if the tank/healer thread gets ugly, post on the PvP thread to drown them out".<P>some short facts<P>PvP servers are CS (customer service) intensive - CS costs MONEY<P>PvP servers are the 3 lowest prime time population servers of the game.  low pop = LOW MONEY<P>PvP servers have multiple problems that require multiple fixes.  fixes COST MONEY<P>PvP servers to not fit the Vision (tm)<P>Bottom line, this is like Ford Motor and the flaming Pintos, they think losing a few clients in the long run (when the next game comes out as opposed to Death at least) is more cost effective than actually fixing the problem. (IMHO, if it was gas tanks, Verant would still make the same call)<P>I would almost hazard a guess that the next survey is "would you pay $50 a month for a PvP server?" then they will say that there were not enough yes responses to make it viable.  Course the results will be as public as the satisfaction survey.<P>I get ill watching PvP's jump on a thread like this, similar to a hostage changing sides to his captors during a long seige.  But fear not, one rule is that if you don't take care of the client someone else will; those games appear to be in the pipe.  We just have to wait for them and then /wave.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One last thing then I shut up and just read...<P>DON'T let the leaders and/or well known players speak for the rest of the player base. There is no way they can know the needs or wants of each person. Let people continue to have voices like you have so gracefully done. History has shown that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. You tend to forget what it was like to be a n00b when you have played since 99', so then you would not be the best choice to represent someone who comes into EQ for the first time screaming TEAMS TEAMS or GOOD vs EVIL or some such nonsense.<P>The mostest more uberer and the newest newer lime green n00b should have a voice on equal ground. I am not saying that the greens judgment should be taken over the old timers experience, but at least let them be heard.

</FONT><HR>I think there is alot of pvp issues for me it is clear that you didnt spend your main effort on pvp, but I play on Rallos 60 Wizard is my main char, so I might as well give my to copper.<P>Unresistable DOTs like WingedDeath is a killer why cant it be resisted or at least almost not.<P>Another DOT problem if I want to dispell a dot I have to cast some kind of dispell on me and it will take a random buff/dot and try dispell it the problem is this since the dot is unresistable but magic based I would actualy be better of if my Cleric friend didnt buff me with MR I cant remove the buff myself since I didnt cast and I cant resist the spell anyway so all it does is make it harder for me to dispell the dot. This is mostly linked to the Winged Death but I think the same issue is with Splurt. The point is I want to be able to cast a spell on myself to only try dispell the harmfull spells, (or chose what spell it should remove but that would probably be hard to implement). as it is now essentialy only classes that can heal can really use buffs if they fight agains a Druid with Winged Death all others are going to get more trouble when they try to remove the WD.<P>Why do SK HT (might be changed in last patch) and Necro drains do 80 persent of full damage in pvp when Wizards spells only do 63 persent.<P>Good ratio Necro drains and Healing spells can make it very hard for a Wizard to kill somebody since we dont deal damage that fast in pvp actualy presisely only at 63 persent speed.<BR>Again a problem is Necro drais are unresitable too this is still a mystery to me why are they unresistable? Drains have a good dam and heal to mana ratio. And are extremly fast casting considernig that it is in fact both a dd and a heal.<P>ShadowKnights HT<BR>This is WAY to powerfull even after the nerf.<BR>I shadowknight at lvl 60 now give 1024 in pvp I belive so all you need is a Metal Golem Wand and your HT then you can Death Touch all Int Casters since they have less than 1000 hp without their Shielding spell, this is not ballanced or funny I have stopped wearing my good non nodrop equipment since I dont want to be Item Ganged like that.<BR>As a further note at the high lvls the HT gains 20 more dam per lvl and Casters only gain 15 hp so it gets better and better vs casters.<P>The damage reduction Wizards and other casters have damage reduction on their spells but it seems too much If I blast away on my SK friend all he have to do is start to drain from me and I will run out of mana before I can kill him he dont even have to think about interrupting me or something like that. This is made even worse now that Hybrids cast FASTER than real casters. I must say try think about that one again. It seems so crazy to me that a SK actualy casts the same spell faster than the Necro for gods sake the SK is a tank not a caster.<P>Then we got the Invincibel Cleric<BR>A pure Caster (without pet) cant kill a cleric I doubt a melee can but that is more complex.<BR>There is no spell that with pvp restrictions give damage as efficent as a cleric can heal (mana wise) there is no spell that deal damage faster then a cleric can heal (time wise) and on top of that they have to invulnerability spells. I dont know if this is a problem after all a cleric is "Close to his God" maybe it is ok not to be able to kill him but dont give them any better pvp ablities then.<P>I think maybe that pure Casters have become too fragile all the hybrids have had their spells and tanks have had their weapons made alot better in the new expansions so maybe pure casters need just a little more hp if you sit when a tank double attackes you you can easily lose more than a bouble hp maybe even two. On the other hand when I cast a spell like Ice Spear of Solist lvl 60 spell it is not uncommon that it does less than a bub to a tank.<P>BTW to the ppl that think it is hard to get spells off based on MR try ice everybody has a Cloak of the IceBear and a Crown of the Froglok Kings that alone is 40 vs ice a few more items and their resist is well over 100. If you try a SK then you have to dispell him cold buff for 40 on top makes him more or less invulnerable to all but lures and there is not enough mana to kill a tank with lures.<P>Sorry if my post is not as precise as you wanted maybe I can make a better post later, but there are overwhelming many pvp issues so I just dont know which ones to pick right now.<P>Faikus Salian 60 Sorcerer MtS Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

My question to you is, what is worse for the community, invulnerable healers and buffers or the idea that some guild members might have to start new characters? I don't think there's an easy choice here.

At least those are my thoughts on the matter.<P>Alan<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>"without a good game how can you really foster a community"<BR>The community on TZ does not need to be fostered, it already exists, and has done for almost 2 years, depite the supposedly horrific problem of same-team healers (curiously, despite claims that the the problem is so serious, it took over a year for any major complaints about it to surface). <P>The community does not need to be fostered, it needs to not be butchered to appease a tiny minority.<P>&lt;&lt; some guild members might have to start new characters? <BR>&gt;&gt;<P>Yes, I'm sure that level 60 players see bringing an entirely new character up 60 levels as just a minor inconvenience. And no doubt the debate over which guild members will be the ones required to sacrifice their prized characters will do wonders for guild unity and community feeling.<P>&lt;&lt; But if it comes down to it, a game with the right mechanics might have to be the right choice over community<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>What do you consider "the right mechanics"? An elf team with exactly one (low level) dungeon, with lousy loot, cut off from any port by an enemy zone, cut off from a druid ring by an enemy zone, lacking monks, shadowknights, shamans or necromancers? Their only access to and from the major zones of the game through ports, both ends of which are in enemy hands?<P>Light teams with most of their quests for necessary uber equipment dependent on faction with other light teams, faction which will be impossible to maintain since they will be forced to kill members of those teams, thus crippled in terms of the equipment vital to PvP survival - is that good game mechanics?<P>A Verant-created enviroment in which elves, dwarves and humans appear as allies, backed up by quest-structure, storyline and the presence of NPC merchants in each other's zone, now completely at odds with the way players are forced to play the game - good game mechanics?<P>Some more game mechanics: How do you propose that members of the short or human team operate in Kunark, when all the merchants, banks, ports or guards KOS to them? Will elves, humans and shorties be KOS in their own cities to the NPCs of other races who live there? How does a human druid in Freeport buy spells or receive training? Do they have to cross the continent every time they level? Or should FP and surrounding zones simply be devoid of druids?<P>Absor, which is more fair: that a MINORITY of players who, after a long time during which they were well aware (and umcomplaining) of the game mechanics, suddenly decided they wanted to change the way the server worked, should have to live with the consequences of their sudden change of mind? Or that a MAJORITY of players who created and developed characters for 2 years with a certain set of rules should have to lose all their hard work?<P>Finally, if Verant really wants to prevent invulnerable healers, then code the server as 2-team GvsE, the way most people play it, or else just get rid of the invulnerability, and leave the healing. <P>I don't wish to criticize, Absor, but my impression from your biography is that you don't have a great deal of personal experience with team-PvP. Maybe you should conduct a server poll regarding how people who actually play it feel about 2-team vs 4-team, or whether they would like to be unable to heal/buff, or be healed, buffed or SOWed by, members of other light races.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hardcoding the teams would be the worst thing verant could possibly do to TZ and VZ. That would ruin friendships and alliances built up over almost 2 years. People come to TZ and VZ for pvp, yes, but there's more to EQ than pvp, even on the zeks. When I started doing the cool pve stuff like killing dragons and such I realized that pvp was only half the fun. Being able to do the pve stuff as well as pvp is what makes TZ great. After playing on the same server for over a year, people want something new. They put so much time into their characters that they have absolutely no intention of starting from scratch. Who would want to start over when they still enjoy playing the same character they have for over a year? Would it be right to force them to do so or quit eq simply because 10% of the server wants to have the teams hard coded?<P>There are some pretty loud voices on this thread, but these voices still make up less than 1% of the population of Tallon Zek. I think I can safely guess that 70% of the people on TZ have friends of races not of their team... the "light alliance". As I had said before, the people who want the teams to be hard coded will be directly benefited in pvp. These are the people who have played one team since day 1, but they only make up 30% of the server. Additionally, the "light alliance" formed to fight the darks, who were less in number but far more organized. With hard coding the teams you'd directly destroy the balance of power on the server, which in turn would likely cause a lot of other people to quit.<P>I go to Karnor's to pvp, and I see 30 people xping along the wall, pulling mobs to the castle. Those 30 people are a mix of human, elf and short, 3 of the 4 teams who have played together since the server opened.<P>I believe a guild war system would be the best to benefit TZ and VS. People can choose their own alliances, friends, allies and enemies. Some bugs will have to be fixed, but then again a true solution to the server's current problems would take time.<P>Selphie<BR>Circle Noir<BR>Pandemonium</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

FV, missing classes and dungeons for elfs and shorts all those things and the quest and faction interaction. But I dont think you as a dark elf should group with humans either and hypothetically speaking for example heal that human when he is fighting a group of dark elves and wins even after taking more then 20000 damage. If single hardcoded teams would be made our server would change to a human vs dark server with maybe some scattered shortie soloing druids that would never see a dragon or the inside of a dungeon... no elves to be seen anywhere, except the corpses from the newbies.<P>Neferti<BR>Human Beguileress<BR>Knights of the White Rose<BR>Tallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok. here it goes. I'm not superman like absor have the time to read through most of these posts, so please forgive me if i repeat some things which others have said. <P>My main char is currently a 52 wizard on Vallon (also known as the home of Xteaming) and here's what i've come to know about PvP in my lvls in no particular order:<P>Problem 1: Cross teaming must stop. Granted Xteaming makes sense from an RP perspective, there will be some traitors among us, and I'm ok with that. The problem I have is that it isnt just a few players RP'ing their chars as traitors, its a bunch of players who are simply out to cause others grief through immortal healing.<P>Solution: Ideally, I would like to see a flag set on the person casting a beneficial spell on a member of another team. This flag would set that person to being on the team of the person they helped, allowing the target of the attack to kill both of the attackers.<P>Problem 2) Faction hits. I dont really care about normal faction hits myself, but i know others do. I play a DE, i'm never going to walk into Erudin or some place like that. But for enchanters, this is hard. If you PK someone when you're only protecting yourself, and take a faction hit, its not right. The hits i do care about are on duels. I dont think it's right if i want to hone my PvP skills voluntarily with someone of my own team, or in a guild event, that i should take a faction hit with my own people for it. Its just silly<P>Solution: get rid of faction hits all together i think is the only way to really deal with it.<P>Problem 3: Classes are not very balanced once you get to the higher levels. As a wizard, I can kill an even con caster fairly easily. 2-3 Nukes and they're dead. An even con melee. I really have no chance of killing, especially paladins. I have on several occasions, unloaded a full bar of mana into a melee and not killed him. Red cons are far worse. Enchanters have it far worse with resists. Sometimes they cant even kill a caster due to high MR. Some classes (druids/necros) also have unresistable/nearly unresistable DoT's. Yes as a wizard, i have nearly unresistable Lures. But one lure, or 3 for that matter, will NOT kill you, but ONE unresistable DoT will. <P>Solution: While probably not feasable due to the fact that it would take too long to code into the system, would be an alternate set of spell effects. One for PvE, one for PvP. That way, we could tone down certain spells and upgrade others without having any effect on PvE, but unfortunately, i dont think Verant is really up to that task. <P>Problem 4: Spell resists. As a wizzie i find that resists count in WAY too much on DD's in pvp. On Vallon, this isnt naked warriors running from caster gankers any more, this is uber-resist buffed warrios, running over casters. I said before, its tough enough to bring down an even con warrior on a full bar of mana, even without him hitting me, much less trying to take a red-con one. Levels factor far too much into PvP resists. I can kill an even con caster in 1 Ice Comet and 1 draught, usually. A red con, on numerous occasions has taken me up to 4 Ice comets. for a caster!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> From what i've seen, a chanter trying to land any DD on anyone post-50 is nearly impossible.<P>SOlution: reduce the amount that resists save in PvP.<P>Problem 5: Invulnerability. While personally i dont think its at all fair that any calss can be invulnerable in PvP combat, but if this must stay, please do something about the fact that these spells (Divine Aura/Harmshield) do not return any status about the spell being active. When i get no response on a spell (no resist message, and no spell landing description message) I think its safe to assume that that person is out of range, but unfortunately, that is simply not the case, at the moment.<P>Problem 6: Harmtouch/Lay Hands. I know you recently fixed harmtouch in PvP. But as it is, its still death touch to casters. And you also recently fixed HT recycling upon death. I think Lay Hands should be set the same way for pallies.<P>This is all i've come up with at the moment. But seriously if you want to know whats wrong with PvP: log on. In the time u spend reading pages upon pages of posts, you could have someone create you a level 50-60 character on Vallon and try it out for a few hours or something. You'll see whats wrong.<P><BR>Cheers  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Arkons, you're right, I did need to reread your posts.<P>But, consider the following:<P>I'm willing to partially agree with you on raising the dmg output of DDs, but only against melees.  Why? Because, as you say, the cleric, sure, he can heal himself, but DDs interrupt casting the heal so if the wizard got off the first nuke, the cleric aint gonna get a heal off.  Heals dont cast fast enough to be a powerful PvP weapon.  So in your example, the wiz does not need to do 100% dmg in order to kill the cleric.  And I assume the wiz is the aggressor, unless of course it was a naked ganker cleric who came to pk you for your wiz robe he cant wear  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Anyway, i agree with you on raising it to full dmg vs melees, but leave it at 66% vs casters.  The reason is because the aggressor caster already has an advantage, if the DD does 100%, the aggressor caster will have even more of an advantage against the victim caster.<P>Your idea on portal ganking is good, and whoever said GMs should check the logs to see if someone was attacked too soon after porting is good too.<P>Your idea on making all items droppable i do not agree with.  Doing that would mean even planar players would be going naked, or they would not have good gear to begin with due to it being taken.  After all, i'm really sure the item gankers casters sell the melee gear they take back to the victim at a fair price...and if you meant to make weapons and shields lootable....that would allow incredible grief to be caused, i mean, it isnt often that a player gets a good weapon...<P>You're right about AE, love your idea on that.<P>I think DoTs are ok tho, and so is pumice, although it does seem necro dots do their damage too fast in PvP compared to druid or shaman dots.  But, like you said, winged death and splurt should at least have a chance to be resisted, even if not a good one.<P>As for the other stuff I have no comment, you are probably right about the resists and all.<P>BTW, it was in gfay that I encountered you, both times.  The first time was one to one, and u ended up gating away after getting nuked a couple times, nearly dead.  The other i cant remember well but i think you were about to attack someone and I attacked you first...again, shadowstep and gate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Alot of people have stated that it would be nice to get the insta casting pumice back. On one hand, I agree, and another I am very objected to it.<BR>  <BR>  I like the idea of pumice being insta cast again because it can get rid of all the buffs on someone pretty fast. This will equal out ALOT of things. It would allow those without the channeling ability to strip buffs off after being hit. <P> The reason why I would be against allowing pumice to be back is because of the pet bug with it. When pumice was insta cast, it was incredibly common for people that I was engaged in pvp with to turn my pet rogue on purpose. This was so common, that I would never use a pet in pvp. I actually started to avoid pvp because of this. <P>   How its done is that someone would use the pumice on themselves. They would remove all their buffs/dots. After they removed everything, they would pumice themselves again which will cause a pet to turn rogue and attack its master. If the pet kills me, I lose exp. <P>  <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant.  I can tell you now (and you can look back on all the other posts and take a look for yourself) that the One Teamers CLEARLY out number those who wish to cross team. <P>People say that friendships will fail if the servers are hardcoded, but I ask you this.  Is a friend really a friend if they are going to hate you for attacking them in the game?  Because if you answer yes to that question, then you have some very shallow friendships.<P>For people that say that Shorts and Elves will be non-existent and will never do any "Uber Mobs", I ask you to re-evaluate your logic.  Many say it is because of lack of Feign pullers (something Verant themselves have said they do not like), and others say that it is because of numbers (which is something that is not a problem for either).  The Shorts are the second most long standing "Team Only" oriented team (only second to the Darks).  Not only that there are *MANY* short only guilds.  To name a few:<P>Liberation of the Underfoot<BR>Army of Kaladim<BR>Scowling Midgets<BR>Merciless Midgets<BR>Tiny Knights<BR>Eternally Tiny<BR>Infernal Elite<BR>Ak'anon Assassins<BR>The Short Army<BR>and many, many, MANY others that do not come to me at the moment (I apologize).<P>Likewise there are many Elf Only guilds for example:<BR>Elven Empire<BR>Faydark Syndicate<BR>There are others, but I am not all too familiar with all Elven guilds.  (Hey!  I kill Elves I don't bother to take a look at tags.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">)<P>Verant you must also remember that the Light Alliance has bullied many people into joining.  They openly abused the invulnerable healing exploit, to FORCE people to play their way.  <P>As for us being all darks, and these are my alternates...  Well I suggest Verant take a look at my account.  Tell me if you find a Dark on my account that is over level 10.  *I* created the Liberation of the Underfoot.  I had to leave EQ for a period of two months due to all the Invulnerable Healing, and other lame acts done by the so called "Light Alliance".  (In that time I gave leadership over to Quintain.)  <P>So please Verant, if you are going to fix ONE thing on these servers let it be Invulnerable Healing.  I assure you that OUR numbers by far out weigh the "Cross Teaming" numbers.  We are not the minority.<P>I will not lie to you.  Yes, some people will leave.  But look at what you have to lose if you don't do this.  Look at your up coming competition.  You will lose SO much more if you fail to fix this horrible exploit.<P>Thank you.<P>Melara X`Shain<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, first off I must say I'm pleased that the PvP issue has been raised.  In my mind the people playing on PvP are usually more into true roleplaying that on the "carebear" servers.<P>However, after playing PvP for close to a year here are just a few things that stick out in my mind - <P>1.  Crossteaming.  It's already been raised numerous times but I'm hoping that saying it again will just reinforce that the problem does exist.  I play Tier`Dal.  All my characters are Tier`Dal.  I do get a bit upset that TZ (the server i play on) has turned into "light" vs "dark", or '3' vs '1'.  I think they idea of not being able to group with someone from another team is an interesting idea.  I will be watching with interest to see how you address this one.<P>2.  OOR Healing - I believe that it's exactly how it should be.  If you have a team of 20 mid 20 lights running into Nek (like they always do *smile) and a pair of 50+ clerics are around healing up the Nek defenders..well....that's just bad luck.  It would be exactly the same way if I was to attack Feydark without bringing in some OOR backup.  That's just silly.  Leave OOR healing the way it is.  Planning a raid is the key.<P>3.  Tracking.  Why is there no Tier`Dal race that can have tracking.  This is a rather defineate disadvantage and to be honest, I'm surprised it hasn't be noticed before.  Trying to get my cenobite belt in Frontier mountains is close to impossible without a tracker to help me and there is no way I'm going to group with an opposing team to complete something like this.  Maybe looking at introducing a class that is accessible to the Tier`Dal should be addressed.<P>Well, those three things are really the only things that really stand out.  <P>I wish VI luck sorting through all these posts and I'd just like to say that it still is a great game and "I'll be looking on with interest" on this thread.<P>Sylvaria<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Arkons: I disagree with your oppinion that the 66% nerf on dd damage needs to be lifted. Heavy hitting nukes seem fairly random, I playing my wiz ice cometed a yellow necro and did full damage even tho he claimed to have 160 CR! The day before I killed a necro 1 level below me with 2xIC as well who said he had 135 CR.<P>It seems quite random anyway with resists I even get your target has resisted ice comet from time to time(the yellow necro I killed resisted it earlier that morning before I went to work)<P>Anyway, I dont feel that wizards 'should' have the mana to solo all classes necessarily. if it means a druid can outheal your damage well your in a grouping guild for pvp you should know that even clerics die fairly easily in group combat and no class is invincible. Wizard nukes are just fine in my oppinion, they still have chance to do incredible damage and if your after more reliable damage use lures.<P>Phreeze 49 Wizzy on Rallos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Coin Loot<P>Now wait here me out!  Well this mainly applies to Rallos Zek.  Those who played on the team PVP servers were given the opportunity of a choice.  One would be converted to coin only, the other team server would remain the same.  Those who played could move to whichever server best fit their ideal of what PVP should be.  People on Rallos Zek were never given this simple freedom.<P>Now I understand the main reasoning behind why we were denined, there simply weren't enough people on Rallos to warrant a server split.  The team servers were different in the reguards that two servers already existed; the cost, time, and manpower of creating a new server just wasn't needed.<P>I propose two alternates to this delima on Rallos.  <P>One is a a simple option for players on Rallos to move to the coin loot only team PVP server (I can never remember if its Tallon or Vallon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) <P>The other, which I personally prefer, is a reworking of the way the Priest of Discord works on Rallos Zek.  On blue servers you turn in the tome and it allows you to attack other red players on the server.  I propose that a similar occurance happens on Rallos, if you turn in the tome you are restricted to coin loot only; you can only loot coins of other players corpses and in turn can only have coins looted off yours.  An option where existing players can be given or even BUY a tome of Discord off a vendor would be preferred too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Someone like Absor or Abashi to specifacally look at our issues.  Maybe a temporary thing, but you would be surprised how a minor issue or patch fix or spell in the blue server severely unbalances or changes the landscape of the PvP servers.<P>I am simply glad that these issues are even being considered.<P>Xaruul, Trooper of Cabilis<BR>Former Beewindy<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay more responses for my critics.<BR>Rafinne: That is not the same repost, that is my original post + the addition i made on the split + the new addition i made on this split.  From now on I will discontinue the practice of adding on each original post to each addition.  and Rafinne if you didn't read the 2 additions, please go back and do so because I put a great deal of thought into them, and you have made other good suggestions and if you read through the topic instead of getting exited about one thing I said you might find you like the idea.<P>T-wax:<BR>Shock of Fire and Shock of ice are in NO WAY interupt spells.  They will not interupt any spell, ever.  The only spell that has this ability without a stun for wizards is shock of lightning.  That statement is complete b\s and you have heard or your experience with them is wrong.<P>&gt;The damage output does not need to be increased. &gt;Even with CR over 120 I have lost 4 bubbles from &gt;ONE Ice Comet. That is a joke. If it werent for &gt;the 33% reduction that IC would have killed me. &gt;And I never even saw a soandso is casting &gt;message. That is not balanced OR fair. <P>T-Wax you just proved my point in a nut shell.  Resistances don't do enough to stop spells IN THEIR CURRENT STATE.  Or are too random to even effect the outcome of a battle.  My entire suggestion is based around increasing EVERYONE's chance of survival with a change to the resistant system.  For a detailed outline of that system, it is in the 3rd addition of my original post on this split.(the bottom one)<P>&gt;I didnt start characters on this server so I &gt;could take loot from other players and I &gt;certainly don't like losing an item it took me &gt;20 or 30 hours to get. That is just not fun. I &gt;would enjoy having Darkenbane attack me by &gt;surprise if I werent so concerned about losing &gt;my stuff. I would be more likely to fight back &gt;instead of gating, running, or bagging. I think &gt;it would improve pvp by a factor of 100. So your &gt;cash flow would slow down if you were a pker, &gt;but so what. The game would be more FUN if &gt;people didnt have to worry about losing time &gt;invested. PvP battles would be a lot more &gt;interesting, instead of seeing the /ooc why did &gt;you run little girl?! comments in every zone. I &gt;get tired of seeing that stuff. If people just &gt;had to worry about fighting, instead of bagging. &gt;You wouldnt see as much of that. It would make &gt;pvp more interesting and challenging for the &gt;pkers. <P>You're right T-wax that sort of thing isn't fun.  What I'm proposing is a system in which the QUALITY of pvp is increased.  Everyone's survival odds will be enchanced, and you will have a chance to attack even though you are attacked first.  It will be much harder to gank someone at low life on this system because ur resists will be much higher when your at low life.<P>Okay Cid, you need to go back and read the ENTIRE post to understand this.  The resistances, everything has to do with why we can increase the 66% back to 100%.<BR>Currently resist saves are based partially on HP, in other words the more HP you have the better you will resist.  Warriors resist better then wizards.  Now what I am proposing is to basically increase the resist saves EVERY class gets to that of which a warrior gets now  AND MORE SO the lower their life gets.  There is no reason for the 66% dmg cap if this happens, nor will their be a need for any other dmg caps because resistances would be in such a situation where it is indeed harder to kill someone then it is currently.  <P>Cid go re-read the entire post and you will understand.  The entire thing, i've added a lot since the first writing of it, and a lot of the stuff is how the %of HP saves will work and such.<P>Cid imagine being able to kill naked gankers easier, but making yourself more immune to them.  Because that is what I am proposing.  Resistances this entire time have not been checking right for low HP classes.  The more HP you have the more your resistances work.<P>Im sorry if I keep repeating myself but it is IMPARITIVE that people understand this.<P>Arkons Arenstaad<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see four basic problems with PvP.<P>1.) Invulnerable Healing.  This is a direct result of cross-teaming, and is constantly used as a tactical advantage for zone control.  The effect of this is that the player who is subject to this is left feeling helpless and frustrated, destroying the fun aspect of the game.  The only way I see of stopping this is coding the teams to prevent cross-teaming.  I understand the effect on the community, but the core gameplay is what is at issue here, and it is broken in this respect.  I signed up for four teams PvP, this is the way the server should have been coded in the first place.  A dark elf should never be able to use the power of his god to heal a wood elf whom he should by his very nature hate.<P>2.)  Resist differences due to levels, not due to equipment or true resists.  Why is it that a level 52 with the same resists as a level 60 takes so much more spell damage from PvP combat?  I understand the need for there to be some difference between the way a spell affects a level 60 and a level 52, but I think the difference as it stands is far too extreme.  An Ice Comet from a level 52 will scratch a level 60, an Ice Comet from a level 60 will devastate a level 52.  The level 60 player should have a definite advantage, but not completely overwhelming insurmountable odds just due to the level factor.<P>3.)  Class Imbalance.  Druids unresistable DOT's such as Winged Death are overpowered, they should be at least somewhat resistable.  High level Necro Lifetaps are overpowered.  Clerics offensive ability is too underpowered, as well as their defensive abilities.  Enchanters offensive spells are too easily resisted in PvP.  Resists keep going up and up, rendering wizards less and less effective and limiting their PvP combat spells to lures.  Sunstrike is slightly overpowered, but with resists going up I believe it's highly overrated.  Lifetaps are nearly unresistable in PvP, and are much more effective than lures.  <P>The class imbalance issues I believe are secondary to the level resists issue, and both are far behind the invulnerable healing and cross teaming problems plaguing PvP servers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, I get it.  Honestly I had no idea resists had any basis in HP, thought they were all based on actual resist values.  Anyway, is what you are saying based on your hp maximum or current hp?  Meaning, if you are a cleric with 600 maximum hps, your resists will be based on that, or based on your current hps meaning if you take a 150 DD, your resists will be higher bc your hp went down to 450?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played on Vallon Zek since day one of the server, having over 130+ days played on my main character.  Here are my thoughts on improving PVP on RACEWAR servers.<P>1.  END CROSSTEAMING.  PUNISH THOSE THAT CROSSTEAM.  Hard code the 4 teams.  Massive faction hits for all traitors and exploiters.  Make them bank and gank each other in Runnyeye.<P>(I cannot stress how severely the lack of hard coding the four teams on team servers has utterly screwed the honest, well-intentioned players and rewarded the those who have exploited the server *guidelines* to gain unfair and *UNCHALLENGEABLE* advantage.  On our server, one group of 4-way crossteaming players (The Prophets, now affectionately referred to as PMS, because they get grumpy as their undeservedly gained power wanes), held Sebilis for about 8 months, because no pure team or even 3-team effort could touch them.  It was impossible without resorting to 4-way crossteaming.  Go check the MOTD on Vallon Zek right now.  Daegarmo basically publicly rewarded them and in effect ridiculed honest players for playing fairly...)<P>2.  Quality GM support, and more of it.  Basically, there are GM's on PVP servers who have never played on one.  The dynamics and situations in PVP is incredibly different, and it takes a seasoned veteran of PVP to be of much help.<P>3. LOS ganking by exploiting Z-Axis differences.  Slamz Biggles said it best.<P>4.  The invulnerability_to-spells-when-you-are-on-land-and-your-target-is-in-water exploit.  Fix this please.<P>5.  Chloroblast should never have been given to druids on PVP servers.  Giving a druid the best PVP heal in the game is a terrible imbalance.  Same goes for shamans actually.<P>Thats all that I can think of right now.  Ill post more later.<P>I urge everyone to read the reply of my very good friend Aadrya to the previous thread, found at the bottom of this link.<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-6.html<P>Tael Elamshinae<BR>57th Teir Dal Templar of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I asked lady d in one of thoes eq chatrooms if they would have self only insta pumices comming into the game she said she really hopes not. So you gotta face facts that lady d's opinion is worth about 20,000 of ours ( ie. never gonna happen). All ideas about how to improve PVP have been brought up many many times before, so how is this thread gonna change anything?. Is verant really waiting for some raical idea to be presented then they will do something?. <P>The 2 biggest complaints<BR>1. Naked gankers/item loss<BR>solution open a /movelog between servers then people will have the choice for coin only ,coin 1 item. I don't see how anyone can complain after that.<BR>2.crossteaming<BR>I don't play on VZ or TZ but sounds like hardcodeing the teams would be the best idea for this. <P>Verant has proved time and time again to not really care much about pvp servers, instead of doing the hard codeing ( this takes work) it is much more easy to put up a "PVP Talk" thread every few months. Dosen't seem like much of a choice from verants perspective. However the first solution of a /movelog has been done many times for other servers, and I don't see why verant is holding back on this one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just had to say one more thing.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Selphie is the queen of cross teaming and invulnerable healing.<P>Clerics constantly die in PvP, it's the life of a cleric.  Everyone targets you, you try to keep yourself alive, you fail.  Yes, you have some means to keep yourself alive longer, but in the end you die.<P>Of course Selphie wants to be able to be invulnerable, she would prefer not to die so that she can go about her merry way enjoying her PvE accomplishments and ruining the game for those of us who want a fair PvP fight and who want a fair chance at zone control.<P>This is not a guildwar server Selphie, it is a PvP teams server.  I signed up for it, you signed up for it.  If you don't like it, leave.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060701&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060701&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
