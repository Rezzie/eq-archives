Player killed you. LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<BR>you have lost a level. i lost exp from tht player.<BR>and at my level, that is a lot of exp. i also lost my level. i petition. GM answers in about an hour. he says "i'm sorry, i cannot resurect you in thet type of situation."  WHY NOT!!! the player went Linkdead and killed me. I LOST EXP DIRECTLY FROM A PLAYER!  could he not rez me? i couldnt do anything about that exp loss. he said well, you a monk, you could of feign death. ya right, you ever FD while a MoB is casting a spell? does it stop casting? i am very angry at the response i got. he even said this is a known problem and the same thing would happen if you were in a dual and went linkdead.<BR>he said he could not do anything unless it was a repeted offense.<BR>ok, its not like i wanted that guy banned. i just want my exp back that i lost to a bug. could he not understand that?<BR>thsi is one of the worst experiences i have ever had with the verant tech support, and i will probably cancel my account due to it unless the problem is corrected.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>Plain and simple PVP in eq is broke and insanely unbalanced. Welcome to yet another reason to not play on a pvp server or take part in it.<P>The guy probably went linkdead on purpose knowing exactly what would happen. All he has to do is have his DD in the last slot and will take out the trash without ever using mana when he becomes an Npc. <P>Reminds me of the time when the first racewar server was up and i had a level 5 halfling druid. A passing dark elf on my run to freep (going to take the boat to get with my race team in butcher) charmed me and tried to kill me ("accidentlY" of course) by having me attack giant spiders, who of course would destroy me if not charmed. But i had my heal in first slot, and dd in last. He sicced me on the spider and I totally and completely obliterated it since I was now an npc caster. I never saw anyone cast a dd so fast. I hardly lost ANY health even though i was naked, having put all my stuff in the bank until i got to butcher. He ran me around a bit more getting the same results and seemed to get bored. When the charm wore off near the zone to freep I hoofed it on to the dock, where i hid until the boat came. <P>These and other silly experiences made my career on the PVP server very short. It was just incredibly stupid and wimpy battles with people going link dead or other crud. I only saw one real fun fight, it was with my level 10 or so naked druid, some naked dwarf warriors with rusty, and some naked elves who outnumberd and outclassed us. As you can see everyone was looking for combat so was naked. This was before they were coin only. The elves would have totally won, but my druid who had camo on snared like 6 or 8 of them, then something hilarious happened. THey all panicked. Rather than keep castign which would have killed us, they all started doing the slow walk to try to get away  guess after being snared. The troupe of naked dwarves with rusty weapons I had befriended beat them down mercilessly. I snared any other elves who arrived on the scene and was laughing so hard I could barely type.<P>All of the battles I were in were so incredibly wimpy like this that I just lost all desire to play on a pvp server. Eventually they all became like the one you describe, someone who obviously outclasses you jumping you then when the battle amazingly turns against them they pull crud like the guy pulled on you. <P>I don't see the reason to participate unless its done right.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There are ways that players can cause others experience loss on the PvP servers.  Doing this intentionally is, as mentioned before, not allowed on the servers and will sooner or later result in expulsion should someone make a habit of it.  That said, the fact that experience loss does occur in some cases (like this one, or like one where someone plays 'root the kiting druid') cannot be eliminated due to limitations to the game engine necessary to maintain the PvE aspects of the game.  These issues are not bugs, and as such are not eligible for GM resurrection.<P>In short, there are times when engaging in PvP that you can lose experience.  <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon posts in a nutshelll why so many will never go PvP. I mean PvPers can refer to other servers as "care-bear" servers all they want to. Fact is, a lot of us want to try it (I know cause I talk to guildmates and friends all the time about it), but all say the same thing-- too many bugs that Verant claims are "working as intended."  Exp thieves, naked looting, root the kiter, and a host of other issues (lets not open the invulnerable healer issue again, but merely refer to it).  Until these issues are fixed (and since Verant says they are, we can assume they will never be), then the majority will shy away from PvP.  it's simply not a fair arena-- the playing field is nowhere near as level as it is on our care bear servers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In defence of PvP...<P>aandai... you may as well stay on your blue server. From your examples, the only PvP encounter that you would enjoy, is one then you have won. With this attitude you definitely WOULDNT enjoy PvP, and would just become like the loudly complaining minority already on the servers. Personally I would have found your initial Gnome encounter as much fun as the crowd controlled elves. You were lvl 5, xp loss? sorry if I'm not all that sympathetic. We're talking of losing bubles of xp in *hell* lvls. You were even naked and so had no risk of item loss, or REAL need for corpse recovery. Sounds like pure fun to me.<P>PvP isnt *broken*, there are some ways in which it cannot pheasably work the same as the blue servers, but such is life.<BR>For every enchanter that complains that charm no longer works, there would be 10 players complaining that they were charm-killed.<BR>For every caster that complains that fear doesnt work, there would be 50 players complaining that they were xp killed by fearing them into camps/mobs (much worse than off cliffs/into lava).<BR>There are certain problems that need to be addressed (like faction hits for PvP encounters) but I'm sure that a HUGE majority of players dont agree that PvP is broken. (My basis for this is that we are all still here.)<P>One tweak that might be beneficial IS however xp loss from LD players. I understand the necessity for LD players to be classed as NPC's, so unscrupulous players couldnt benefit by intentionally going LD, but this shouldnt mean that other players must suffer because someone else goes LD, intentionally or not.<P>Isnt there a way one of your code-heads could come up with a solution to a player either being tagged as a pc or npc, with nothing inbetween. (I wouldnt assume to suggest anything cos, hey, what do I know?)<BR>One doesnt get xp from killing rogue pets, or LD players (not that I would attack a LD player) so there must be some way of differentiating between LD and NPC.<P>Jukkar<BR>Light team<BR>Tallon Zek<P>( ps Ghander... Grit your teeth and wait to FD until AFTER the spell hits.

Other then that, I think PvP works out fairly well at higher levels, although caster's have a crap load of advantages, such as not needing line-of-sight to cast on players.

If you can lose exp from it, yet you are not supposed to lose xp from it, its broke. Either make people gain and lose xp from pvp, or toss it out altogether since its broke and usupported. <P>Someone going purposely linkdead and becoming an npc and killing you causing you to lose xp though nothing is done to them since it can't be proven that they did it maliciously means that pvp is unsupported.

</FONT><HR>I agree that PvP should be advertised as generally 'play at your own risk'.  I think they might have legal obligations to support it to some extent if it was advertised on the box.<P>Verant should be very open about the risks as well, including a full disclosure of all potential problems with PvP and PK in specific.  A separate PvP/PK FAQ section is essential.  It's time to come to terms with the part of the environment that, according to Sony/Verant's own admissions, cause a large number and possibly the vast majority of customer service issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would have thought the ability to "pull the plug" and thereby fight BETTER to be an exploit and as such would've expected it to be nerfed i.e. "fixed" like any other exploit.<P>Is this a case of an exploit that since it hurts players and causes them to level slower is "ok" vs. an exploit that speeds up leveling and is therefore nuked to oblivion, after the uberguilds have of course benefited from it to your satisfaction Gordy?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wait! You mean rooting the kiting druid is illegal? I thought kiting was supposed to be nerfed anyway, and besides, was a wonderfully evil way to kill a druid! I think any one kiting should run the same risks from NPCs and PCs alike... <P>I am totally all for hands off letting people be creative with their spells. It irks me that simple creativity is squashed (i.e. no fear for necros in PVP, although I could see lessening its effect maybe - and losing enchantments for enchanters who attack...what a way to destroy enchanters in PVP! I scraped mine as soon as this happened). I am not sure why Verant cannot just fix the real bugs and stop worrying about nerfing everything in sight.<P>Applaud real creative uses for spells and deal with the real breaches in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I find it interesting that the comment about one day being dust in the wind was run over with a statement that they are very strong with a new record on the number of people playing.<P>This goes along with the statement comparing themselves to Lucas and Disney.  They truly believe that they are immortal. It will be interesting in 5 years when these servers and game tech are obselete and no independent servers (shards or what have you) are licensed to support the game. I feel that this game will not come close to being age defining like Luke Skywalker and Mickey Mouse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=023999&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=023999&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
