</FONT><HR>I want a nice damage causing 1hs weapon.  I want a nice magical shield.  And I want something to drop it for me.  I can make LOADS of money, and for that I will buy jewerly, armor, belts, etc, but my bread and butter will be sheild and weapon.  I told a higher friend that I really need a better weapon, and they said they would keep an out out to see what they can scrounge up.<P>I Politely (I hope) said no...but if you FIND something that drops it, I would not mind the help in getting it for myself.  In other words, when I was sub ten, YES, I was very grateful for hand-me-downs and gifts.  But I am all grown up now, and want to earn my keep.  <BR>I could easily get two or three high friends to twink me so I have no fear.  My Armorer friend would have given me my armor three levels before I could pay for it...but I insisted to wait, to EARN my plat to pay for it...even if it was paying at cost.  Now I can't really afford too hefty of a weapon, but I don't want to buy a magic weapon, i want to loot it.<P>Is this normal behavior?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I recently spent 3 days playing my (level 53/54)Druid without /anonymous or /roleplay turned on, and I will never do it again. I would log him on in his home town of Rivervale, and within 15 seconds I would see 5-20 requests, for buffs, money, items, teleports, and/or powerleveling. Every time I entered a new zone, I got the same treatment. It really made me sick, since I strongly believe in doing things myself. I was especially offended by the beggars who DEMANDED money or magic weapons from me, and refused to leave me alone when I said no. One player in particular hounded me for more than an hour. <P>I used to find a way to politely say no, but now I've decided I have no choice but to be rude - since it's the only way to shut them up. <P>I don't mind giving items and buffs to those players who really need it, and who actually try to play the game for themselves, but I don't want anything to do with beggars.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the ability to get things for my self.  But also there are times I put in the blood sweat and tears and can never get the rare spawn with that item and other times I lose the roll.  Than there are times I win the roll on other items I might have or dont need so I either sell them or trade to get the item I want.  I did put in the time, I belived I had earned the item by fighting off many a mobs to get to the spot and hold the spot.  <P>If I personally got every piece of armor and weapon I use myself the only thing I would need any money for would be donations, and jewelery to be made for me.  <P>I am not saying go out and get alot of money by farming and than just buy the item all the time but sometimes getting something else that someone else can use and trading for the item you need is good you still earned it IMHO.  Case an point I have a friend who was in a full group camping in lguk and he got an ebony blade which is ranger only now he cant use it and I can and did want one.  I told him I was camping the AC in Uguk if I got the gaterscale legs could be swap.  He needed the legs and felt it was a fair trade and that is what we did.  Well I did earn the weapon as the AC didnt spawn for 7 hours and I sat there killing the place holders and waiting and waiting to kill the AC.  <P>I have rambled long enough<P>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 40 summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been thrilled by the gifts I have received. I just about fell out of my chair by the niceness of the complete stranger who gave Tirra most of her armor. And I have been thrilled to pay it forward as much as possible. <P>But you know, nothing so far has beaten the sense of accomplishment of earning my spear myself. Or hitting the combine button and actually making the Wu's  gauntlets for Jakys.<P>Playing Tir last night on Luclin, I did have someone offer me 50pp just because I've been helping them learn the city. Her main finally twinked her, and so she had stuff to spare, and wanted to share it with me. I confused the heck out of her when I turned it down. Besides, I had just shown someone else higher level the way to the bank- and he gave me 10pp (a ridiculous sum, and I told him so). But it was enough to buy my sewing kit and several patterns- and I  whomped wolves and passed out patchwork armor to all the level 1, 2 & 3 folks running around nekkid. That was a lot of fun!<P>Giving feels very good. Receiving can feel just as good. Earning it feels even better. Interaction is the best part. <P>-Tirra</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmmm...<P>Interesting post. I have to sit here and think now. I can only think of 2 things I have, on all my characters on Xegony, that were gifts. I have a lot of things that have been given to me, but mostly for things I've done for them. Such as our guild enchanter giving me several pieces of CHA equipment, because I donated several hundred PP to him to get his skill up. It's just give and take really. Everything else, I made via trade skills, quested, or bought outright. Now, I've done a lot of questing, and hunting for the equipment on my alts as well, but all of it accept 2 items has been earned in one way or another.<P>What are those 2 items you ask? 1 is a cougar claw earring given to me by a former guild mate. The other is an Executioners Axe, lent to me by a guild mate, who then several levels later, told me to keep it when I tried to return it!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"><P>Now, my character on Luclin is another story entirely. He's had several incredible gifts given to him by higher level guild mates, and friends. Kind of an odd feeling, to have the hardest bow to make in the game on my level 15 warrior. and an enchanted FS 2HS bastard Sword as well. Not to mention the PP he was given to get him started (now in all bronze but 2 pieces.) Very generous people there, and I'm very thankful.<P>Anyway, the point of my rambling. I think most people are proud as hell to quest for/earn everthing they have. Gifts are nice, but not required. I admire those who want to earn their equipment. Good luck my friend!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If I was starting a group, and one of the members said they were searching for a Particular item, if no one else was in search of that, well, dibs to them I guess.  I would just want a fair exchange of their loot to offset it.  In other words, if they were going for Sword X on Mob Z, and I was not, but I knew that Sword X was a goodie good good one...Well, I would not expect him or her to also take an even share of other loot as well.<P>If two people were going for it, then roll...<BR>If it drops, and no one was expecting it...then USEABLE Race/classes roll for it.  Just like in D&D, if an MU picked up a sword, when someone else that COULD uses a sword in party, they better give it up.<P>In the heat of battle it is really hard to be fair at times.<P>In my perfect teams, I have been in, this is the way it works.  Puller, beat up all mobs, and ONE person loots EVERYONE after the battle is over.  Then at lulls, they evenly distribute the wealth.  This works well on Derv raids, as just how many MORE CUT-T Rings can you use?  I have yet to sell one to a player yet!  GIVE or Vendors.<P>BUT, when Brass is dropping, and the turn structure is such that one person nabs three brasses...Well that is not fair either.<P>Once I get that good first drop of weapon or shield, then my mind my change about buying or donations, but my first goodie good, I don't want coming from someone so high they did not break a sweat getting it for me.<P>But Egads...if someone walked up and said "Here, I found Soulfire for you, I can't use it..." It would be REALLY tough to not take it, wouldn't it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Early on I would accept gifts if I really could use them but nowadays I've grown to know what my characters can do.  When grouped with a friend I often cancel trades when he tries to give me some loot from a mob.  He just wants to be fair but if I really don't need it he can keep it.<P>I never ask anyone for anything, SoW, Buffs, Breeze, money, ports, or even help with a nasty mob.  I'm use to running everywhere at my speed.  I take pride that I can kill the mob using my own talents and I don't want a free ride.  It's a pride thing or more to the point knowledge and experience through doing without.  A friend is always going looking for SoW.  He needs it all the time.  I've rarely had it so I don't miss it and don't need it.  He feels he's lacking without it but I don't which gives me a mental edge.<P>So, yes, I take more pride in doing things and getting things for myself.  I'm not dependant on others, I'm self sufficient.<P>Kaminaa Gix &lt;Innoruuk's Rage&gt;<BR>Teir'Dal SK of the 33rd Depth<BR>Master Blacksmith<BR>Master Brewer<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

After all, if you're buffed then you've either done it yourself or grouped with someone who buffed you.  if you did it yourself that's a natural class ability, and if you're grouped they're rewarding you for efficient grouping.<P>If course, its possible someone just walked up and buffed you (or PL'd you), but to deal with that they'd need to punish those who do the thing I mentioned first.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And just before he got out of casting range, I hit him with sow and a +250HP buff.<P>He gave me a tell.../This was so nice of you...Why?<P>Because, I replied, in the time it would take me to sell that stuff I could have killed enough sand giants to make five times as much. I'd rather see a deserving fellow like you get it than throw it away.<P>It was fun. I knew I had made some newbie's day.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I only wear four things that I've made or gotten myself. A Jaggedpine Cloack, Testament of Vanear, small protection deity, and reinforced shoulderpads. I enjoy fighting stuff, but I'm not superdooper keen on it, and I usually don't have the patience to keep hacking at the same Mobs until I get what I want (nor do Mobs I can currently kill have anything I really want). When I fight it's usually to have fun killing stuff or having fun grouping, or if I feel I need to level. Naturally at the moment I'm going against that by camping for the IBC, but I really really want that, as I did the Cloack and Testament.<P>I've been given a Chipped Bone Bracelet and a Silver Rose Engagement Ring, but other than that I've bought the rest of my gear with proceeds from Tailoring. And though I didn't whack the Mobs myself, I do feel I've earned the items through time spent in Tailoring and related trades.<P>Gear in EQ seems a bit weird to me. It seems like the Mobs are based against a party who would be wearing stuff that's on Mobs ten levels higher than they are. If someone builds their gear in increments along a similar level as the Mobs they're getting it from, it seems to me it would make things a lot tougher. So, I prefer to buy things ahead of the suggested curve.<P>I'm only 27 seasons though, and maybe when I get older I'll start wanting phat lewt from Mobs that I or my group have a chance of killing. Then I'll be all over it, and have a new and exciting reason for fighting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Palpitus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Except for my Testament of Vanear, a Polished Bone Bracelet and Hand Woven Leggings, the rest of my equipment is bought. And I don't have a problem with it, in Real Life (tm) I didn't tailor my trousers myself neither. Did you?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The real reason for that is mudflation, the supply of items is continually increasing, so prices drop. This corresponds to a deflation in Real Life (tm) economic terms.<P>Take for example my neckpiece. A Blackened Iron Medaillon. It drops in the lowest level of Runnyeye. While I could go there and get one myself, I couldn't do it alone, being a level 30 druid. It would take me a lot of effort to get a group of other level 30's together to go to Runnyeye, which is usually deserted due to the Evil Eyes. And if I got such a group together, we would have to camp a room in that dungeon for hours, before I would win a roll for a BIM. On the other hand, I can buy the BIM in East Commons for 40 PP. And I can make those 40 PP easily in less than one hour by teleporting.<P>Again, it is just like real world economics. It is less effort to earn enough money to buy a pullover, than it would take to shear a sheep, spin the wool and knit the pullover myself. If we wanted less items traded, we would have to make more items NO DROP. And the NO DROP items should be slightly better than the dropable ones, when coming of a mob of the same level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Getting what you need from the bloody corpse of what once had it is a nice goal - but not always acheivable.<P>My Ranger has been trying to do this with mixed results.  Armor wise I did the ivy armor quests I could do as I became the proper level for them.  Bracer I remember being easy.  But after awhile of waiting to get to the level to do in Meldrath (hehe I still need a group for him at level 40) when a groupmate offered me his old Ivy Tunic I readily accepted.<P>I bought all my banded armor as I did not want to take the time to become a blacksmith.  I was able to get my weapons from critters until recently.  I had a Polished Granit Tomahwak and the  Short Sword of Morin.<P>Then I heard of the Sap of Piety (Damage 13 Delay 35 or so 1HB weapon) and decided that getting two of these would be nice.  They dropped in Dalnir (good dungeon at level 35) however here is where the problem crops up.  This Sap of Piety is a rare drop off a critter in there and first you need to get one to drop then you need to get lucky and win the lotto for it.  After many hours in there and only seing a couple and loosing the lotto each time, I decided that it was worth while to buy a pair and be off to new hunting grounds.<P>Bought the two then headed to Vellious where I did well agianst the Cougars and got 4 Cougar Claw Earings - 2 to wear and 2 to sell to recover my bank accont from buying the two Saps.<P>So yea try and get the stuff you need from the critters that have it, but do not be afraid to buy something every now and then too : )<P>Saramen Forsetwalker<BR>Level 40 Half Elf Ranger, Drinal server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=006171&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=006171&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
