</FONT><HR>Ideas for undeveloped lands in Antonica<P>The Rujarkian Hills could be that section off of Oasis on Orc Highway just past the Gypsies.  It would be the hollowed out mountain home of Clan Deathfist.  At the top of the mountain would be an open temple to Rallos Zek inhabited by Sand Giants, even powerful Sand Giant Shamen.  (30th to 40th, if PC Orcs ever come about, this would be an ideal location for their city, and Crushbone would be a source of quests and additional vendors / trainers for them)<P>The Frigid Plain is already in game, it is called the Eastern Wastes.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Snow Orcs and Ice Giants would have encampments here, as well as larger-than-normal Polar Bears and roving packs of White Wolves.  Assorted Snow Leopards and such would round it out.  (25th to 45th)<P>The Hatchland would be where Vox's kids roam free in the Icy peaks.  Skyfire, but white, with Arctic Wurms and Frost Drakes (that have no Breath attack, but a chilling Banshee Aura Damage Shield instead).  A few wandering Woolly Mammoths and Giant Polar Bears and Giant Woolly Spiders and Icy Terrors (as seen in Vox's Lair) might also wander here.  Occasionally an Ice Giant will pass through here, but they will have no camp here.  (45th+)<P>The Nest is home to a soaring crystalline palace / city of ice, gravity-defying and as dangerous to walk through as the maze in Velketors Labyrinth.  It would be home to the Aviaks of the north, wrapped up in the model of the 'parrots' from OOT with a Snow Leopard 'skin' over it, resembling arctic owls.  Wandering mobs would exist as per usual, but the Aviaks would be better at clearing them out than the above-mentioned races.  A few Goblin tribes would lay claim to the lower elevation.  (25th to 35th)<P>The Northlands would just be a collective title for Everfrost Peaks, Halas, Permafrost, the Frigid Plain, the Nest and the Hatchland, not a zone in itself.  (alternately, smaller versions of the Nest, the Hatchland and the Frigid Wastes could all be rolled into one 'Northlands' zone, just divided into 'sections' like Mt Rathe)<P>The Jaggedpine Forest would be the ancestral home of the Elven race on Antonica, long since abandoned by that people.  It would exist behind Surefall Glade and be filled with dozens of appropriate 'fey' races and a few camps of wood elves who chose to remain behind.  A shimmering city in miniature would be host to Pixies and Faeries, some tiny lance-wielding Paladins astride Faerie Dragon steeds.  A bucolic camp of good Fungus People would gallumph about the forest on their own business and wild animals galore (bears, wolves, giant boars, bunnies, etc) would roam free.  (25th, but only an evil nasty troll would hunt here, right?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The Unkempt Woods would be a war zone between a circle of Unkempt Druids and the creatures that used their xenophobia to sneak into the sparsely defended woods.  Every creatures here would be twisted and tainted by the foulness coming from the Witches Tower.  Giant Spiders would lurk in the trees and leap down upon their prey with Engulfing Roots attacks and deadly poisons.  Goblin tribes would roam openly.  A few wandering Skeletons and Zombies remain of those travellers who wandered into this wood and found out that the paths all loop around onto each other and lead nowhere...  Rabid Wolves and Pixie Tormenters and even a Rotting Treant stalk the woods for prey to take out their anguish upon.<BR>(15th to 20th)<P><BR>In the far edge of the wood from the Druids, a Witches Tower made from the skeletal remains of the greatest tree in the woods, once the source of great natural magics, is inhabited by three evil sisters and their minions.  Well, not really sisters, save in darkness, since one is a Troll Shamaness, another a Human Necromancer and the third a Dark Elven Enchantress...  Their tower wood be guarded by undead and troll warriors mainly, although a few 'coerced' Unkempts might attack the Enchantresses foes.  (30th to 40th)<P>The Serpent's Spine hills near Highpass and East Karana is an area of Gnollish power, the source of the local Reavers.  The Gnolls of this area are corrupted by the undead and often skilled in the arts of the Shadow Knight and Necromancer.  The local architecture resembles the Egyptian style monoliths seen near the beach in Northern Ro and the Rathe Mts (guarded by beetles), suggesting the ruins of a previous culture here.  The local Gnolls themselves have a jackal-like cast and seem to prefer Egyptian style dress and jewelry, looking far more cultured and sophisticated than their more nomadic (and scruffy) kin.  Regardless, their plans for humans and others who enter their lands involve the same stew kettle...  (25th to 35th, if PC Gnolls ever exist, this would be an interesting place for their 'city')<P>The Dead Hills are the center of power for a thriving cult of Bertoxxulis and several temples of bone have been erected from the remains of the fallen to be inhabited by diseased Ratman Clerics, Shadow Knights, Rogues and Necromancers, Plaguebones and Scourge Spirits.  Human Clerics <BR>of Bertoxxulis and Necromancers can also be seen here more rarely.  Somewhere in the endless plains of bones and wandering ghouls and decaying bits of armor and weapons, a portal to the Tower of Rot, the home Plane of Bertoxxulis, is said to be found, although the key is located far away...  Great corrupt Golems of Flesh and Bone and Corpse Minions would roam the plains, along with the Skeletons and Zombies of Giants that fell in the ages-old conflict here.  (40th+)<P>Broken Skull Rock and the Gulf of Gunthak are  the home of the Broken Skull Clan of Trolls.  They oppose the Trolls of Grobb and are just as savage and fearsome in their own way.  Lacking much land to forage, they reap their sustenance from the ocean, some of their Warriors said to be able to swim out (or paddle sad little rafts of decaying logs) and pull small Sharks to shore to feast upon!

</FONT><HR>There is actually a lot of backround behind the Broken Skull Rock area, and the Waylunder Lakes.<P>Back in the days when Roleplaying existed, and heroes were heroic,  There were 3 people known as "The Chosen."  <BR>  The first "chosen" was A Elf (Indicates High Elf, as he is from Felwithe, but he is a Warrior, not that that means anything.. Bronto Thunderfoot is an Ogre Paladin).<BR>  He weilded a fierce blade, and confronted a somewhat more serene (and living) Trakanon. (It seems he was either truly more benevolent back then, or he was possessed by Nameless.)<BR>  One was a Troll Shadowknight who fought a clan of Dwarves (The Irontoes, they will comment on it if you ask them the right thing).  This Troll SK wielded a flaming sword.  This battle took place at Broken Skull Rock.   This Brave Hero was slain (some manner of treachery, I think another troll killed him in some act of betrayal), and his flaming sword, armor, and remains were laid to rest on a slab on Broken Skull Rock.<BR>   The Troll Shamans gathered their magical power and covered the tomb in a magic dome of crystal.  <BR>   <BR>The 3rd Chosen, I forgot (I think he might have been Erudite, but I don't remember, pretty sure it was a Caster), or it might be Lanys T'Vyl (I'm really unsure as to the <BR>  Someone named NoseSocks posted awhile back about the 4th Chosen (It was said there would be 4 chosen, we know of 3..), about Broken Skull Rock, and some others..<BR>  He, Some others, and I, went out, interrogating, charming, exploring,  all NPCs...<BR> We never found anything beyond base references to Broken Skull Rock from Tumpy Irontoe and his kin.<BR>  We did discover there is an Antonius Bayle (SP? I forgot, LOL) NPC, you can see his casting message (he's presumably, a Paladin).   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The three "Chosen of Trakanon" that I can remember are:<P>A High Elf Warrior (I know that there are none that are Player Characters, but what the hey, the High Elf Guards are warriors) that did several things of note:  He lead the High Elf forces to aide the Wood Elves of Kelethen in routing an Orc invasion.  He aided the Gnomes in petitioning the Elven King to give them the land to found Akanon.  He was the first living being to enounter Trakanon after his self imposed seclusion post Field of Bone/Troll Civil War.  Trakanon gave him a prophecy and an amulet I belive.<P>A Troll who is notable in that:  He unified the last two Troll clans after the civil war that created the Field of Bones (which destroyed the original 15 or so clans and Troll empire).  He traveled to find Trakanon (The patron of the Trolls at that time that had gone into seclusion) and was given a flaming sword and part of a prophecy.  Taking the sword, he took the Trolls from Kunark to Antonica landing near Oasis of Marr.  Once in Antonica, the Trolls and Ogres came into war over the "Troll Invasion".  After much fighting, the Trolls and Ogres signed a peace agreement where the Trolls and Ogres have a mutual protection agreement.  To seal the deal, the Flaming Sword was thrust into Broken Skull rock and then entombed magicly.  Removal of the sword would break the treaty and plunge the Ogres and Trolls back into war.<P>The third Chosen I do not remember but I think was Miragul the Erudite Lich.<P>The prophecy was that a fourth Chosen of Trakanon would come and reassemble the Amulet, the Sword and something from the third chosen and bring about some sort of reckoning.<P>I have more details at home, but have not read it recently.  I used to have my Bard go from city to city and tell Norrath related stories and this was one of them.  Unfortunately too many people thought that I was some sort of GM or Verant staffer and gave me so much grief that I decided to stop.<P>When I get home I'll try to look it over my notes and correct anything I messed up.<P>As for the Dwarfs stories, it was an Ogre and the Dwarf/Ogre war, Dagnor was not a chosen of Trakanon and did not have the flaming sword.  The Trolls were not involved in the battle with the Irontoes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>mgeneral: I have plenty of imagination! Not trying to start an arguement here... I'm just curious. The Stonebrunt Mountains were just a named spot on the map as well, but they are fleshing out that area. I just think it would be cool if Verant would put out another expansion adding perhaps another playable race or two and focusing on the old world (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus) rather than adding a new continent. Anyway, just a thought. (Hint: See also the post concerning adding Kerrans as a playable race... not mine, but I am in complete agreement).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, considering Kunark and Velious were part of the original design put forth for the game, I don't see that as a conflict.  They chose to simply release the game with just those zones that they had ready at the time, so they could start turning a profit after spending so much on development.  What motivations led them to release Kunark and Velious as expansions I don't know, but considering the improved graphics and additional things available, I don't see this as a bad thing..  I'm certainly ecstatic though that they are continuing to add free zones and improve the existing locations..   Hopefully this game will continue to be successful long enough for them to put in all the zones shown on the map.  I'm sure they have ideas for most of these zones already and I'm looking forward to finding out what those are..  I just wish it didn't take so long for them to make one zone!!.  we gotta wait til later in the year for Stonebrunt Mountains?  that doesn't speak favorably for all the other zones being added anytime soon...  love those ideas for filling out the zones from the previous post..  who knows, maybe Verant is listening.   hehe.  reminds me of the line from Curse of Monkey Island..  "The monkeys are listening!"..  er, not to say that Verant employees are monkeys..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bixies could have a neat mini dungeon.  This came up the same day they changed board format, the idea of lots of lil bitty dungeons all over the place.  Make them half the size of Crushbone or smaller, like the underground stuff in the Field of Bone.  Put them all over the place, little ones like a hive for the wasps in Greater Faydark, and a spider web (where do the widow hatchlings come from?  Do the cling to the bottom of the ship across the ocean from Freeport after running from East Karana?).  Add in a mummy filled buried temple in Ro, etc.  Those kind of zones would only add to the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Interesting idea Grim, not so much new zones as fleshed out 'nooks and crannies' in existing zones.<P>A tunnel underneath the undead ruins in NRo that leads to 'Rahoteps Crypt,' a smallish five room 'dungeon' that is not worthy of a zone to itself, just a half dozen mummies and various other undead and perhaps a minor golem.<P>Some random Bixie court in Misty off to the side with a few caves or perhaps just a woodsy tangle area off to the right near between the Orc camp corner and the wall, where there isn't currently anything, or even perhaps in a section directly over / under the area where the wall meets the zone edge.<P>Areas like this wouldn't need to be zones to themselves any more than the Aquagoblin tower under Lake Rathe or the Marauder caves in Field of Bones, since they would just be discrete 'areas' of existing zones.<P>Interesting.  More content is always a good thing in my book.  Small chunks like this is also quite nice, since it is much more easily doable than creating whole zones, itemizing and pathing them, etc.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sure, we could come up with a great and easy list of little things.  Look at some of the zones, Greater Faydark has huge areas where nothing at all is in them.  Put a big spiderweb full of spiders and a mama spider in them.  put a cave into a face of the zone wall that is full of wasps.  Look at each zone, figure out what could be there that isn't.  This would add nice little spots to hunt in without really needing new whole continents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of using those nooks and crannies of the current zones to add flavor.... But there is a big problem that VI has to fix if they do that.  <P>I was killing the Sythrax Skeletons to get my Sythrax Building Plans (for an Iksar shaman quest).  That burly ogre Gharg OVerboard aggroed through the walls of the mini-dungeon.  And that Skeletal Jester and Sythrax Guardian aggroed through the floor when I ran up the beach and towards Cabilis.<P>The world needs to be substantial.  Those little areas within zones don't work too well yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064532&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064532&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
