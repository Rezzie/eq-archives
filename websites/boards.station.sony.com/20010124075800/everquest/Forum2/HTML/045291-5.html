</FONT><HR>Here's some suggestions that's specific to the issue at hand.<P>1. Ignite/Chill Bones.<P>Remove the skeleton effect. The spell takes almost as long as Ice Comet to cast, is mana-inefficient, has a long recast delay and an all-or-nothing effect. Frankly, this nuke is worse than cleric's. There is no need to penalize it more. However, if you do insist, here are some ways to modify it.<P>(a) Remove skeleton effect. Give the spell a stun effect like wizard's Force Shock.<BR>(b) Remove skeleton effect. Give the spell a fire/cold resist debuff like druid's Ice.<BR>(c) Remove skeleton effect. Make it do 500 dmg initially, and then a 12-second 'burning/chilling' effect (that in reality is a 60 dmg per tick dot over 2 ticks). Change the dot damage as you wish.<P>I like (c) best. It not only gives necro ignite/chill bones a unique (but tolerable raid-wise) property, but also maintains the effect that the spell has in the past at disallowing multiple necros of varying levels to land this spell at the same time on a given mob.<P>2. Damage to Uber Resist-Everything Mobs<P>Necros across all servers want to have a chance at doing damage to boss mobs. That is the real issue at hand. Anything that you add/change that doesn't enable this will not satisfy the necro community. I have an interesting and viable idea that solves this issue almost perfectly.<P>Solution: Take away Infusion and Trudication. As a replacement, add a poison dot at level 54 and a disease dot at level 59. Both dots do 1000 damage to target in 1 minute, heals 1000 damage to caster, requires 1000 mana, almost unresistable (close to lure-like) and stacks with other necros. The only difference between the two spells being different resist checks (poison vs disease). Again, change the dmg/heal/cost/duration of the spells to suit your taste.<P>Here is why I think these two spells would solve all necro uber-mob fight complaints.<P>(a) As master of dots, it's only natural that necros deal a slow and painful death to mobs, which include uber mobs. Therefore, necros using dots rather than lifetaps to hurt these mobs are more in line with the vision for the class.<P>(b) It will not give necros more power in everyday groupings since Bond of Death (720 dmg/heal for 360 mana) and Vexing Mordinia (1098 dmg/heal for 495 mana) are already unresistable on normal mobs and are immensely more mana efficient than the two dots I suggested. Therefore, necros will only use these two spells on uber mobs that resist all other of their spells.<P>(c) It's in line with the necromancer design. Having a dot heal effect allows necros to lich in big mob fights, thus convert hp into mana, and then transfer mana or do more damage as necessary. Also, it's more necromancer-like, to see all necros turning liches when doing tough fights vs boss mobs.<P>(d) It makes the necro a poor man's wizard. A 60 Sorcerer with Lure of Ice can do approximately 9k damage to Trakanon, a poison dragon. Six level 54-58 necros will do zero damage to Trakanon since their level 54 spell is poison based. However, six 59-60 necros will be able to do 6k damage to Trakanon in 1 minute. If Trakanon lives past that, then another 6k damage in the 2nd minute. Then another 6k in the 3rd minute before being out of mana (even with liching). In comparison, six level 60 Sorcerers can do 9 x 6 = 54,000 damage in one minute, whereas six level 60 Warlocks can do 6 x 1 x 3 = 18,000 damage in *three* minutes. Doesn't sound too overpowering to me.<P>(e) If a mob is resistant to both poison and disease but is vulnerable to fire and cold, necros will be able to do zero damage. But this is acceptable, given the rare instances of the case. Also, it's fairly understandable that if the mob is particularly resistant to poison/disease spells (necro domain), necros wouldn't be able to hurt it while wizards can.<P>This in one swipe solves all necro complaints. Now, necros can do moderate damage to uber resist-everything mobs by inflicting a slow death through dots rather than using unresistable lifetaps. This damage is no where near what a wizard can do. Also, the necro design is kept intact through the heal effect property of the two dots suggested. Also, this two spells only give necros more to do in uber mob fights, not more power in every day groupings.<P>With this in place, you will see level 59-60 necros turning liches, rush to Trakanon, dot it to death, med for 1 minute (lich is sustained by the life force of Trakanon through the suggested disease spell), rise up after the minute is over, dot again. This makes necros good for long fights, and does exactly what every necro has been dreaming of since day one.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>Sern<BR>59 Defiler<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brief thoughts regarding Ignite Bones:<P>My first big question, which (in a quick glance over the thread) I have not seen an answer to, is *what is the intended result of the skeleton effect?*<P>Of course, the actual result is a big swat to raid-level necros, for reasons that would be inanely redundant to repeat.  If the effect was *intended* to be a penalizing factor in the spell's usage, then any 'fixes' for it would have to take that into consideration.<P>My guess, however, was that this effect was just intended to be something groovy to impress newbies with.  That's cool.  I'm all for impressing newbies.  Possibly it also has the intended effect of letting the caster and everyone else who cares know that the spell stuck.  So now we need to figure out how to make the spell alter the appearance of a raid-level mob somehow without making the tanks have to perform clowncar contortions in order to keep doing their job.<P>The simplest and cheapest solution that pops into my mind (simple + cheap = everyone is happy) is to leave the spell as is for everything, say, under 55.  However, instead of changing models for raid-level mobs, just add a simple persistant particle effect.  Instead of the particles fading shortly after casting like with most spells, have the effect stick around.  Heck, there's even a persistant particle effect already built into the game.  The little bubbles that float around enchanters who (for whatever bizarre reason) cast Sentinal.  That effect would work great.  Tint it red for ignite bones, blue for chill bones, scale it to the mob, and stick it on him till the spell drops.<P>The only problem this might cause is playing hell with framerate, but everyone who has framerate problems due to particle effects should already have their particle effects and level of detail turned off for raids anyhow.<P>Just my 2cp.<P>Lev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for looking into these issues Alan, I'm really happy someone is at least paying attention.<P>I wish you had not skipped over improving mana transfer ratios so quickly.  I think this would be a simple and effective fix to the problem.  Make the Subversion spells mana over time transfers, like the Pact series.  And transfer for 1 or zero mana cost.<P>I don't understand why it's such a big problem to improve the ratio on these spells.  In your example you tried to show that a necromancer can improve the rate of healing during combat if mana is given to a cleric.  This simply isn't feasible right now.  At level 57 I have enough mana to allow the cleric maybe one or two extra heals.  Instead of bringing a necro along for the raid for those two added heals, most groups would probably just add a second cleric.  If the mana was given to a wizard, it would still be much better to bring a second wizard with a full mana pool in place of a necro...  you see what I'm saying.<P>Improving the mana transfer would make necromancers a useful class to have along on a dragon raid.  As it stands currently, there is no reason just to replace them with some other class that can do more damage or heal much more effectively.<P>Improve the transfer spells please.  Mana over time.  150 mana given over 20 to 30 seconds, at a cost of one mana to the necromancer.  The Sedulous Subversion spell should be an upgrade to this, giving 200 mana over the same time, and be stackable with Covetous.   <P>There's probably some troubles with having transfers work like this, ie the spells would have to be castable only on others (no free mana for necros!)  If this simply cannot be implemented for whatever reason, I hope that you can arrive at a solution which addresses this problem in full.  We want to see necromancers be a wanted and useful class to bring along on fights with mobs that resist our lifetaps.<P>Thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's my 2cp on the subject.<P>Absor, your premise is proposterous(sp?). There is absolutely no way that you can improve a class on such a narrow scope as you are seeking to do.<P>No matter what the change you implement is, it will always have a use outside of the Narrow raid scope you suggest. That use would thereby increase strength in all situations. It's foolish to think otherwise.<P>The only option that is remotely close to this unatainable goal you have set forth would be to make the Lifetap line of spells able to land on uber mobs. Almost nothing will resist a lifetap, other than these creatures. By changing the resist rate of these spells against these uber mobs, you basically only increase power in those circumstances. <P>Of course, there are always exceptions and you will be slighty increasing power in those situations. But, like I said, your proposition has no answer. It is absolutely impossible (unless there is super secret specialized code that is only exectuted for these uber creatures)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, the one true answer is the one they won't allow. Make the Lifetaps unresistable. That is what we were supposed to be.  That is why we have such lousy Manna/Dmg ratios.  We trade the fact that the spell WILL land for low damage, and some healing.  This is indeed a powerful effect, and it was meant to be. We pay dearly for it.  With Bad faction.  With low utility.  With Essence Emeralds- at the most high of levels.  This ability was IMHO rightly curtailed for the lower levels, so that we would need to group, and could not effectively powerlevel ourselves up insanely fast killing things that should be beyond us to kill. However, at 50+ this is no longer the case.  Wizards were justified in their complaints before the Lure series, and our Lifetaps are the same issue now.  Perhaps we could see not an unresistable lifetap, but one that was 99% on anything within 15 levels?  This simply doubles what is already in game.  Other than a few cases-IMHO badly tuned cases- I can hit anything within 7 now.  The endgame changes that by having creatures that I will never advance to be in range to.  <P>Also, Either change Sacrifice to allow us to sacrifice our enemies, allow resurections to our friends, or else change the spells that require the sacrifice to be Truly awe-inspiring, epic, overpowered spells worthy of true sacrifice.  The only thing in this game of true value is the player's time and effort.  We are the only class that requires that coin for the casting of even a few spells.  The spells that require that cost should not be subjected to the Eq merchants idea of value.  They should have incredibly profound effects that are worth 4 to 10 hours of actual playtime to achieve.  Perhaps the creation of permanant Items--Camping without the need to camp.  Perhaps a FULL xp res-- It requires a full death to cast it, and I don't think clerics even need a reagent to cast theirs, much less xp loss on someones part, but I can be wrong there as I don't play a cleric. Perhaps a full mana re-charge--That is what a death without res provides anyways.  Perhaps a complete heal that takes 1 second to cast-- Again, death without res provides this, and I have been killed in far less than one second on more than one occasion. Perhaps a Lifetap that may begin to Rival Wizards damage spells--no one dies when they cast theirs except the Mob, seems a fair trade.  I think you see my point.  If someone has to die to cast the spell, then it should be worth the cost. <P>Necridious Darkheart&lt;Companions of Trust&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About this Ignite/Chill bones thing...You said taking away the effect would be bad cause thats what makes the spells unique (not quoting just sumarizing IMO)...so, we need something to make the spells cool, that doesnt make it like a normal DD.  You also mentioned its technically impossible (or might be to make the skeles the correct size in proportion to the mobs) well...<P>When you cast Ignite Bones, there is this large blast of flames that lights up and stays around for a few seconds around the area where the mob was hit.  Well...what if you removed the skeleton form, and made it so the mob that got hit, flamed for a longer period of time ?  is it possible to have a *flame* of this type follow the motion of the mob if it moves?  maybe you could model this flame after a similar graphic to a certain spell being cast.  I can't think of one that looks cool, but i know that the spell casting graphic can follow a PC if he moves while casting it.  creating trails.  well, what if we did this to the mob that IB was cast on? kept him on fire for the duration of the illusion.  I think it would be cool, unique, but the mob would still apear the same so the tanks wont get confused and the other casters can still target easily and such.<P>Lvl 51 Necro - Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello<P>Ok this message wont be read again but here are my suggestions to make necro a class playable (btw i m not telling ALL of them should be accepted in order to make class playable but i m just giving all the solution i have seen) :<P>- Group FD : a bit useless : Imagine you have a necro casting Group Fd while wizard is casting evac and ALL THE GROUP MEMBER FALL ON THE GROUND : evac is interupted and all die.<P>Just give us a better FD ( fall less on ground for exemple ) after level 50 and it should be ok.<P>- Essence emerald : as i saw on another post can you check if they are REALLY used ? I personnaly have ONE and i never used it i m just exepting it to be a security for raid but i will probably never use it. Have you already asked yourself that : why would someone sacrifice himself ( i will not even sacrifice for 1k personnaly ) in order we can have <BR>a) 1000 mana : honestly it wont change the end of a raid or it can even be a waste if you are killed by ubber mob just after using the spell WHICH IS A LONG TIME refresh and disable by this way one of our 8 slot of spell !!<BR>b) 1000 DD lifetap when we have a 700 DD lifetap free and at level 59 (btw this is one of my only reason to level my nec)<BR>c ) A level 49 cleric rez whereas at level 50 + peeps often refuse level 49 cleric rez because they want level 56 one <P>Here is my idea to make essence emerald usefull : if you really like that keep essence emerald cost on infusion and trucidation anyway we will just put thoses spell near true north in our book and that s all. <BR>But i tough i was playing EverQUEST : why not puting that quest in game : you need to sacrifice 8 DIFFERENT player level 46 + in order to collect their soul then you go to your guildmaster (or maybe someone else) and for each 4 essence emerald he give you a greater essence emerald then for the 2 greater essence emerald he give you a Reviviscence spell necro usable : this way necro will be usefull on raid and will still be less powerfull than cleric due to cleric FA. I dont know what you think but the job of the cleric in RPG is to heal if they fail to their job it s necro job to repair the damage and ony necro should have rez IMO.<P>- Bond of death line spell should be longer in order it s usefull : i usualy have the time to gain the same mana i spent to cast it and it s already gone.<P>- PLEASE put off the night or day only spell or just put them usable everytime : do you really think as somebody already told you will check the time it is when you have 10 frog on you and need to cast quivering veil of mar : the spell already use one slot we cant mem it if we know we have one chance out of 2 it just tell us : this spell cant be casteed ATM. And it s the same for skin of shadow please put of the need to cast it during night it s just unfair as all the other class get better invi while they level and they can cast it everytime on everybody ( our is self only )<P>- DMF : one of the only use of the necro during the raid is DMF : butas it s the only use there is never lot of nec at raids : why cant you make a group DMF or better :  a 1500 mana AREA EFFECT DMF which DMF all in the area (maybe more mana as far as you can cast it naked ).<P><BR>A level 55 Defiler of Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here it goes. I know this doesn't really have to do with necromancers directly, but I've noticed the word "balance" in this thread a lot, and I figured out the perfect solution to making the classes balanced.<P>1. Make every single item in the entire game ALL/ALL<P>2. Make it so that every class gets every single spell that is possible in the game<P>3. Make every class have every skill there is.<P>4. Make each classes' epic weapon DMG 50/DLY 5 Effect: Death Touch.<P>5. Make every person in the entire game look exactly the same; shaved heads, bar codes on their hands, wearing matching uniforms, oh wait, I'm going off into Communism.<P>So, pretty much, Communism is the only solution to balancing the classes.

</FONT><HR>I must admit that I haven't read teh previous 176 replies before writing this one, so I don't know if this has been brought up. If it has I simply agree with whoever suggested it first:<P>If Necromancers are going to be able to possess their pets, magicians should too (although I don't think enchanters should, since their pets are uncontrollable). This spell should only work if you have visual contact with your pet and it is within range - rather like the Bind Sight spell. This wouldn't be horribly overpowering, but very fun.

</FONT><HR>=== Summary #1 ===<P>I have read through the entire thread and have compiled a summary that you might find useful.  I will try and add to it if something new is brought up.  Please note, the vast majority of the ideas below are NOT mine but rather those of the community at large.  I am merely the editor and compiler with one exception.<P>Changes fall within several categories<P>Lifetap<BR>1. If a tap is cast on a mob that is less than six levels above the player, then the tap will check resistance as normal, but always return the full amount of health of the spell to the necromancer even if resisted.<P>2. Really a corollary to the above in that it allows partial damage while still returning full health of the spell to the necromancer.<P>Fear<BR>3. Provide a fear protection line that allows the necromancer to make the target immune from fear for a time.<P>4. Group fear protection--similar to above, perhaps an upgrade if a line is considered.<P>5. AoE fear removal spell which would encourage the necromancer to meditate near the fray and cast this spell somewhat regularly to keep all players and pets on target.  This spell would need both fast cast and recast times to be effective.<P>6. MOB fear elimination spell which, when cast on a critter would prevent it from casting AoE fear for the duration.<P>Pets<BR>7. Make undead pets immune to AoE fear<P>8. Additional control commands<BR>   a) /no attack--pet will not defend itself<BR>   b) /sever--kills pet regardless of distance<BR>   c) /one target--prevents pet from changing       targets unless countermanded<P>9. Raid-Pets: Max pet per summon, but have very slow movement rates, are immune to fear, and suicide after MOB is killed<P><BR>General Grouping<BR>10 Ignite Bones--Remove skeleton illusion in favor of a fiery particle effect<P>11. Provide a 42 second "splut-like" debuff overtime.<P>12. Group DMF<P>13. Group Feign Death.  I think the general consensus from both necros and non was that this would be interesting to try out on test to see how it worked.  Some thought it would get more folks killed than it saved.  Given the supposed ease to code, it might be worth a test.  My personal note is that the spell would probably need to be all-or-nothing based on the necromancer's save.<P>14. Mana-Link--a link similary to shifting site, but cancelable, that allows 80% of the necromancer's mana to immediately channel to the target along with 80% of all mana gained during the duration of the spell.  This spell should probably have a relatively long duration, 2-3 mins, but also a very long recast time like 30 mins.  Part of the compensation for this restriction should be a better ratio, perhaps 2-1.<P>15. Lower level requirement for Conjure Corpse from 57 to 55.  Reasoning behind this from the poster is three-fold:<BR>a) Summoning corpses is unarguably one of the few things necros do on raids.<P>b) Summon Corpse was gained 19 levels before, which is a very long time to wait for an upgrade<P>c) Shadow Knights are supposedly getting Summon Corpse at lvl 50 and are far better equiped to carry the heavy coffins than are necromancers.  Generally speaking, hybrids do not get a parent class spell until the parent class gets any available upgrades.  At lvl 55, necromancers are still 5 lvls above the point where their child class gets the upgrade.<P>=== End Summary ===<P>Now, for my personal biases...here is what I'd like to see from the above:<P>Lifetap:<BR>1&2 combined<P>Fear:<BR>3&4<P>Pets:<BR>7&8 (8 btw..would, imho, be nice for mages as well)<P>General Grouping:<BR>10, 12, 13, 14, & 15 with 12 certainly requiring some solid testing to see how that works in practice.<P>Again..I have tried to live within the constraints you have provided.  I do not believe any of the above increases the necromancer's agressive powers against MoBs nor do they and any solo power to the class.<P>I look forward to your thoughts.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So when the wiz casts his 1000 dmg DD and the monster goes back and taunt doesn't work you can use this.

</FONT><HR>Ok, first thing I wanna say is that every time I hit my backspace key when a banner is being refreshed, it resets my message and I have to start all over again... that's really makin me mad.<P>Anyway, I have an idea for Ignite Bones.  Just make the skeleton white and about the size of a greater dry bone.  I mean, think about it.  The problem with the spell is that it is hard to keep track of a human sized dark brownish red skeleton in most dungeons because most dungeons are dark.  It also tends to blend in better with the players because it's smaller than most of the tanks and on the same side of the tint scale as their armor (meaning most of their armor is dark too).  Having it about ogre sized and white would stand out in 90% of the situations it previously blended in with.  It's also important to keep the same hit radius as the previous mob.  For instance, Wurms can be hit with normal melee weapons from a good 80-100 range.  They should keep this range when they're turned into skeletons so the tanks don't all have to suddenly run in to be able to hit it.  I believe this is a positive change that would greatly enhance Necromancers in a raid situation by giving them a more active role in the damage dealing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If understand the question correctly, you're looking for ideas that would give necros something useful to do specifically against ubermobs, but that won't affect their effectiveness on the rest of Norrath's mobs.  Sheesh.  Seems to me that unless there's some kind of "this is an ubermob" flag in the game engine, it's not possible, no?<P>Otherwise, you're left with controlling the effect by using the level of the mob recieving it, with the effect barred from happening on LOWER level mobs...  illogical and unpractical, since there's high-level critters that aren't "boss" mobs (ex: quest NPCs, Guardian Wurms in Skyfire).<P>How about giving the pet the SAME resistances as the caster?  That would at least make them more useful against the major critters.<P>--------------<P>Overall it seems to me the necros have two vastly different problems:<BR> <BR>1) Having their role reduced to that of inefficient mana batteries on the fight that's the GOAL of a raid.   To date, the answers by Verant pretty much seem to be: "Tough.  We changed your job without asking you for your opinion, deal with it (you're in our world now).  If we gave you something useful to do against ubermobs, you'd become too powerful against everyone else.".  Well, I'm still holding a smidgen of hope there, things may change.  Hell, Verant added the mana transfer ability, yes?  Good thing too because otherwise there really wouldn't have been any use for necros on the biggest encounter of the raid.<P>2) Having several major spells problem:<BR>Track corpse broken since the beta game;<BR>Root line of spells in the wrong order;<BR>Chill bones and Ignite bones make the job so much harder for the teammates that the spells are banned from use;<BR>Infusion and Trucidation are just plain too costly, and won't ever be used;<BR>Defoliate and Defoliation are limited by the absence of plant-type critters (treants and even the mushrooms in Old Sebilis aren't plants!);<BR>Levant and Skin of Shadows can only be cast at night (why? we're necros dealing with life and death, not timekepers).<BR>Lich (49) and Demilich (60) are basically the same spell (one gives 20 mana for 32 HPs, the other 20 mana for 31 HPs. Weee.)  Archlich (60) is the logical followup to Lich (31 mana for 48hps), but then why is there even a Demilich spell?;<BR>Corpal empathy: it's nice to be able to give 300 or your own HPS away instantly (at the cost 200 mana), but why does it have to remove your manaskin/diamondskin/steelskin buff?  The slower reverse lifetap spells don't.<P>So even if you cannot in the end give the necro anything more useful to do against ubermobs than playing battery, how about just FIXING our current spells?  That would go a long way for player satisfaction.<P>Suggestions? <BR>A better Screaming Terror (Howling Horror?): Less resistance and lasts 30 secs.<BR>Group invisibility to undead.<BR>Group Dead Man Floating.<BR>Group or targeted Call of bones (Doggies move aside, here comes da boneyard!).<BR>Enchanting weapons (or people) with a lifetap proc<BR>AE Fear or AE Screaming Terror<BR>Dread aura: enchanting people with a Screaming Terror proc<P>Aerik N'Krosis<BR>Officer, Scions of Veeshan<BR>Necromancer 55 on The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>***Suggestion in making Necromancers have a more "useful" ability in Epic/large raids***:<P>God-given spell:<P>1.) Unmemable spell (Like Wizard Harvest).<BR>2.) Poison-based, and/or Disease-based (Combination would be very nice where half can be resisted while other half is not)<BR>3.) Spell is a massive direct damage PLUS a massive and quick DOT spell.<BR>4.) Recast time: Only once a game day. (i.e. Like Paladin Lay Hands, Shadowknights Harm Touch)<BR>5.) Very, very low resistance to this spell (i.e. Like Shadowknights Harm Touch).<BR>6.) Misc: Do not make it an "all or nothing" spell. Yes it will be a big taunt spell, but make it worth the taunt: Stop (yes completely) the mob's health regeneration; massive damage on initial cast (above 1,000 damage on contact of spell); massive damage over time effect(also over 1,000 damage over time); very quick DOT (no longer than 30 seconds and the spell has done it's full damage).<P>This is in my opinion a solution to Necromancers' ability to participate in large raids, it gives them a very unique class-defining ability, and it is not (again in my opinion) unbalancing in the overall view of Necromancers related to other classes (i.e. it is not stepping on the toes of other classes, it is not giving them "more power", etc). Because this spell is once per game day, and is unmemable, it should be one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful spell, a Necromancer has in their spellbooks. They should obtain this spell at around level 53 or so (just my opinion, just trying to help).<P>I hope someone at Verant reads this, I think it would work, personally. No, I am not a Necromancer, I am a tank, but I do see the problem they have in large raids and wish them the very best.<P>-Revelation, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>    You forgot about group Dead Man Floating.  Or removing the recast time on Dead Man floating.  Group spells do not really increase power but instead they just save time.<P>    Also did you know Ignite Bones/Chill Bones do not stack with themselves.  IE if 2 necros cast Ignite only 1 of necros will take hold.<P>    Lastly I do not think necros want Unresistable Lifetaps.  Just less resisted on boss mobs.  And not even all of them just a couple of the top ones.<P>Please look into Group DMF though Everyone on raids says necros need this spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem with making life taps less resistable...<P>If you make the lifetap series less resistable then that means they can use them in other places (spite golems, etc) on mobs that are NOT supposed to be hit by spells of this nature<P>If your simply drop the MR on epic mobs, other spells stick easier.. that's not an option.<P>Honestly, necromancers best raid option IMHO would be a nice debuff that stuck.  There are already MR and Turgur debuffs, etc...<P>there has to be some debuff that works well in the necromancers line of spells that wouldnt be usefull except for in raid type situations.<P><BR>But, on another note....<P>I think if I was going to give necromancers a line of spells that made them ultimately usefull for raid type situations, it would be a line of spells that does this:<P>Fear Effect<BR>UNRESISTABLE<BR>Duration 1-6 seconds.<P>This would work on ANY mob, from trakanon to overseer of air.  We all know that 6 seconds of fear is a lifetime in an epic battle, and its NOTHING in a small battle (say kiting in front of karnor)<P>Just a thought  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I'm also a HUGE fan of group feign death  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think most people are aiming way too high with their requests.. here's hopefully a more reasonable one for necromancers, a new spell designed specifically for some of these types of encounters.<P>Remove Fear - Level 50 (55, 60, whatever)<BR>Cast Time - 1.0 Seconds<BR>Recast Time - 10 Seconds<BR>Mana - 100<BR>Effect - either removes a Fear spell/effect from the target immediately, or actually makes them immune to Fear spells for a short duration (30 seconds to a minute).<P>This would give the necromancer a combination of things.. if she wanted, it could be used to basically get the "unfearable" pet that people clamour for in these cases, just cast on the pet each time there's an AE Fear wave.  It also can obviously save tanks or casters who are running away, getting them back into the fight a lot faster.  And finally, it's not a spell that would greatly increase a necromancer's skill in everyday fights.

</FONT><HR>Absor you mention in one of your first posts that necros main rolls is transfering mana or something like that.  Give us a theft of thought spell with a low recast time (any more then 30 seconds wouldn't be super helpful).<P>+ Necros can now drain big mobs of their mana and feed to other classes like Wizards and Clerics.

</FONT><HR>=== SUMMARY #2 ===<P>ABSOR,<P>I have read through the entire thread and have compiled a summary that you might find useful.  I will try and add to it if something new is brought up.  Please note, the vast majority of the ideas below are NOT mine but rather those of the community at large.  I am merely the editor and compiler with one exception.<P>Changes fall within several categories<P>Lifetap<BR>1. If a tap is cast on a mob that is less than six levels above the player, then the tap will check resistance as normal, but always return the full amount of health of the spell to the necromancer even if resisted.<P>2. Really a corollary to the above in that it allows partial damage while still returning full health of the spell to the necromancer.<P>Fear<BR>3. Provide a fear protection line that allows the necromancer to make the target immune from fear for a time.<P>4. Group fear protection--similar to above, perhaps an upgrade if a line is considered.<P>5. AoE fear removal spell which would encourage the necromancer to meditate near the fray and cast this spell somewhat regularly to keep all players and pets on target.  This spell would need both fast cast and recast times to be effective.<P>6. MOB fear elimination spell which, when cast on a critter would prevent it from casting AoE fear for the duration.<P>Pets<BR>7. Make undead pets immune to AoE fear<P>8. Additional control commands<BR>   a) /no attack--pet will not defend itself<BR>   b) /sever--kills pet regardless of distance<BR>   c) /one target--prevents pet from changing       targets unless countermanded<P>9. Raid-Pets: Max pet per summon, but have very slow movement rates, are immune to fear, and suicide after MOB is killed<P><BR>General Grouping<BR>10 Ignite Bones--Remove skeleton illusion in favor of a fiery particle effect<P>11. Provide a 42 second "splut-like" debuff overtime.<P>12. Group DMF<P>13. Group Feign Death.  I think the general consensus from both necros and non was that this would be interesting to try out on test to see how it worked.  Some thought it would get more folks killed than it saved.  Given the supposed ease to code, it might be worth a test.  My personal note is that the spell would probably need to be all-or-nothing based on the necromancer's save.<P>14. Mana-Link--a link similary to shifting site, but cancelable, that allows 80% of the necromancer's mana to immediately channel to the target along with 80% of all mana gained during the duration of the spell.  This spell should probably have a relatively long duration, 2-3 mins, but also a very long recast time like 30 mins.  Part of the compensation for this restriction should be a better ratio, perhaps 2-1.<P>15. Lower level requirement for Conjure Corpse from 57 to 55.  Reasoning behind this from the poster is three-fold:<BR>a) Summoning corpses is unarguably one of the few things necros do on raids.<P>b) Summon Corpse was gained 19 levels before, which is a very long time to wait for an upgrade<P>c) Shadow Knights are supposedly getting Summon Corpse at lvl 50 and are far better equiped to carry the heavy coffins than are necromancers.  Generally speaking, hybrids do not get a parent class spell until the parent class gets any available upgrades.  At lvl 55, necromancers are still 5 lvls above the point where their child class gets the upgrade.<P>=== End Summary ===<P>Now, for my personal biases...here is what I'd like to see from the above:<P>Lifetap:<BR>1&2 combined<P>Fear:<BR>3&4<P>Pets:<BR>7&8 (8 btw..would, imho, be nice for mages as well)<P>General Grouping:<BR>10, 12, 13, 14, & 15 with 12 certainly requiring some solid testing to see how that works in practice.<P>Again..I have tried to live within the constraints you have provided.  I do not believe any of the above increases the necromancer's agressive powers against MoBs nor do they and any solo power to the class.<P>I look forward to your thoughts.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very nice suggestion Uberwolf. Although, instead of it being a straight fear I was thinking it should work more like the stun from the effect of a tranquil staff. Unresistable, short variable duration, interupts casting and doesn't make the mob run. Give it a sizable recast time, say 20 minutes so a single necro can't chain stun trakanon.<P>This would be minimally useful outside of uber mob situations and very useful in the right place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>Thank you for your time and thoughts.   I found your comments refreshing and at least open and not full of sarcasm or bluntness.  Thoughts to help necromancers.<P>1.  The ignite/chill bones series is the skeleton illusion just eye candy?  If its just graphics then remove the graphic, I dont care about eye candy, besides some uber mobs will still resist it, but it gives the necro something to cast on those that it might stick too!<P>2.  The DOT bug.  I do believe this would help some but Verant is gonna have to do something to gain the players trust on this one.  Nothing personal Absor but we have heard before that this bug has been fixed.  I think Verant should implement a good faith CS effort for a short duration say 3-4 weeks that would somehow reimburse players for corpses poofing.  If Verant doesnt do something like this it will be a LONG time before DOTS are allowed.  They have been banned for over a year by guilds and raid leaders.<P>3.  Classification of the mob.  I dont know why, but none of these uber mobs (at least not the ones I have fought) are undead, not even Trak, VS or Dracoliche.  The necro already has a DD for undead and now for plants.  However, what uber mobs can they be used on?  Shouldnt there be plants in the POG?  Dracoliche an Undead mob?  By changing the status of a few uber mobs you might change the desirablity of certain classes for that raid.  Undead mobs - necros, pallidins gain!<P>4.  Conjur corpse should be moved down a couple of levels bringing it in line with clerics rezz, particularly if SKs are to be granted this spell at lvl 50 (or make it higher lvl for SKs). Besides SKs (Trolls and Ogres) have the str to carry those 10stone coffins, necros generally dont!<P>5.  Lifetap - I understand your arguement.  But my opinion still stands too this IS the class defining spell of the necro.  Consequently, it should be the most powerful one in their arsenal against uber mobs.<P>These five fixes add no new spells, no new abilities or power but could help necros in raids.<P>MY thoughts on some of the other suggestions.  Many new spell ideas have been thrown out, but there all utility/buff spells mostly.  I dont think giving necros more utility spells will solve the raid problem.  I think they are good ideas for future material.<P>I do think that after 50 some of the necro spells should start losing there self-only status.  We spent 44 levels before we got a really desired buff, I dont think it outlandish for the necro to have gained some buffing skill after 50 levels of self buffing.<P>Alan Mage fire pets are immune to fire, so why shouldnt necro pets be immune to regular Fear.  Yes they should be suspectible to Undead fear but normal fear there undead, mindless animations what are they afraid of?  Fear is an emotion undead have no emotions?<P>Group Feign Death - nice but doesnt solve the uber problem.  Future spell material.  I also like the idea of a targetable feign death like spell which could save that tank or cleric right before death.  Perhaps its a buff similiar to death pact, that if the individual hits uncociousness or is down to x hps the FD kicks in and activates!  Now that is a buff and a lifesaver!  Might need to limit how often this could be cast though, dont want the whole raid party FD, but maybe  a few clerics!<P>Death Pact was given to clerics, but really seems more like a necro spell?<P>Group DMF would be nice, but not my highest priorty.<P>Group Fear spell yes for future material.  Another good grp quick save spell.<P>The essence emerald spells.  Keep it the way it is for rezz, but change the other two completely.  I think something close to sacrafice should be created, maybe Mericless Toruture or Parasite Life whereupon the individual doesnt die, but suffers rezz effects.  Drop Trucidation no one wants it.  For infusion if you must use an EE, maybe if it transfered your whole mana bar instead maybe it would be used.  However, I think infusion should use a new reagent from the other new spell that wasnt a complete sacrafice.  It would take a gem and force the necro to spend time creating the reagent before the raid.<P>Night time only spells.  Change this for the Veil spell.  There are TOO many conditions on this spell that make it SO situational, that it becomes pointless to memorize.  Nite only, 10 minute recast, cant be in lich form, no regens on, etc. etc.  Instead, I think the time only spells should only grant the additional benefits IF it is night time, but gives the normal lower level effects if its during the day.  This makes Veil a "sometimes" upgrade to harmshield!<P>Upgrade the poison DD for something in the 50+ range or replace defiolation with this!<P>Why no upgrades to our Shadow Vortex, Siphon Strength, or Screaming Terror spells?  Why are Scent spells so resisted?<P>Lastly, shouldnt necros also get an upgraded FD spell who else should be able to fake death better than the master of it?<P>Thank you for your time and help Absor!<P>Sarasate</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If it is not, it is not working as Intended  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.  How about if the Mob is greater than 6 levels, but less than or equal to 10, resist chance is low, with health returned. If it is more than 10, normal resist?

People would get res'd in and slaughtered, even an immediate invis post-res wasn't quick enough to prevent aggro. But if I'd have had group FD it would have saved a LOT of deaths whilst we all got back and waited for res effects to go.<P>Don't dismiss a spell just because nothing obvious comes to mind.

Of course these are all secondary to seeing mana transfer improved!<P>We have a couple spells that save vs cold, but they are really weak.  I don't see why it would be out of line to give necromancers a few high powered spells that save vs cold.  We've had Endure and Resist Cold buffs since the very beginning, a damage shield at low and high levels that inflicts cold damage...  Why no powerful cold based spells?  <P>Chilling Embrace was a nice addition, I'd like to see it be a lifetap over time dot though, that saved vs cold.  <P>I'd like to see Chill Bones be a lifetap spell that saved vs cold.  <P>I'd like to see the Scent line of spells save vs cold as well, and have their taunt factor reduced.  As it stands currently, if I cast Scent spells during a dragon raid (useful debuff series, always want to lead off with them) the dragon resists the spells, and kills me immediately.<P>I also see lots of people asking to make the pet immune to fear somehow.  I don't think this will ever work.  Adding a command /pet fearless, giving the pet the new Velious resist fear discipline would not be completely out of line.  It would only last a short time, making it impossible to kill or severely damage dragons with pets alone.  However, the same would probably have to apply to mage, shaman, and now druid pets.  I think that would get unbalancing.  Making pets immune to fear is probably not the best idea of the bunch...  <P>I'd like to see mana transfers improved, and secondly, some useful spells that save vs cold.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=045291&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=045291&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
