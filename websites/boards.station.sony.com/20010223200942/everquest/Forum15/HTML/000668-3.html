</FONT><HR>I really like a number of the changes going in.  I do have a question or two though.<P>Shouldn’t we get a 72min type spell like LH or HT ? maybe a dot, a once a day gate spell, or a invisible spell that will make the attacking mob "forget" about us for a period of time giving us a chance to escape or disappear in the woods if you like that better??  <P>If we are going to do as much damage as the Warrior, or just a small percentage more, wouldn’t a group be better off using the Warrior and getting the defensive advantages of that class as well. If we are going to be classified as a damage-dealing class, then the baseline for our melee abilities must be either the Rogue or the Monk, not the Warrior.  This will give us something to be desired in high level groups.<P>The Ranger Epic Blades don't have any +Wisdom on EITHER of the blades??  <P>I like all the proposed fixes, but I still see the problem of what makes us unique and valuable enough to make a group want us?<P>I guess that what I am looking for is real balance!  I wish for my ranger to be just as desired as a warrior or a druid in a group.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read a bit of this post and then saw some lower level rangers whining about most of the changes that are coming in are affecting only high level rangers.  Well, this irritates me.  The fact of the matter is that Rangers were well balanced and fairly powerful up till level 50.  It's after that point that balance becomes a serious issue.  The gap quickly widened, and we fell behind in nearly all areas.  Some of the spells that are going in will help you low to mid level rangers immensely.  I mean, I hear that sow may be lowered to lvl 30.  I would have given anything for nearly 10 additional levels of sow.  Also... many of your spells are being moved around and also, you're getting new ones that we never had the chance to use.  Also, tracking and archery may be fixed... Hell, I've gone through nearly 50 levels without this.  Don't point the finger at us complaining... because when you get here, you'll be thanking us for making for future easier.  We've been there and done that... when you get to the PoF and TV armor actually DROPS, you'll be kissing our feet.<P>Jareck Thundershot<BR>48th Season Ranger<BR>Drinal<BR>The Mithril Warhammers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>one thing that i would like to add, dont think anyone has mentioned anything about this, is to the trueshot discipline. I would like to know why on earth the trueshot discipline is basically useless while soloin, if mob is snared or rooted and your soloin the discipline does not really work at all, if mob is snared or rooted and is under attk by others it works great, now to me this makes absolutly no sense what so ever. shouldnt a immobile mob with a open view no one in the way be taking absolute maximum damage from the trueshot discipline, come on it only makes perfect use of common sense. also the discipline should last a bit longer and produce a few more criticle hits. Im a 55 ranger with a archery skill of 208 who likes to solo every now and again and find the current use of the discipline absolutly dissappointing, please take these suggestions into consideration. Another note on the side we are suppose to have same lvl of offense as a warrior, why dont we get crit hits from mellee? Palys do at 55 and up and they have the defense of warr, hehe makes absolutly no sense again, we should get crit hits in melee after 55.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think archery needs more than just a Z-axis  and skill cap fix.  Right now it's just a waste of time to use my Trueshot.  Giving the Rain Caller a proc would help this issue.<P>What about Bind?  Earlier/better heals?  Regen before Chloro? - These seem to fit the role of the Ranger and would fit into the current spell progressions.<P>Thorny Vine needs more than just more frequent drops, but better stats too.  I just bought a Hero bracer since it's about the same (depending on preferences) to the TV Bracer.  I think our Class-only Plane armor should be the best we can get or at least very very close to it.<P>Ivy Armor, most of it is not worth the time to get it - camps/mobs are too much of a pain.  I've just been getting Ry'gorr instead.  It's much easier to find.<P>Disarm - useless.  It has never worked once for me.  Increase the cap or just dump it.<P>The other changes listed look good.<P>Rudor (43rd Ranger on Prexus)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think stats on TV armor is good, just maybe a possible increase in ac.  The gaunts rule (9 str dex 7 fire but only 11 ac... just got last night) aside from ac, as do most of the other pieces.  The best part about the bracers are the saves IMO.  The stats are ok, just maybe a tad more ac to balance our low defense.<P>Jareck Thundershot<BR>Ranger of Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've only been playing for about 4 months now, and my only character is a 32lvl Ranger on Tarew Marr.(When you consider that I work from home and easily put in 10+ hours some days, this isn't too unreasonable. I do also have a high lvl friend who has "twinked" me some, mainly because he was the first to tell me that I was screwing myself by playing a Ranger, and he feels sorry for me)<P>I appreciate the complaints from both the 50+ and the low lvls, because quite frankly, no one wants me. I can easily say that 98% or more of my time has been spent soloing, because a Ranger has no abilities that most groups need.<P>I can heal - So can Clerics/Druids/Shamans.<P>I can buff - See above<P>I can pull - Anyone can pull<P>I can fight - But not as well as other melee classes<P>My Fletching skill is 133. I currently pay about 25pp to make 20 arrows, the average damage of which is 1, when I do hit.<P>My nice but not great weapons are a Silvery War Axe, and Sarnak Flesh Harvester. My average damage with these is about 8 or 9 points, with a lot of one's two's and three's thrown in, and the very rare double digit entry. The proc on the Flesh Harvester is very nice, it even happens once every lunar eclipse or so - but I assume all weapon procs are rare, not having any knowledge to the contrary. Most mobs I fight hit for an average of 30 to 50 points approx, so the disparity is HUGE.<P>I have DoTs. Well, let's just kick the whole can with spells. Why call a skill level Master when spells still fizzle alot, sometimes 5 or 6 times in a row. "Casting interupted" or what ever it says. BY WHAT?!?!? I'm standing in a city, with no one else even in view!!! (enough about that)<P>So, I can try to continue soloing, which gets very dangerous higher up, so I am told. I can't get a group anywhere, because I'm a ranger, and rangers don't have any benefits to offer a group.<P>Joining a guild might be an option...except that guilds like to have wars. And since I'm a ranger, I absolutely can not beat any other class of equal level in a duel, because I'm the single weakest class in the game. (Please note that this is not just rambling, but the compilation of many remarks from other players on my server explaining to my why my class sucks)<P>In my opinion, I've wasted a lot of time. Vernat can solve all this with one fix - change the class name to Useless or The Unwanted from Ranger. At least then anyone playing the class will know what to expect.(Sorry, little bit of anger got through there)<P>Also, and I can not even guess why this was never brought up in the discussions - Am I the only person with maxed skill for my lvl (165) who finds camo to be total junk. I can honestly say that on average, Camo lasts less than a minute for me every time. Terrain doesn't seem to matter - night/day, standing/sitting, moving/staying still, open fields/trees shrubs/rocky hills etc. On the VERY rare instances where Camo actually lasts more than a minute, I get worried that I'm actually disconnected from the server, now how bad is that?!?!? Camo just plain does not work.<P>One more thing, as a general complaint. Mobs have arms and legs, sometime weapons. I have arms and legs, and weapons. WHY DO HUMANOID SIZE MOBS FIGHTING BAREHANDED HAVE A LONGER RANGE THAN MY CHARACTER WITH A SWORD!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?<P>ie - They can thump me for 50+ points, but I keep being told "Target is out of Range....".<P>I'm sorry everyone. I was just going to put in my two cents about rangers, but I guess it all kinda poured out.<P>Back to the main issues - I have a character that I can no longer advance, or not without a whole lot of frustration anyhow. The game is supposed to be group based, so why don't rangers have a place in a group???<P>I'll be honest with you all - I don't think Verant can fix rangers. To actually make them relatively equal at lvl50+ is a small band-aid. How do you get to lvl 50 when your class is publicly shunned and disparaged repeatedly online as pathetic and useless. If Verant were to actually properly fix the class, everyone else would start howling that rangers are now too powerful - because they're used to them being useless.<P>I respect everyone elses opinion on this board, and I hope that something can be done to salvage this class. I especailly appreciate the people @ VI reading and actually taking action with peoples complaints, ideas etc.<P>But the proposed fixes in this thread are just more band-aids.<P>For now, I'll be starting another character, one that is allowed and wanted in a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmmmm...<P>Although I shared your concern at one time on our class, I think that you may have rangers confused with warriors in any given situation.  Do not compare yourself with a warrior, as we are more along the lines of a rouge or monk, aka damage on a stick.  Get behind the mob and whack away till it turns on ya then turn attack off for long enough for the warrior to taunt it off.  Then whack away again.  Learn to manage agro.  Heal your casters, top off your melees, DON'T try to stand toe to toe with a mob... if you're soloing, kite a bit, then finish off with melee.<P>Procs- I don't know what you're talking about, improve your dex and see what happens... I have a fluxbladed axe and it procs up to 3 times per fight with around 130 dex.  <P>Your damage will increase significantly, I hit for about a max of 35 with a 7 dmg weapon, so the dmg is there.<P>Finally and most importantly, don't listen to other people.  Play your ranger to the best of your abilities and people will want you back for their group.  Clerics will love you because instead of being a mana sponge, you're saving them mana by healing the casters, monks, topping off warriors, etc.  Shammys will love your Ranger clarity so to speak.<P>Jareck Thundershot<BR>Ranger of Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*yawn*<P>I'm sorry, but these changes aren't just exciting.<BR>My two main characters are a bard and a ranger. Well... my ranger has been stripped of all items and on indefinite retirement ever since Abashi's insulting comments towards Elderan.<BR>Anyway, I find the bard changes much more promising than the ranger changes.<BR>The ONLY changes listed here that even remotely interests me are the tracking changes, which have been talked about since before RoK.<BR>Minor skill increases at 50+? Please. Maybe this would be worth twinking and powerleveling a ranger up to high levels for, but it by no means makes playing a ranger "compelling."<BR>Want to make a ranger compelling?

</FONT><HR>The list is not bad although I'm not really convinced that a lot of it is necessary.  Personally with my ranger I feel that spell choices and defense are the only real concern for making me useful.  The other things are nice and all and anything would be appreciated but to be truthful with my concerns the other two are my only real concern.  <P>We get mainly the lower AC chain class armors limiting our defense from the getgo anyway.  I'm not sure what a small boost in it would hurt (such as boosting it to the same level as the Knights offense sounds like it is going in the right direction)<P>I also find it a bit disconcerting that Paladins and Shadowknights get very useful parent class spells at 57.  Rangers don't seem to get that benefit.  (Playing a druid I don't see a lot of use out of SLN except for maybe pickup.  To the majority of other buffs available it's kinda sad)<P>Just my opinion though.  Thanks for at least making an effort.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess it depends on the ranger population on your server daBatu.. It took me 10 trips to get my first piece of TV.<P>Tomorrow will be my 22nd trip to Fear, still missing half a set, but have Tolan's in all the spots I am missing.<P>Looked up the Thurgadin quest armor last night.. I'm wondering why anyone would even bother doing the prolonged quests for that crap, Tolan's has better AC and effects. Unless/until they make stats actually count for something, Make Mine Tolan's!<P>ps- Don't see why they don't make the bonuses stats give you increase with levels, since that would in no way help twinkies (the main reason they nerfed stats).<P>ps-s- I sure am glad my Fletching is at 200, dunno how I would have ever made it to lvl 53 without maxxed fletching (hah!) When are some bow-making quests going to make their way in to the game? Right now in Velious you have a lot of ranger only (tigerraptor hide) gear that can be made with trade skills, but they are the ones least likely to have been chosen by rangers to advance (well, pottery and baking aren't part of them, thank god). Kinda like making Wiz trade gear require fletching.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This post stems off of Maxxius topic on defense. I agree with him 100%, and he finally gets to the root of the problem. All melee classes should have the basically the same base defense skill. It is the Armor and secondary defense skills that should set the classes apart for AC and tanking ability.<P>There are 7 different melee class: Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Paladin, Shadow Knight, Bard, and Ranger. Here is a quick run down on there Armor type and defense skill cap for each class.<P>Armor Type & Defense Skill:<BR>Warrior- Plate Armor, Defense(252)<BR>Monk- Cloth Armor, Defense(252), AC bonus each lvl<BR>Rogue- Chain Armor, Defense(252)<BR>Paladin- Plate Armor, Defense(200)<BR>Shadow Knight- Plate Armor, Defense(200)<BR>Bard- Plate Armor, Defense(215)<BR>Ranger- Chain Armor, Defense(200)<P>Now if you look at the armor type and defense skill for each class it is pretty easy to see that Rangers come in DEAD LAST. Now you combine that with our low hit points, you have basically the fasted dieing melee class out there. Only Bards and Rogues can compete with us for this wonderful title. Further more all the Hybird classes need an increase in there deffensive skill cap. I think a cap of 230 for all hybird classes would be a fair compromise.<P>Now Ask yourself this. How is this BALANCED?<BR>Answer: It is NOT balanced, and the only way one could justify is poor base defense is to give Rangers some of the highest secondary defensive skills. Here is a break down for those skills.<P>Dodge, Parry, & Riposte Skill Caps:<BR>Warrior- Dodge(175), Parry(230), Riposte(225)<BR>Monk- Dodge(230), Block(230), Riposte(225)<BR>Rogue- Dodge(210), Parry(230), Riposte(200)<BR>Paladin- Dodge(125), Parry(175), Riposte(175)<BR>Shadow Knight- Dodge(120), Parry(180), Riposte(200)<BR>Bard- Dodge(155), Parry(75), Riposte(75)<BR>Ranger- Dodge(137), Parry(185), Riposte(150)<P>Starting with the Dodge skill Ranger fall in 5th out of the 7 classes. The four classes ahead of Rangers: Warrior, Monk, Rogue, and Bard. Now I agree with the Monk and Rogue skill, I can accept the Warrior skill, but there is no reason a plate armor wearing bard should have a higher dodge skill. Rangers should at least have a dodge skill as high as Warriors, and I feel it should be higher. I say a cap at 200 for dodge would be about right. We are Rangers, we are known for our agility, we should be better at dodging.<P>Next the parry skill, which suprisingly enough is right where it should be. We are 4th out of 7, and our skill on the same level as the other hybird classes. What suprised me the most is how low the parry skill is for bards. Speaking of the behalf of all bards, I feel there skill in parry should be more around 140.<P>Finally, the Riposte skill, in which ranger fall 6th out of 7, beating only Bard's whopping skill of 75. Rangers riposte skill should have a cap closer to Paladins(175), but overall the cap where it is at is fairly good. Again the bard cap in this skill sucks, and should be up around 140.<P>Overall, all of these skills need a serious overhaul, and something needs to be done about it. If Verant plans on increasing Rangers offensive skills to be equal to warriors, then what do you think will happen to rangers. If you guessed rangers will die faster, then you would be correct. Our class has trouble staying alive as it is now because of our natural taunting ability, so giving us more damage output would just do more unbalancing then balancing if our defense skills aren't raised as well.<P>This system needs to be fixed and revamped, not only for the benefit of Rangers, but for all melee classes.<P>Talone Trailblaze<BR>Level 48 Ranger<BR>Divinus Veritas<BR>Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My biggest issue is the fact that the 3 bigger melee damage dealers all have something special to make them that way.  Rogues have backstab, Monks have thier cool kicks and such, and Warriors have triple attack.  I think Rangers should get something to help them do a little extra melee damage, my suggestion would be a slight level bonus for the offhand.<P>And could the casting time on the Tolan's bracer, along with the effects of the Tolan's pants be looked at?  Rogues get the same effect as our pants, have it cast faster, and it's on thier gloves, a much easier drop to get than the pants which are off and uber mob.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My opinions.<P>Ambidexterity, Self-ports to balance other hybrid abilities, See Invisible, Unique ability like HT or LoH, Defense raised to Paladin's Offense level: Good stuff.  This is all worthwhile.  <BR>Specifically, I'd like to see our answer to LoH and HT be a good long stun -- to model it after LoH and HT, make it a quarter of a second per level until 40 and half a second per level thereafter.  So at 60, it'd be a 20-second-long stun.  Compared with 1000 points of damage from HT, this could work (or something close to it could).  It would also be the only inherent stun we get besides the Call of Sky effect, if that one counts.<P>Raincaller stats, Thorny vs. Ivy, Exclusive Track abilities, Forage clutter, Glimpse, Hide & Sneak: This is good stuff too, but I don't know if it's as much of a problem as it's portrayed here. <P>Bind, Gate, Pets:  Now you're just being silly.  Guys, we're *melee*.  We don't get pets, or Bind, or Gate, and neither do the other melee, including hybrids.  <P>Assassinate:  Guys, it's a Rogue thing.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There are bows with proccing effects on them now.<P>Another idea is to set a minimum dmage equal to that of the bow. If its a 20/41 bow, then a hit will do a minimum of 20 damage. At least I feel my 3 platt I spent on the arrow was worth it.<P>Aiming. Why can't a master archer aim up or down a hill, thru a small crowd, around a small tree? Take the time to talk to a REAL specialist at archery and find out how good he can aim.

</FONT><HR>Thank you for wasting the time of many Rangers posting long well thought out messages.  You obviously will only bring to team the things that YOU think should be brought up. Are you planning on sending these changes in with YOUR opinions attached with them as you have written them on YOUR list?  If so.... why ask for our input?  If the agenda is to submit YOUR lists only... dont bother asking us... just post your vision of a Ranger and other classes and go from there.  You seem to have a lot more power than just an interface between the players over the internet and the company.  You are making decisions on your own.  Is that your mandate?  If we MUST communicate through you the least you can do is READ the entire thread and LISTEN to what is being requested.  I don't believe it is your job to decide what goes to the live team and I don't care whether you agree or not.  You are a talking head.  Not a game designer.  Just because you dont think a Ranger idea is a good one doesnt mean that opinion is shared.<P>    Absor, i just re-read what i've written.... it sounds like im about to go postal... sorry for that.. thats not the case but i DO think you are overstepping your objectivity where its not warranted or desired.  I read the entire RANGER TALK thread and because i am PERSONALLY interested in seeing Archery fixed (as has been promised since before the "programmer is on vacation" announcement i noticed over 30 referrals to ARCHERY being fixed and useable.  All you put on your list was miss rates and Z-Axis.  Ok those are BROKEN things... those are NOT balance issues.  Verant has already admitted the MISSES and Z-AXIS are broken.  Dont even think of trying to sell that as a balance fix.  A balance fix would be increased damge... bows that proc... arrows that stun... whatever... you have REFUSED to put this down.... why?  Because you dont like it?  Sorry, thats not your job.  I'm seeing this in other areas too.  You are even saying you think things are a good idea or bad one... you are saying PROBABLY and MAYBE in threads.  You are even writing things down and saying no action needed.  ***?  Are you the boss? LOL You are making judgements of character classes. You are telling people they platy the class wrong and need to change play style?  Do you REALLY believe you know more than hundreds of players with chars played well into their 50's?  I concede that a LOT of Rangers level 55+ know a LOT more than i do at 55... im seeing what it takes to go 50-55... I listen to these people when they tell me im wrong about something. I suggest you do too.  I also suggest telling every class what they are doing wrong and and what you think shoud and shouldnt be done is destroying any desire for communication... why bother?  Unless you agree it doesnt make the list and if it does and you dont agree you8 say it probably wont be implemented... yee haw.<P>Forget any more... im wasting my time. Good-bye discussion board... what a waste of time.  No wonder they locked the threads.  A good distraction for a few weeks.  Too bad the integrity of the whole thing is destroyed by changes made on test BEFORE the threads were even closed.  Which tells me how much input the threads had there.  And bravo for putting things that have been broken for years as a BONUS BALANCE issue....  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I only started playing EQ back in December, and my first character, a Ranger, has just reached the dizzying heights of 20th level.<P>I have been following the ranger threads with interest, and have already begun to notice the difficulty my group members have in pulling mobs off me when I am in 'whirling buzzsaw of death' mode (ie dual wielding, double attacking, kicking, snaring, flame lick, taunt etc etc). I rarely use my taunt hot key (except after leveling to keep it maxed) unless I am trying to pull a rogue mob of a caster, as otherwise I take too much damage...<P>I am proud of my archery, and my trueshot (which I managed to make at 15th level with 124 fletching at about my twelfth attempt overall, and made a second one to sell only four attempts later at the same skill. :)<P>My priciple concern is with Archery, though I acknowledge the need for the other areas mentioned as being on the list to be looked at as well. I can accept that Verant don't want archery to be more effective than the equivalent time in melee, but I see no reason why it can't be 70-80% as effective, and maybe 110% for the duration of the Trueshot discipline. This would open up the 'fire-brigade' role for the Ranger, where after pulling the tracked down mobs back to the rest of the group, the warriors and 'defensive' meleers pile in, while the nukers, mezzers and healers do their thang. The ranger meanwhile is hanging around on the fringes, firing into the melee and racking up reasonable damage (though by no means excessive) ready at a moments notice to leap in dual-wielding, double-attacking, taunting like a taunty thing and pulling anything that breaks for the casters onto him/herself. This would sustain damage on mobs, and still let the Ranger do his 'buzzsaw of death' damage output as required, but without as much risk of becoming a mana drain on the healers.<P>Now one way to achieve this would to bring Ranged weapons more in line with melee weapons in the way their damage is calculated. My trueshot and 1/150 arrows do 21pts max (barring a crit). 20 from the bow and 1 from the arrow, exactly as shown on the items 'card' when you view it. Now melee weapons have been doing *twice* the stated damage... Why the inconsistency? couldn't bows etc have a multiplying factor of say 1.5, to make them about 75% as good as a similar damage/delay melee weapon, with a damage bonus based on dex and level, instead of str and level for melee weapons.<P>I don't want it so that a ranger would never have to melee, but it would be nice to have a viable niche role. As for bow kiting, it is a lot less efficient than caster kiting. If the caster is OOM after finishing of a mob, he just sits down for a few minutes and is good to go, a ranger who runs out of arrows has to find a way of summoning them (and they are pretty poor specimens of arrowkind that you get that way) or make a long trip to the nearest fletcher, spend plat, take half an hour fletching up the arrows you need to take on any decent HP mob, run back, kite, rinse, repeat... hardly the best way to gain xp... and if you run out of arrows mid-kite you have no choice but to melee... a caster can at least just keep running in big circles and regain mana...<P>Anyway, I just want Archery to be a rangers defining 'thang', and for it to be useful in combat, though not an out and out replacement for melee.<P>just my 2cp<P>Honig<BR>Lvl 20 Ranger<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have an idea for Archery that I think would be interesting.<BR>Since Archery is the Ranger's forte, they should be better at archery than other classes. This is supplemented by criticals being possible for a ranger of course.<BR>I think a big addition to that would be the removal of the minimum range for Rangers using archery. The bows aren't particularly imbalancing as existing items in the game (decent weapons to dual-wield with would still be far more damaging)and require usable ammunition. But this would add something useful and fun to the class, as well as seperate them a bit from other bow-using melees. <P>Another idea could be something like a double-shot (fires 2 arrows) discipline, which would make the Ranger as an archer a more formidable foe; this would not be terribly dissimilar from a rogue's double backstab at 55. The removal of the range bonus helps rangers of all levels, the discipline helps the higher level characters.<P>There's more to smooth out of course, but these were a couple of ideas I liked and thought I should mention.<P>Khasia<BR>14 Ranger<BR>Morrell-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For people intereted in how good archery really was in war have a look at "The History of the English Peoples" by Winston Chirchill. (spelling probably wrong  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  )  English archers could have up to 6 arrows in the air at once their rate of fire was so high.. and as for dammage they could kill a mounted knight at up to 500 yards!<P>PLEASE MAKE BOWS AT LEAST A LITTLE LIKE REAL LIFE! Give us some sort of decent dammage output from them.<P>As for people sugesting a "casting delay" on shooting a bow.. have you ever used a hunting bow? Not one of these ***** compound ones (pullies n stuff) but a simple composite recurve.. let me till you, you dont buggerize about.. you aim, you shoot.. cause a bow made for killing is as hard as hell to hold draw, if it isn't then get one with a higher pull so you can hit harder.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I also point out that horse archers seemed to do ok in history without suffering from interupts or whatever.<P>I really feel archery should be rangers defining feature. We are told we nee to step back from the fight and let the real tanks take the dammage.. well at least let us do a reasonable amount of dammage with a bow while we are out of the fight.<P>Lavarin, ranger 49.<P>BTW I also have a wizzy 50 and a chanter 51 both of which are way easier to play and to lev than my ranger, and genrally way tuffer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Hell at the same lev my wizzy could stand toe to toe with kobol in sol B and kill it by tanking and casting while my ranger would die trying the same thing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>just echoing some of brethren of the woods opinions and adding my own<P>1.  we need high defense skill the very fact that the other classes where plate and class only armor with higher AC should be enough of a change to allow us chain wearing classes the benefit of the same defense skills as they have<P>2.  ARCHERY we are supposed to be the masters of the bow but have you ever tried to kill a mob with only a bow pre trueshot guess what unless you are loaded like the clampetts and more mana that al kabor it ain't gonna happen increase our damage on our bows and maybe just maybe make arrows a little cheaper to make ALSO can we please do something about the cast bug with a bow what i mean is i cast a spell spell hits then i fire bow arrows goes but doesn't do squat doesn't miss doesn't hit doesn't do nothing<BR>3.  self ports come on now we want one or two get us there quick spells this ain't a major issue its just a fact that sks get pet fear summon corpse major parnent spell lines  pallys get heal and ressurection once again major parent class spell lines we get diddly squat <P>4.  allow us to be bound outdoors for the love of karana i am born raised and bred in the woods but i have to go to a city when i die explain that one<P>5.  move skin like diamond to 49 to keep our one level below parent class buff line going<P>6.  RAISE parry skill ok we are supposed to be offensive bad@$$s right parry and riposte are about the only 2 offense related defense skills lets try and get a little increase here<P>7.  how about a one shot wonder disc with our bow at 50+ similar to the rogues assaniate if you have ever watched a good ranger movie or read a good ranger fantasy you know rangers can just as easily put a arrow square through and mobs heart as a rogue can a dagger<P>8.  DO NOT give the other 2 pretenders to the throne our tracking changes like scroll bar and filters WE are supposed to be the masters of tracking and everyone and there brother gets the same changes we do where is the fairness in that<P>9.  increase ivy etched or make it a tad easier to get have you ever tried the camp on wiltin or the difficulty of the gauntlets or the boots for that matter why would i want to waste my time doing theses quests when there is much easier BETTER armor than i can chose from at the same level<P>10.  indoor harmony yes i know this is a much harped on fact but lets face it this ain't a crowd control spell this is a get the mob back to group with as little difficulty as possible and for some reason when you say ranger the group heres "hello your puller has arrived"<P>11.  let us cast sow indoors (this goes for the other sowing classes as well) for the love of god there are 500 "spirit of" spells that can be cast anywhere why should sow be any different <P>12.  move superior camo to 39 well at 49 most of our spells come from the 24 line where as at 39 most of our spells come from the 19 line why should superior camo be different we get everything else upgraded at 39 why should our invis be any different<P>13.  give us an offhand damage bonus or crits with weps we are supposed to be the "offensive" hybrid but we get diddly that backs that statement up unless we use high output low delay procing one handers <P>14.  increase our healing ability just a bit move gheal down to 49 or low 50's so at least we can heal worth a durn with giving ourselves carpel tunnel in the process <P>well thats about it and just want to say thank you for the changes so far and hopefully these will increase our durability in groups but there is still work to be done</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It is real simple for me. I like the things that made the list. Those are perfect. The only ones I wish to draw attention to are the requests for item upgrades. The examples sited are the Raincaller and the Cloak of Jaggedpine. Emplement them. Nothing wrong with putting in a quest to recharge the Raincaller. That would be great and it would, though add tedium, be something fun to do and not overpowering. Finally emplement the upgrade to the Cloak. I spent many hours camping for those stupid casks only to get an item that is worse then the common drop Lizardscale cloak. Add an upgrade quest and since we are all wanting more wisdom put that in the upgrade. Druids and Rangers both will love it. Someone later on mentions the Short sword of Morin and I remember at one time there were proposed upgrade quests for this weapon and they may have been even tested. I don't know but it would be nice. It would be in line with all the upgrade weapons quests the Iksar have and those are a blast. Well must my opinions. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok..first and foremost, I'm not a ranger..never have been.  I've always been drawn to the class and might even start one now the xp penalty has been removed.  But coming from outside the class looking in Rangers really don't offer much to a group.  Sure their melee is decent..but it pales in comparison to a warrior, and good luck keeping a ranger alive if he's your main tank.  As far as a secondary melee I'd still rather see a monk &lt;great for pulling&gt; or a Rogue &lt;CR Masters&gt; in my group.  I don't have numbers I can pull outta the air about defensive stats or offensive stats, I only know that when it comes to fighting classes Rangers have to rank pretty low..and that dissapoints me.  <P>Ok..now a few issues I haven't seen mentioned much.  Seems to me that the other hybrids get the best of their caster class parents.  Shadow Knights get Summon Corpse and Paladins get Rez.  What do Rangers look foward to...wolform?  I'm an advocate of seeing Rangers get ports.  Maybe only self ports and only to the 4 basic rings..but at least they would inherit the best the Druid offers like their other hybrid counterparts.  Also animal spells, Rangers by my definition should have more reign and control over beasts then druids anyways.  I see no real balance issue by giving Rangers befriend or even charm animal.  Shadownights have pets that don't attack them, If given at the appropriate lvls rangers could charm pets that were many lvls below them.  Also the panic animal line would be nice.  I don't know..just seems like if your going to be partly druid, you should get the ability to partly solo.  I'm also still not sure what's up with Ranger healing...your stuck with what light heal until 39 then you only get healing?  Wow...that's gotta be rough.  I'm not suggesting you get heals that rival Pallys..but really..druid is a priest class, seems as though your healing should be a little better then what it is.  &lt;shrugs&gt; I guess if no Rangers are complaining about these things maybe it's just me...but I'd personally like to see a little more Druid in my Ranger cousins.  <P>Senelebe Pureheart<BR>45 Druid Luclin<P>oh..and btw I really hope druids get scrolling and filterable tracking...was playing around with it on test...nice stuff. =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My only input for this list would be about Raincaller.<P>Back when it was created, the notion of bows with procs was a wish, almost a pipe dream.  However, since then, bows have been given the ability to proc.<P>I dreamed of my Raincaller ever since I was 19th level and crafted my Trueshot.. that was well over a year ago.  More recently, at 46th level, I was able to finish the quest and get the Trueshot enchanted into the Raincaller.<P>As it was "enchanted" -- I do not see it doing more physical damage, but I could see it being imbued with the ability to proc.  As it stands, it is charged with a very nice DD.  I will likely never ever use these charges for fear of running out of them.<P>I would ask that the charged 200+ pt DD effect be removed, and replaced with a much smaller DD proc (like 50-75 points maybe).  This would make Raincaller the bow that I think was intended back when it was created.. there just wasn't the ability to do it at the time, whereas there is now.<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My beloved ranger is my first character and has only so far reached level 22 so I have not been around that long. I do however, have a few comments.<P>ARCHERY<P>Given that I have not been around that long, I am not really clear on why Verant is so against archery being a viable combat form - could you explain please. I get the idea that it is because you dont want us to have a manaless form of range combat. And yes I agree that at the moment were archery to do the kind of damage melee does (with the double damage, duel wield bonuses), with snare and root I could probably become pretty good at taking down non-casting mobs without too much harm to myself. At the moment, however, all I seem to be able to do is some minor flesh wounds which compared to the kind of kiting damage druids seem to be able to do (even with their mana limitations) is nothing. Surely the damage archery does could be upped quite a long way before it becomes unbalancing. And if you really are worried about that then hows about this as a limiting factor. At the moment the quiver is only a small pack with a different name and from what I have read it seems unlikely it is ever going to make it to the arrow slot, so, why not prevent us being able to just dish out damage enlessly by only allowing arrows to be carried in the quiver - you can even make it smaller (maybe 40 arrows max) if you want. Fletching components could be carried in other packs. And then you can increase the damage that arrows are doing to something a little more realistic without us becoming over powered. The other ideas that have come up about enchanted arrows, special archery related abilities, chance of a stun/fatal blow etc should also be discussed at least.<P>You have only to read back through a small proportion of the posts to see that archery is a big deal to us rangers - hell I based my life between lvls 10 and 20 getting money to get fletching up to get my trueshot and chasing round after those damn micro servos - my ranger is an archer - hes gonna continue to be an archer till I give up - please at least make it an issue for discussion to try and make archery more FUN and less frustrating for rangers. Just fixing the bugs does not I'm afraid go far enough.<P>GROUPING <P>I notice in your re-reply to the Wizard issues, that you took notice of their grouping problems, at least to the extent that you acknowledge there is a problem. Please do the same for us - even at level 22 I am starting to notice that people would rather choose someone else over a ranger - I dont think necessarily that that is to do with my direct abilities at this level when compared to other classes, but more that there is a general acceptance amongst the community, probably due to the real high level issues, that rangers are not much worth in a group compared to other classes. Given that you have recently stated that EQ is a grouping game this has to be dealt with. I came up with an idea in a much earlier post for some kind of group ability that allowed us to escort the group to a safe hiding location and so de-aggro chasing mobs, based on the fact that in the great outdoors we should be the best at understanding the landscape. The mechanics would maybe just be a group hide or maybe a 'teleport' to the nearest zone. It could be our once a day ability that as a hybrid we seem to be lacking. This is just one idea, there have been many more in previous posts and although I accept that some of our grouping problems may be solved by simply upping this or that stat (and in some cases it definitely sounds like this is necessary), I would love it if the ranger appeal to a group was more in line with our ranger abilities. Again please at least make this an issue in the discussions that you and your colleagues have over this class balance thing.<P>BINDS ETC<P>I would be grateful, Absor, if when the dust settles, you could for the benefit of some of us newer players maybe reiterate WHY rangers or any other classes for that matter should not get binds, gates etc etc (not saying is good or bad thing - tho in the case of binds, it seems to be the case that an awful lot of casters run around anon to avoid tells asking for them whilst the rest of us run around spamming the city zones trying to get hold of one - what is the point??). This is a fairly minor point, its just frustrating to keep reading Verant have said NO, without knowing WHY.<P>Oh and finally my own little bugbear - I dont want the scare animal (or whatever its called) spell to be introduced - I just know that I will soon see fellow rangers and supposed followers of Tunare fear kiting anything fur covered with a pulse. I know there are plenty of people who dont take role playing seriously in the game, but you should not be giving them the tools to make it even less of an issue to go directly against what their character is supposed to stand for.<P>Cheers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just remembered something else, this is in regards to foraging (not really a balance issue but I thought I'd bring it up).<P>I have on my ranger a backpack which I dedicate to foraged items. It has 7 stacks of food of various types, and one of water. I think another backpack has a couple stacks of food as well. The water stack rarely has more than 5 in it.<P>What's the problem?<P>The way I think it works, is every item on the foragable list has an equal chance of being found. The problem is there are about 10 different kinds of food, and only one type of drink (pod of water). You have a much greater chance of foraging food than water. I find myself having to buy water quite often, and give away food even more often. <P>I suggest that more drinks be added to the forage list, or that the chance of foraging water be increased substantially, maybe to a 50/50 chance of food or water. This could also be zone dependant (harder to find water in the desert, but very easy in the Karanas).<P>While talking about the desert... why does the Oasis still make you consume double the amount of water a day? It's an Oasis!<P>Anyway, please look into the forage thing, I'd really like to stop running out of water while having to make room for food.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
