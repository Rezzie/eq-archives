I really don't understand how he is losing out.  NPCs usually are specific in what they require.<P>Giving the NPC the wrong item needs to be resolved though.  SO MANY items in the game look exactly the same in the game.  It's an easy mistake and should be prevented.<P>Also, is someone also losing out if they need a certain faction for a quest?  If I turn in all 3 items to a NPC conning indifferent, but I need amiable faction to do the quest, should I get my items back or "lose?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What if you handed items to the wrong NPC for instance? I did this by accident the other night when playing a newbie iksar doing the first of the series of iksar quests. Had to create another one to hand in the newbie weapon I had lost in my mistake (thus multi-quested). The NPC I handed it to wasn't a quest NPC at all. Would you make it so giving items to any NPC would make them give it back to you if they didn't want it?"&lt;<P>That came up.  I, for one, am one of those people that has characters that likes to give stuff to NPCs.  Giving bears food is fun, if you're into that sort of thing (try giving food to a Kodiak to try to convince it that you are NOT food yourself…).  Basically, it might end up being a case of all or nothing.  If you can't give your quest items to the wrong NPC, then you probably won't be able to feed the bears either.

</FONT><HR>Here's a solution that will make both camps happy:<P>Leave the current logic in place. But extend it. <P>When you hit "Give", the items go into the NPC and another player can continue to multiquest if desired. Leave the 'should we allow multiquesting' question for another day.<P>But here is the idea which would help reduce the pain of exploring quests with rare components:<P>Add a new button, called "Show". This button will cause the NPC to respond with either "I am interested in &lt;ITEMNAME&gt;" or "I am not interested in &lt;ITEMNAME&gt;" for each item in the trade window. <P>Finally, if the items in the trade window and the NPC's inventory would result in an item, have the NPC say "I will give you a &lt;REWARD ITEM&gt; if you wish to trade with me". This way, people will know whether they have all the items needed or not.<P>This way, players can tell in advance if the should give the item to the NPC for questing or potential multiquesting.<P>This would be a great upgrade to the quest system. If a player has an item and they are trying to give it to an NPC, they deserve to know if the NPC even wants it. If the quest is not described well enough it's not exactly fair to just keep the item, but this lets the player determine for himself if the item is used in the quest.<P>Thinking back to my early days of EQ, I recall how I eventually became paranoid of doing quests without a full spoiler. After losing just a few rare drops to messed up quests I don't think I ever went back to 'experimenting' on quests of any real value or difficulty. <P>It would sure be nice to remove that fear.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Simple answer: Don't kill Multi-questing. It creates problems, such as JBoots (in some people's opinions), and the problems with the NPC accepting the wrong items, but it is FAR more beneficial than all of the rest hurts. Being able to HELP other people with a quest, or have a group do a quest, is something that needs to stay, no matter how much programming you have to do. Some quests even require this (Think: Erudite Cleric Mantle of Souls), and the chances of them being changed are... well, zilch.  I like helping my friends with a quest, and if someone happens to loot a nodrop item, not being SCREWED. <P>Find another programming solution that doesn't kill multi-questing, or leave it alone. Maybe change the JBoots quest, THE most complained about multi-quest in the game, but even that would have it's downsides. <P>Think about all the Epic Quest items, all of the other quests that you can help other people with, and all of the quests you may have only one part of. It's fine as it is. Fix the NPCs that may be unclear in their instructions, but do NOT kill multiquesting.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is a gnome who appears in the Seafarer's Roost in East Freeport who wants two illegible scrolls from Orc Oracles (or was it apprentices). These items are LORE, or at least they were at the time I spoke with the gnome. I asked around at the time about this at the SafeHouse and here on the official board and was told about multi-questing and even found information about it in the official FAQ here.<P>I went to find this quest at a spoiler site, but couldn't. It was quite a while ago that I came across it(over a year), so it might have been changed, but I don't think it was. I did find this similar quest at Allakhazam's, http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=614 :<P>Illegible Cantrip<BR>-----------------<BR>Tara Neklene, located on the bottom floor of the Arcane Science building wants you to kill a Deathfist Apprentice and return to her two Illegible Cantrips. Because they are lore items, you need to make two trips to do this. When you do she gives you small exp, money, and a minor item, and sometimes a new quest. Be aware that you lose faction with a necromancer guildmistress but gain some for the arcane scientists when you do this one.<P>Anyway, please do not take this as a request to fix the quests that would not work with your new method. Instead take it as a plea to keep multi-questing as an option for those of us who like to work on quests with the help of friends. I would urge you consider an alternate solution. If you feel a quest reward is too valuable to be multi-quested, please change that quest, and that quest only. A good example of this kind of quest is the Staff of the Wheel, where 10 NO DROP items must be combined in a NO DROP container. I can think of no way to multi-quest that one. This idea has been ignored before for other often abused quests, such as Journeyman Boots.<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 48, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>1)On the one hand Multiquesting is VERY benficial and not worth losing.<P>For specific quests that should not be multiquested they should be changed the require the combination of no drop items in a no drop bag with a no drop result. Examine the staff of the wheel quest. It is a perfect example of such as it is impossible to multiquest. The wizard must di it himself.<P>2)Getting the wrong items back from an NPC would be cool as well but NOT worth losing multiquesting. If you could somehow get the last item back if you asked for them. But then you would have to track who gave what items to avoid players trading no drop items.<P>I don't know what you should do but please don't break multiquesting. Its not worth it. Its not like you're really adding anything to the game by putting the change in. So don't bother unless you have a really good way of doing it.<P><BR>Rhicco Suavey</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Make the change, but also evaluate the NO DROP status on some particularly rare items.  Either something is NO DROP and thus requires the player to loot it, or it is not, and can be sold.  The current situation allows for ANY quest item to be sold/transferred, and this can't possibly be the intention.<P>But please do not make the ring from the AC droppable/tradeable.  This item has the power to upset the eq economy in a substantial way!  Also, with it being less convenient to camp this for a twink, perhaps more people will get a shot at them.<P>PS I am a druid/bard.

I was already to voice my support.<P>The only problem is that Multi-questing fits the Vision(tm), even if you don't think so.  Since this game is sooooooo group oriented, it makes more sense to allow a band of hearty heroes to spread out across the land in search of the rare components needed to create the Boots of the Journeyman.  Sure, only one person can wear them at a time, but it fits the heroic mold much better than completing a laundry list to get Phat Lewtz.<P>I hate to say this (mostly because I think multi-questing encourages farming), but it seems to fit the archetypes better to allow multi-questing.<P>--Ix</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The correct solution is not to kill off multi-questing, but rather encourage it with certain quests and eliminate it for others with intelligent Quest-mob AI.<P>Jboots, for example should never be allowed to be multiquested...the mob is too rare and it encourages people to twink and take from primaries who want them. As it stands now, if you see the AC you drop him...because you know you can use the ring for someone even if you have jboots..heck, you can even make yourself 2 pairs and keep one in the bank for corpse runs if you wish.<P>Make quests level dependent for multiquesting. If you are under level 25-30..no jboots for you.<P>If we're talking about epic quests like the ranger piece from sky or other assorted no drop items..these need to be multi-able. <P>Unless of course you care to tackle the issue of certain guilds always taking out certain spawns, some people in EQ will never finish their epics unless they are multi-questable.<P>As far as quest-NPCs eating quest items..I thought the code was in the game to log all quest turn ins...if not, this needs to be implemented asap and people losing items on epic turn ins need to be fast-tracked to the front of the line and helped asap.<P>Killing off multi-questing is fine IF you change game mechanics to allow for people to acquire those items themselves. If you only do the former but ignore the latter, a lot of people will be very upset.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You go hire a band of mercenaries to kill it and bring back it's head. These encounters arent meant to be done solo ... so as long as the task is done the NPC that asked you to do it should be happy.<P>The ONLY problem i see here is high levels doing quests for low levels. Well does eliminating multiquesting stop a group of level 60's from killing a mob and toting a level 10 along to loot the item? no! How about you just put level limits on completing the quest ... so at time of completion the level of the person to get the item is checked.<P>oh well my 2cp ;-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's possible to do it all.<P>When items are turned in, have the NPC hold on to them.  So you can give food/weapons/etc. to a NPC and the NPC will keep them.<P>When items are turned in by other people, those items are thus kept, so multiquesting works.<P>If you give the wrong items, and get no reward, say a trigger phrase to the NPC (perhaps "I'm done"), and the NPC will tell you that you didn't give him what he wanted, and give you back your items.<P>Currently when you hand in items, there are 4 fields in the database for that NPC that store what you've given.  Just the item ID's are stored, not who turned in the item.  What I would do is add a column for the player ID that handed in the item, so the NPC always knows who gave it what item(s).  Alternately the current ID field could be used, if there are enough bits to represent both the item and player ID's.<P>When someone says "I'm done", any items they gave to the NPC are given back.  If two people multiquest something, they both have to say "I'm done" to get their items back, if the quest didn't work.<P>The extra field to identify the player is needed, because otherwise someone could say "I'm done" while two people are trying to multiquest, and get back items that they didn't turn in.  Or get weapons/food/whatever off an NPC that someone else gave it, or get a NO DROP item that someone else handed to the NPC, meaning that players could transfer NO DROP items at will.  Adding the player ID solves all of these problems.<P>From what I know about how the current quest system works, using this method not only allows more flexibility in doing quests, but it doesn't require nearly as much code.<P>--Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064627&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064627&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
