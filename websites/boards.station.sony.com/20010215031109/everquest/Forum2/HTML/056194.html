They didn't address clerics, they screwed us clerics. <BR> I contiplated starting a druid because of it, After all, why be JUST a great healer, when you can be a good healer with good DD, some good Dot's, ability to Solo when ya can't find a team or just don't have the time to devote to a team, and evac/port move around quick..etc etc etc... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most clerics I know are happy to share our healing powers.  Were just looking for something to make our jobs a little more fun.  If our primary job is supposed to be healing in a group, don't you thing we would be able to do that job standing up?<P>Clerics should be given slightly incresed melee skills and standing medetation at 50.  Standing medetstion would work in combat but not while traveling.  The medetation taunt would be the same as a cleric that was sitting a few feet away from the battle.<P>This would be unbalancing in no way as the damage were going to be doing even with incresed melee skills is still not going to be much.  Were limited to blunt weapons after all.  It would add no noticable overall power to the cleric, but would make it much more fun to play.  I don't even see a reason why standing med couldn't be added at a lower level for clerics.  If anyone sees any reason as to how this might be unbalancing, please let me know.<P>Standing Med is also something I think that should be considered for other casters that don't get pets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kraegor, you are dead wrong.<P>It's not stupidity.<P>We never said we can't do all this work by ourself. Actually, we can. We can do all this work very well, and still have time to chat with our guild and frieds list.<P>You are right that it is boring, but I can live with that.<P>Here's the answer to the original post.<P>Clerics can only do one thing. Just one. Keep a group alive.<P>We have no power, no ability to get exp or loot or eve plat (short of farming very green mobs) without being in a group.<P>Ok, we can solo a little. Very light blues with tons of downtime. Slightly stronger blues on those rare instances we find some undead that are solable and not camped. Still tons of downtime.<P>On any given day, the number of druids + shaman is roughly 3 to 4 times the number of clerics on most servers.<P>Give enough healing ability to druids and shamans, and you have more than tripled the number of group healers, without tripling the number of groups.<P>This means more competition for group healing spots.<P>Since that is all we do, keep groups alive or solo so miserably that it isn't worth the time, failing to join a group means failing to play. Means we pay our $10.00 just like everyone else but unlike everyone else, we don't play while they do.<P>That is our complaint.<P>I am glad druids and shamans are getting better healing. They need it.<P>I just don't look forward to tripling the time I spend LFG while I can't play. And yes, I can go LFG for hours some days, now, without those healing changes in place. On my server, there are enough clerics to keep groups running, and it's hard to convince a group to take a second cleric.<P>Yes, Ask4, I am tired of just sitting, medding and healing. But it's what I do. At least, now it's what I do. <P>After Verant triples the number of people who can do this role, I will be doing less sitting, medding and healing. Instead of that, I will be sitting, lfg.<P>Not a trade off I anticipate eagerly.<P>Oberon is right. I know several people with two computers who have a cleric on computer two. They run their tank, or rogue, or even caster on their main PC and watch the life bars on that PC, when someone needs healing they reach over and hit F3, 8, sit, and put their attention back to their man PC.<P>It's sad.<P>But that will be the best use of clerics in the future.<P>I wish ebay were still running. It would be nice to sell my cleric to someone with an extra PC and then maybe buy a class that I will be able to play.<P>Ok, maybe not. I'll still play my cleric. I'll just have lots more opportunties to log after an hour lfg and play my alt.<P>Mordullin<BR>LFG Priest o Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They are vocal because they are correct.<P>Improving the healing powers of druids and shaman post 50 degraded the value of a cleric in a group, like it or not thats the result.<P>I dont think clerics should have a monopoly but I dont see it that way.<P>Druids and Shaman, when played like clerics healed just fine for every type encounter except the uber mob encounter.  Now with the changes on test, if they go live, will make them viable for the uber encounters.<P>The only thing you will "need" a cleric for, after these changes go live, is to regain 96% of your exp if you happend to have died.<P>That IS the plain TRUTH.  Whether you like it or not, whether you think clerics are *****ing about it or not.  It is the 100% pure TRUTH.<P>I am sorry if a druid/shaman dont like to play like a cleric in SoV when no cleric is around, but hey they are getting a taste of what its like to be a cleric.  They could do it, I have a druid and a cleric at high levels and if I play my druid like a cleric he heals well enough to keep people alive, and then after the battle regen is key.<P>Why am I explaining this?  You people only listen to what you want to hear.<P>I am indifferent either way, it makes no difference to me what Verant does, I play on.  You (the reader) should know that clerics have a valid point, dont degrade them by giving them a hard time.  Just walk a mile in their shoes and then complain, well........actually.......just keep your cake hole shut.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the changes.  But that doesn't mean they don't worry me.  Nor does that mean that I am not highly annoyed that Clerics, who have been nerfed right and left, are looking at getting Bash and a better bandaging skill (mine is 8).  If Clerics are extremelly lucky, we will get a lowered cost of reagents for spells.  I am not holding my breath on that one though.  Clerics know how often they only use the heals that are being given to Druids and Shamans in a group.  The danger is that Clerics will still be needed in raids, but not needed for groups.  That will too often mean that Clerics only go on raids with few alternatives.  Clerics don't have a lot of fun things to do in the 50's outside of groups.  Except running around and being the server's res mule, which is hardly what we would call fun.  Many Clerics quit the class in the 50's after spending many levels suffering through being unwanted in groups (this is true of the older Clerics, not the newer ones that have the class reputation going for them now).  The same stress that causes them to quit in the 50's is now going to increase due to the increased healing of Druids and Shamans.  I agree that there will be fewer Clerics after these changes go in.  Other Clerics are looking long and hard about continuing the play the class without these changes.  I just feel that Druids and Shamans need a role to fill in raids themselves.  But it really angers me to hear those same Druids and Shamans that I am supporting troll the Cleric threads with "whining Cleric this, and greedy Cleric that".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a cleric, I am always happy to have a backup healer, when I go OOM, a druid or shammie is a welcome addition.  What bothers me is that at lower levels, we clerics are basically druids who can't solo, TP, snare, DOT, DD (Except Undead), or give meaningful buffs (except AC & HP).<P>It is always annoying when as a cleric I log in and shout for a group, and get no response... or get passed up for a druid/shammie because they can heal plus a whole lot more.  When that happens, I have no choice but to log and play one of my alternate characters.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Don't listen to the hype.<BR> <BR>From the games inception the designers have made it clear that every class was to have certain drawbacks and benefits to playing it. When they keep beefing up the druid's abilities their "drawbacks" are becoming fewer and fewer. This is not only inherently unbalancing to over class balance, it is also unfair to the other classes who suffered the drawbacks druids don't get for the exact same benefits. It's becoming unclear why anyone would play a cleric when they can play a druid. Druids have their cake and eat it too.

That's horse puckey. Clerics will always be wanted.<P>It's just that the Clerics that got lured by the 150mph/50mpg sales pitch missed the larger impact and the bigger picture. <P>Tunnel vision is what is hurting the Cleric class, not upgrades to Druids and Shamans.<P>Noini Lorien<BR>Halfling Druid of the 34th Harvest<BR>Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The ranking of the healing classes is (and should remain):<P>1.  Clerics - they heal the best, that's most of what they do.<BR>2.  Shamans - they heal on par with Druids, but they have slow, that's fine.<BR>3.  Druids - somebody has to be 3rd, they have a LOT of other stuff to compensate.<P>What I see repeatedly are complaints like the following:<P>A group lost its Cleric and I wanted to join, but they wouldn't take me because I'm a Druid.  I should be able to heal well enough to fill that slot.<P>Well, no, you shouldn't.  You should heal well enough for the group to toss out a Rogue and take TWO druids.  And, in fact, you do.  I had a Shaman and a Druid doing healing for my party last night in Sebilis and we had next to no downtime.  I had two Druids two nights before.  I had one Shaman last weekend.  I had one Druid (in an admittedly easier area, but that is as it should be) last week.<P>If you can substitute for a Cleric, then your healing is equivalent enough to a Cleric's that you then have to look at the REST of what the classes offer, and balance THAT part of it.  Which Druids are apparently utterly unwilling to do, and completely incapable of understanding.<P>The second complaint is that there is a lack of healing that causes people to sit around and do nothing.  But for every group I've had which couldn't go somewhere due to lack of healing, I've had a group which didn't have sufficient crowd control, or was unable to get through a door, or had no single-puller, or had insufficient tankage.<P>If there is always enough healing available for anyone to do anything at anytime, that's not a game of skill or strategy or competence.  That's playing on God Mode.  I know some of you LIKE to play games on God Mode.  I don't.<P>You will probably get your way.

</FONT><HR>Lidane-<BR>Most clerics agree that you need better healing.  But something also needs to be done about the cleric's weak areas.  Absor stated that Clerics are pretty much balanced and he doesn't see any real changes for us comming.  Thats what the clerics are angry about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics will still be highly desired in groups and preeminent in healing.  This change will have no effect on their desirability.  It will only allow groups to function if there isn't a cleric in sight.  This happens far too frequently.  It'll also give druids something to add to a group, especially a dungeon group.<P>That's it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE POST-50 GAME!<P>There, that being said I have to put in my opinions AGAIN about class balance.<P>Level 34 Cleric seeking group...  Good luck, you'll need it.  I hope you've got lots of friends, because you're going to spend more time waiting for a group to pick you up than you are playing.<P>Level 34 Shaman seeking group...  Congrats, you're in the door right off the bat.  The only way you wouldn't be is if -everyone- in the zone already had a healer with them/in their group.  And if so?  Well, just go solo stuff... or run to another zone and try getting a group there.<P>Level 34 Druid seeking group...  Well, not quite as instant group-ability as a Shaman, but close.  See Shaman for what to do if you can't get a group... only add the fact that you're even better at soloing, can track the mobs you want to hunt, and can teleport to where there might be groups.<P><BR>Many, many times since reaching level 20 with my Cleric (and again with my Paladin) I have seen "Group seeks Druid or Shaman."<P><BR>Again, I don't care about the post-50 game...  I just want to be viable and have fun in the 30's!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056194-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056194-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056194-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056194&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056194&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
