</FONT><HR>I'm not sure how many of you have been to Harpy's Happy Tavern, but I just recently went there myself to read over a few things.<BR>Well, I know that Absor and Abashi, among many others, have always said there is a story line behind Everquest and Norrath, just nobody have ever gone out there to try and find it.<P>So, I'd figured I would check it out myself. Sigh, I have to say, after reading the history of Norrath ( not even in it's entirety ), and I've totally lost interest.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>There isn't any real 'fantasy' feel ( or any feel at that ) behind the story. Many things are left open, and never explained giving the idea it's 'Not important'.<BR>The grammar gets to me, granted, I'm not the best in the English grammar, however; It's not proper to start off a sentence with the word 'And' or 'But', let alone a new paragraph. Many sentences looks more like a game of yahtzee. There isn't must as far as run on sentences, but they, allot of them makes just as much sense.<P>Writing style: Again, I'm not an ace in this field, but I have done a few stories and read a few to understand, what you all have here, isn't good. First off, lack of detail. You give story of things happening, but no detail as to who, what, why, when and, most importantly, where.<BR>Example:<P>"But then came the last curse of the gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains, bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids fought long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the change, they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, and eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving much of their greatness behind. "<P>This is quite apparent that this 'story line' is about the old elf city ruins located within the Desert of Ro's, but anybody that doesn't know this, will have no clue to where this is happening. Great, the elves had to leave Tunaria, but again, when and where. Missing both of those.<P>Paragraph endings ... Now, I've done this by mistake myself, but promptly correct upon re-reading my stories. Just about *ever other* paragraph ends with "Thus began the Age of .... ". The way to keep interest in the story, is to change the why you word things around. Keep the user moving and wonder. End every paragraph with the exact same phrase gets old 'fast'! ( It's like, a blonde, like using 'like' all the like time .. like .. ahhh! ).<P>Important events: If something happens that's important, detail and information is the most important key to getting it across to the user. Using the example above. Again, and important event that later lead to the civilization of the elven races on Faydwer, but no detail was given as to: one, where they where from in the first place. two, there they where heading to.<BR>Okay, two can be left out until later in the story, but alas, it's not even stated later on  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Now .. Those are just the prominent problems I see with the story. There are many interesting twists w/in Everquest and on the lands of Norrath that truly interests me. I would like to know more about them, but find it very hard to learn when the 'opening story' is so vegue and poorly written.<P>I would love to learn how the Bards fit in the opposing faction of the Ring of Scale, and how and why they relate to Mayong Mistmoore. I would also love to figure out WHY Venril Sathir's faction is all over Kunark ( but yet his followers are KoS to him and most of his minons ).<BR>I also want to know what's the deal with all these faction surrounding cities like Cabilis, Freeport and Qeynos, and how they play a role with another.<P>You do learn 'some' while playing the game, but never the underlining detail.<BR>The opening story is so vegue and left open, there are literally *no* clues as to where to search for these answers. Shoot, there is nothing mentioning how the Bards of Antonica are in opposing faction with Mistmoore and Ring of Scale, even though MM and RoS as in opposition as well.<P>Sure, the clues are in the game, but please, give us out of game clues ( and most story ) for the in game clues.<P>Story's writing like Star Wars Episode I .. it's got something in there, but too much detail is left out to make anything out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The reason the story doesn't interest me much isn't so much the writing style or it's technical qualities.  For a MMORPG I personally feel that a story for the world needs to do a few things in order to capture, and hold my interest.<P>1)  Provide clues that players can look into.  It should help with solving quests and foreshadow possible conflicts (which IMO is where events should draw their inspiration/content from).<P>2) In the revelation of a history, there should also be the lure of adventure, and an idea as how participating in such an adventure has others look upon one (i.e. faction adjustments-must like Guice pointed out, why do the factions oppose each other).<P>3)  Participation and adjustment/advancement of the storyline.  The servers don't have any real distinctions other than what uberguild dominates what spawns.  In order for each server to have it's own character, it has to be influenced in it's evolution by the people who play there.  <P>Some things could be done to reflect this, i.e. the result of a epic scale quest, rather than resulting in some epic particile weapon, results in FV becoming a full fledged town rather than a outpost.  Same could be done for The Overthere's Dark Races outpost.  This is the sort of thing that gives long lasting senses of accomplisment rather than just toons and their toys.  <P>unfortunately, that would require more effort than I think VI is willing to put forth, especially as it's not the GMs who do the coding but just handle bugs/petitions/reports ect.  It's the strongest feature of the text based muds that sadly, never made it to the video rich ones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I agree. They (VI) need to let more of the history in the game slip out. Im not saying the playing public is stupid, but I think Verant has masked it too much. I think if they hired someone to sit down and actually write out a novela type book on the history of Norrath, why things are the way they are, where certian lost cities used to be, what happened to the Combine empire, it could infact be a great read. <P>For instance. Has anyone noticed that inside Tower of Frozen Shadow there are pictures of Mayong Mistmoore hanging all over the place, but his face has been clawed or ripped out of the picture. Was Tserrina an old flame? Ex wife? Scorned mistress? What? Did Mayong visit Velious, did Tserrina live in Mistmoore? <P>Things like that are interesting storylines, yet they are totally hidden to the players. You could litterally spend a lifetime just seraching for clues, hints, and leads to the stories in Norrath, but then if you did youd never level to take it further. <P>Important characters that are reserved for GM events, such as Mayong Mistmoore, King Tearsis Thex, Firiona Vie, Queen Christanos Thex. They all exist in a web of story and often play vital roles in the world of Norrath, yet they only pop up maybe when an expansion comes out, or once a year. Perhaps Verant should invest in more of a story teller outlook on the game. Put more GMs into action just for such things. Non CS GMs whos sole purpose is to tell stories, play out events, and help players uncover the completely hidden history and story line of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Much of the historical tidbits either haven't been or never will be implemented meaningfully.<P>For instance, much is said of Miragul and his secret lair under the ice full of mystical treasures and scrolls brought there from all over the world.  Go there.  The portal is inactive, the tunnel is barren.  Miragul apparently found the door out of his lab and wanders around some Ice / Aquagoblin tunnels with a big bear that took me over a week of camping (eight hour placeholdered spawn, I logged on three times a day for eight days) to get for a Shaman quest.  Believe me, I know those darn tunnels.  I got Divination from 3 to 180 casting Sense Animals and Vision on animals running overhead to amuse myself...<P>Miragul's tale is a neat story and would be interesting if it is 'true' to the history of EverQuest, but in the actual game-world it is proven a pointless fable by the absence of follow-through.  It is just words on a website, no more <BR>'real' to the game-world than the tale of Mysteres childhood enslavement.  And worth about as much to us players as that example.<P>Another interesting tale is of the dragon of Steamfont (which apparently was a weak one since one High Elf Paladin could kill it) and the champions of Trakanon, including that Elf and a Troll whose sword is now a holy artefact buried in Broken Skull Rock at his tomb, where, presumably, the Trolls of the BrokenSkullClan, whom I lose faction with whenever I do quests in Grobb, live.  No such place.  No such tribe.  Not sure what the faction is good for / bad for.  The Elf himself has a holy relic presumably 'buried' with him at the bottom of the Lake zone that was never implemented in Feydwer, making this tale even more irrelevant, since the entire story seems to lead up to the suggestion that someone has to get these items together and return them to Trakanon at some point, which would be kinda hard with at least 2 of them existing in unimplemented zones...<P>Another interesting potential tale (and uberquest) wasted by rushed implementation of other content and now made LONG obsolete by other expansions.  The grand-daddy of Epic Quests, bringing artifacts from the corners of the world to a powerful Dragon.  Pissed away.<P>Deep in Neriak, a portal goes nowhere and beyond it the Dark Elven Queen can sometimes be heard to cast a spell.  But she apparently hasn't found the way out yet and the Dark Elves remain unled.<P>It would be nice to see some of these stories made 'real' but I wouldn't hold my breath.  The people who wrote them have no doubt gone on to jobs where their ideas are used and not posted and forgotten while coders randomly implement 10,000 unrelated and inconsistent things instead as their caffeinated whims take them.<P>With work and imagination, *we* can make a living breathing world out of Norrath, but they sure didn't make it easy...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's a neat and easy way they cold distribute any current lore in the game, with VERY VERY little programming: The in-game messageboards. Probably at least half of the EQ population doesn't know these exist, and for good reason. They are ONLY in Qeynos and Highkeep. However, it stores messages, has several sub-boards, you can reply, use languages, and all that. <P>My suggestion is to, at the VERY least, put one of these boards in _EVERY_ city in the game. That would get the players to maybe use them a bit. To make them actually, well, USEFUL, post the current GM event storylines on it! Use it as a "town crier", and let people KNOW what happened.<P>For instance, I know NOTHING about the Claw of Veeshan GM quest. I was able to participate in no bits. People have posted portions, but never the full transcript. The FV quest is, again, a mystery. The ONLY way I found out FV was kidnapped was via the front of the Kunark box. As far as I know, there have been NO storyline advances anywhere in the game since then. If there were, I have no way of knowing.<P>so, put your outdated in-game messageboards to good use, and EDUCATE the people.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, a few interesting quest bits that I did hear about: You know there is the Thex Mallet, correct? Queen Christianos Thex wants it, for some reason The Thex surname is common on all High Elf and Dark Elf royalty, as they are all related. <P>Now, at one point, rescuing Lenya Thex gave you the Thex DAGGER. Like the mallet, useful, but barely. +50 disease resist, otherwise useless. (Note: this quest is now gone, replaced with a crappy paladin shield quest that's bugged)<P>All fairly common. Except that, at one point during the FV storyline, or more likely due to the Paladin FA Inquisitions (They ased a LOT of NPCs questions...), it was found out that if you brought all of the Thex Weapons together, you would get an artifact of immense power. The only other Thex weapon mentioned was the sword. No further clues were given. The Thex Dagger quest is now broken, and no new servers can have one, ever. The Thex Sword is unknown. Interesting how they set up for an artifact of immense power, then break parts of the story, and neglect to write out the rest, such as WHERE the Thex Sword is...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another interesting dead end story. If you ask one of the SK masters in The Lodge of the Dead within Neriak 3rd Gate, "Who is Innoruuk?" he will speak of a scroll which is to be used so the Dark Elves can cummunicate directly with Innoruuk. It was stolen by a Koada'Dal, and seems that both the Queen and King factions are racing to get it back. Only thing is, I have never seen a Koada'Dal rogue in either Felwithe or Kelethin who would speak of any such scroll.

</FONT><HR>Yep, EQ is like BG2, but with every other NPC removed that is related to the quests.  You can't ask anyone anything, and expect to get an answer, or dialog about it.  Players can do quests over and over again to "add to the story", but then do it again and again.<P>The only solution would be to have flags on the player record(server side where we can't see it), then based on if you have the flag set, give different responses.  The same could be done for items(If you didn't get a quest that requests a darkbone skull, why would you ever think about looting it?).  That sort of thinking would be needed to make any game a true RPG.  Quests shouldn't need to be done multiple times, just to earn faction with a group I don't even know exists.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grave_Robber: Oh, I know alll about those Neriak quests. That particular one I made 2 hotkeys for, then went through all of Felwithe spamming, to every NPC: Hail (until I get a response, or 3 times) then hit they hotkey twice.<P>So, no one knows "what scroll of G'han" "what scroll of ghan" "what scroll" ANYWHERE in Felwithe, and then I did it in all of Neriak, too. Maybe I need to make a "what koada'dal rogue" hotkey, and spam that.<P>Basically, they have lots of interesting stuff that dead ends.<P>Another Neriak quest that's interesting is one that doesn't exist: Go to Kizdean Gix in West Commons. Ask him "what messages for Neriak" or "do you have any messages for Neriak". Interestingly, he spawns in two forms: One form says "No, come back later" and one gives you a scroll. This one leads into the Thex Mallet quest. Then you go ask Cytodl Krish (spelling? Almost right, I think) the same thing. He spawns in one of the HighHold Pass inns, with Sir Edwin as a Placeholder.  He will give you... the same f****** scroll that Gix gave you.<P>WHich is too bad, since both scrolls are signed "Kizdean Gix" and both of them reference to "send reinforcements to WEST COMMONS and BEFALLEN". Doesn't make sense for Cytodl, in HighPass, to tell you that, huh? <P>As for where this quest originates... Damned if I know! It was listed on Allakhazams, and I've spammed everyone in neriak about it, with no response. The questions to the 2 known NPCs still work, and there IS a third one out there. I'm planning on finding it, somehow. I hope it's a Dark Elf...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Have you noticed that it is entirely possible to play EQ from 1 to 60 and not know c**p about the history?  It really isn't important to gameplay, which is a tragedy.  <P>If VI tied the history more closely with the gameplay (probably in the way of quests), it would make things a lot more interesting.  But they wont.  Aside from the fact they would have to do a lot of serious thought to tie up the dead ends of their "storyline" and implement (or fix) a huge number of quests, they won't because it would fundamentally change EQ gameplay to it's very core.  EQ would become...gasp...a DYNAMIC world!  A world where things would change from time to time.<P>I'd love to see a quest where some aspect of the world changed for good.  They tried this over last Halloween in Qeynos.  A bunch of Bert worshippers were attempting to build a shrine which would bring an avatar of the disease god to QHills and wipe out Qeynos.  All the players really knew was there were more and more "rude individuals" in QHills and Qeynos and some rather strange drops from them.  Then, on Halloween, it was reported that the ringleader of the plot was captured, tried in the Qeynos courts, and escaped.  This was not a GM event...this was a story they posted after the fact in Harpy Head Tavern.  The escaped ringleader isn't even a wandering mob somewhere for people to hunt down.  The "rude individuals" disappeared from the QHills area, leaving only empty huts behind after the next patch.  <P>So what involvement did the players have?  None, except camping the rude folks.  Was Qeynos wiped out by disease?  Nope.<P>IMHO the reason VI doesn't want change, especially if produced by players, is they feel it would alienate new players.  No one wants to come into the middle of the movie and not understand what's going on because they missed the first part.  Plus, if a permenant change is brought about by a player, then it can't be duplicated by anyone else.  By giving "everyone" (uber-enough I suppose) "equal opportunity" at the quests, they stagnate any sort of "progressive storyline" they may be fostering.  "Wow!  You've spent a month online hunting down the clues and battling numerous foes to rescue FV from the iksar.  Now the walkthrough is posted on the spoiler sites, and there's another guild waiting in line to do it next week."  <P>VI received huge amounts of flack in the past just for removing items from the game because "...now my character will never have the chance to possess one...".  Imagine the howls from the playerbase if one group brought about the destruction of Freeport?  There were even complaints when they put some DEs in a formerly empty bandit camp in LFay a while back, which Abashi defended by saying EQ was a "dynamic" game and things would change from time to time.  hehe.  Yeah, sure.<P>To bring the history of Norrath into the game, VI would have to allow for permenant changes to Norrath, they would have to allow that some quests can only be done once or some mobs only killed once, and they would have to allow the players to create history.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, on SOME servers, the ringleader _WAS_ captured in a GM event. Basically, they were told to go to the Karanas, depending on which month, then go to to Highpass. Find GM playing NPC. Beat on it. It "surrenders", even though it's a high priest of Bertoxxulos, and the last time someone tried to beat on, say, Lanys T'Vyll, the entire zone got wiped out... but nevermind that!<P>After that, everyone went to Qeynos, one person got a shield that was 75 AC, Human and Half-Elf Melee classes only. Artifact, too. Someone got a title, "Of Qeynos" or something.<P>However, I found out about this only by being lucky and reading other server's messageboards. On The Rathe, I do not believe ANY of it happened. Except the Rude Individuals. Did you know you could get Rubicite off the level 35+ ones in QHills, the Loathsomes and above? It's true, you turned in a certain type of weapon, the Runed Branding Irons I believe, to an NPC in Qeynos, and poof, rubicite piece. No Breastplates or Legs, but I think everything else was gettable. Naturally, this quest was pointless, as a select few figured it out, bought up all the branding irons, farmed the Loathsomes, and completed the quest in secret while telling no-one.<P>Oh, and the quests that are time-limited did indeed exist: Lenya Thex quest, un-intentionally time-limited, and the abovementioned quest NO ONE knew about, which ceased when the rude individuals all disappeared for no reason.<P>Permanent change would be wonderful. Overrun Freeport with orcs. Give them half-decent drops, and you'll have High-levelers being guards. Let the damned goblins take over Misty Thicket, and maybe Rivervale. Best one I can think of would be to turn all of North Karana into one big, smoldering crater, and preferbly allow you to bypass it. What a useless zone. Same with West Karana. <P>Or maybe, if they SERIOUSLY want to have fun, and have an RP justification, create The Hole #2. The Erudites have warred before, they can war again. This time, however, kill off Erudin proper, instead of Old Paineel. <P>Basically, all of these changes would piss off "newbies" aka people who have played the game for a little bit and want to have everything stay the same. On a server as old as mine, I think many, many people would LOVE to see city or zone-wide PERMANENT invasions. We've all oohed and aahed at all the pretty architecture in various cities. Have someone kill the King of Kaladim, have the fake Clockwork King of Ak'Anon be exposed, and have mass wars in the cities. All that sort of fun stuff.<P>One problem with dynamic worlds, though: As of yet, the only feasible way to make something "dynamic" is to make changes to _ALL_ servers at once, when you change anything. So, say you stop the destruction of Rivervale. Another server assists in the destruction. You can't have 2 servers that diverge, period. Version control would be a NIGHTMARE, and what happens at the NEXT quest junction? 2 choices, then 2 for each of those, then 2 for each of THOSE...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What they should have done, to make this world more immersive and include people in the history of Norrath is hire a seperate GM staff that does nothing but play these characters. Keep a record of all who complete their tasks and make a mark or bearing upon the world of Norrath, thus making it possible for players to become entwined with the history of the game, rather than just watching it or hearing about it from a programmed NPC. <P>Mistmoore, Queen Christanos Thex, Firiona Vie, King Tearsis Thex, various gods, demi gods, and dragons could all be GM characters played on a much more constant basis.

</FONT><HR>Woohoo! My post got through the grammar/spelling rules filter (aka the poster who just posted)! I never bother to run these through a grammer/spellechecker, but I'm betting I'd find enough to make an English teacher freak out.<P>As for Kithicor, that is the only real exception to the "static" world in the WHOLE GAME. Would be kinda neat, except that if you depop the zone during the day (current), it's no different to run through than before, and if you don't, all the newbies die. Add to that they changed a secret, actually DECENT, newbie hunting ground into a zone where both newbies AND high levelers hate hunting. Each of them only get 1/2 an EQ day to hunt, and the low-levelers get to run like hell OUT of the zone, while high levelrs get to be bored to tears by the greenies. <P>Oh, and while we're on Kithicor: This invasion was caused by Innoruuk, right? Okay, I'm a Dark Elf Necromancer who worships Innoruuk. Even the Ghouls in Neriak 3rd Gate love me. So, why is Kithicor so  bloody KoS to me? I ought to get a quest from the rare spawn undead! Even the skeletons in Najena like me in Call of Bones form. <P>On a side note, what's up with the Rogue epic quest? For those of you who don't know, the big goal of it all is to: Prevent the (possible) assassination of a High Elf prince/general, while absolving a Human rogue of any involvement. It is said, IN THE QUEST, that the assassination of the High Elf would have caused great wars between the Humans and the High Elves, leading to mutual destruction, making it prime for the Dark Elves to sweep in and take it all over. Yet you are supposed to make sure this cannot be tried again?? The WHOLE goal goes 100% contrary to the goal of all Dark Elves, and guess what? Dark Elves can be Rogues! Heck, you even KILL the important General, who calls upon Innoruuk when he dies, to complete the quest. <P>Now, having the most imortant class-epic quest reward come by being completely contrary to your race and religion doesn't make sense. It has been said, in your opening note, that if you make attempts to go contrary to the will of Innoruuk, you will be unwelcome in Neriak. The reason that Enchanters religion matters so much is that everyone knows their religion, because it is an IMPORTANT facet of your character. <P>So, basically: The goal of the Dark Elf race is to kill all Fair Elves. The goal of this quest is to recover the Assassin's Instrument, and absolve the almost-assassin of any blame, instead of killing him for doing his job poorly, then presenting his head to the General. Hell, you could even then have a quest to get the Feir'Dal mask, and assassinate the High Elf royalty yourself. Now THAT would be epic. Oh, and I believe that Dark Elf rogues can choose not to worship Innoruuk, but their race's goal remains the extinction of the High Elves. <P>Ugh, I suppose I shouldn't even count on in-game quests to make RP sense. Just go kill for the phat lewt, dewd, and hey! It doesn't lower Neriak factions, so who cares?? Instead of making a Dark Elf leg to the quest (which would have taken more effort, granted) and making it truly interesting (See how well you can stealithly assassinate a High Elf in the midst of a parade, with the assistance of the Ragebringer...) Oh, and Innoruuk worshippers would then have nothing to lose from the Curse of Innoruuk that is laid upon the weapon, as THEY fulfilled their duties. <P>Oh well, too late to hope for any change to the most ideals-contrary quest I've seen in the game. At least for the Paladins it has been explained that they consider all NPC races heathens, and it's a tradeoff as to whether to kill them. They also consider people who worship other religions badly, so that makes the Erudin assassination quests at least explainable. Then again, "Good" Erudites are also torture freaks, even more so than even Dark Elves. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058111&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058111&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
