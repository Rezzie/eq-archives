She would be alive for about 2 seconds.<P>Zzgo, I do believe you are wrong on how easily the AC pops.  You just got lucky in your encounters.  One time camping him in OOT he popped twice in a row which was nice (and someone mentioned that occurance in another post like it was something that happened all the time).<P>I have 4 characters with boots now, one of those just happened to bump into the AC when walking through sro.  All the others I put at least 7 days worth of camping in, with many of those sessions going about 40 hours.<P>My trick always seem to be this.  When you are so tired, you can't possibly stay awake another minute, and you say okay...just one more pop. Kill two more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Fiznar, I certainly preferred the Najena camp. Sure it was hell (my own personal hell was 29 hours straight - almost killed mem lol) but it's a big difference to know that if you wait long enough in line you'll get your boots. KSing happened extremely rarely and during my camp I made a lot of good friends.<P>In contrast my camp for JBoots after I switched server was over 50 hours total, no one camp longer than 6 hours but you just never have the feeling that if you stya long enough you'll get the ring, S Ro is FFA as far as the *** who decides he can't wait is concerned.<P>Do I think 29 hours is a ridiculous waste of time? Sure I do. If you'd have told me it would take 29 hours before I started the camp I would have gone elsewhere. But it's the whole flawed design ethos of EQ. Good items = rare items. Rarity is either kept by making the zones inaccessible (VP, ST) or more usually by having them on rare spawns. If you want certain items in EQ you have to either camp them or hope you have a lot of money (assuming it isn't a no drop, non-quest item - most nice stuff is no drop).<P>Am I retarded for spending 29 hours of my life camping something that lets me run 30% faster? Probably but no more so than getting enjoyment (occasionally) running about as a blue coloured, pointy eared quasi-human casting spells on cartoon characters...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You act like these boots are a requirement to advance in the game, they are nothing more than a very nice luxury.

They could've put this on a level 65 Dragon deep in Veshan's peak, then you'd have NO chance of getting it.  I can't play at all hours of the day, and I'm only glad that verant has given me the chance to get these boots without having to play 10 hours a day.  The only reasonable thing I've seen here is having it drop randomly off mobs that are of a high enough level.  <P>I wanted Jboots, I put my time in and got them,  I can't say the same for a mana robe.  I won't get a mana robe because my guild cant take Trakanon.  That doesn't mean that I'm sitting on this board saying "Make the mana robe drop off fire beatles."  <P>SolRoWizard <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It was a tough fight and in the end I was petless but I had Sow (potions). It was a quick hunt, zone in, cast a pet med, climb first hill, kill AC it too 5-7 mins from the time I zoned in from Oasis.<P>So far I have downed 12 Sro AC. I have tried the OOT AC but my brain melted after 6 hours. I'd rather put up with the KS cometition than squat in 1 spot for long periods of time.<P>The SRo AC is not as bad as the nightmarish stories that have been told and the J-Boots are well worth any time you spend getting them.

</FONT><HR>Many items have some 'control' on the number that come into game. JBoots are one of them. The control is the rare-ness of the two MoBs that drop the needed ring.<BR>Spreading out what drops it will also increase it's availability. Won't happen.<P>I agree single spawns that have a needed quest item suck. It only leads to camping and all the rudeness that goes with it.<P>I also agree that JBoots need to be controled. The only ways I can think to control an items "spawn" rate is:<BR>- Quest/awarding/droppng NPC/MoB is a rare spawn.<BR>- Needed item self spawns on a timer.<BR>- Needed drop is on random MoBs, but item still on an "available as loot" timer. (No idea if EQ can do this with loot table items.)<P>1st option is current, and best choice.<BR>2nd option is way too easy, still promotes camping.<BR>3rd option (if possible) is worse than other two. If someone else gets lucky and loots the item you need, timer re-sets unknown to you. It does eliminate camping specific MoBs. The result would be the uber-guilds "raiding" the zone. Instead of just one spawn camped, the whole zone would be camped (ala the planes). Make it multi-zoned and the camping is reduced as much as possible. But, now it's pure luck if you get it, not a "quest" you can work on per say. Might as well make the item itself drop.<P>Suggest a way to control the quantity entering the game that doesn't promote camping and I'll bet the live team will listen. Given the needed restrictions, I think they have done the best they can.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I never had the heart to camp the bugger. Today I ran through SRo from druid ring to Oasis when a low lvl player shouted "Ancient Cylops near gypsies". I was just passing the merchant camp, I could hear him walk.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Got a lil nervous when a necro showed up when I was fighting him, but he didn't try to steal him.<BR>Now I just got to find Hasten. After a few drakes the monk popped so trying again tomorrow...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please ignore Cabriolet, he hates everyone.<P>The JBoots quest is mainly boring and painful because there isn't much else to do there... and it's in a normally-lowbie zone with PHs, forcing you to kill them to get the AC to spawn.  Most don't know the PH's so just wipe the zone constantly... which is good if you are a low-level running through and want to pick up lots of cash off of dead mobs, but not if you want to fight here.<P>I think the AC should be in an area more like the OOT Seafury camp, where there is plenty to do for the people of that level while waiting.   I think something closer to the Tizmak guy in Great Divide.  He's not as rare, but the concept is fine... These rare spawns shouldn't be something you need to sit, doing NOTHING for 10 hours straight.<P>-- Fabmatil Fabulous<BR>41 Mage, The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062152-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062152-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062152&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062152&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
