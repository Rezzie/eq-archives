</FONT><HR>Alan, you originally posted the below:<P>&gt;&gt; <BR>True, this is only on Test right now. And you folks all need to be aware that stuff on Test will not always go live.<P>But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community.<P>So the plan is to raise the Druid cap so that they are still better at tracking than Bards. That's the plan anyway.<P>Alan<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>This thread is located at http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061242.html<P>Now, a ranger just posted a comment saying that id the druid community can make such a request, we would like to offer up some suggestions as a class as well. <P>Then in the thread located: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061765.html<P>You responded that it was taken out of context, would you clarify your original statement? We're getting mixed messages here. Thank you.<P>Underbrush<BR>Ranger of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>By quoting Alan out of context, the Ranger post represented Alan as saying that Druids had tracking raised in this most recent patch because they asked to have tracking raised.<P>What Alan meant (and what should be clear from context) was that Druid tracking skill was previously kept lower than Bard skill (e.g., 50 cap vs. 100 cap) at the request of the Druid community.  If you follow the history, Druids had a cap of 20, which is barely enough to see the MOB hitting you in the face.  Verant wanted to raise the cap to make Druids better; given the way that tracking worked, Druids asked for it to be kept low.<P>In other words, Verant wanted it to be good before, so they kept it low.  Now that they've added the ability to scroll, they wanted it to be as relatively good as it was before, so they're raising the cap.  Raising the CAP was NOT done at the request of the Druid community at this time.<P>It's an out-of-context quote.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me throw this out there then:<P>Rangers had a tracking skill of 200 since release.<P>If having a higher number is working as intended before the "enhancements", then rangers by deduction, were intended to track worst.<P>Either that, or they were fixes... or the tracking skill increases were increased to make druids track better.<P>This is simply pointing out the irony that made me smile.<P>Jaraxel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kenross is right on the button.<P>And I kind of doubt that lowering the ranger tracking cap to something like 50 would have been seen as an improvement by many rangers.  It might have been an improvement because of the way the skill worked, but reducing their cap would probably have upset people.<P>All that really matters now, though, is that it's pretty much the way we want it, and it's working great.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All of the recent fixes and enhancements to track were done BECAUSE of the high skill being a disadvantage for rangers. This was never intended, and Verant quite clearly stated that higher skill being a disadvanage was not intended. They also said that it was "on the list".<P>It has always been this way, Verant has always known this, but only recently have they allocated the resources to fix it. Now that it is fixed (i.e. higher skill is actually better than lower skill), they are changing druid tracking skills to put them in the middle as far as tracking usefulness goes, as they were intended to be.<P>I'm sure they felt that 125 is too high, and that it should be 100, while bard skill should be 50, but they are unwilling to change remove that advanctage that bards have had for so long. I agree with that decision. It might make more sense, but it wouldn't be fair to bards to take something away that they have had forever. In other words, it's too late to change it. Thus, druids were given 125, to put them higher than bards. I don't think Verant likes it being quite that high, but they see it as he lesser of two evils.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I keep seeing this "as intended" in reference to Druid tracking being better than Bards and I'm curious when this intention developed?<P>I've seen others comment on this, as have I, and there is a huge descepency there, or the histories as I remember them, compounded by tales from Beta testers, is completely wrong.<P>When this game was released, Druids had a tracking range of 20 (which, if you read the beta accounts, was originally only 1 and was only increased to 20 so they wouldn't have a skill that didn't work), while Bards were at 100 and Rangers were at 200.<P>This really only leads to one conclusion... Verant originally intended for Bards to have a higher tracking skill.  Any claims otherwise are revisionist.  They might have changed their minds later, which it would appear they did when they upped Druid tracking to 50, but it was not the original intention for Druids to be better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It doesnt matter how you 'sugar coat' it.  The fact is that Tracking should be a benefit of the Ranger Class.  For 2 years Druids and Bards were better at it than Rangers.  Then we had the tracking upgrades and Rangers were reasonably better at it than Druids/Bards. <P>Now, for some insane reason they are increasing Druid Tracking which lowers the advantage Rangers we rightly given.<P>You can go on about /tracksort and /trackfilter but now there is a scrollbar they are convienience tools, nothing more, they hardly make Rangers 'Shine' as the master Trackers they should be.<P>That is whats wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>It should be Rangers/Bards/Druids in tracking ability.  Tracking is a HUNTING skill.  Rangers are specialists in hunting, hence their high bow skill and track skill.  Bards are wanderers and live off the land, they hunt some and forage some, thereby supporting a moderate skill level.  Druids live primarily by forage and rarely hunt their animal friends to eat.  They do not need a high tracking skill.  <P>In the same context, rangers should have a much lower forage than they do.  Hunters would forage things to suppliment their catch, but they would not live off that alone.  Forage and Track should be inversly proportional, so Rangers might be 200 track 50 forage, bards 100 track 100 forage, and druids 50 track 200 forage.  But of course this makes too much sense for Verant to actually impliment.<P>There should also be more "meat" animals to track down to kill that drop rabbit meat etc to make tracking something you could "live" on.  They should have snow bunny type mobs in more zones.  Make them really really fast with low hp and a low reaction range, so a ranger could sneak up and shoot them, but most people would scare them off and be unable to catch them.  Think of all the things people could do with that, such as hunting contests...<P>Sigh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I for one don't like to see this.<P>Honestly, what would you have them do?  Re-introduce the scroll-bar for druids and bards?  Seriously?<P>I don't know of a single thread where druids are complaining about how Rangers now have several more druid spells, new ones, and existing ones at lower levels.  Should druids start threads to complain about druid effectiveness being diluted because Rangers are being improved?<P>I don't think so.  Is it going to change the online druid community?  Yes.  SoW at 9 levels earlier is definately a nice change for Rangers, but it also makes availability of the spell much wider at that level.<P>Please,  how about honest suggestions?

</FONT><HR>Working great according to who, Mr. VanCouvering?<P>The Druids didn't ask for it, the Rangers dont' want them to have it, the Bards don't want them to have it, and everyone else either doesn't care or realises that giving one of the pre-eminent solo classes an even better ability to farm rare spawns is probably not a cool thing to do.<P>At no point in this game's history have Druids ever been better at Tracking than Bards.  Old-system skill 50 was not better than skill 100; skill 100 was the sweet spot.<P>A skill of 125 means that a Druid will functionally track as well as a Ranger, because pursuing targets at longer ranges is usually a waste of time.  It will probably be engaged by someone else by the time you get there.  (It also means you're hunting in the wrong spot.)<P>Rangers have had to endure a broken Tracking system for two years; when it is finally fixed and we finally have our well-deserved advantage, it is snatched away again.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kenross: the primary purpose of Tracking is to find rare spawns.  For that purpose, the normal sort is preferred.<P>You don't use Tracking to pull.  You use your eyes.  If you need to pull targets from father away than you can see, you are hunting in the wrong place.  It means you've overpowered the local spawn, which means you have a group that's too powerful to gain EP at an optimum rate.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>With regard to Rangers = 200, Bards = 100, and Druids = 20, there is another explanation: Bards at 100 was a mistake.  This is, in fact, what Abashi said over a year ago when Druid tracking was being increased.<P>I still haven't seen a decent explanation for why a drunken bar-fly (or mailman, take your pick) should be able to track better than a druid.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   <BR>    There are quite a number of outdoor zones where you use tracking to pull more effectively.  The aviak tree in SK is a classic example.  When there's a range of green to red things, it's very helpful to be able to pick out just the blues.<P>   Or, for another example, I once met a friend with his level 2 Erudite in Tox with my level 4 ranger from QH.  Suddenly, we were gods.  Think about it -- lots of blind Erudites in a dark, limited visibility zone, but one with some really nice rich mobs (skels, kobolds).  We'd run around hitting all the good stuff, leaving the snakes and spiders for everyone else.<P>   Tracking: it's not just for camping rares.  High skill is not always better.  You don't always pull the thing that spawns right in front of you at the derv camp or "your" gnoll spire.<P>   IMO, the change for druids is about neutral.  It does give them a little better chance to spot rares.  That's helpful, if you take a look at the long, long list of rare stuff druids are supposed to be hunting in the Karanas at mid levels (and never do, because they're absurdly rare for the reward).  On the other hand, increased range hurts pulling ability just as much as it always has, since druids and bards don't get the sorting features rangers do.  Increased skill level is a mixed blessing, and the net overall effect is low, for either good or ill.<P>   There's quite enough anti-druid ranting with creating yet another ill-informed, poorly-thought-out, and emotional thread.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards don't live in bars.  Most bars in EQ do not have a bard in them.  Most players don't know this of course, as most players have never actually been inside a bar in EQ (no phat lewt in bars except for the Testament quest).  Bards also don't deliver mail, they hire other people to deliver it for them (ok, a low level bard might deliver mail, but so might a low level any other class).  <P>Bards are a generalist class.  They do a little bit of everything, and they wander a lot.  They get track because it makes sense for a wandering person who spends a lot of time outdoors and who "lives off the land" to get it.  Its the same reason they get forage.  As a generalist class they should have a moderate cap.  Rangers, being specialists, should have a high cap.  Druids, who are gatherers (forage) much more than hunters (track) should get a low cap.  The only reason they get any at all is becasue they are an "outdoors" class.  As I said before, tracking is a hunting skill, and druids don't generally hunt and eat their animal friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Venture -<P>When tracking to find rare spawns, it doesn't matter what the sort order is, unless you know the spawn is down and you're waiting for it to pop.  But if it's in range, you can find it in any case, now that all trackers have a scrollable window that shows everything in range regardless of spawn time.<P>As for tracking for pulling, you can indeed "see" things if:  a) all MOBs are about the same level, b) you're in flat open terrain.<P>When I'm soloing with my Bard, I do NOT want to waste my time on greens, and I do NOT want to pull even cons or better (unless I'm charming).  And in any uneven or wooded terrain (FM or BW, for example, as opposed to OT or much of LoIO), a MOB can be right next to you and not visible.  Maybe YOU don't use it to pull; if not, you're not using the skill to its fullest potential.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's the problem.  For a long time high level rangers where the worst at tracking due to our large range.  When looking for spawns I was forced to time, after time, after time, tell people I can't find it, get a druid or a bard to track it for you.  Many rangers, including me, came to the boards here and begged Verant to lower our tracking so that we could be usefull again.  We asked them to lower our tracking to 100 until such time as having a higher skill was usefull.  We asked this every time ranger issues came up.  It was not a few rangers asking this.  Now when having a high skill in tracking is usefull finally, we're told that Druids had an artifically lowered score to make their tracking more usefull, the exact thing rangers had been asking for.  The differance being, our requests were ignored.  That is why rangers are bitter over this.  The question is not 'why are druids getting higher tracking', the question is why did Verant do this for Druids and not for Rangers?  At the very least this shows class favoritism by Verant -- two classes make the same request and Verant only answers the request for one of them.  This is why Rangers are upset.<P>Rhyse</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
