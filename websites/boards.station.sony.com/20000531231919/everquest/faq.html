You've probably seen others use smilies before in email messages or other bulletin board posts.  Smilies are keyboard characters used to convey an emotion, such as a smile :) or a frown :(.  This bulletin board automatically converts certain smilies to a graphical representation.  For example, if you type :o in your BB post, it will automatically be converted to <IMG SRC="redface.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="">- a shameful face.  The following smilies are currently supported:

<A NAME="search"><B>Searching For Specific Posts</B></A>
<BR>
You may search for specific posts based on a word or words found in the posts, user name, date, and particular forum(s).  Just click on the "search" link at the top of most pages.  Note: announcements are not included in the search returns.
<P>
<A NAME="announce"><B>Announcements</B></A>
<BR>
Announcements are one-way communications from either a forum moderator or a bulletin board administrator.  No one may post replies to these announcements.  If you want to talk about specific announcements, you will have to create a new topic in the appropriate forum.  
<P>
<A NAME="censor"><B>Censoring Posts</B></A>
<BR>
The bulletin board administrators have the power to censor certain words that may be posted.  This censoring is not an exact science, however, so certain words may be censored out of context.  Please realize that the censoring, if any censoring is being performed, is being done by a computer based on the words that are being screened.  Words that are censored are replaced with asterisks.
<P>
<A NAME="activetopic"><B>What is the Daily Active Topic List?</B></A>
<BR>
When you visit this bulletin board, you will see a link at the top of the list of forums called "Daily Active Topic List".  Clicking on this will provide you with a list of topics in all open (non private) forums that have been posted to that day.
