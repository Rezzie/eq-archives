</FONT><HR>Here's the main issue:<P>Most of us old timer monks are feeling shafted.  Why? Because Pre-Kunark we had a very distinct and useful class.<P>We did lots of damage and we were basically required for any high level raid (Pulling FG safely, pulling POH/POF, etc..)<P>Our distinction has become blurred overtime.  Other classes can pull as well, if not better than us.  FD doesnt work for jack squat in Velious.  DMG over warriors is negligable, and rogues outdmg everyone (In a fight vs. a thrifling focuser, a rogue with epic + bp did 225,000 dmg to the mob...just one rogue).<P>Therefore we merely ask to be distinct again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Couple things i gotta say <BR>Level 60 is not the game..try not to base so many of your arguments around that..thats only 1/60th of your levels but people that talk about it make it seem like its the whole game.<BR>Skills that have been usefull that have made Monks a viable class for 50 someodd levels can't summarly be dismissed because at 60 they don't work as well anymore.<P>Monks are never gonna get Evade. Everyone just has to accept that..and in the same tone Rogues are never gonna get FD or mend.<BR>Maybe at 60 FD and mend aren't a big deal but it sure was a big time bonus for the first 50levels and you can't just micro analyze one level and disreguard the whole life of the class.<P>I really DO believe that the nerf to FD from few months ago at highlevel and especially in SOV needs to be reevaluated.At the time it was maybe appropriate and somewhat effective in its objective but now its just a bit to extreme.<P>I also do think all special attacks by monks should have the same min damage as rogues have for backstab.This would add damage with out overpowering and with out relying  on uber gear to see it. <P>Could anyone post their parsed average Special attacks damage for a night? <BR>I can tell you at 56 with Bloodpoints 220 str my average is 130.My min is 84 at this level.<BR>Duelwielding 2 BP's with Sash of Dragonborn and SLTW I'm averageing about 3500damage a min.<P>Monks should have the same benifit at this and if you look at your average then mine lets see how much more damage a minute Monks would end up with.<BR>I'm rather curious I suspect that it would put Monks noticably higher the warriors and somewhat closer to Rogues damage.<P>FD should be reworked tho i dont' think you'll ever get evade I do think an agro reducing component being worked into FD should be included..so that the longer you are FD the lower on the hatelist you go to a certain point..No way to clear it completely but would stabalize your agro more.Say every 5sec's or 10secs(longer might not be as appealing to youse but might get verant to consider it ;-))you get moved down a spot on the  hatelist.ITs like evade but using an existing skill and you sacrifice damage when you need to stop being hit..Might be a doable tradeoff.<P>HP we're equal as long as our sta is the same and HP gear..<BR>Ac 1080 and 1100 at 60 is only 20 ac differant..not that big a differance..were not talking 200 here. Do monks need some better class gear for ac...sure but not as much as you make it out.<P>Just somethoughts feel free to correct me where I'm wrong..not trying to start a flamewar here just adding some imput that hopefully will help.<P>Everyclass when looking just at themselves sees so manythings that could be improved..but everyone still needs to step back and look at the whole. These talks are about balance not so much fixing everything that isn't pefect.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In line with the old AD&D monks I would like to see...<P>Some kind of movement enhancement (say a self only L9 shaman Sow at L39, a L14 self only sow at L51)<P>Make monks more defensive.  Easiest way to do that would be to add another dodge, parry or riposte to monks.  This would lower damage taken significantly.<P>I don't care if I do 2 points with a flying kick.  I DO care that I do 2000 points while a warrior does 2100 points and the rogue does 4300 points.<P>I HATE- repeat HATE having to use weapons.  I picked the class because it didn't need weapons then all the sudden at L50 weapons were suddenly REQUIRED.  I wish they would continue to allow weapons the maximum damage but raise HTH to be about 85-90% of this damage rate.  So if I could do 2100 points with a 1HB, I could do 1900 points in the same time with hands.<P>--<P>Some kind of stealth along the lines of ADND monks hide in cover.  Not rogue hide but perhaps ordinary invisibility- as a discipline perhaps 2 minutes per hour at L51.<P>--<P>Unnerf Feign Death so it doesn't AGGRO mobs.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree<P>I think most of the points that monks would like to see addressed have been made in this post, in a sensible way as well which is great to see.<P>I do think it's harsh that things like the weight restriction were placed into the monk character to balance our extreme power, and since then FD has been nerfed to nothing in SoV, and our reliance on weapons places a double penalty on the 14st we're allowed.  I was amused to note that the reason given for the high weight on the Tstaff was that is was too powerful a weapon to have without a balancing negative factor. I think this a consideration only ever applied to monk uber-weapons for some reason.<BR>Anyway, the point of this post if that the weight restriction and the low AC and hp's were supposed to balance the massive damage we were able to bring to the party.  I think this balance is now a little out of whack, and I'd love to see something to help the upper levels of the class.  I think pre 50 everything is sweet, but the relative quality and quantify of good items for other classes and the active nerfing of our core abilities post 50 should be addressed.<P><BR>Yingwa - 25th human monk<BR>Ashi - 27th Iskar monk<BR>Saryn.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Some kind of movement enhancement (say a self &gt;only L9 shaman Sow at L39, a L14 self only sow &gt;at L51)<BR>thats about as likely to happen  as Druids/Shamans getting complete heal.<BR>How can any pure melee class getting the ability to sow themselves add to class balance realistically?<P>&gt;I don't care if I do 2 points with a flying &gt;kick. I DO care that I do 2000 points while a &gt;warrior does 2100 points and the rogue does 4300 &gt;points.<BR>Well what i was getting at was this..if your average damage for your special attack ,same relative level to me ,is 50 damage mines 130damage every 5sec's max haste..if monks special attacks were brought up to same average as a rogues using your own numbers your damage output would increase by about 1k per minute(i assume the numbers you stated are somewhat arbritary)so you'd end up with this<P>warrior 2100,monk 3000,rogue 4300. <P>That kind of adjustment requires no new weapons which you also mentioned you hate having to rely on equip as a monk.<P>Depending on what you are fighting that would be a significant diffence and the longer you were fighting the more it would be<BR>So for those 500k hp mobs that take 1 hour to kill that change would give you the potential to do another 60k damage compared to what you were doing.<P>&gt;If looking at every level as equal, this might &gt;be true. However, as I have heard said, level 50 &gt;to 60 takes almost the same amount of play time &gt;as 1-50.<P>this is very true but warriors and rogues don't change from 50-51 the relative differance increases 51 thru 60.All i was saying was that to many numbers of end result at 60th level comparing the classes shows "this instant in charaters life" and don't reflect all the levels before that point.<BR>But it is true the advanges in numbers(offence,defence ect) a monk had at 50 and lower are slowly eaten away till at 60 the advantage is gone.This happened because monks cap was closer to the 252 max at 50 and so the gain they get post 50 is much less and everyone else catches up.<BR>Not saying its right or wrong just thats my understanding as to why that happened.<P>&gt;classes are SUPPOSED to be balanced during all &gt;levels, and *monks* are not.<P>You can insert just about every class in between those 2 stars and it applies except clerics chanters warriors and rogues i guess.<BR>All classes have level ranges where they excel and and level ranges they don't.<BR>That is part of the way they designed things.Right or wrong for example necro's were considered extremely powerful offensivly prekunark now they aren't..partially because they were so powerful earlier. <BR>No necro's are happy about it but thats part of the overall Lifetime balance Verant decided.<P>As far as FD i agree it needs to be tweaked <BR>so it works more effectivly and could be used again to control agro.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;Im adding this here from a monks point of view&gt;<P>As a dedicated player of EQ since release and having two monks under my belt along with many other melee type classes in the high 50-60 range here are my two points on how to bring monks inline with the melee arena.<P>But before I go into it let me start off with a quote from Abashi, "Monks are the best toe to toe damage dealers.". With that said you need to go back and look at what the real role of the monk is and how you have effected the game by adding new uber weapons that most other melee classes can use that effect this issue. Adding in new weapons every few months that get better and better will only effect the balance of the game down the road, this goes along with armor. Instead of adding faster and more damaging delayed weapons you need to stop and come up with a better well rounded idea that wont skew your balance later on. This goes for armor as well. Now two areas that you might want to look at to keep monks ontop of the toe to toe damage area;<P>1. Flying Kick and other special attacks, needs to have a min bases damage much like a Rouges Backstab but no where as high to help keep us above these insane low delay high damage weapons you keep tossing in every few months. I would recommend the min base damage should be set at a 1:1 ratio. Thus a level 60 monk would never do less then 60 points on successful kick and the max would be 140 fully buffed with a strength of 255.<P>2. Disciplines, as a general over tone why do monks have some of the shortest duration disciplines in the game? on avg they last for about 8-10 seconds and the others are a one hit wonder... Take a look at them and see what if anything can be done, perhaps just double the time so its 16-20 seconds instead?<P>Well that's all from my perspective as I am looking at this in the light of being the most damage dealing toe to toe fighter out there as per say the vision. Would have been nice for you folks to have thought about how putting in X weapon with y/z damage/delay would effect this vision but its to late for that now. Good luck with the balancing as you have your work cut out for you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My monk problems.<P>As a 45 level monk, I have to say over all, yes I enjoy the monk class.  But there are a few things that just bother me.<P>1. No monk with 200 skill in Flying kick enjoys seeing you "You kick xxx for 3 points of damage!"<P>This is just depressing and a slap in the face to our skills.<P>2. I doubt any monks enjoy seeing "xxx beings casting yyy spell."  "You kick xxx for 98 points of damage!" "You feel your skin freeze!"<P>Come on, this is crazy. Tho I must admit of late, I have noticed a lot more times where a caster I am fighting has been interrupted.  Possible stealth bone tossed to us? I won't rule it out.<P>3. As a monk I actually enjoy pulling for my groups.  Now in Vellious, I get to sit and watch because when I pull, I can no longer feign split.<P>Everytime I pull multiple mobs in Velious and feign death, the mobs ALWAYS have gone back to their spawn points ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  So it's either aggro everything, or let someone who is a higher level pull just so you won't aggro everything around you.<P>4. Why do I have to use a weapon before I get my epic gloves?  Please rework the post 50 H2H tables. <P>Yes I admit no personal experience with this, but I hate hearing, "Yeah you need xxx weapon, maybe if you're lucky, you'll get in a rare group that won't want to /random all for it since they can sell it for tons of plat".<P>Overall, I love my monk.  Thaldin is the first character I made on Everquest, pre-Kunark, when monks weren't that common.  I just don't want him to get shelved in Velious and the post-50 game.<P>-Thaldin, 45th Circle Monk of the Ashen Order<BR>-Talshir, 31st Rank Enchanter of Innoruuk<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Having recently finished my CF's I noticed pretty fast just how much aggro I now make. <P>Before I used a peacebringer and saw how painfully tough it could be to feign off mobs in Velious. Expecially so on long battles which I would be spending half the time just trying not to die. So I too believe some sort of evade should be given to monks. <P>However it should not as reliable though as rogues, since it is their forte more so than ours, but still something to help us here. <P>I figure adding a [b]chance[/b] for evade to proc per successful feign. Something along the lines of ((feign skill - 80) / 2)% chance could be fair. Another possibility is based on level, say ((level-30) x 2)% chance. Both of these give a 60% at best to evade the mob and will be noticeable around the time they really need it (54+).<P>This would also not give any upgrade to feign pulling as the mob would still be aggro on you, so should not meet with the same resistance as making the mob simply forget as was pre-35 / FD nerf days. It would also not increase our solo ability, nor have much impact on regular grouping.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I am at it I might as well say the rest of the ideas I had for monks in general.<P>First off a minimum flying kick damage would be nice, level/2 works for me as many have sudgested.<P>Secondly, at 55 we should get a chance to attempt to flying kick twice, with the same chance (or even a lil less) as rogue's double backstab.<P>and lastly at 60 making it so the secondary hand gains the primary hands damage bonus if this is possible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

(I was in MM the other day, and lost almost 900 hit points faster than our shaman could heal it!  -  Magic attack's (Lighting spells?) are the worst!)<P>I also do agree monks should be more defensive (if they're masters of combat, why do I take 80 points of damage, and the tank next to me take 20 ...)  --   But I don't think they need to more damage (I'm very happy with the output my monk has ...)<P>Last comment, I'd like to see more monk stuff (light weight weapons and such)  --  Using hands in combat is quite frankly dumb ...

</FONT><HR>I am an old monk, I've been playing a monk since about 2 months after everquest came out.  Since that time I've tried just about every class in the game, based on the original core principle of the monk it was always my favorite class, though I havn't enjoyed it half as much as since kunark came out and Verant changed their "vision" of what a monk is.  I'm still not sure what verant's vision of a monk is currently, I'm thinking along the lines of a pathetic wanna be warrior that can't use real armor or slashing/piercing weapons but makes up for it by having feign death.<P>I read a lot of people talking about the prime of a monk's life and that deteriation.  I think every class has its different prime in life.  Like bards seem to pique very early and then taper off in power to the point where they are reduced to mana batteries and emergancy crowd control post 30.<P>Now as for the monk, the monk was always considered a late bloomer, warriors with their weapons always out damaged us up until about 30 when we started to quad attack, got flying kick and our fists got buffed.  By level 50 we were the stars of the show, and truely did hold the title of masters of melee (toe to toe), then kunark came out with its weapons and whatnot and aside from the uber rare monk ultra weapon the best monk weapons were useable by warriors, meaning there is no chance that a monk will outdamage a warrior, and with rogues weapons, they can easily outdamage us toe to toe, let alone behind the mob.<P>I just would like a response from Verant, is that too much to ask?  What is our role in the "Vision"?  Do you really think that we are accomplishing that role?<P>Suggestions, if you're not going to give us some sort of evade integrated into FD, how about increasing the successfullness of block, it would only effect monks since we are the only class that gets it?  Or if that isn't acceptable give us parry in addition to block, since we're forced to use weapons now, why can't we parry with them?<BR>In light of all the weapons in the game how about re-evaluating h2h damage tables, maybe if monks are to be balanced these tables need some adjustment..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

How about once FD gets to (200) skill it never fails and mobs never see thru frenzied or not.  Casters can still cast thru it, but melee against you will stop if you have a 200 skill in FD. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the never fail idea for FD skill of 200, regardless of frenzy.  If not given some type of evade skill, this seems like a good alternative. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This discipline lasts for 12 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the monk gains additional levels.<P>100 FIST  (Level 57): When using this discipline, the monk will be hasted (e.g. will hit much faster).  This haste stacks with every other haste in the game, including haste items and spells.  This discipline lasts for 15 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the monk gains additional levels. <P>this discipline with a traq staff is godly.<P>STONE STANCE (Level 51): When using this discipline, the monk will take roughly 1/3rd damage from most physical attacks. This discipline lasts for 12 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 12 minutes.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the monk gains additional levels.<P>wariors get the equal of all of those basicaly but we also get the abiltity to cut our taken melel damage bu 40 % for aprox 3 minits.<P>in exchange monks have the ability to outright kill a sub levle 48 opponent.<P><BR>Once again tripple atack is caped at skill level 0 so it is insignificant.<P><BR>simple fact here is you were not ballanced pre kunark. pre kunark a monk at 50 could tank as well as a war dam near. thats not correct. you could also do aprocx 50 % more damage that numebr has droepd to 25 % now wich is about right considering your pulling skills.<P><BR>I have no disagreement tha monks should get mroe wepaons available to them some are jsut to rare<P>also i agree that monks should have there flying kick given a minimum damage that would be all thats needded<P>i decent monk equiped with he top end weapons will allways out damage a war by far.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really hate seeing people use Rogues as an example.<P>Rogues are extremely handicapped until they reach level 51.  That's when they become gods.  Monks are godly up until around 53.  Monks can easily replace wars in most mid level dungeons.  Lguk,SolB for example.  Rogues can never do this. Although at 60 Rogues can push replacing wizards.<P>The few things I think Monks should get...  <P>1) Triple attack at 55 capping at 5-10 more skill points above wars at 60.  It never made sense to me why the one's taht are at one with their bodies couldn't do this when Wars could with brute force.<BR>2) Lowered time on mend at 51+ levels.  Be a HUGE benefit as the gap between War and Monk AC begins to increase.<BR>3) Flying Kick- This one is segmented into either, ors. I;d like to see one of the following.<BR>a) Min Flying Kick per Level.  Should probably be a min at 3/4 level.  Seeing a monk flying kick for 3 (for some reason the low is always 3) is just plain sad.  <BR>b) Leave Flying Kick as is but introduce a method of letting other skills be used in a combination of moves.  I think this would actually be neat.<BR>c) A Completely new move. (Although the jump kick is one of the most fun things about playing a monk).  <BR>4) Do something about FD.  There needs to be another tier or something.  The tier at 35 is reasonable but when a monk reaches 55-60 it is silly that lev 40-45 Mobs arn't forgetting/believing a Monk is truly FD.<P>Monks with adequate gear can solo up to 50 fairly easily.  With an Epic and a Fungi Hide Tunic they can solo into even higher levels and are not bound by having to med.  And being ale to bandaid 70% life at 51+ witha 200 skill is sick as well.<P>Yes they may lose what they had prior to the expansions release.  But they are still very wanted in NUMEROUS situations.  Rogues are only very useful at the high level end of the game.  I agree it is a weird way to have balance but I guess it is balance none the less.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049963-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049963.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049963-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049963-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049963-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049963-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049963&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049963&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
