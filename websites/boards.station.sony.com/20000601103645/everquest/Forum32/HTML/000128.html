&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Almost one month later, after what I have seen happen with PNP in terms of how the "playing public" are dealing with the issue, I am somewhat relieved. Verant can throw whatever new policies at the players they wish, but in the end it is the players themselves who write the rules of playability.<P>It is obvious to me that PNP has become a little pest which the vast majority of players ignore. What was working before is still working. Pro-PNPers are being blacklisted. Good.<P>A while back, someone asked me to post the name of the Guild involved with the incident I started this post with. I am revealing this information here because for the good of all who play on Xegony, I believe that the "players" need to know who to watch out for.<P>The guild's name is Royal Harmony, and the level 50 Enchanter was no other than that guild's leader, Stexxy.<P>I truly hope no other person has to experience the negativity that I had to go through as a result of Verant's oversight in the future. Good luck to you all. One month later, after 8 deaths (and 8 bubble losses), I finally yesterday turned 37.<P><BR>**** ORIGINAL POST IN GAMEPLAY TITLED - A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PLAY NICE POLICY (A TRUE STORY)****<P>This is a true story taken from an experience on the Xegony Server following the implementation of the new "Play Nice" rules.<P>Never have I seen more Guides and GM than I did yesterday. What is interesting is that they all follow a different set of "Play Nice" guidelines than has been confirmed in these boards by Abashi.<P>The day started out in the AoF room in Cazic, where I'd logged the previous session. I requested to be put on the list and intended to re-level to 36 for the 3rd time, and get through this level with some of the last fast and furious experience places available in this game. I had cleared my calendar for the day, picked up a six pack, and committed myself to play this thing out in the AoF room until I leveled to 37, or dropped from exhaustion whichever came first.<P>I was lucky to log on early this day, I was one of the first on the list, and my turn came up fairly quickly as the nightshift crew started to log. Within 4 hours, I had made my level back, and started to gain yellow into 36. All was well with the world, and I was getting to know some rather nice people.<P>All of a sudden, a Ranger outside of our group comes running through our room, Alligators snapping at his heals. These very same Alligators decided that our Wizard was a more favorable tasty treat, and proceeded to gnaw at his O-Robe. The group being loyal to its faithful blaster turned on these sewer-rats and within seconds they were nothing but Gator Meat. The Ranger was gone by this point.<P>About a half hour passes and the yellow has moved a bit more.<P>"Thank God" I'm thinking, "If I ever see another upright Lizard after this it will be too soon." A familiar flash of green runs through the room, with the growls of Gators close behind. Unfortunately, we were a little busy at the time with a couple of our own, and a few lizards. Being an Enchanter, however, the numbers matter not. Anything in my Mez range gets frozen. One by one we finished everything that came into our room within seconds, including the Ranger's newfound friends.<P>"DruidMenace says, 'If another one of my pulls gets KS'd I'm bringing my Wizzie friend in here and you are sharing the AoF spawn with me!"<P>Puzzled, my group begins to question the Ranger's logic. He maintained that we were stealing his pulls as he pulled through our room to his awaiting group. Any veteran Cazic hunter realizes the folly in doing this. Honestly, try tracking numbers in any fast and furious environment.<P>Nonetheless, the new "Play Nice" rules are in place. Luckily, I felt prepared after reading a post by Abashi, stating that these New Rules were not put into place to affect people who already had a fair system of play, like the Lists made in Dungeons. The rules were created to prevent guilds from "holding" these spawns from regular players… which is a different situation entirely.<P>Well, not according to the Xegony Guide who showed up moments later. She explained to our group that should this Ranger and his Wizard friend want to share the spawn with us, we now must set up a rotation with them. She also told me that Abashi has absolutely no say in player policies within gameplay, because it wasn't his job.<P>Enlightened, we continued to pull for experience while we still had the opportunity, until this Ranger/Wizard group showed up to share the spawn, which they did. My experience gain slowed dramatically at this point, so much so that I could barely see it move. I decide to join my Guild's Hill Giant group at this point.<P>I zone into the Rathe Mountains, passing a group of players a GM, and an Apprentice. A couple of their "say's" catch my computer screen. The GM muttering something about how much Verant understands that Hasten Bootstrutter's spawn rate was increased in length, but for good reason. "Lovely," I think to myself, I still haven't done my Jboots quest. Apathetic at this point, I chalk it up to another Nerf and decide I'll be grouping a lot more with Shamans and Druids.<P>Four hours pass, and I make a half of a bubble. My group disbands as everyone is tired I'm very close now, only a bubble left to go, and it is 2:00am EST. I decide to return to Cazic and give the AoF group leader a tell. Maybe luck is better now that people are going to bed and the servers are thinning out.<P>"You tell ShamanDude, How is the AoF room going? Situation back to normal?"<BR>"ShamanDude, this group isn't doing very well without an enchanter."<BR>"You tell ShamanDude, Enchanter for hire if you need one."<BR>"ShamanDude, Spot waiting for you."<BR>"You tell ShamanDude, OMW."<P>"Thank God" I'm thinking, in 2 hours I'll finally be safely out of this terrible level.<P>Twenty minutes later, a level 50 Enchanter shows up with her level 35 Guildmate. She is Powerlevelling her friend she tells us, and demands that we rotate the spawns with her. "Well it could be worse", I think to myself, how many lizards and gators can one druid consume at a time? Both groups proceed with their pulling for another twenty minutes, until one of ours gets "stuck" in the sewers. The group rushes out to help our puller in peril. I take my position at the end of a plank for safe distance from the MoBs to Mez. <P>"YOU have been stunned!"<BR>"You tell the group, Darnit, I've mezzed myself."<P>Puzzled, my group continues to deal with the throng on the planks where what I thought was a safe Mesmorize distance.<P>"A Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 31 points of damage!"<BR>"An Alligator hits YOU for 28 points of damage!"<BR>"A Lizardman Protector hits YOU for 27 points of damage!"<P>Shocked, I turn around to face a throng of 4 MoBs, and right behind it is the familiar Purple SMR of the level 50 Enchanter, who was standing quite still. I try to Mez this Enchanter's pull…<P>"Your spell is interrupted"<BR>"An Alligator hits YOU for 23 points of damage!"<BR>"A Lizardman Protector hits YOU for 21 points of damage!"<BR>"An Alligator hits YOU for 28 points of damage!"<P>Health going down rapidly now…<P>"Your spell is interrupted"<BR>"A Lizardman Protector hits YOU for 25 points of damage!"<BR>"An Alligator hits YOU for 31 points of damage!"<BR>"A Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 26 points of damage!"<BR>"An Alligator hits YOU for 22 points of damage!"<P>One more chance… I hit Gate…<P>"Your spell is interrupted"<BR>"An Alligator hits YOU for 29 points of damage!"<BR>"A Lizardman Protector hits YOU for 24 points of damage!"<BR>"YOU have been slain by a Lizardman Protector!"<BR>"LOADING"<P>Sitting outside Cazic, buffing myself for corpse retrieval, now 2 bubbles away from 37, I notice my group is shocked.<P>"ShamanDude says, What happened? Why did ChanterChick Die?"<BR>"NecroMan says, OMG ChanterChick I tried to Fear something off of you but there were so many!"<BR>"WarriorGuy says, The 50th Enchanter just told me she'd warned us… what was that all about?"<BR>"WizardLady says, She's upset that we're pulling from the Druid."<BR>"ShamanDude says, So that was her Train that killed ChanterChick?"<BR>"NecroMan says, It looked like that, I can't tell, she was just standing there."<P>Apathy overflowing at this point, I zone back into Cazic for corpse retrieval and don't say a word.<P>I settle back into my corner position in the room, having looted my corpse safely. Either our group has just become much larger, or we have much more company than we had previously. I'm surrounded by SMRs and Plane Armour, all bearing the same guild tag as the Enchanter and the Druid. I decide to give my level 50 Enchanter friend a tell, asking if she'd ever met this troublesome Enchanter in the past. Being of similar levels, I assume they'd run into each other at some point.<P>"You tell BigEnchanter, Have you ever met EnchanterMenace?"<BR>"BigEnchanter tells you, Yes, I couldn't stand her when I first met her. She's very full of herself and quite pushy. She can be nice when you get to know her?"<BR>"You tell BigEnchanter, Well, I just died at her feet. She's powerlevelling a guildmate."<BR>"BigEnchanter tells you, Where are you?"<BR>"You tell BigEnchanter, AoF in Cazic… trying to get through 36?"<BR>"BigEnchanter, OHHH That sucks, you lost a full bubble OMG I'm so sorry!"<P>The group starts getting edgy.<P>"NecroMan says, They've called in the reinforcements."<BR>"ShamanDude says, I'm petitioning"<P>Having had experience with the Guides and their view of the new "Play Nice" policy, I call upon my guildmate who just made 50.<P>"You tell BigNecro, If you can get a TP over here, we have a problem brewing in the AoF room and I'd really appreciate your help"<BR>"BigNecro tells you, Why? What's going on?"<BR>"You tell BigNecro, We're losing our spawn, I just got trained by another group of high levels powerlevelling their guildmate. I really don't want to die again in this level."<BR>"BigNecro tells you, OMW, BigDruid is Tp'ing me right now we're grouped. Meet me at the Entrance I've never been in AoF room."<P>"You say to the group, BRB Guys, friend of mine is coming to help I'm meeting him at the entrance."<P>LOADING<P>We zone into Cazic, and BigNecro calls a pet. <P>"You tell BigNecro, Shouldn't we invis? We have to pass through 2 rooms with full spawns to get there?"<BR>"BegNecro tells you, Naw, my pet will just kill as we go"<BR>"You tell BigNecro, Ok, I'll cast see invis on you, maybe they won't attack you at your level, I'm going invis though."<P>Sure enough, the round room flocks to BigNecro. I take a position safely from the throng and mesmorize steadily as BigNecro hacks and slashes. The throng is dead within 45 seconds. I recast invis on myself. We proceed down the final corridor until we enter the courtyard of the AoF Temple.<P>"You feel yourself starting to Appear."<BR>"You Appear!"<P>A throng of about 15 Lizardmen rush towards me. I attempt to cast mez…<P>"A Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 36 points of Damage"<BR>"You begin to cast a spell"<BR>"Your spell is interrupted"<BR>"A Lizardman Protector hits YOU for 23 points of damage!"<BR>"An Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 31 points of damage!"<BR>"A Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 27 points of damage!"<BR>"An Lizardman Zealot YOU for 22 points of damage!"<BR>"You begin to cast a spell"<BR>"Your spell is interrupted"<BR>"A Lizardman Protector hits YOU for 21 points of damage!"<BR>"An Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 32 points of damage!"<BR>"A Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 24 points of damage!"<P>BigNecro and his pet begin to advance on the MoB, which is still unmezzed. My health bar resembles a sideways thermometer which has just been dipped in Icy Water.<P>"A Lizardman Zealot hits YOU for 28 points of damage!"<BR>"YOU have been slain by a Lizardman Zealot!"<BR>"LOADING"<P>"You tell the group, Slight delay all. I should be there shortly."<BR>"ShamanDude tells the group, What Happened?"<BR>"You tell the group, Invis popped."<BR>"ShamanDude tells the group, Well there are 2 GMs here. They're saying if we don't come to some sort of agreement they will have to take action on all of us."<BR>"NecroMan tells the group, This is so unfair! These new Play Nice rules suck! I'm never going to get to level 34 now let alone level 50!"<BR>"WarriorGuy tells the group, Are they giving us a warning? One guy said we'll get banned…"<BR>"You tell the group, What the heck is going on in there???? Zoning…"<BR>"LOADING"<P>When I got to Cazic, I had less than one bubble to level. I now have 3 more to go. I loot my corpse, then cast invis on BigNecro and myself. BigNecro feels terrible. I am more than apathetic, I am considering Ebay.<P>We arrive at the AoF room. The population has now increased to about 20 players all tightly packed into one room. Indeed there are 2 GMs present.<P>"XegonyBigGuide says, If you people can't work something out, we will work it out for you and nobody will be sharing any spawn."<BR>"EnchanterMenace says, What did you call me ShamanGuy?"<BR>"ShamanGuy says, I said you were a KSer. We had the room, you came in, trained on our Enchanter and Killed her. We were fine before you got here!"<BR>"WizardMenace says, Who the hell are you BigNecro?"<BR>"You Say, He's a friend of mine."<BR>"XegonyBigGuide says, Is this true EnchanterChick? Does anyone have proof that EnchanterMenace intentionally trained on EnchanterChick?"<BR>"WizardMenace says, Who the **** are you?"<BR>"XegonyLittleGuide says, People can we watch the language please!"<BR>"You say, No. It happened too fast. She was standing there, I think she pulled but I don't know. I was helping my group from a distance when the new MoBs started attacking me."<BR>"BigNecro turns an icy glare on WizardMenace"<BR>"WizardMenace spits on BigNecro"<BR>"XegonyBigGuide says, Without proof I'm afraid I can't do anything. As for this spawn you will all have to work it out for yourselves. The new rules do not include Lists. You will just have to share the spawn. If you can't work this out between yourselves then we will take action on all of you."<P>The stream of insults continue between my group's members and the other guild.<P>"You say to your group, Guys I'm out of here… good luck but this is just stupid"<BR>"NecroGuy says to the group, I'm logging too man."<BR>"You tell BigNecro, Thanks for coming… I'm logging. I don't even care about 36 anymore. Damn I could have gone out with some friends tonight… what a waste of a Saturday."<BR>"BigNecro tells you, NP… I think I'm going to hang out for a while. Not much else to do at 50 and this is entertaining. Man are people ever stupid"<BR>"You tell BigNecro, I personally think we are all part of some huge, sick, human behaviour experiment by Verant and Sony. I feel more like a Lab Rat than a customer."<BR>"BigNecro tells you, LOL… never thought of it that way. Makes you think though… Have a good night my friend."<P>-------<P>For the Original Post: See Following Link<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/027145.html<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Life would be easier if people would learn to pull correctly...one of the finer points of pulling is controlling it.  Yeah, you will take a beating doing it, but thats what's fun about being the puller.<P>I'm sorry you had to go through that.  Just remember that not everyone on Xegony is an ass.  There are a lot of good people out there too.<P>Also, Royal Harmony was only hearing one side of the story.  Blaming the whole guild for standing up for one of its members is wrong.  Its tough not to blame them, but I would stand up for one of my guildmates in the same situation.  <P><BR>-Madrogran the Mad<BR>Officer of Mortalitas Evito</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>An Officer from Royal Harmony and I have been in extensive conversation over this issue recently. It very much appears to me now that there was a person with malevolent intent involved here (this person was in my group), as all of the pieces which I did not understand that night have come together. This person apparently has an issue with RH being a previous member, and for some reason was dismissed from RH. I will have to say that our own guild has had issues with this person in the past in terms of trust, so I find this less surprising as a result.<P>On a brighter note, A few of my guildmates and I ran into members of Royal Harmony again last night. This time, we decided to all venture for the first time into the dead side of lower guk. After an hour of organizing ourselves (which was a bit of a farce... thanx for your patience Guys), we finally arrived in Lower Guk. It was exciting for us all since we did not know what to expect, but that made it altogether a much more enjoyable experience.<P>After the fun we had with Royal Harmony last night, I for one would like to see future adventures with your guild. You are an absolutely wonderful bunch of people for the support you have given me personally from this unfortunate incident, and my guild Nexxus is grateful to you all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Royal Harmony are a wonderful bunch of people, and I would like to apologize for my misconception of this issue. It is unfortunate that people can be malicious, and decieving but we all run into them unfortunately in this game. Thank god we can ignore them for the post part!<P>On a last note, I would like to say that it's the people in this game which make it playable. Sometimes it is hard to find the gems, but they are out there  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As much as I am happy to see that we all managed to work this all out I cant help but be extremely disappointed that you felt the need to post this stuff here before you took the time to speak with Stexxy about it.To be honest it always angers me when I see people named in the discussion of any in game issue on public boards and I feel no different about this when my guild is involved.I appreciate you apologizing about it but heres my view on it.<P>You took my guilds name and a very close friend of mines name and chose to drag it through the mud on a NUMBER of different forums.I don't care how wronged you felt about this situation the bottom line is rather then take the time to sort it out you shot first and asked questions later and besmirched my reputation as a member of RH as a result.<P>The fact is this type of thing goes completely against what we stand for as a guild and what we work very hard to instill in our members we dismiss members that choose to go against our charter.So seeing this type of thing posted about us particularily when its inaccurate distresses me greatly<P>The airing of dirty laundry should not happen on message boards open for public reading as you can't take back the damage you did by spreading this issue around in the way you did.The fact is the majority of people that read this only read far enough to hear your side of the story.So now I have to work that much harder to maintain my guilds reputation as a good guild and you walk away feeling good about yourself and vindicated because you got to sound off about the situation.<P>Sorry if I sound angry but you took a shot at me when you take a shot at my guild maybe next time you won't feel the need to splash this kind of thing around before all the facts are on the table<P><BR>Tsorath Ravenspirit<BR>50 shaman<BR>Xegony<BR>officer Royal Harmony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

But again, do realize that I have also Publicly Retracted this statement, which requires a great deal of Humility that not many people have the courage to do.<P>Let me ask a question. Have You ever made a mistake?<P>Let me ask a subsequent Question. Are you humble enough to admit that mistake so publically?<P>Form whatever opinions of me that you will. However, since the positive dialogue I recieved from members of your Guild, I have gone out of my way in all of Norrath announcing how wonderful and honourable the people of your guild are, specifically Stexxy, Erlana and Benaldor.<P>Remember, this is a Game which lacks the personal expression one-on-one interaction in Real Life has. As a result, situations are open to a great deal of interpretation.<P>I was completely unaware that RH was having a problem with an Ex-Member, and to the entire Group and I, it appeared very much like there was something sinister taking place, otherwise I would not have posted to your board asking your Guild for an explanation.<P>This again, is interpretation. If what I have done is not enough to rectify any wrongdoings you feel was done to your Guild and Yourself, I would ask that you deal with me on a personal level, and not the entirety of my Guild.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum32&number=32&thisthread=000128&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum32&number=32&thisthread=000128&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
