</FONT><HR>I have posted the following to a couple of recent threads, and I believe its entirely applicable here going by the recent Warrior demands for higher taunts; also the common Warrior belief about FD pulls etc.<P>Snip...<P>"So what indeed do hybrids offer to groups? I cannot speak for Rangers or Paladins, but as a Shadowknight my perceived roles in recent groups have been:<P>Primary<P>Taunting<BR>Tanking<BR>Pulling<P>Secondary<P>Snaring<BR>Melee damage dealing<P>So lets talk about taunting first. I'm supposted to be this truely amazing taunter eh? Well I (at lv48) was in a recent group that comprised a warrior/chanter/cleric/paladin in the Dreadlands, and I was throwing at the mobs every offensive spell I had available to me PLUS Taunt and Disarm but most of the time the mob seemed supa-glued to the warrior. When I did manage to taunt off, it stayed with me for like a nano-second and was back hassling the warrior again. Honestly I felt like telling the warrior to stop hitting his taunt button so I could perform my job. The only time the mob stayed with me for any length of time was if I had pulled it. Now warriors are asking for AoE taunts, and higher taunt caps - so my one real, needed function in groups is being further eroded?????<P>Tanking. Hmmmmm, well getting the mob onto me can at times be almost impossible to do - but when I do have its attention, then WOW my red health bar sinks faster than some third-world currencies with the end result that the healer is constantly pouring mana into me via heal spells. VI reckons Shadowknights are a defensive class (i.e. able to take, not give damage) - then I'm afraid they are going to have to increase my AC, increase my defense caps, and give me more hpoints because currently I'm not designed to tank for any length of time.<P>Pulling. I do enjoy pulling (especially in outdoor zones) but even this is problematic. My pulling spells often fizzle/interrupt leading to the mob drawing out of spell casting range and me having to waste the group's time by hot-footing it after the mob. I have noticed that a single warrior armed with a bow is a far more effective outdoors puller than me with my interrupting/fizzling spells. FD pulls is something I have not yet been called onto do, but hearkening back to my own use of the spell to evade death whilst soloing - frankly I reckon that casting FD whilst pulling will be like playing Russian Roulette with a fully loaded pistol (i.e. one dead shadowknight every time)!<P>Secondary roles have been snaring runners and damage dealing. However my role of a snarer is immediately made redundant if a druid/wizard/necro is in the group because their line of snare spells overwrites my darkness. At times I have been called on to be the primary melee damage dealer, in these few cases my offensive melee damage reads like a depressing litany of constant misses and low hits that a summoned caster pet could easily exceed.<P>So the above is what I have been asked to do in groups, however I do not excel (or am even adequate) at any of them. I just seem to be this quasi-interesting looking character which really does nothing good, offers nothing particularly useful or needful, and is constantly handicapped by gimped melee, AC, spells, and being generally average at everything.<P>/sigh<BR>/em wishes she was really good at ONE useful thing"<P>Tryst, lv49 darkelven lady shadowknight<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladins and Shadowknights should be able to replace a warrior if they use their spells to full capacity. The warrior should still be able to tank better, but pal/sk have others skills.<P>Up to 50, this is pretty much accomplished.. all are desirable tanks.<P>Post 50, it's like pal/sk are wet rags compared to warriors, and forget it, rangers are like casters.<P>Why?  Because defense skills lack about 30 pts behind, and warrior armor always has more AC (compare a 50 or more AC breastplate vs a 30 for pal/sk).  Combine that with higher hitpoints from a warrior, and you get a much better tank (able to suck up hitpoints).<P>Also, pal/sk lag about 50 pts behind on offense.  Their weapons are usually pretty bad, with some exceptions. But they can't dual wield.  So the offense points reduce pal/sk output to about 40% of a warrior (when both are average equipped).<P>Pal/sk used to be able to use their stuns/dots to improve defense/offense respectively, but post 50 those are pretty much a joke. Stuns get entirely useless on all 55+ mobs (they just don't work), and shadowknights lack a simple DD for their dmg output to be improved.<P>So at this point, ALL groups would rather take a warrior over a hybrids. Is that balanced? Nope...<P>Wyrd</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not sure what you guys were reading, but uh... I read something totally different.<P>[Quote]<BR>Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for. <P>(alan's reply)<BR>Ok, that's not such a bad idea. It has it's own drawbacks built right in. I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing). But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use. <BR>[/quote]<BR>hmmm... looks like a possible add on....<P>[quote]<BR>BIND WOUNDS.... Please allow the percentage healed to increase with level. Start at 50 and by 20 let the tank be at 70% then at 30, 80% then 40 at 90% then at 50 at 100%. Do you really think it will effect balance? Heck no.. I will still be screaming for a clearic. The bind wound is nothing more for the times when you have no cleric, druid, shaman, or necro handy. <P>Well, I'm not one to advocate something that is specifically intended to improve the solo ability of any class. But I'll add it. <BR>[/quote]<P>It's on the list to discuss....not.."Forget it!!!"<P>Added to the list also..cobalt drop rates..peircing increase(but he disagrees), epic weapon concerns,noted that warriors hate disarm, iskar armor in the planes,<P>[quote]<BR>I know some folks have already voiced this here but put berserker frenzy on a timer. (maybe equal to a pally's loh or an SKs harm touch) And make it a bit more effective so that crits and crips go off a bit more. <P>(alan)<BR>Like this. I gather that the idea is to have 'berserk' as a skill (or discipline) like taunt. It would have to have a long timer, perhaps on the same scale as Lay on Hands. I'll add it to the list and see if it floats (or something like that). If it seems too powerful, perhaps we can replace one of the high level disciplines with this one. <BR>[/quote]<P>Now...the ONLY part I didn't like seeing was the part about removing invisbility from warriors...  BUT if they did that and gave me the ability to keep ultra greens from attacking me????  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  "Back off Hill Giant...I got 20 levels on you and you will just get your butt kicked"  True or not, if that giant turned and walked away???  <P>WOOOHOO!!!!!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whoah?  People are complaining that 60 Warriors are not balanced?  You have the ability to achieve great AC.  You run great HP's.  Your can cast spells.  You are needed on raids and in groups.  You have an oustanding selection of different weapons to choose from.  Unreal...<P>I can honestly say I am rather shocked at how well my level 45 Warrior performs. He can out taunt anyone while equiped with his wurmlsayer! (Just kidding oceanus).  Seriously, I am pleased with him and have been since the damage cap came off.  <P>Btw, Druids are not balanced at the high end of the game.

</FONT><HR>Personally, I am seeing this as what happened the last time hybrids were "balanced".  They recieved higher HP, better AC, and nicer weapons.  The warriors recieved...uuummmm... well a lesser uniqueness.<P>With the release of the expansions, hybrids were given weapons and armor that are not only on par with the warriors, but also easier to attain.<P>I will say that Absors responce did not surprise me.  I did not expect warriors to be given anything.  The thread was nothing but an attempt by VI to make warriors feel someone cares about them.<P>Personally, I am starting to feel like the hybrid.  My damage output is not as good as a rouge.  My AC is not as good as a monk.  And I get the bonus of having no spells.<P>I should have been a paladin.  I could have had an AC and HP comparable to a warrior AND have to be killed twice (with the use of LoH).  <P>Instread of dieing, I could have rooted the mob and stepped back to cheat heal with my Deepwater helm.<P>I could have purchased a deepwater helm of 2k pp instead of trying to get a necro to reduce the 15k price of the Cobalt Armor.<P>The warrior thread should never have been started.  I am even more depressed with my warrior.<P>I was even hoping that Absor would at least respond about my haste idea for the smaller race warriors.  As things stand, everyone might as well be an ogre warrior.  They have all the best things to make a warrior.<P>Lyenea<BR>semi retired 45 warrior<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Sorry, I've got to crawl back into my chair.  Ok.<P>Whoa bud!  We can do what?  I stopped soloing at lvl 25 or so.  pound for pound we've got the Least ability to survive a face to face encounter.  Sure we have hit points, but that isn't enough at the higher levels.  Pretty much every other class has some way to get the mob off him, and back up to heal or run.  When a warrior is backed into a corner and its fight or die, we usually take a loc so we can come get our body later.<P>Freewynd.  I don't think anyone is saying warriors aren't balanced.  As a matter of fact, the only thing I'd like to have looked at is the effectiveness of taunt.  I don't want any wild powers, abilities to sweep multiple opponents etc.  I'm very happy with what I can do.

</FONT><HR>Ok I'm one of the "other" classes, a Shadow Knight.  so to answer the original poster, what surprises me is that he openned a Warrior thead AT ALL.  <P>Every Class that swings a weapon of a living (read hybreds) wants to be almost as good as you, and almost as wanted in highlevel groups.  We know we will NEVER be allowed to be AS GOOD as you in anything.  So please, give it a rest.  Yes you would like some new things and maybe you should get a few of them.  But are you really broke in any area, NO.<P>I have yet to see any Hybred with close to a Warriors unbuffed AC or HP's.  I have a Warrior 10 levels lower than my SK and he already has just over 200 HP's less than my SK and the AC is the same.  My SK with better weapons can't do the same damage against the same MOB.<P>Just remember, we all want to be as good as Warriors someday, don't loose the bubble.  Warriors are the model the rest of us are trying to get ballanced to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
