</FONT><HR>Dwarven Grape here......<P>VI is gone insane!  Yet another nerf to the BP?  The BP is powerful yes, but VI acts like the Donal's BP grows on trees.  The BP is ultra rare on a major dragon.  The people who actually get one should have something ultra nice.<P>With the new effect, they make the arguement that you can still heal anyone else in the 7.5 mins.  Think about this.  Average party is 2 tanks, cleric, shaman enchanter, another caster type.  Out of those classes are you really goign to need to CH him them.  So the best you could every do is CH the 2 tanks.<P>You wonder why the Donal's BP is needed?  Have any of you tried killing Dain?  400000K hps able to slay entire guilds in a matter of mins.<P>Ok so what would a good effect on the Donal's BP be?  Is it the clerics fault that all VI was imagiative to give us was heal spells to use in that game?  So the only effect that could be put on our items was a heal spells.  DUH!<P>VI is using the same ole excuses that they used when they nerfed the manastone.  Something about overpowering and unbalancing.  So overpowering that the manastone effect is on a caster robe now?  <P>Leave the BP alone.   Leave the clerics alone.  We have been nerfed enough.  Mark of Karn, PoG BP cast time nerf, Donal's BP cast time nerf, Cestial Elixir nerf (CE makes it to easy to kill Trak).<P>Oh I forgot to mention our wasted 54 cleric pet!!!!!  Like the other hammer spells a waste.  600 mana for a pet that can't take ONE hit from any mob that a level 54 cleric would be camping.<P>If you want to nerf the Donal's BP, then fix the rest of the cleric problems with it.  Like the ultra rarity of all the Donal's equipment (other then the arms)  The drop rates are lame.  Fix the fact we only have one line of spells, heals. (which your are trying to give to other classes now).  Fix the "sit" ... "heal" ....."sit" necessity that the clerics have to deal with every day.  If you are going to give us a pet, make it useful.<P>In short, if you want to us to not gripe about the nerfing that you are doing, then fix some of the other things to make us happier with our class.<P>VI, you have set everyone up to fail in this game.  You want us to fail, admit it.  Failure makes us waste our time and pay you more money.  But get ready for the panic and for that 350,000 people paying you to sink, because the competion is coming.  Maybe they will actually "TEST" they stuff.<P>Of course that is my opinion, I could be wrong!<P>Darrak,<BR>55 Dwarven Grape<BR>Cohort<BR>Cazic Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My question : <P>Wasn't whoever designed the Donal's BP able to see the potential problems that are so obvious now?  Who in the world would not have seen the potential problem with making a right-clickable item cast complete heal, no matter the time in question?  The problem isn't the nerf, the problem is the introduction of the item with the complete heal, no matter the cast time.

Maybe you need to hire some people that have actully played the game to make items and test them. And I don't mean some guy that has killed the Orc Legionare in misty before.<P>Is the BP really that unbalancing?

</FONT><HR>If your going to make the Recast time on the item 7.5 Minutes, why does the Casting time have to be an insanely long 30 seconds? Why not not 10 seconds like the casting time on Complete heal is supposed to be?  Don't you see you've overnerfed the item?  Made its usefulness extremely limited?  Do you have any idea how rare this item is and how difficult the mob that drops it is to defeat?  It takes a well planned/organized raid of 36 or so people All near level 60.  The Cleric BP is one of the rarest BP's that drops off Trakanon.  And every group on a Trakanon raid has at least 1, if not 2 clerics.  To win this extremely rare Item, you have to go in a lotto with 6-8 other clerics if your fortunate enough for him to drop it in the first place, and fortunate enough to have organized a good enough bunch of people to kill this incredibly difficult mob to begin with.  <P>Verant never sees the whole picture when they do these nerfs.  But nonetheless, I like the idea of increasing the casting time through this Benficial buff technique, but for crying out loud... Reduce the casting time on the item to 10 seconds or something somewhat close to being reasonable or at all useful in a group situation.. Think of it... Its 1 extra CH for a cleric who is OOM in a group.  Don't you think a cleric who has gone through all the trials and tribulations of obtaining such an incredibly difficult and rare item to obtain should have such an ability?  1 Extra CH to save a tank every 7.5 minutes?  Its not a lot.  If you make it 30 seconds... well I'll tell you, I don't know a lot of tanks that can hold up longer than 10 seconds in certain situations (ie, high level dungeons) 30 seconds makes it pretty much useless in a combat situation, and restricted only to after combat situations when someone's health bar is not dropping at a varrying rate.  And BTW, where'd you get 7.5 minutes?  Seems excessively long.  Making it 5 minutes or even 3 minutes would defeat your worrisome acusation of 1 warrior and 1 cleric defeating any mob in the game that the warrior can survive 30 seconds with b4 the next CH.. You seem to fail to realize that every 30 seconds of combat rounds do not result in the same rolls (damage done and damage received by tank and foe) HEALTH DECREASES AT A VARRYING RATE ASK ANY CLERIC AND HE'LL TELL YOU THAT, Doesn't take into account a mob not being snared and running away to find friends to aid him, and several other factors Like a warrior running out of stamina and his AC and defensive skills being reduced causing him to take much more damage, and other factors that wouldn't make it the ideal over-powered item as you explained it.<P>Anyway.. I've rambled on enough... Hopefully you can find something to respond to in this jumbled mess of post.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you are going to nerf this item, I would hope you could at least loot at the drop rates of this and other items.  Clerics aren't asking that there is an equal drop rate as other class armors, but a percentage of those other class armors would be nice.  If Elder Spiritist Gloves (Druid) drop 3 times, and there are three times as many Druids and Clerics, then one Donal's Gauntlets (Cleric) ought to drop it seems to me.  The current estimate is one Donal's Gauntlets per month.  Not a good ratio at all compared to the number of Elder Spiritist Gauntlets in the same period.<P>And when you talk about redesigning the game, weren't the Velious top bosses designed with this item in mind?  If so, don't you need to redesign the Velious to recompensate?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If it concentrated directly on that warrior it would tear him up.<P>Maybe if you didnt constantly make mobs hit more and more and have more and more hp, in the way you changed the hitpoints to a percentange instead of 32k max the uber guilds out there wouldnt need the donal's bp to kill things of that nature.<P>Ive heard of fights lasting over 30mins on creatures that have 500k hitpoints and the only way that is possible is with multiply breast plates.<P>You think youll quietly get away with nerfing this bp your sorely mistaken.  Every and i mean ever uber guild or not even uber will be flaming you.<P>With the server popuplateion getting towards the average of 40+ or more your going to piss off all of your customers.<P>This item was already nerfd one time.

</FONT><HR>I honestly dont think the item itself is all that overpowering.  It has a high risk factor when you actually use it grouped,  as alot of things can happen when you try and cast a 30 second spell.  CH costs 400 mana in 10 seconds.  The donals BP costs 0 mana in a 30 second time period.  <P>If you take a cleric give him c2,  in most grouped situations a cleric with donals bp will have an enchanter,  and time how long it takes them to get 400 mana.  I dont actually feel like testing it but I would think it takes maybe 30ish seconds.  <P>If you are worried about the warrior/cleric example,  I dont think you really need to kill the recast time so hard.  From 0 recast time to 450 seconds.  That is a bit harsh.  You could effectively make that problem go away with a 150 second recast.  <P>Why make it a buff?  That is just gonna make the item more useless.  A recast time would be alot easier to keep up with.  If you do this,  at least make the buff decent.  +1regen?...<P>I am not surprised by this. Nor am I really angry.  Mostly just disappointed,  as have I been many times with customer service,  guides,  GM's,  and the general incompetence of VI.  Do it right the first time or leave it alone.  You are going to have alot of angry customers now,  and it could have been avoided if done right the first time.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like the effect on the BP to be something other than CHeal...or a buff with that effect...<P>If its a buff, MAKE IT A BUFF... a good one...<BR>+800hp, +40 ac, or something... something that having 2 or 3 of these in a guild raid would make the overall accomplishment of the group easier, not directly, but indirectly.  Make it stackable with ALL buffs. Downside is its another buff, upside is it would remain being useful..and in massive death situations, it would be easy to stick a manaless buff onto a new res'ee... I think of Dain in this sense, where my guild alliance throws themselves at him and most die 3-5 times, and there is no way a CH off the BP could come CLOSE to healing them in time.<P>Another option, if you want a heal, make it a NICE heal, just not Complete heal.  We currently have NO heals in between Divine Light (900) and Complete Heal which are instant casts. An 18 second, 2500hp heal would be extremely usefull... Thats about half the warriors HP at level 60, after buffs. It would at least allow us to be able to heal SOMETHING when we are oom.  Most mobs 50+ can dish out 2500 damage on a warrior in 18 seconds without a problem, therefore it wouldn't replace the spells we have mana for...just more of a downtime heal, or something to cast while waiting for next pull.<P>These make it VIABLE to want the BP for group situations.<P>Any other ideas for possible effects the BP could have?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although I suspect that the powers that be have already decided how to nerf this item (and I use the term 'nerf' with some reservations, because I agree that it is in need of a nerf), I would like to offer a somewhat different approach.  This approach is a modification of the 'leave a residual buff approach, but it is designed to fix the problem in a similar way.   The following suggesting is designed to nerf the BP spell, while leaving in an effect that will be worth overwriting the buffs (and there is no question that overwriting the buffs is to be preferred).  <P>When first cast, the spell does a GOOD amount of healing (but not a complete heal..I would suggest that it be equivelent to  Devine Light) and leaves a buff in place.  However, this buff is a proc that heals the tank for a minimal (but useful amount of damage - say a greater  heal).  We already know that spells with proc effects are possible and this buff can last for five minutes, but it should be removable.  <P>Now, the BP no longer casts the complete heal at all (and thus is not overbalancing), but it does cast an appropriately Uber effect, healing the tank substantially at the start and allowing a continuous low grade heal throughout the melee.  If the cleric wishes to continue to use it as a heal, he can do so, but he is only casting a divine light, and not a complete heal, the effect is not so unbalancing...and if he leaves it in place, it only makes his job easier, it does not make him unnecessary as the superior heal proc will not (and is not intended to) keep up the demage being dealt out by the mobs.<P>Other comments:  This spell should not be castable on under 50 characters to prevent its exploit as the ultimate PL item.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't play a cleric but I am capable of simple mathematics. Any mob that cannot kill a warrior in 30 seconds can already be killed by a 39 cleric and a warrior. There are two types of mobs in your game...those that kill warriors really fast and those that a warrior can tank. The first type are unaffected by this nerf and the second are unaffected also.<P>All you are accomplishing is negetive customer relations. I really feel someone in your organization should try to look at the entire picture before making decisions like this. You should really try to take a realistic look at the current effect of an item/ability (by which I mean actually play the game...a lot) and weigh whatever you perceive to be its negative effects against the results of a nerf both in terms of gameplay and customer relations. This is a completely unnecessary nerf and it is causing you to lose customers both voluntarily and through your own bannings. A mature organization cannot afford to behave like this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm really disapointed in you Verant. You made MoK worthless. You gave druids better buffs than us. You talk of giving them better heals. Now you nerf our breastplate.<P>You guys obviously have no idea how the high end game works. Clerics only have limited mana and when it comes to the many of the bosses of Velious our mana just doesn't hold out. We can't use 100+ people to kill these mobs because of the limitations of the game with lag. We resort to tactics to overcome...you destroy the tactics. I'm sure if lag wasn't so horrid on high end encouters we could "lemming" a mob with that many people and not worry about our mana but it isn't gonna happen.<P>If you do follow through with this atleast have the decency to fix MoK, fix the right clickable effects on our other Donal's parts (NO CLERIC USES THESE, I REPEAT NO CLERIC USES THESE), or something else instead of your rampant destruction of the cleric class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>First I considered the change to be totally justified, and believe that CH is also unbalanced and<BR>should scale in mana cost with the amount of HP healed so that the healing rate is not so ridiculously out of comparison with the others, HOWEVER, for the "300,000 people"/"trick" business -<BR>please, credit us with some shred of intelligence, do you seriously expect us to believe that you<BR>didn't nerf it because FoH was killing Kendrick's pet uber mobs with one group? The coincidence<BR>in timing is highly suspicious ;p<P>Second for the people mentioning mana regen abilities, sure, I can provide you with that.<P>Lets take two situations, first is a cleric standing still, chain clicking the BP every 30 seconds as it cycles.<P>Mana cost per hour zero, mana recovery per hour, negligible.<P>Next lets take the cleric who is medding then CHing every 30 seconds to match the first one.<P>First a few base assumptions:<BR>- spends 3 ticks medding and two ticks standing/sitting and casting the spell.<BR>- recovers 50 mana/tick normally when medding<P>That gives us 11 ( Boon of Clear Mind ) + 2 ( Gift of Brilliance ) + 6 ( Protection of Glades ) + 13 ( Cantana ) = 32 mana per tick.<P>This gives 160 mana regained from buffs per casting of CH, with the 150 mana from medding for 3 ticks, it leaves us with 310 mana regained every cast of CH.<P>Given it costs the cleric 450 mana to cast CH, then it will only be 18 casts, or 9 minutes before the cleric is fully OOM.<P>Of course, in this situation you are actually sucking a substantial amount of mana out of other people to sustain this. With gift of thought at 300 mana/33 minutes, gift of brilliance at 450mana/100 minutes<BR>and protection of the glades at 1200 mana/ 100 minutes, over the course of two hours you are consuming<BR>3000 mana from other classes, as compared to zero from the first situation. Not to mention the fact that<BR>having the above buffs actually quadruples the number of people required ( cleric vs cleric/bard/enchanter/druid ).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
