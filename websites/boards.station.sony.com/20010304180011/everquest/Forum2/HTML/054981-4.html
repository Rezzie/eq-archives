</FONT><HR>jzero, Shaman and Druids can do far more than Clerics in this game... They have way more "Goodies" that Cleric.  If all else fails, you can solo.<P>Clerics are and always were considered THE HEALER, and BEST HEALER.  If you started a druid thinking you'd be as good... You fooled yourself...  What's this thing about, "I Expect"...  Get with the program, look at what's the evolution of your character....  Most people that played a druid, wasn't because they were healers... but because they were powerfull...  (Is said most, not all).  And now, they come back whining that at high lvl... Lo and Behold...  Soloing is Tedious, and not as fun... Hmmm...  Clerics have been complaining about things being tedious for How man lvl's by then ?  hehe... too funny...<P>If you want a REAL Healer, the Cleric has always been it.  If you play a Druid/Shaman, from my views and the "Guilds" I have been part off... They were never considered THE Healer for any raids, and it's never been a "Frustration"... cause they knew.  Druids/Shaman whining just want to change the balance so that they can fit into a spot meant for someone else... Ya, Clerics still have it better that you...  But what do Cleric get in exchange to that ?  I'm really curious to know...  Cause that is the Outrage Most clerics are having right now...  They are getting the shaft...  You two are more group friendly now, is there anything that could help Clerics being more Independant... ?  Or would that be bad ?  think...  If Clerics wern't Stuck to HAVE To group, Druids and Shaman that want to would have it easier... and some Clerics that get frustrated in being in groups could some time go on their own...  If There are balances done in one directions, why not give some balance in the other ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Would it bother wizards if clerics were given Lure of Lightning?"<P>Apples and oranges, my friend.  Clerics already have potent nukes.  Their level 44 does, what 535 damage?  The wizard nuke of the same level does only 625 tops; our Draughts start at level 51 (Fire) for 643 damage.  Our 44th "lure" (Enticement of Flame; Velious) does 360 damage for the same mana that Conflag (625 damage) uses, and is still resisted heavily on MR MOBs.  I shudder to think the waste of true Lures.<P>Anyway, to the person whining that "clerics are the most boring class in the game:"  shaddup.  Every other casting class can make exactly the same claim, for the same reasons, if they use the same BS selective functions you would use:<P>Wizard: sit, med, stand, nuke, sit, med, stand, nuke, ....<P>Magician: sit, med, stand, /pet attack & nuke, sit, men, ....<P>Dr00d: sit, med, stand, buff | heal | nuke, sit, med, ....<P>Necro: sit, med, stand, pump, sit, med, ....<P>Enchanter: sit, med, stand, mez | blur | stun | buff, sit, med, ....<P>(Let's do melee!!!)<P>Warrior: stand, /assist | /attack, /taunt<P>Paladin: stand, /assist | /attack | heal | LoH, /taunt<P>Ranger: stand, /assist | /attack, die, res, stand, ....<P>Monk: pull, feign, attack, pull, ....<P>Bard: mana song, buff songs, superagro, frantic cleric, mana song<P>Shadowknight: stand, /assist | /attack &| Darkness, /taunt, ....<P>Shaman: sit, med, stand, /slow | buff | heal, sit, ....<P><BR>Geee, I guess every class is boring.

</FONT><HR>This is pretty simple if your going to allow druids and shamans healing upgrades so that they can compete with clerics for groups.Then why not give clerics the ability to compete with druids and shamans in solo areas seems fair to me. I mean we are talking balance right  where every class has a fair shot.Ill wait for the cleric upgrades to see what happens but anything less than the shared ability to compete solo with the druids and shams will prob not cut it in my book.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm a 55th cleric and the proposed changes worry me. I agree that druids and shaman should be viable healers and secondary to a cleric in that regard.<P>I'm not worried about uber mob encounters. For those every class is needed and useful. Where there be dragons, you'll want the best debuffs and PR/DR buffs from shamans, the best AC and hp buffs and heals from clerics, and the best RC/RF buffs and regens from druids not to mention their awesome travel spells to get you there.<P>My concern is with the whole group and what will be most desirable in regular, grind-type, play. I don't think it's hard to see that it is possible a group would be more well rounded if it took a level 55 druid and a level 55 shaman over 1 level 55 cleric, with the proposed changes. You certainly wouldn't want all 3 if the other 2 can keep the party alive.<P>Absor, you said you thought a shaman and a druid should be able to take the place of a cleric in a group. If that were reasonable, why have clerics at all except for the very highest of encounters?<P>FWIW: I spent about 3 hours last night at the Jail in Seb with 2 rogues, a monk, a enchanter and a druid. I cast about 2 divine lights all night and they weren't even close to being life-threatening. The only thing else I cast were stuns for gaters and roots when the enchanter was being absent-minded. I have no doubt the group would have been equally safe with a shaman in my spot if both the druid and shammie could have cast remedy. And with a shammie debuffs, buffs, speed, and pet it might well have been more effecient.<P>So my question is, if my guess is correct and that group last night would have been just as safe, more effecient and had started before I got there, what the heck would I do?<P>If clerics aren't 'needed' in a group, and I mean NEEDED, not just preferred, clerics don't play. It looks like we'll find out just how necessary we are.<P>Derenath<P>P.S.

Clerics are also innately better healers than any other class. They will heal more hit points with the same spell than any other class (they have a built in bonus on all their healing)."<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Fair enough...  Then give Clerics some form of SoW many levels after a Druid.  Heck, don't make as fast as SoW either, make it the same speed as JBoots for all I care.  Give Clerics some sort of teleport spell (to their temple is a good idea) many levels after a Wizard/Druid gets some of their port spells.  Druids and Shaman get a wide variety of utility spells to choose from, making them much more flexible in group situations as well as solo.  If we get a SoW spell, or a teleport spell (to our home temple) then make the mana cost twice that of other class spells.  This way Druids and Shamans will be innately more mana efficient in this area.  You see, the same thing that you say about Clerics can be said about Druids/Shamans if you flip it around.  And it is all valid too.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;To be honest, I could care less what you gave Druids/Shaman.  But give us Clerics something!!!

</FONT><HR>Verant has unfortunately lost sight of a major part of the game. There are THREE combat healing classes, not one. By making Shaman and Druid post-50 healing have both high fizzle and L34 Cleric volume, the two other classes intended to be combat healers... aren't.<P>This deficiency is mitigated by other spells in Shaman and Druid inventories -- the Shaman Slow line and Druid Damage Shields. Shamanic Slow acts as a healing aplifier... it reduces damage taken and therefore reduces the amount of healing necessary, hopefully to the point the Shaman can keep up with damage taken. In the post-50 game (where the healing issue has been a problem), Turgur's is incredibly powerful... usually. (Especially when a Cleric IS in the group. Shamans amplify Cleric healing incredibly.) It's that usually that is the problem. Where high magic resistance applies, Shaman healing is effectively at a level of a L34 Cleric. Without Turgur's, a Shaman watches in vain as his tanks die.<P>Druidic damage shields directly act to reduce MOB HP at the cost of damage taken. It isn't as effective as Shaman Slow (DS shortens fights to reduce damage taken vs. Shamans reducing damage directly) for translating into reduced healing, but it is unresistable, at least. The real problem is that post-50 MOB damage rises on a different scale from pre-50, and the linear DS damage output becomes overwhelmed the further you get from L50. So, the DS simply becomes overwhelmed and does not act to reduce time-to-kill noticably enough to affect the amount of healing required. Thus, the Druid is a L34 Cleric, under any situation after L50.<P>So, that means there is, in fact, only one combat healing class, where pre-50 there were 3. This translates directly into a major group dynamic problem: every 6 person group must have a Cleric, not matter how risky the eventual destination. That now requires that 1/6 of all players play clerics, regardless of target difficulty.<P>Given that Clerics are already necessary in any post-50 situation where someone expects to die (for resurrection line), the addition of better healing to the other combat casters will not affect many groups: a Cleric is, and always will be, necessary in a risky dungeon raid. There is simply no change on that front, no matter how good Shaman and Druid healing becomes.<P>The question is: should they also be mandatory in every non-risky situation? Should a Cleric be required if you want to camp the Chardok exit/entrance or Iksar Betrayer hall? Sebilis entrance? Skyfire? Karnor's corners? I think the simple answer here is no, clerics should not be mandatory in every group in every situation. There is no class in the game that can claim that need (even enchanters can't say it), so how can Clerics expect that kind of special treatment?<P>All Verant is doing with these changes is allowing those classes that were combat healers pre-50 to regain that status, for limited situations. The Cleric will always be the favored healing class for any dangerous (and profitable) dungeon raid, for their irreplacable ability to mitigate experience loss. That form of healing is inviolate and alone ensures the Cleric's position.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The thing is that Verant has already set its mind to giving Druids and Shamans the healing power up so no matter what any cleric says for or against the issue it'll be a moot point coming from a cleric.  Only druid and shamans can comment on whether the healing power up is adequate to get them back up to being a healing class that they are.  But, the thing is, druids and shamans are getting the healing pouwer up, but clerics in exchange will get absolutely nothing in return.  I can easily think of a few things that would not unbalance the cleric class or the game if given to clerics.  Spells like Levitate, Invisible, See Invisible, Endure Breathing... even a self only invis+see invis would be perfectly fine.<P>Someone argued that clerics are the masters of killing undead... that's very untrue.  Necromancers have the exact same spells used against undead, not to mention many more damaging spells.  Wizards, druids, magicians as well have nukes that do MORE damange to undead than any spell a cleric would cast.  Clerics will not get any power up to make them the single master of any kind of damage to anything.<P>Clerics are only looked at to heal and buff (AC and hps only) in groups, that's _all_ (even though there are rare times clerics can do other things like ITU or nuke).  <P>Druids are looked at for GGs, damage shields, hp regeneration (they are kings here with the ability to group regen), invis/see invis, buff, snare, DoT, nuke.  <P>Shamans are looked at to slow , malosi (basically any needed debuff), many variety buffs, invis/see invis, DoT, regen to a lesser degree.<P>Fun game spells that druids and shamans have:  beneficial illusions and some way to regain mana.  Clerics:  in practical terms, none.<P>Shamans get to summon pet and can melee. Druids get a small pet that sticks around.  Clerics get a DoT pet that casts for 600 mana so is never used.<P>In the everyone-is-all-and-already-60-and-doing-raids game, it doesn't matter when druids and shamans get their new heal spells btw, only that they are getting it.<P>So in the end, clerics are basically looked at as the base healer, just as warriors are looked at as being the base melee.  Clerics will not get anything other than heals, ac and hp buff to benefit a group.  Druids and Shamans have much more variety of spells that are used and now will have the heal power up to get them back where they belong as a healing class.  Live with it clerics, you are only meant to CH, group heal, and hp/ac buff in groups.  As the base healing class, clerics do not get "fun" spells, clerics do not get good damange spells (no good damage to mana ratio or DoTs), clerics do not get utility spells... that's the Verant way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

What is a cleric supposed to do when they cannot get a group?  Solo?  hahaha<P>Making Druids and Shaman (who can do everything already) efficient enough healers that Clerics will be needed less is just plain wrong.<P>I decided to play a class that was boring, one-dimentional, and with little to no solo abilities for one reason and one reason only... I would be needed and wanted everywhere I go.  I would never have a problem finding a group. <P>Now, you are lessening the one benifit of being a cleric by making druids and shaman effective enough tot replace us in most situations.  <P>What you have failed to see is that a druid or a shaman were already effective enought healers if (IF) they would specialize in alteration, then do nothing but heal and med.  Heal and med, Heal and med.  If that did that, they could substitute for a cleric (IF THEY PLAYED LIKE A CLERIC HAS TO).  <P>Now, all you have done is make them effective enough healers that they can replace the cleric as well as nuke/dot/debuff/snare/slow and travel.<P>Yet, the cleric is left with what?  Sit around shouting "Cleric LFG!" while being ignored by all with a druid or shaman until the need a rez ofcourse.  <P>Give us 80% of the druid and shaman abilities and we would not have a problem with you giving 80% of our abilites (or ability, cause lets face it, we have one ability post 30, keep people alive) so we would have options when we could not get a group.<P>Now, you are taking away some (alot!) of the desire to have a cleric, yet giving the cleric no compensation for the fact that they now will be less needed than before!<P>I've see all the comments saying that this will not make clerics less needed.  You beleive that?  You make it so two other classes can do the one ability that a cleric has to offer, almost as good as a cleric, and then can say with a straight face that this will not make clerics less needed?<P>If clerics could TP almost as good as Druids and Wizards, would that not make Druids and Wizards less needed for TP's?  If a cleric could mes almost as good as a chanter, would that not make a chanter less needed? <P>How can you say making druids and shaman heal almost as good as a cleric, not make a cleric less needed?  And what are we supposed to do now that we've spent a lifetime playing the most one-dimentional, boringest class in EQ when we cannot get a group?  What do you suggest a 47 cleric that cannot get a group do?  What do we have to offer if we cannot be the healer?<P>What are you going to tell all the clerics that suffer through their lives playing the most boring, most one-dimentional class just so they are the most wanted class (and that is because they are willing to play the most boring and one-dimentional class without complaint) now that you have eliminated some of that need?<P>You stink Verant.  Risk vs Reward means nothing.  Making choices (do you want to be the most wanted class in a group but the most boring? Play a cleric.  Do you want to be the best soloer, the most exciting class to play, but less needed in groups?  Play a druid.) means nothing. <P>You are rewarding the Druids and Shaman for playing exciting, solo classes by making them more group friendly, and punishing clerics for playing boring, non-solo classes by making then less needed.<P>You stink with a capital S!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The quality of the pro-druid and shaman responses pretty much condemns their cause.  Gimmme Gimmme Gimmme Gimmmme....I see the type all of the time - Start out begging for Platinum at level one and after solo camping there way to level 50 are worried about grouping.  <P>I play both a cleric and a druid.  Started the druid since a cleric is simply the pits prior to high levels.  Play the cleric for about 10 minutes a day now .... No group, go play the druid.  No group, TP over to a different spot and check, No group Solo.  Yes, as a druid I would like to see my healing improved...really would like SHeal at 44 or even 46.  And as a cleric I see no problem with that really.  The fizzle rate problem would be fixed by about 51 anyway.  <P>But once druids and Shamans get the most commonly used heals (chloroblast) at very high levels, then the need for clerics WILL drop off.  That is what has been asked for by all of the druid whiners: "Mommy make it so I don't need a cleric in a group cuz I wanna play."  Lets face it, 2 Shamans due to AC and Slow are, in most encounters, actually better than a cleric...except their heal spells fizzle a lot.  Drop the fizzle rate and the problem is gone.  <P>Druids will not ever be a great group healer.  Not enough Hit Points or AC...unless they get much better armor that is.  So why not just start giving better AC to druids also...in fact, combine the classes.  Just call them Ubers.  But what they can be is spoilers.  People WILL try to fit them in the clerical role.  And clerics will NOT get as many groups.<P>And so there will be less clerics.  Damn, now I can't get a rez..."ummmm, Mammmmmma!  I gotta have rez too to play."  The circle does not end.

Its nice to have when you need it, but .05% of our play time definitly should not define our class.<P>For those of you who say "this isnt even in production yet. how can you complain?".  Wow, could you imagine if we waited until production then started complaining and it got removed/nerfed?  How mad would the shamen and druids be then?!?  Now is definitly the time for discussion.<P>My cleric is bound outside sebilis.  I log him, and try to find a group inside.  If I dont, I log and play my necro.  Why?  A cleric needs a group to heal in order to play everquest.  It is pretty difficult for a cleric to travel, its not even worth the run over to karnors, when there probably wont be any available groups there either.  Can a druid/shamen say the same?  If a druid can find a group, they can solo or farm.  I see 50+ shamen and druids soloing all the time in BW or SkyF or even TT.  Clerics need a group to play everquest, and now I am being made less needed in that group.<P>You say that clerics will always be most wanted in a group as a healer.  I would agree.  But then should I /ooc 54 cleric lfg, drop your shamen or druids cause I am a better healer.  No, can you see how stupid that sounds?!? <P>There are now 3 times as many people as before able to perform my ONLY class defining ability. Granted they cannot do it as well as me, but they can do it sufficiently. And since this is the only ability that gets me into a group, that means my odds of getting a group are now cut in third. Please note that this change would make a lvl 49 shamen or druid able to heal a caster just as well as a lvl 49 cleric. period.<P>Alan ( Absor ), you are always saying how you think that blurring the distinctions between the classes is a very bad thing, yet you say that you think that this is the right thing to do?  <P>I would suggest to you, that if you want to make druids and shamen more viable in post 50 group situations, give them spells more in line with there OWN class defining abilities.  Why infringe on other classes if you dont have to?  this is a magical world in which you (and yours) are the gods, you can do anything! think outside the box!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Give shamen some cool new "shamen" spells. Make their DoTs better, make their stats mean something.  make stats have drawbacks so you can do this (eg higher stamina = more hp but less atk?)<P>give druids some cool new "druid" spells.  Like great damage sheilds (er..) or better dots (er..) or better DDs (er..)..  <P>You can find something for them if they need a bone.

</FONT><HR>I think one thing that kinda upsets us clerics is the fact that, below 50, druids dont even need a group. Sure, they are "healers" but for the most part druids arent healing anyone but themselfs in the rare occasion that something they are quad kiting actually gets close enough to hit.<P>Now in the 50+ game, they have decided kiting isnt getting them their phat lewt so they want to become a healer again ;p<P>Is it that the Kunark and Velious guards arent as easy as the dwarf and gnome guards they have been protecting the forest from?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Or perhaps the phat lewt isnt as easy to farm as old world lewt?<P>This is all meaningless anyway.

</FONT><HR>I need to point this out, because it's painfully obvious to me, but I guess not to the people who keep saying it.<P>You say "There aren't enough clerics, but there are plenty of druids and shamans" so you want the druids and shamans to be the healers.  And why aren't there enough Clerics?  Because clerics do 2 things.  *2* things.  We heal.  We buff.  Period.  No one wants to be a 2 trick pony.  We can't solo at all except against super low blues, and even then it's risk.  You say a wizard is boring to play?  You can solo easily.  It might be very efficient, but you can solo 3 things at once without a problem.  Those of us who play clerics play them because it is what we like to do.  We like to group, we like to heal, and we like to buff.  <P>And what buffs do we have?  We have a grand total of 3 buffs.  HP/AC, AC, HP (if you're willing to spend 11pp per cast).  We're the best buffers?  You tell me that you would rather have a Cleric AC/HP that is 400 HPs and 20 AC (Heroic Bond) as compared to the Druid AC/HP buff that is 450 HP 24 AC and a 6 per tick mana regen (Protection of the Glades).  Don't like seeing a level 52 clerc spell compared to a level 60 druid spell?  Well, guess what, our level 52 buff is our BEST buff.  Fortitude lasts 2 hours, but it's only 340 hps and 17 AC.  Ok then, we'll compare our best buff to the second best druid buff.  once again, 400 hp and 20 ac for clerics.  400 hp 20 ac and a 4 point per tick regen for druids.  Wow, which would you prefer?  <P>I have no problem with Shamans getting some new heals, but the two most powerful solo classes have always been Druids and Necros.  Now you're making Druids the 2nd best group healers and buffers.  Wow!  No wonder 40% of all people play druids on my server. <P>Call this class envy, because that's exactly what it is.  I can't SoW, I can't port, I can't damage shield, I can't DoT, I can only MR base nuke (and very inefficiently at that), I can't snare, I can't debuff, I can't slow, I can't SOLO!  I can heal, I can buff, and occasionally I can rezz.  I'm envious because my livelihood is threatened.  A cleric is nothing without a group, and you have made it so that a Druid and a Shaman working together is much better than a Cleric and a Druid or a Cleric and a Shaman.  Yes, we are the best "uber-raid" healers, hands down, but how much time do people actually play where they're fighting gods?  I'm still fighting in regular groups with single and double pulls, and frankly, with Druids having Remedy, AC/HP buffs, damage shields, and a 33 per tick regen, what group would need me for single pulls?  <P>And for those of you who say "Complete healing is the best heal in the game" need to play a cleric for once.  Celestial Healing (which, by the way, doesn't stack with DoTs...including poison and disease, which makes it a situational heal) and Remedy and by far the best 2 heals to cast.  Sure, with a 5k health Warrior you can afford to wait 10 seconds for the heal to go off, but with lesser tanks and casters, you always cast Remedy.  3 seconds, 440 hps, all for 175 mana.  It's the most efficient single shot heal there is (Divine Light has a slightly better hp/mana ratio, but it fizzles too much to use).<P>/rant off<P>Now in a much more laid back response...  Clerics don't need to be monopoly healers for groups, but that's what Verant made us.  To make up for the lack of healing, other classes got other spells.  The gap between a Cleric in a group and a secondary healer in the group was large.  On the flip side, the difference between a cleric solo and a secondary healer solo was also large.  Clerics just can't solo.  We can take on 1 light blue and go oom against is, then wait an hour to med, then take another light blue.  Now the group aspect has narrowed, but the solo aspect has grown (because now they can heal themselves more efficiently while soloing).<P>Ah well, no biggie.  I'll still play my cleric and still love it.  When the group dynamic changes so that people are asking for druids more than they're asking for druids, then it will be time to make a new twink to waste my time with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can somebody get the Crack pipe out of Absors hands and tell him to go spank some programmer for feeding him BS.  I have never seen a clerical bonus to heals.  a heal is 100hp it is 100hp for cleric, druid or shaman.  Greater heal heals 300hp it heals 300hp for cleric,druid or Shaman.  Whats the diff clerics get it at 24 and druids/shammy at 29.<P>AT LEVEL 34 CLERICS BECOME THE BEST HEALERS.  prior to that they are even to druids and shammys 50% of the time.  Except during that 50% knowledgeable groups want healers that can SOW.  So everyone that says clerics always get a group need to sit on thier butts for an hour waiting for one cause they have no choice.<P>Clerics get a total of 146 general spells plus imbues of which each cleric can use one.  Wizzies are the only ones worse they get 135 general spells 12 ports 7 evacs and 1 imbue. hmmm Druids 161 general spells 21 ports 2 imbues.<P>All clerical combat spells save vs magic the highest resist rate in game.  Our best AE nukes we get 10 levels after Druids do.<P>Our undead ability Directly Mirrors Druid vs Summoned dd ability spell for spell.  In the case of a Druid they are an unused sideline. In the case of a cleric we have to hunt opportunities to use them since they are the best damage spells we have.<P>I wish all the trolling idiots that have never played a cleric tried it to level 29 where you get your first no xp rez.  Then tell me how "balanced" they are.  Clerics pay through the nose with the worst abilities of any class so they can Rezz and heal and are needed post 40.  Do not mistake Needed with Balanced!!<P>The information is out there go look at it.  Starting with the Cleric 1st level dd costs 12 mana where the Druid/ Shammy costs 7.  Hmm blinding light costs the Shammy 7 mana and the cleric 12mana. They both have minor heal.  They all heal the same until level 5 when the cleric gets his upgrade.  then at 9 druids and shammys are back even with the cleric in healing plus have utility.<P>I have nothing but respect for anyone that has taken a cleric out of the level 14 to level 34 black hole of waiting for groups med and heal.<P>"For those who understand no explanation is necesary, for those who dont no explanation is enough"--- Rollie Free<P>Tfodthog Tmfof<BR>Battlehammer Cleric<P>BTW I am for improving the healing of druids and shammy in the late game but there are some serious issues of balance for clerics that need to be addressed.

</FONT><HR>Ok, first let me get this off my chest.  Clerics are not the undisputed masters of killing undead.  Nor should they be.  For a test, take one Necro, and one Cleric and send them out to battle undead, and see which one fairs better.  Necros have the EXACT same undead line of DD spells that Clerics get, and a HOST of others, DoTs, Pets, debuffs; abilities galore.  Necro's are, and SHOULD BE the undisputed masters of undead.  That they are almost as good at killing the living is equally right, as death, in all it's aspects, is their stock and trade.  Anyone that thinks different, probably doesn't have enough information on which to base their opinion.<P>Second, somone earlier in the thread had it right.  It is not that clerics have no definition, but that they are too narrowly defined that is the problem.  There are really only 3 classes that are this way, Warrior, Wizard, and Cleric.  All three are utterly dependant on grouping, without a group, each might as well camp.  For my part, I see any encroachment on their respective roles, as a severe disservice to the respective class.<P>That Paladins and Necro's encroached upon the Clerics domain, by getitng Res type abilities, is unconscionable when the Cleric was given nothing in return, say better Defence and Dodge caps (from the Paladins strong area) or more some form or DoT ability (from the Necro's strong area) strengthend the Pals and Necros at the expence of the Clerics' very very narrow definition.<P>Not that Shaman and Druids are given more to allow them to encroach upon the Clerics' domain of Healing, what are we to do?  We continually get weaker and weaker with respect to the doling out of our areas of strength, given our very very narrow definition.  If you're going to make other classes good at the ONE thing that Clerics do well, by Gum, give us something else that we can do!  If you're going to give Clerical abilities to other classes, then by Golly, give some of the abilities of those classes to Clerics!<P>If you seriously think that Clerics are able to do things other than Heal, take one Cleric, one Druid, and one Shaman, and send them out to kill something.  Anything.  Living or dead, doesn't matter.  Which one will fair better?  If you seriously think that a level 40+ Cleric can tank, you need your head examined - to be honest, this holds true for Druids and Shaman as well, but they have other abilities that allow them to work around it, whereas Clerics don't.  If you honestly think that a level 40+ cleric can even HIT something with either 1hb or 2hb, you need to put the crack pipe down - again, this holds true for Druids and Shaman as well.<P>This is the problem and the fear that most of the Clerics are expressing on this board.  If you're going to make Clerics completely dependant on grouping, then make the Cleric class irreplaceable.  Clerics were not necessary to groups until 34.  They weren't even DESIRED, as a Shaman or Druid could do so many other things as well as healy slightly less well than a Cleric.  By Gosh, i love Shaman and Druids, they are really cool classes which several of my friends play, but should these changes allow them to displace me in the upper tier game the way they were CONSTANTLY able to in the low and mid tier game, I may as well hang it up, and bring it out only for ressing my other chars when they die.<P>This is just my 2 coppers worth, your mileage may vary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
