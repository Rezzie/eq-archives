If you can't keep your long time players content or at least interested, what purpose is there. I have left. Changes like the mana stone, Jboots, Donal's, Twig etc.. are not our fault. <P>Please tell me why I would sit in game for months trying to obtain a donals BP or setting a goal to obtain an item only to have it rendered useless later?<P>Please explain how upsetting 90% of your subscribers is for the betterment of the game?<P>Please explain why this type of "nerfing" goes on<BR>and how it has gotten better since beta trials?<P>I want you to reverse the table here. You sit on this side as a regular player and after 2+ years playing, seeing your character / items / spells being changed for the worse, how exactly you would feel. Items that need to be chnged should be left alone, and any new drops should be changed. It's absurd that VI demolishes a persons hard work and expects to keep a paying customer.<P>--Asus--<BR>60 Cleric<BR>Afterlife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, the changes you have made to the cleric class and healing in general are *NOT* making this a good game. They are driving people away in droves, and totally removing the FUN to the game.<P>My guild has already lost 3 of it's longest-term and best clerics over this. Yes, you heard me right, 3 of the hardest core paying customers, clerics, have quit specifically over these changes. Why? Cause they're sick of dying all the time, seeing every little thing they can do be made vastly more difficult, and are sick of loosing mass XP on any large guild raid.<P>The stated reason for this particular nerf is rather silly. Practically any mob that anyone of sufficient level to even get these BPs, especially the quest ones, is going to do vastly more damage than 300pts every 6 seconds. Heck, to get the skyshrine or kael breastplates, you have to be hunting in Temple of Veeshan, where average roaming mobs are significantly tougher than Trakanon. Do the people there really think that 300hp every 6 seconds, at the expense of keeping a cleric doing NOTHING else but chaining this on one person is going to make one iota of difference against a mob that quads for 600?<P>In earlier threads, you asked that we play with these nerfs before we condemned them. We have. They have literally ruined the high end game. For example, the wurms in the testing halls in the Temple of Veeshan. Practically every single time we fight one of these, we literally loose half to 3/4 of our healers. On one mob. And yes, we've tried to work around the aggro. Nothing much helps. How is it "fun" to have to resurrect half your healers, wait for them to get mana, get them rebuffed, and have an entire raid sit on it's collective rear end for 20 minutes after each fight? Frankly, it's not.<P>That's just one example, not even the most extreme. Lets take something else, like, say, the Statue of Rallos Zek. Here is a mob that duals for 1250, and hits once every 2-3 seconds. (never timed it specifically, but he hits fast). The primary tank, at best, with absolute max buffs, is going to be at 6khp, if that. With Defensive, this Warrior can barely take 2 rounds of hits from the Statue. This means that 6 seconds into the fight, if you want this tank to live, he must get complete-healed. Thus we must start a CHeal on this tank before we even charge the mob. Given the new way hate works, it is IMPOSSIBLE to build up enough hate to save that cleric. Yes, it might be possible to COH them, but that's not a guaranteed aggro clear, and timing all that is iffy at best. Now, given the power of this mob, the only way to keep the primary tank alive is rolling complete heals, hitting every 4-5 seconds or so. However, any clerics doing this, are of course building up far more aggro than that tank can generate, especially with the changes to proc aggro, and the damage drop with defensive. So what you have, is a situation that by it's very nature is set up for massive cleric death. Combine that with the fact that this mob has oh, 200k-300k hp, and you have a mob that has become functionally impossible to do.<P>Velious was put out with high end mobs balanced based on multiple donals usage, original heal aggro, etc. Healing has thus been drastically nerfed. Yet none of these mobs have been adjusted one iota to make them easier. Indeed, as posted by someone else, several have been made HARDER, including at the very least dragons in Sleepers, and now Yelinak. If these encounters were "balanced" before, and now you have drastically nerfed the ability to heal, by what standards can they be considered "balanced" now? What has actually happened is that several of these mobs have moved into the ranks of the "totally unkillable", and no one bothers any more. You've thus completely removed a large percentage of the high level game from the very people you intended it for.<P>Yes, some of the changes on test might help. They shouldn't be necessary though, as the changes never should've been made in the first place. The Donals nerf I can kind of see, but not the aggro nerf nor the CE-casting BP.<P>-Arlos the Disciple<BR>Grandmaster, Nameless<BR>Legacy of Steel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A level 60 Cleric’s perspective on why his brothers and sisters are calling it quits…<P>No one likes to be under the knife, especially when that knife is wielded by Verant and continues to cripple us[Cleric] more and more every patch. When was the last time we were improved, even a small amount? We had something like an 8-page thread when the class balances posts were on this board… yet not one improvement to our class yet(and I’ve seen improvements to other classes based on those posts, why not us?). Or are you playing the “lets really NERF them, then give them a small improvement and they’ll be grateful!” game?<P>Another reason we are heading for greener pastures is, well, toys… Yep, toys. Just like everyone else that plays EQ, we like to get toys once in a while. By toys I mean items that improve our class, things you hear about and say “I gotta have that!” It gives some a reason to play, personal goals and such. Well, if you’re a Cleric then all you have to look forward to is more spells that anyone your level can get. All of our “toys” have been taken away or reduced to complete uselessness. With the changes to the high-end BPs that I had access to, and their (now)complete ineffectiveness… there’s nothing separating me from any other level 60 Clerics who’s never seen half the zones I have. How do you think melee classes would react if they logged into their Cloak of Flames only being a 10% Haste? That’s what you’re putting us through, weekly almost.<P>You could of at least had the decency to mix in a few class-improvements these past few weeks, but instead your soul focus was trying to make as many Clerics quit as possible. Congratulations, you’ve succeeded in making ever 55+ Cleric hate you and, most likely, their associated guilds as a result of them quitting.<P>p.s.

</FONT><HR>I said it earlier, and Arlos went thru in detail how dumb this is.  Verant, you can not make uber mobs and decide to make them unbeatable.<P>You can also not equip players to take on these mobs, then get upset because everything else that's not a uber mob gets slaughtered without effort.<P>It's not a balance issue here.  Verant, you are simply wrong, and as it was said earlier, you're acting like a snot nosed, sniveling little child trying to GM a D&D game, then throwing a fit becuase your players beat you.  <P>HELLO?  We're not playing this game to beat you Verant, we're playing it to have fun.  Killing monsters is part of that fun, as it gives a feeling of accomplishment.  Get off your high horse and stop acting like a spoiled brat whenever a uber guild finally figures out a way to bring death to your newest unbeatable creation.<P>Well, Verant's time is now limited, as it is only a matter of time that the competition lays waste by releasing their newer games.  These people have it much easier, as they can watch Verant and see exactly what not to do.<P>It's just a game Verant, so why make it next to impossible to play?  We know what you're trying.  You're trying to make the game unbeatable in a attempt to keep that massive player base.  You think if they can never beat it, they will stay longer trying to do so.  Well, let you in on some news, what you are doing by making the game this unbeatable, is driving away your customers.  You must think we are all morons or something.  We're not the stupid sheep you think we are.  Yes we might be paying to play your precious game, but re and more are canceling, and even more are planning to cancel.  We're just bidding our time till our new addiction is released.<P>BTW, don't even think Star Wars has a prayer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is the first game I have ever seen that made changes in this direction.  Usually a patch is to correct coding or add features to a game.  Not to take away something that the company was to stupid to catch that they actually made a feature.<P>My PoG faction is shot to heck now.  The reason I did it was that being in an average size guild there was no way I would ever be able to complete the quests for the BP's, not to mention most quests are about the least exciting thing to do.  You just did not consider the majority of us in such situations who don't have 10 or more lvl 55+ tanks, nukers and clerics.  Hunting the PoG looked like the best and only chance to obtain this gear.  Now its gone like the faction.  *** did i bother.<P>This lvl 52 gnome cleric is haveing serious doubts about not just my class but the game in general.  SoV is a flop for the majority of us.  Just to much undoble without 3-6 groups, lvl 50-60.  <P>I can only dream that some day soon Chris Taylor will finish up &lt;a href="http://www.dungeonsiege.com/"&gt;Dungeon Siege&lt;/a&gt; and put together what would assuredly be the funnest persistant universe game alive.<P>Since tons of us sacrificed our faction you dang well better make the dropped armour as good as the quest armour, just like it is before the patch, and not even think about nerfing its already super rare drop rates.  Do that and you are sure to lose the true cleric base and I guarantee the rest will follow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to ask myself, why bother? Why post about what could/should/might have been done or changed that would have made yet another nerf easier to live with - it has never made a difference in the past and it won't this time either.<P>I have played a long time. I struggled through the early levels when I couldn't get a group, through the 'experience leech' period when no one wanted clerics around because druids and shaman could do my job and then some, through the months of broken quests and tedious camps. I've watched my spells nerfed over and over again, and I've watched them handed to other classes as well. I've leveled through those extra hell levels to finally get spells that are so broken they sit in the back of my spellbook. And I watch my toys become useless status symbols with ADMITTED useless effects.<P>Most clerics keep plugging away - not because we enjoy our jobs in the game or even the game itself anymore. I haven't enjoyed the game in a very long time. We keep at it because most of us care about those people that depend on us being there, so we log in and do our job. Yes, that's what it is - a job. Sad? You betcha.<P>It isn't about the item, or the effect. I have a BP and I don't use it that much. It's a downtime reducer for the most part. On the rare occassion when I go OOM, I'll click it on my tank hoping it's fast enough to keep him up. It's about trust and it's about goals. There is little in the game for the high level cleric as it is. Our spells are a joke - many don't work, others are nerfed into uselessness. We have so little in the way of toys it's pathetic. Someone tell me what is there to look forward to now? Better yet, tell me why we should even bother as it will just be taken away...<P>Clerics are needed - we have that thrown in our faces every time we ask for something positive and everytime Verant bashes us with the nerf stick. But you know what? Being a cleric isn't fun - it hasn't been for a long time. I hope people think of that before too many more of us retire... Better yet, just take away CH and res, give it to another class, and be done with this slow death.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We have to patch live or read the message boards to find out what changes have been made.<P>When they do, on those rare occations, ask us for help, they get an overwhelming response.  We are there to help, hell, we want to help, but they apparently would rather ask you guys to make 300 lvl 1 chars to go see Warrens then ask us to set up a raid of 15-30's and see what the place is all about.  Much as we might like you guys, frankly 300 lvl 1s arn't going to find ANY bugs other then zoning and dieing bugs.<P>When we do report a problem, it is ussually ignored, or in MAJOR cases, we get our ***** reamed for "taking advantage" and wiped (funny, that little screwup still went live though didn't it?).<P>Stop leading us around by the nose VI, answer our questions, STRAIGHT, no sidelines, no half-ass answers, give us some real facts that we can work with.

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>I hope you make it to this post. My question is, will players who already have spent the time and effort (and faction loss) obtaining these breastplates be given the option to switch it out with the replacement one? It seems to me that if the replacement BP ends up being "better", then they shouldn't have to do the quests/kill the MOBs to obtain it all over again. <P>I am sure you are well aware of the horrible PR Verant has with the majority of clerics at the moment (and I can't say I really blame them). But if you don't at least allow the players, your customers, the choice of swapping for the replacement BPs that you put into the game, the resulting backlash will be catastrophic.<P>Wayseeker<BR>Ranger of Tunare<BR>Veeshan Server<BR>"Save your DoT mana... send in the ranger!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me try to put this in a way you can understand.<P>Velious has been out for a few months, the rules of velious combat are well understood, and even if they rely heavily upon certain classes (my main is a 60 shaman, NOT one of those classes), it was at least possible.  Ubermobs were falling, people saw the loot and drooled, and we all had a goal to get in the game.  My group of people has been steadily decking ourselves out in velious gear in preperation for the massive festering pool of death that will be getting our Kael quest armor.  The only reason we can even get people to PLAN to go there is that almost every single one of the people I hunt with is 60 and has a huge buffer.  We also plot to kill Dain and the like.  It wouldn't be for a few weeks, but it's a hope for the future.<P>Then, Enter Verant.  They give token upgrades to shamans, druids, and hybrids, nerf warriors slightly, rogues moderately, and clerics massively.  The thing is, the upgrades to other classes do NOT make up for the nerfs to the big three.  Couple this with Verant's idea that their uber mobs shouldn't be killed (see Yelinak going from 4 hits to 6 hits, Dain poofing more when you try to pull him to areas where he's a tad more feasible, etc.) and you basically have a game that's being ruined by Verant.  What I'm leading up to here is fairly simple, and I hope you recognize the reference.<P>Verant says, 'OKLAHOMA!  OKLAHOMA!'<P>Seems like you guys there aren't playing the same game we are.  I'm grateful as all hells that the cleric in my regular group just plays the game to talk with friends, because if he played it for the fun of the game itself, he'd've quit like so many others.  But hey, I'd just be missing buffs, right?  Because after all, it's Verant's opinion that gear shouldn't help priest class's performance at all, and it only takes me about 30-35 hours to power a cleric to 39 on a seperate account/puter.  God forbid that clerics (and other casters) have something to strive for, right?<P>Gathu the Tactician, Xegony - for now at least.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, <P>   As a 57 cleric, I know the power of the Donals BP, and I agree the changes that were made to it.  It still has some usefullness, you can use it on the first CH on the tanks on a big raid, provided your given a chance to use the spell.  <P>   Basically, the Donals BP went from usefull in ten ways, to useless in all but one or two ways.  <P>   Players paid money and invested a lot of time for this, and you shattered their investment and other people's dreams.  It was needed, we understand.<P>   The Velius BP's, First off, the people who did the quests will get hit the hardest, they were few, but they were there.  <P>   To you, the impact is small, 0.001% of the EQ Population will be effected?  Who knows, but you didn't care.  Word travels my friends, the way you treat any ammount of people, is heard by all.  <P>  You *COULD* still change the effects on the CURRENT Bp's to the new effect you are going to implement.  Nope, you are screwing everyone over, also those that did the HARD(!!!) Quests, making their usefull item worthless, and making them do the HARD(!!!) quest all over again if they want an effect they will actually use(hopefully).  <P>  You get a hearty /flip from me, as much as i'm addicted to EQ, I wont be quitting, nor do I have one of these.  But as a cleric, you've made this BP 100% useless on raids, after making it very usefull.  <P>  Abashi says its hard to get a middle ground, I dont think its that hard.  Put Summon Abundant Food or maybe some kinda spell that summons 20 food and water at a time, and do this to the CURRENT BP's, because if you dont, you are destroying people's work and the next product with Verant on it wont get my money, because its pretty obvious there are lot of incompetent people high up in Verant Interactive.  <P>  This change wasn't thought through, or you were drunk doing so, either way, ill treatment of customers(if only 200 clerics on the servers total), is heard by all.  <P>  You made this type of change to the Donals, why cant you do it here too?  Let everyone who already has the BP, get the new effect because your already pissing people off, making them get a new BP will piss them off even more.  <P>  You amaze me.<P>57 Templar of Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You guys know that all this arguing is futile.  They are not gonna say "o, we didnt realize you guys didnt want us to nerf your BPs"  If they decided not to nerf the BPs that would be admiting we are right and they are wrong, and Verant would NEVER do that.  The best they have ever done is reduce the stupid changes they make, but it doesnt fix anything. <P>Anyways, Verant always lies to get us to shut up, so I wouldnt be suprised if they just made up some stupid lie to get people to stop bashing game they are destroying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL, this whole thread is NOT just about this BP Absor.  Its about 2 years of absolutly the worst testing of your game, THE WORST.  This recent change to one item broke the cammels back, you knew it was coming.  You knew that we were gonna break at some point, but you just have to push it, see just how much you can strech this game out to keep people paying your salary.<P>You pushed just too far.  Your test servers(Veeshan and Erollisi) are broken, they are quitting.  LoS, soon to go, along with many more.  If it weren't for our guild recently working for over a month to get Veeshan's Peak key, we might have broken up as well.<P>I just don't think what you guys have done for the passed years has hit home yet.  You got exactly ONE patch, ONE SINGLE PATCH, to somehow win back your player BASE.  About a week?  seems right.  You got one patch to save this game, can you do it?  Not hardly.  Too bad this isn't a fairytale where you can buy a miracle Verant, cause you need one.<P>Qalar - Drinal<BR>Cats in Hats</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor stated:<P>"Changing these items is not all that different than any of the 'positive' changes we've made to the game, with the exception of the way those changes have been perceived. All are done with thought about the health of the game in mind"<P>The problem is that VI has made many, many more changes perceived as negative than those perceived as positive.<P><BR>Im not going to get in to a class envy type post. But it does not take a high IQ to see that some classes have endured HUGE nerfs to the point they are not even a shadow of their original selves while others are comparatively, too good.<P>VI is constantly tuning around the ability of very few. Constantly knee jerk reacting to the feats of those. The solutions they are implementing is driving certain classes away by the truck loads.<P>VIs lack of willingness to explain why the game evolves around a small group of classes is outright depressing. It is apparent that they cant find a balanced role for all the classes available. Its sad they dont even have the balls to say they cant. After all, they are still in the denial stage.<P>Heck, they cant even come forward and explain what their reasoning is for some Epics to be almost common and others outright very rare.<P>The statement often made by VI, that "All is working as intended", has become a running joke. Actually, considering the amount of times they have had to eat those words, were I the responsible person at VI, I would ban every single VI employee from using it. I would also lock and delete every thread that contained it. <P>Noc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's stuff like this that will be the end of EQ history one day. Negative changes that has a massive effect on gameplay. Sure, the Donals change didn't affect many people, but soon you will think, "this can't work like this" and "that is too good", and suddenly you will end up in the same trap that caught the most of the players in Ultima Online. I played UO for 2 years or so, then they made soo much changes to the game so all I had worked for was ruined. I've soon played EQ for 2 years, and I hope you won't do the same mistake.<P>I'm not saying you are doing wrong with thoose nerfs, just that every nerf brings EQ closer to it's popularity peak and from there it just goes downwards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063879&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063879&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
