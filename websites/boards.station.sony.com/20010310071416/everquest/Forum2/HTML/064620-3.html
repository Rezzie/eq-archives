</FONT><HR>"2 years back wizards could use their normal DD spells but today resists are so high they have to use "special" DD's with lousy mana ratios. And it's gotten so bad that their first "unresistable" spell, Lure, doesn't do the job anymore so Verant has introduced a newer "unresistable" spell, Bane. So while warrior weapons are getting better, wizard spells are actually doing less damage per mana." (Dracones)<P><BR>Exactly.<P>Ever seen a level 55 plus rogue backstabbing for 1607 damage? Manaless, in a second?

</FONT><HR>All nice ideas, but no practial way was given to implement them.  You have to understand that you cannot think of this game as just a player.<P>If VI goes and gives a wizard a 30% damage increase focus item, thats all well and good for that ONE wizard.  He may now feel he is contributing.  <P>But for a second, just think what a 30% damage increase per wizard with a group of 10 wizards.  Now with 10 wizards on a raid, all with the focus item(and you know if it was there all high end wizards would have it)you just increased the output damage of that raid by 300%!!!<P>Can you see what im saying?  You are all thinking in single terms.  Verant cannot do that.  Thats why Melee chars are so out of whack now.  They gave increases to help out the melee, not realizin what it would do if you had a group of nothing but those increase melees!<P>Im not saying I have the solution, but simply adding better items is not the solution.  Try thinking in terms of the game as a whole.  not just as yourself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ummm Dobraine,<P>I must point out the fatal flaw in your argument.... Wizards are NOT the only people doing damage on a raid or even doing the most damage on a raid.  I know that melee and espically rogues outdamage wizards by a huge margin.  An item that will increase the offensive power of a caster class would be no different than an item that increases the offence of a melee class.  Casters no longer do the most damage on a raid and they are increasingly doing less damage as melee weapons increase in power.  If this continues down this trend casters will be obsolete.  I think VI needs to do a damage comparison between casters and melee with SoV gear the numbers speak for themselves.  It is very sloppy design that VI did not do this kind of analysis before they released a new expansion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Totally agree with the original poster and all the supporting arguments made by the contributors to this thread.  Been playing my mage as my primary since day1 of release.  Before the expansions, melee classes were the defensive wall, healers kept the wall standing, and pure casters did the majority of the damage (paced and in a controlled fashion).<P>Doesn't anyone else find the need for Evade and the Jolt line ironic.  Casters were always taught, while cutting their teeth, to space out the amount of damage.  If you got aggro'd and killed...well, YOU did something wrong.  But do we tell Rangers, Monks, or Rogues this?  No siree bob.  Keep on doing that insane damage guys and girls, we'll add some new abilities to lower you on the hate list!!<P>/ponder<P>So, who is the one that's in control of overall design at Verant through Kunark and Velious?  Just want to know so I can keep an eye out for his name on Dev Lists from now on and save my money and time by not buying the product =).<P>/em hats off to the original game and levels 1-50.<BR>/em throws bat guano at the game's current balance.<P>Oh, and my mage is retired and I'm having a blast playing a Iksar Shadowknight that has solo'd his way into the 30's (farther than I ever got solo with my mage, hehe).<P>Dhimmid de'Thon, 57 Conjuror<BR>Kihr 'Tain, 31 Fear Knight</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although I enjoy playing my hybrid so much more, a necro seems to have so many more options in battle. Wow-- I never thought I would see the day when a ranger was considered a better option than my necro simply because he is a melee class.<P>And yet here it is, being given a major thread.<P>In general, I think that people are underestimating the abilities of most of the caster classes, especially mages, necromancers, and shaman-- there may be some problems with Wizzies but that is the only caster which I think may have significant weaknesses and they are mainly because wizzies have so few utility spells. <P>Casters are just recovering from being the center of attention for so long and losing a little of that immense power they once had. Verant has introduced some more balance into the game, and by and large it is a good thing.<P>Rogues may be overpowered in terms of damage, but once again their utility during battle is so limited (of course they are necessary on CR and with picking locks, but that is not battle). And so while casters now seem to be vastly underestimated, I am constantly seeing rogues being overestimated both in game and on these boards. The fact is there are tons of classes that can do great damage in this game, and it is the utility spells that seem to make the difference in the tough fights Ive seen. Root, which almost ever caster has in some form, is an absolute lifesaver and none of the melee types you mention here has it.<P>Chiaroc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a high level ranger and a high level wizard on Saryrn. I have seen excatly what this guy is talking about.<P>new gear for casters really means nothing once you reach the 200 int soft cap. All you can hope for is a robe that casts a spell for you, manaless, or mana and resist items.<P>But I can tell you this, it wasn't until my ranger got his epics that he was able to solo again at 55, light blues mind you. he could kite a mob for ten minutes prior to teh epics, but i am talking regular soloing now. Standing toe to toe with a light blue and killing it.<P>My wizard has been soloing since day one. hell she can even quad kite 4 mobs at once without blinking an eye. And she doesn't compare to the soloing power of a mage or a necro. <P>Now enter into play epic mobs and encounters, the SoV type encounters. The tables have been turned because indeed, a Ch'ed tank will out damage a caster any day.<P>But what do ya want? over powered casters that make melee's useless in everyday combat? bah just get a puller, we don't need any more tanks..<P>if they increased the damage done by casters in everyday hunting, the results could be huge for melee classes.<P>So they are trying to balance this out. If you bring a pet to a SoV encounter he will be doing constant damage just like a fighter would be. So compensate a wizard with the dragonsbane and giantsbane spells. <P>I hate to say it, but VI makes sense. There is no need to increase the damage power of casters. In everyday encounters they are fine. <P>btw mages AND necros have pet focus items in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> If 10 wizard all were able to cast for 20% more dmg each = 200% more total dmg done<P> If 10 melees where all able to melee for 20% more dmg each = 200% more melee dmg.<P> Melees have the FBSS( along with alot more haste items) for their 20% more dmg. What do INT casters have? We have a soft cap that is far too low, and thus easy to reach. A caster gets more powerful spells as they gain lvls, melees get skill increases which cause them to do more dmg with their weapons. <P> One solution that I would like to see is implement casting haste. A FBSS would not only increase a melee's attack by 20%, it would increase a caster's spell casting by 20%. Maybe if that would happen, the toy Tolapmuj robe would become something useful. I'm still trying to figure out why any high lvl caster would want a robe that gives them haste. Effect: Haste would then become something useful for both classes then.<P>  I would love to get some casting disciplines. One that would cause my spells to become unresistable would be incredible. Maybe something called force of nature would become one for magicians. Once used, it would give a 30% increase in spell dmg. <P> Its really sad being a mage when I'm told that I cannot get into a group because they need another melee. There does not seem to be any room in post 50 groups for necros, wizzies, or mages. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It was easy to justify the lag created by a raid member contributing around 10% of overall damage to a high end encounter with the 32K HP cap. But now we have Velious and even a level 60 wizard using the new (on test) XXXbane spells with a mana pool of 3000 would contribute at most 2% of the total damage to some of these 500K hp encounters if he was allowed to cast till he was OOM. In Kunark under that same situation that same wizard just accounted for close to 1/3 of the total health of the mob. This being said how do you justify bringing him to Velious and possibly indirectly helping cause the link death of the warriors rogues and monks that contribute for 90+% of the damage? Conversly, how do you tell your friend/guildmate that whatever lag he creates is not worth having him around?<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>just want to point out a small mistake.  500k is a rather high estimate.  you find someone with 500k and youve set a new record.  right now the statue of rallos zek has the highest i know of and hes only 400k, with most of the "uber" battles on velious being closer to 200k.<P>PS: *NO* i do *NOT* know how many hp tunare or bristlebane have and neither do you so dont even bring them up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The original writer has fingered the truth.  <P>When melee types can do 100 points per second in combat - the equivalent of an ice comet every 10 or 11 seconds...  Who needs a wizard?  Or a mage?  (And, btw, haven't needed a Necro now in a while.)  <P>Whether its an epic battle that is going to last 10 to 30 minutes or a series of smaller engagements, you must have the constant superior damage a melee type provides because the wizards will be sitting it out on their behinds for most of the fight, uselessly medding.  (Yeah, I suppose you have to have 2 or 3 along as the taxi drivers if you're in PoA or H)<P>The melee type and his supporting cast of clerics, shamans, and enchanters are the essential centerpiece of any and all actions.  The rest are at best nice to have along, but certainly not necessary.  Decorative fluff.<P>The fact is you can conduct a perfectly capable raid with no wizards, no mages, no necros, no druids.   <P>Its Broke.<P>Its not balanced.  <P>Its getting old and and despite the coolness factor of a high level Necro soloing seafuries, its no longer fun.  Soloing seafuries is, in the end, boring.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What else can you do besides, haste, heal, debuff, buff, and stun, to support melee?<P>I don't see a way to keep these high end encounters difficult, while allowing caster to contribute significant damage with spells, and not at the same time throw off the already unbalanced solo ability.<P>Hmmmm.. Maybe spells that are much more mana efficient, but can only be cast in melee range.<P>Hmmm.. Maybe a spell that is like an AOE, but the damage is only recorded when the melee's in the effect make hits against the mob, and the hate stays on the melee!

</FONT><HR>Ancient Cyclops,<P>"Hmmm.. Maybe a spell that is like an AOE, but the damage is only recorded when the melee's in the effect make hits against the mob, and the hate stays on the melee! I like the sound of this one."<P>A spell like this already exists:<P><BR> Wizards get one line of sweet basically group only spells called rains. They do a whole lot of damage over 3 waves. You absolutely cannot solo with these spells because the instant you cast one of these spells your root breaks and the mob leaves the area of the rain and procedes to pound you into a little pulp. The main problem with these spells as they are today is that they cost too much mana for the resists and the difficulty of using these spells. For instance the spell tears of drizzul a lvl 52 rain spell that does 1800 damage over 3 waves costs 380 mana. This spell when used properly usually gets resisted one time putting its average damage at 1200 damage. 380 mana for 1200 damage on average is about the same damage to mana ratio of our draughts and ice comet. This does not reflect well the fact that this spell causes 1800 points of agro for 1200 average damage and that this spell can hit the wiz if he gets in its range and all the damage of the spell is nullified if the mob aggros the wiz and leaves the area of the rain before the damage is done.<P>My point here is that if you want to balence the wizard out in group play vastly improve the mana to damage ratio of this line of spells. Make the rain cost 200 mana or even 2 mana... this spell line is balenced out by more than just how often you can cast it. In fact if you cast this spell too much it is useless. This spell line is the perfect way to give wizards sustained damage over time to match that of the melee classes and it is self correcting. ie if you get agro the spell is useless.<P><BR>anyhow this is my 2 bits<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The idea of a proc line of spells that added to melee damage was shot down at least twice.  Once during the wizard talks (all three responses we got), and once a long time ago before velious was even released.  It wasnt "in line with the vision".<P>I no longer understand what it is I'm supposed to do.  Your average sebilis frog that's blue to my lvl 57 wizard has around 8000 hp.  I nuke for 716, or less than 10% of its hp.  Your average lvl 1 bat has 18 to 20 hp, and a lvl 1 wizard nukes for 4.  Which is roughly 20% of the hp of the bat.  Now I understand these are meant to be soloable, but as I look over the wizard spell list all I see is myself becoming *less* effective over time than I was before.  There are two times when this jump is not seen, 44th and 49th level.  These were the levels when in preKunark days, being a wizard payed off.  Suddenly we really could hit hard (for those who dont know, there's a 200+ damage disparity between 39th and 44th level nukes, far more than any other level).  Much like a DnD caster we came into our own in the end game and were actually somewhat of a force when we needed to be.<P>In Velious I truly dont know what I'm there for.  I'm worth more Okielsing tanks versus 100K+ mobs than I am getting constantly resisted with my lures.  The Bane spells are a bandaid on a gunshot wound.  Even with those I could still only do maybe 2% of the mob's hp.  They really dont increase our maximal damage any at all, they simply take resists out of the equation.  Every balance talk we've ever had with verant has ignored resists anyway, so what difference does it make.<P>Verant intended Velious to be the land of monsters that die so very rarely, they could make events out of them.  They didnt think anyone would kill Dain, Yelinak or Tormax for months, and certainly not the week of release.  I personally think it hurt thier pride a little bit that suddenly thier new expansion was more or less already conquered ground.  So, much like a bad roleplay DM when his big bad ubervillain gets axed ahead of schedule, they got huffy about it and started making changes to make sure it wouldnt happen again.  Wendolyn of Afterlife posted on thier board that in his current form with healing nerfs, Yelinak is not killable, and that even without those nerfs, the newly buffed Yelinak may not have been possible.  I think she could be considered a good source of information seeing as they've seen more than most of the rest of us combined, so the question now is whether or not Verant really does want us killing thier monsters at all.  Lately I've had my doubts.  I'm not suggesting they want us frustrated and for us to quit, that's just stupid.  I'm just of the opinion that thier developers were a little put out when thier newest bad boys got waxed due to thier limited understanding of how efficient and well informed a high level guild is.  Its a thorn in thier side they've now chosen to remedy, and they're seemingly okay with pissing off thousands of people to do it.<P>After 137 played days, I feel like I've earned the right to not be embarassed when a rogue backstabs for more damage than I am capable of nuking for, or when that same rogue has done triple the damage I have during a velious fight.  I guess I'm supposed to be content knowing that I'm at least worth a damn in VP though.<P>Heylel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>But AOE has other bad effects, like breaking mezz, and pulling other mobs into the fight, which is another reason it doesn't get used much.<P>What I had in mind wouldn't be AOE damage. I think verant would be free to up the damage or efficiency more than they would a true AOE spell that can be used to take out a lot of mobs at once.<P>It could be a group buff type spell. It would be  like that pally spell that adds a proc to any weapon they use.<P>It could be setup where it works like my monk's thunder kick discipline. It would become active and stay active for some duration of perhaps 10 or 20 seconds. During that time, the first hit you score would unload the additional damage like a proc, then the effect would be over.<P>The more people in your group, the more efficient it is. It could be a fixed max damage like most procs, or it could be based on the weapon and/or level of the players. Like a weapon proc, it could have level limits so you couldn't use it to power level players.<P>So instead of giving wizards some huge nuke that they can then go use solo on all those non-uber HP mobs that still exist, you give them a spell like this which can do the same amount of damage spread out over the other players in a full group. And the wizard could go poke with his dagger to proc it also heh.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I nuke for 716,&lt;&lt;<P>I guess it's expectations. The same kind of thing happens to melee classes, only much earlier. <P>I'm a 52 monk that's oh so great killing those mobs by dealing out lots of damage. For instance, I did almost 5k damage to a sky mob during a fight that lasted about 2 and half minutes.<P>However, plop me in front of an ice giant in everfrost and I have no chance of soloing him. Yet I see blue to me casters doing it no problem.<P>The difference is that melee can't do damage without taking damage except when they're in a large group since the mob only attacks one person at a time. (Unless they have AOE spells heh)<P>Even during that fight with the sky mob I would have died 3 times over from the damage the mob did to me if I hadn't been buffed and healed during the fight.<P>&gt;&gt;In Velious I truly dont know what I'm there for.

If they up the mana pool so you can do a lower amount of damage per hit over a longer period of time, you could still solo like crazy since mana down time is the only thing that slows you casters down. (For melee, it's medding all the HP lost during the fight.)<P>The only thing I can think of is for verant to find another way besides HP to make these mobs just as tough to kill.<P>All that said, I think the ideas in this thread about items that up a caster's damage, or other things like that, sound good to me. And it does sound like a wizard's nuke abilities should be higher relative to the other casters.<P>But none of these small tweaks would change that fight with the 100k hp mob much for you.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I don't get is that, in most RPGs, casters are SUPPOSED to do more damage than melees.  I mean this is only logical since casters die so easily.  In my opinion, a rogue should NEVER be outdamaging a wizard of the same level regardless of the weapons he uses.  Verant played into the hands of the melee classes when Kunark was released and actually made things a little "too balanced".  <P>If anything, casters should be 2x as powerful as they are now (6,000 DMG spell without component cost for wizzies, focus items that cause reduced resists, items that randomly generate ungodly DDs or DOTs (proc), etc.<P>Melee classes, on the other hand, should be meat shields for the casters instead of the damage generating engine they were turned into when Kunark came out.<P>Knat    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The level cap a caster can land a spell on needs to be increased as well. Currently a caster can only cast a spell on a mob 6 levels of red (8 levels higher than the caster). There are ever increasing encounters with mobs 65+. Resists are bad enough on 2 levels of red let alone 6 levels... but it is impossible (by game design) for a 57th caster to land a spell on a 65 mob... but a tank can hit it without issue.<P>Casters need to be able to land spells on mobs 10-12 levels higher. I hate being 55th level and not being able to touch mob's like Trak. Im a VERY high level caster and by design can not be of any use at all on a Trak raid since he is 10 level higher than me. If I was a 50th tank at least I could hit him.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I will use Frost as an example, since Wildfire at level 60 for a Druid and Draught of Fire at level 60 for a Wizard is so obvious its not funny. For those that read this, the reason Lure's were not used was because Druid class doesn't have Lure spells. And yes Druid Frost is very resistant, more so then Draught of Ice.<P>Wizard and Druid Level 60<P>Frost: Casting 6.0 second plus 2.5 second Recast (Level 60 Damage: 762)<P>10 cast: Time 85 seconds<P>Mana used: 2500<P>Damage: 7620<P>Draught of Ice: 3.0 second plus 2.25 second Recast (Level 60 Damage: 731)<P>10 cast: Time 52.5 seconds <P>Mana used: 2150 <P>Damage: 7310<P>________<P>Difference DoI vs Frost:<P>Time (with recast): 32.5 Seconds <P>Mana used: 350<P>Damage: 310<P>It takes 32.5 seconds more to cast 10 Frost<P>It takes 350 less mana to cast Draught of Ice<P>Frost does 310 more damage then Draught of Ice<P>Common Sense tells me this: during the time that I am casting 10 Frost, you could cast 6 more Draught of Ice and still be 1.0 seconds ahead of me. Simply put you are the master at Direct Damage since during the time I casted 10 spells you could put out 4076 more damage then a druid. If you forget one essential item such as the time it takes to cast and recast, then your point becomes invalid, since your argument was: "Wizards... Wannabe Masters of DD? The PURE nuking class... (almost ?) outdamaged by a support class?"<P>Total direct damage for a druid in 85 seconds = 7620<P>Total direct damage for a wizard in 84 seconds = 11696<P>If your gonna use another class as an example get the full facts across and find something that viable to your arguement. The arguement should be vs Melee. Mob vs Melee - Mob vs Caster! The game has become Hack and Slash, with the Melee yelling HEAL ME! HEAL MELEE!
