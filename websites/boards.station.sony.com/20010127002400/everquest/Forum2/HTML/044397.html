</FONT><HR>Why is there so much negativity? Is no one grateful for what they DO have?<P>Every class got an epic weapon to quest after. These quests are difficult and require a great deal of time to acquire. When it is finally acquired, there are hoots and hollers about how awful it is. Oh, wait. I'ts not actually awful, it's amazing! It's only awful because it doesn't make you win the game every time you swing it. Or at least not as much as some other class's epic weapon. <P>Then, suddenly, it became THE reason to play. As if the purpose of EQ was to get an epic weapon. People starteed complaining about how hard it is to get one. Cazic skin doesn't drop often enough. The uber-rare spawn shouldn't have a place holder or should spawn at least twice a day. The purpose of the quests was to make it fun to get stuff, you know, a challenge. It was not meant to be the goal of everquest. Its EVERquest, not UntilYouGetYourEpicWeaponQuest. The point of the weapons are not the effects, its the quest that is supposed to matter. A great deal of the other items are simple drops that are camped. No quest, no goal.<P>After Kunark, people got bitter about how the game changed for them. All the monsters were harder. A lot harder. So instead of thinking it was a challenge, people decided they were better off comlaining that they got "shafted" because they weren't as effective as before. "New" does not equal simple. How much fun would you have if you had to fight the same old stuff. What if every monster in this game was an orc, gnoll, or goblin? And Kunark just gave them more HP's and higher level spells? BORING. It MUST be harder, it MUST make you play more, and it MUST change the game strategy. Otherwise you wouldn't play from boredom. Things aren't handed to you on a plate; you aren't royalty (well most of you anyway). Like much of everything else inthis world you have to WORK to get what you want. Otherwise you won't appreciate it. <P>So it's work and not play anymore you say? Wrong again. It's the work that makes it fun. If you had a job where you can't wait to leave the minute you arrive, you need a new job. We aren't little children anymore. Playing isn't frolick, it's challenge. Sports are hard work, hobbies are hard work. It's the accomplishment that keeps you going.<P>Without EQ what would you be doing? Studying? Watching TV? Going out drinking? More lascivious activities? Be grateful there is something you enjoy doing for countless hours at any time of day for $10 a month. If you aren't grateful, you need to change your priorities, fast. Format C:, and go get something else to do.<P><BR>H.C.<P>There is no governor anywhere. <BR>You are all absolutely free.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>And this relates to real life, too. The story of that father who killed his 9 month old son is a good example (see post on this topic). He was so involved with this game that any deviation from what he considered to be right would cause him frustration, only to take it out on his son. It's a very real tragedy.<P>Now this was obviously a severely unbalanced person and we should not equate the average EQ player with him. What we should do is look at the big picture on this. If you are under the impression that things are going to go your way every time, you are in for a world of disappointment. EQ is not going to change its shape to suit your needs just as the rest of the world would not. You have to adjust, or find a different path to tread that suits you more. <P>In the case of this topic the only real change required is attitude. Life will go on if the duck stick doesn't cast something no one wants. Not using Donal's breastplate will not ruin your life. Adjust, adapt. Humans are so VERY good at adapting. It's a pity they are so good at refusing to, as well.<P>H.C.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahhhh... Airtreader.<P>You are a prime example of bitterness. I say this from other posts you have made. I do agree with you that informing Verant of game mechanics that do not function is necessary. I was referring to the fact that when new content is added, short of it being non-functioning, why is there a need to complain about it? If it's new, use it as if it is NEW, not an upgrade to something old. If you view something as old with improved stats, you are going to find flaws with it every time. Instead, why not play as if it requires different usage. Spice it up a little. That is the intention of new content. <P>It's like you have been eating McDonald's french fries and they start selling a baked potato. Instead of saying baked potatoes are new and interesting, you go on about how it tastes nothing like fries, and how McDonald's cheated you out of tastier and larger fries. That is my point, and yes, it is lunchtime for me.<P>To further the analogy, I completely agree that McDonald's should know if their new baked potato comes out burned or green or something. So, yes, alchemy needed (needs?) fixing, yes, falling through the world is bad, but NO, your epic weapons should not let you solo or really make your game easier. They should be neat to play with, neater than other items. The duck stick, well... I'll reserve judgement for now.<P>H.C.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;your epic weapons should not let you solo or really make your game easier. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Kindly point me to the post I made where I said this or anything that could in a ratioal manner be construed to demand this?<P>If it is NEW content, it should be tested to SOME extent on live servers, not simply on test and then thrown to the wolves and then telling the customer base that if there is a problem your screwed because VI pretended to test the quests. Have I said that we should not have had the silly DoT on our "epic" not be a proc? Why yes I did since post 50 shamans in the main, do not melee so it mostly would never go off. In effect "not workable". <P>So it seems to boil down to if YOU think something is broken it's ok for you to post about it. If someone else sees another problem, or a different aspect of it and posts on it it is "bitterness" that drives them to do so. Unlike perfect you who starts vanity threads to dismiss and demean others since they see things differently from you.<P>If that was not your point, it is really hard to see any other. You posted nothing about "gameplay" simply a whine about other people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and you seemed to take the tack that soloing or wishing to solo is somehow an evil act. How so? Does it not say on the EQ box that solo play IS supported? Is grouping bad? Nope. Is wanting to be alone a bit and explore or just sit and talk, or get some exp and/or plat to buy stuff a bad thing? Nope.<P>I have run into groups that constantly train, spam the zone with dumb stuff and generally act like a buch of punks on a street corner. That does not mean all groups are bad.

The druid weapon is overwritten by root, and if the target is already snared, it won't stick!  Even better, it's super long casting time prevents it from being at all feasible if it's resisted the first time (which happens often) and since it's only a 3 minute snare, it's not even feasible for kiting with.  Even better though is the necro (un)epic.  The spell results are exactly the same as the necro level 49 darkness spell, and is resisted just as much (if not more).  The best part though, is that necro's have to wait until level 50 to cast a level 49 style spell from their epic.  And probably the worst part of it all, You can't cast the necro epic and the druid epic on the same target because of that same lame snare effect.  Both druids and necro's have asked for the same thing, remove the horrid snare effect and just leave the DOT on, and please please please change the resistance level of the spells, since they both get resisted so often.<P><BR>BTW, this isn't a complaint session, I'm just validating why these classes have a right to complain.  Why spend 100+ hours scouring the lands of Norrath trying to complete these quests when the weapons you recieve are sub par?<P><BR>Sal, 51 wanderer, Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the original poster - adapt and MOVE ON!<P>Again the boards are full of class whiners complaining about how they now have to THINK to play correctly. News flash - several classes have to change tactics as they progress through the levels. For those who escape it until post-50, GET OVER IT!<P>EQ is NOT just about getting the loot and beating the others to 60. It's also about getting good entertainment value for your money, about feeling a sense of accomplishment from overcoming CHALLENGE. I didn't buy this game in the hopes of beating everyone else, or beating the game, because I knew damned well it wasn't going to happen!  There will never be a grand finale. I'll never see my avatar in an end-game cut scene, slaying the last God of Norath and banishing all evil. I bought this game because, if I care to LOOK for it, there is always a new challenge, there are always friends to be made, and there is always entertainment. <P>(The other day I accidentally saw a dragon for the first time while running through Dreadlands. I was thrilled just to see the thing! Even more thrilled to have live  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>Too many people forget all about the CHALLENGE part of entertainment until it bites them in the arse. Until they actually have to work to earn their exp. They get a routine down and yawn through the levels, then complain about how boring it is. Later, when they have to start thinking again, they complain that they can't.<P>My heart bleeds. <P>The worse part about it is that the boards become much less useful because of it. They get dragged down by people who act like babies wanting their big red lollipops handed to them. You can rarely come to the boards anymore for productive discussion. All you'll get is finger pointing and crying. Funny how most people I know in-game don't feel this way. Why can't *they* be the ones coming here, instead of the crybabies?<P>Hmph.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good. An honest answer. Airtreader, there is a difference between feedback and "this weapon suXor!" The latter is what I'm seeing more often. With titles of posts like "another slap in the face to Class X," how can you possibly expect a good reaction? Constructive criticism has its place. And it is here on these boards. To say "Verant hates Shamans" or "why is this STILL being ignored" when people haven't received an answer THEY WANT. People want to be catered to on this message board and in-game. I say Verant isn't a catering service. It's a bunch of servers that you can take or leave at your convenience. <P>I play a shaman, so I can appreciate the value of a triggerd epic as opposed to a proc. So yes, feedback is good, it's just the attitude that sucks. <P>New content is not necessarily good content. True. At the same token it ain't exactly castor oil. Treat it as unexplored, not an upgrade. View it from a child's perspective. Everything is new and different. Different does not equal bad. <P>As to the flame Airtreader, I will leave that unrewarded with a response. Your attitude is a prime example of my topic here. And yes I AM referring to the players (or rather posters) and not content here. I am free not to read posts, but I am also free to respond to them.<P>H.C.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I gave you the general complaints about the weapon procs and the reason why they're not worth getting (unless you go for the flashy graphics of them, but honestly, 95% of all 50+ players have particle effects off).  I must say, you need to take your rose colored glasses off.  Yes, the game is great, yes the game is highly (to the nth degree) addicting, and yes I enjoy playing.  But the game also has issues that needs to be addressed, and beleive it or not, VI spends a lot of time listening to these boards and the complaints that are generated on them.  So rather than flame those who disagree with you (I will never use the term SuXor) why not listen to the issues that they bring up and see it from their perspective?<P>On a final note, I just wanted to ask Hagbard, what level is your highest main character? The reason I ask is simple, the game changes when you hit 50+, to the point where little tweaks to the game's mechanics can change entire play styles that players have been developing for their entire play lives.<P><BR>Sal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Good. An honest answer." That means I like what I hear and not some filtered mob-mentality BS. A real argument. <P>Airtreader, <P>&gt;Many of us take our "roles" seriously. many have spent almost 2 years creating the reputations and accumlating items to increase our effectiveness, grouped or solo.

First you automatically assume that I have "sided" with Verant on all issues and am satisfied with their responses and the game in general. And also that somehow I am no longer on your "side". I don't think I am unique in my trials against adversity. I deal with the problem or sidestep it, depending on the situation, and move on. <P>You abolutely have the "right" to be bitter and to feel slapped, but the right to do something does not require its action. You go on and on and dwell on an issue til you blow up in anger. I say let it be someone else's problem. Only you make things bother you, short of physical or serious mental stress. A video game? "I spent 100+ days /played getting to where I am and I DESERVE whatever I demand. If things don't go my way, I'm gonna complain til I do get it my way." It's called a temper tantrum. No one likes a whiner. Why do you let it bother you? Cause I invested so much time... Well is that time wasted? No, it isn't.<P>Your outlook says that you spent whatever amount of time getting to where you are only to find that you have to change at the very end. Even a fundamental change is still adaptable. If you find that adapting does not suit you, you always have the option of leaving the format and go play monopoly or Quake or go fish.<P>The constructive criticism enters here. If you don't approve, state why you don't approve and move on. If you refuse to move on, you need a different way to spend your time. If you want the game to be YOUR way, either go make your own, or accept that sometimes you can't win. It seems what you consider perserverance I consider unconstructive. Flames, whines, and general grumpiness or invective solve NOTHING except to appease your... well, your ego.<P>Maybe I'm just good at accepting what I'm given. I think I'm happier that way. If I don't like it, I am free to reject or accept it at my leisure. Here are some cliche's to help you through this.<P>Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.<BR>When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.<BR>Haitian prostitutes are good company, but not for long.<P>H.C.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Why Bitterness,<BR>I will give you my reasons. When I started playing the game I was given the understanding that any player or char could be played to level 50 with or with out a group. The game stated play with or without a group in your free time. That was all I read. Granted it was not everthing I should have read but it was what i did read. So I decided to play a ranger. I created a ranger based upon my understanding of what a ranger was. As the game to my understanding was much the same as the Knights of Arthur and the quest that of much the same as Monty Python and his search for the holy grail, a simple direct approach for what information which I had. I had never played online games before and knew little of the so called balanced system of game play. <BR> I chose the ranger for the ranger was a seaker of truth, of faith, and was a knight of the old code of values. Trained in the use of weapons, and faithful to his Lord. He grew strong in both body and sprit. The strength of his body would be refelcted in his weapons and the strength of his sprit in the mana and the magic he would project.<BR> I did not realize that he could not become a knight, but the only knights in the game are the Pallys. When I found out I almost left the game as I thought all players were allowed to acheive the honor of knighthood, this is when I started to understand that the values I had assuned and the real values were not the same. At that point I decided to achieve to be not born of royal  blood but to achieve the highest rank allowed as a ranger , and to one of the finest rangers that  ever played the game. In the time that I have played almost 200 days game time I had aquired the 42 level. Most of which was solo game play, much by my own choice as I do not know how long i shall have time to play I do not beleive in the disruption of others for 5 min of play for my char. In this time I have seen the rangers nerfed , nerfed , and nerfed again. I have seen the so called great bow, be as worthless a weapon as ever one was created. I carry a skill of 195 archery, using a raincaller bow, which i quested at 40, dmg 20  dly 47 range 200 using damage 8 magic (1.5pp each) arrows which I fletched with a fletching skill of 192 hit a mob for 1 hp of damage. <BR>Or I go to Velious, where the mobs are blue to me and I can not afford to play because there is no cash drop and the rarity of item drops will not allow a cash flow to replenish the supplies which I use. <BR>Becasue I do not sit and camp, mobs for either exp or money, I have been hard pressed to have enough money to purchase addition weapons. If I am in a group I only normally loot 1 in 6 of those we kill. And as a ranger very few skills produce any items of value for sell. I placed my money into fletching to produce high damage arrows which do not produce high level damage. A dmg 3 hooked normally produces better results than a dmg 8 magic. I can't give TP's or Rez, to get large sums of money, so i have to loot what is killed. Which has made the new expansion a worthless place for me to be solo.<BR>  But there is the rub, solo. Verant, says they offer value for value. The higher the risk the better the loot. This is bogus, or a flat out lie which ever you prefer. If any one has ever done the ranger quest in Vironia Fie can tell you it is a flat out lie. Latley I have been reading much of the information as to the idea of what is game balance, but I beleive it was Brad that said , it is not in the best interest of the game to allow solo play, and no one should be allowed to level to 60 solo. The game would not last 6 months if they allowed solo game play. <BR>  So now I understand, The game will never be a game where I can play for self satifaction, It is not designed to be a game of pleasure but a game of frustration. I do not gain pleasure of sitting in a spot and committing  mass slaughter to gain exp so I may become a better killer. The exp to growth when I solo results in 7 additional hours to regain exp from one death. Then I made a mistake the other dy while playing I went into Keasora, at level 42 solo. When I did come out I had lost 2 full levels of exp. But what I found out was  not only had I lost the levels to creatures which were 7 levels below me, my new skills were now lost back to the level I had now been reduced to. So I will be a level 40 max instead of the 42 I had earned. so archery is instead of being 192 is now back to 188.<BR>  So I guess I have just reached the point that I have had enough of the frustration of playing. So the bitterness that I have is because the game play has taken the heart of the game from me, and that I resent. <BR>So before you all start your flaming, I have prepaid for 11 more days then I will be cancelling my account so there is no need to bust my chops. <BR>   <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You can convince Verant to make it your way, or try, but that's about it. If you don't get something your way there is no reason to cry about it, or assume it is a personal affront to you. If Verant doesn't wish to publicly respond to your request, it's not a slap in the face. If Verant determines that the game is to be played the way they see fit, that's it. They aren't an authority figure people. There's nothing to rebel against.

</FONT><HR>Ashby1861, Good for you!<P>You have made the right choice, you should quit. Everquest is definitely no the game for you. For consistency issues I recommend Diablo II as a substitute. You can do all the soloing you want there. Not so much in the way of questing, but... Warhammer has a great deal of cool games which I think you'd like. They are not very solo oriented, but they sound like your kind of game. And of course console RPG's are a terrific alternative.

Cazic skin doesn't drop often enough. The uber-rare spawn shouldn't have a place holder or should spawn at least twice a day. The purpose of the quests was to make it fun to get stuff, you know, a challenge. It was not meant to be the goal of everquest. &gt;&gt;<P>How "fun" do you suppose it is for the level 50ish guilds who WANT to camp Hate and Fear for their armor, weapons, and god encounters to find them occupied nearly all the time by the 60ish guilds who DO NOT WANT to be there but are forced to be because Verant put epic components on excruciatingly rare drop tables and once-a-week god mobs?  Put the shoe on the other foot, and the picture looks different, doesn't it?<P>The complaints I have seen are not that "I want my epic, wah."  The most well-thought-out ones point out that "I will eventually get my epic, but it is ludicrous that I am having to do so at the expense of other players who really really WANT to be in the place we have to monopolize."<P>Just food for thought; I'd suggest re-reading some of the complaints in that light.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;My answer is, simply put, adapt and move on. Instead of complaining that it used to be one way, now it's different, why don't you just change?&lt;&lt;<P>Because I don't have to.  I am a dedicated, paying customer, and, as such, I have every right to voice criticism.  Do you just blindly, quietly accept whatever any company sells you out in the world. (That's a rhetorical question.)  The people who puzzle me most are those like you who get so bothered when someone criticizes something.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
