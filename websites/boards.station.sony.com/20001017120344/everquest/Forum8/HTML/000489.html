</FONT><HR>I think folks are going way to the extreme on this cultural armor thing, and blowing it way out of proportion.  It is no big thing, it will not effect your ability to make it as a smith, make money, and Yak is absolutely correct on this. <P>It is not that big a deal. Sure I would like the woodelves to have a cultural chain (we are rangers after all), but it is not something that the "culture" would be into. (I have a high level woodelf smith btw).<P>Cultural armor is based on the culture. Dwarves mine, wood elves live in trees. A wood elf could become a fine smith, but that would be an individual choice-not a cultural thing. The wood elf people live in trees and work with what they have (as a culture). They would use wood, stones, hides. They would employ the bow and arrow made from stones and wood-firing at enemies from the tree tops or ambushing them in the underbrush.<P>Dwarves live underground, they mine as a culture. They would fight their enemies on the ground, in the open, they wold need heavy metal armors. It only makes sense that they would have developed cultural, finely made armors.<P>Bottom line here is that it all makes perfect sense. If I want to keep my wood elf smithing, there is no problem. I can make the profitable armors all I want. But I am not born to smithing so I don't have that auto advantage, and my culture does not have in it a specific armor. I can buff my str if need be to make up for that, but I can't change my culture simply because I want to be different anymore then a German can change his culture because he likes spaghetti, or an Italian because he likes sushi. <P>Its just not in the culture.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Get over your hard as rock attitude that nothing can change and let those of us that have concerns voice them without all the trolling.&gt;&gt;<P>*Sigh*<P>1. You seem to through that "troll" phrase around quite a bit-mostly when someone disagrees with you. Just a little FYI here friend. I have been posting on this board since it was created, I have been playing the game since beta.<P>If you disagree, that is fine. Voice your opinion anyway you want. I have no problem with that. I might agree, might disagree, but I never try to shut someone up by attacking them (hint, hint). <P>I always try to keep it on an adult, or atleast mature level. Flaming only tells me that someone cannot support Thier argument, and therfore attempt to degrade the poster rather than attack the post. Don't work  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>2. The curlture is, and has been written in stone since beta. I doubt it will change now. Its just too complexed. I dont even think that is up for question. <P>That part effects me also. As I said, I have a wood elf smith myself, but woodelves are tree folk who live in the woods of Faydark. Dwarves are underground dwellers who toil with the earth. They ARE miners-Kaladim is a mining community. <P>If you have an argument to change that, I would not mind hearing it, but I think it would be hard to do without a complete redesign of both kaladim and faydark, which would include eliminatiing some of the classes from each (which would really go over big im sure LOL).<P>Beyond that, I can understand peoples frustration here. This should have been established long ago, but I tend to look that the bigger picture, and the brighter side. Smithing will be fixed, and EVERY Race will be able to make armor, profit from armor. <P>The only issue here is the curltural armors (which Yak has stated are not profit bearing items anyway). So yes, I still believe this cultural issue is way out of proportion to its effect on players (including my smith) and the game. Its just not that big a deal, and I believe we are looking at the glass as 1/4 empty rather than 3/4 full. <P>That is my opinion. I explained it, and I stand by it. I would be interested in hearing yours, beyond simply saying that mine is wrong. And in no way will  I attempt to flame or belittle it-whether I agree or not.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Anyhow, as for Wood Elf smithing, how much you wanna bet we are gonna see Mithril bowstaves being produced by WoodElves using the Smithing skill?  (making it into a bow will require fletching, nat)  Mithril Arrowheads?  Mithril Reinforced Bonings and Studs?  None of which will have low trivial levels?<P>Yes, as a master smith of some of the races, you won't be able to make your Cultural Armor directly.  But all the new Cultural Tailors, Fletchers, etc, will be _swarming_ over you.  Getting smithing up to 50 to make bonings and studs is one thing, but getting it to 200 is another - a very many tailors/fletchers will want to buy the raw materials off of _you_ rather than skill up.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>BowHawkin,<BR>  You been playing since beta and posting here since beta...cool...what does that have to do with anything?  It seemed to me that you totally ignored what Loudent was saying and trolled him...sounded to me like you were slamming his opinion and I stand corrected there. I apologize for saying you were trolling.  That doesn't change that fact that VI can make ANYTHING make perfect sense, EVEN if that means they change their own version of history.<BR>  You are incorrect IMO as far as the history of norrath being set in stone since beta.  This is a game....all of a sudden VI could possibly decide that there really are UFO's in Nro desert and that they formed the world in some huge terriforming process...not that the dragons had anything to do with it (watched the intro one too many times I guess hehe).<P>My point about the history not set in stone is this...EQ is a game that VI can change on a whim and NO it's not set in stone...ever...the changing of tradeskills and the constant nerfs (good and bad) are proof to this.<P>As to how they can smith cultural plate or chain I have offered many possible solutions to this...I never said that wood elves had to mine the ore...but they can use it...VI has already implemented this..we can make banded...we can now make fine steel (which is really cool and I'm glad we can..VERY happy with this upgrade as far as that goes).<P>But to use yours and VI's realm of fantasy then they are not being very consistent.  Elves (ALL ELVES) should be the very very best in making that mystical Elven chain that I have read in many different fantasy books where ...it has mystical properties that could have only been enchanted by the elves...stuff like that.  So we are left behind the 8-ball to an extent.  Happy with the upgrade - yes.  Happy about not being able to make cultural plate/chain - no...and not even so much for the plate as for the chain but (strictly tradeskill minded here) I would like to do the plate for our race...and if you keep in tune with the history that VI themselves have written and POSTED on the EQ website then they are contradicting themselves...example:<P>&gt;&gt;The High Elves are much more intellectual than their Woodland kin, and are the "royalty" of the Elven races (with the exception of their Dark brethren). <P>If the high elves are royalty and more intellectual then why would they dirty their hands making my cultural plate/armor?  Seems to me that they would be much more inclined to not even pick up the smithy hammer but more happy to go scribe scrolls or something "intellectual".<P>&gt;&gt;They equal the High Man in their intelligence and wisdom, but are much more fair and charismatic.<P>This is the description of wood elves that VI has posted.  They themselves state that we are just as smart as high elves which translates to me as being more than capable of learning the ability.<P>You can argue why would wood elves decide to pick up the hammer as well, seeing how they are more in tune with nature.  To that extent I agree...but that is my point...they COULD decide to pick up the smithy hammer and make cultural plate...it is a choice that has yet been "written in stone".  Show me where it's written in stone and I'll drop the issue.  VI can change it if they see the logic that it IS possible...but they have to be dynamic enough to say OK it could happen and not be so closed minded like a lot of people out there.<BR>And culturally I say that wood elves can most definitely have developed race specific chain - ever watch the movie Legend with Tom Cruise?  Fantasy movie based on the whole fantasy genre.  What armor did the little pixy go into the tunnel and find? ...You guessed it ELVEN CHAIN....can't tell who made it other than ELVES...I am wood elf...I AM included in this definition...<P>Also doesn't it say in the char creation screen (not at home while writing this obviously) that the high elves tend to not want to mingle with the other elves so again why would they make wood elf cultural plate/chain?  Correct me if I'm wrong about this...and I will go look at it when I get home too anyway hehe.<P>Anyways if I'm ranting then I'm sorry...I just feel that every race has a unique culture to it...a culture that is not limited by what product it can produce...you can't tell me that a wood elf blacksmith, that LOVES his trade wouldn't try to be the best he could be.  You can't tell me that he wouldn't try to improve upon process...refining them and possibly adding magical NATURE related enchantments to it. Possibly making it so that only the elves would gain the benefit from using it, seeing how they are in tune with nature.  Would this NOT constitue a cultural chain/plate?  Since you are not a wood elf then you can not possibly be as in tune with nature as us therefore you cannot use the armor we make because you will gain no benefit from it or magical property from using it.<P>And yet again I show that it would be possible for the wood elves to make their own cultural chain/plate...after all this is fantasy right?<P>Those additions Sir Yak would be cool in their own right.  And (with VI's NEW and IMPROVED vision of the wood elves) would probably be very much in tuned with what cultural type of stuff they could make.  Sounds neat.  If I have to change my tradeskill then I will, if they make it interesting enough to me.  I choose being a blacksmith because it was interesting to me and yes I will make fine steel plate and be happy about that...YAY I CAN FINALLY MAKE PLATE ARMOR!!!! ...I am genuinely happy about that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I dont want to make everyone's cultural plate/chain...just my own...if that sounds like I want to be able to "do it all without the help from others" then you people have very limited views.  Components that require several groups to acquire (how is that doing it all??)...getting other components that can only be made by other races (how is that doing it all??)  And here's a suggestion that might even make the interdependancy point happen without the use of mules:  This component that I need that is only made by race X is a no drop component...they can only either destroy the component or put it in the forge.  Don't know if the current game engine would allow for this or just how difficult the coding could be but wouldn't that make it next to impossible for one person to do it all (unless of course they have more than one account)?<BR>Well now that I'm out of breath I will let this issue die...not to satisfy trolls out there and not to satisfy anyone else except myself in the fact that VI can change things if they really want to and I will wait to see all these changes unfold.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
