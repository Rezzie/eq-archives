</FONT><HR>re;  Someone suggested mem-blur as a substitute for a pet back off command......Doesn/t work that way.<P><BR>Scenrio one:  Mob and Pet engaged, want to mez/ enthrall mob.  I cast mez on mob, pet continues attack and breaks mez...Mana wasted, nothing gained.   Moral:  Cant mez mob with pet attacking it.<P>Scenario two:  Mob and Pet engaged, want to mez/ entrall mob.   Cast mem blur on Pet, pet stops attacking.  Before I can either get mez spell off or pet can move out of attack radius, it gets hit again, putting mob back on its hate list and negating mem-blur.  Moral:  Cant mem-blur a pet engaged with an active mob, cause it will go back on hate list too fast.  ANother option would be a pet only (ideally non-targeted spell that automatically hits enchanters pet without needing to be targeted) that does the same thing....Costs another slot (but would be low mana), and it would basically stop the pets attack and mem-blur it at the same time (and this mem-blur would take effect at the END of the duration, so that mobs that attack DURING the (short) duration would be forgotten.  This spell could be cast first to 'freeze' the pet, followed by a mez...At which point the 'freeze' ends and the pet returns to inactive state, having forgotten about the now-mezzed mobs.<P>How again do I use mem-blur to do this?<P>Idea....Enchanter Pets DO NOT maintain a hate list.  Attack mobs that ATTACK the enchanter only (which can be cleared by mem-blur if the mob is not attacking the enchanter),  but DO NOT remember mobs that attack the pet directly.  Result of this...Mob goes to attack mobs that attack the enchanter (as they now do), but will not engage mobs that attack them (note, this does leave them vulnerable to multiple wimpy mobs, as they will not change targets once the first one drops...but that is a sacrifice that is prob worthwhile in order to get a pet that doesnt break your mezzes.<BR>  <P>The Pet Stop command (which freezes the pet for a brief period of time- as suggested above) would also work, as that would allow you to mez the mobs during that time and THEN memblur the pet.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>AuntieShaynta wrote:<P>&gt;”THERE AIN'T NO FREAKING "VIRTUALLY" IN BRAD'S DIRECT PROMISE THAT WE'LL ENCHANT WEAPONS!”&lt;<P>Fair enough.  But I also don’t want you to expect that item enchantment will be a result of these lists.  It’s a big project, and it’s not really the kind of thing that is the topic of these lists.<P>Mavra wrote:<P>&gt;”I have several complaints about this list, but one stands out above all others and shall be what I address. You state that we should not get the undead illusions and such because you feel that is the realm of the Necormancer and it should not cross class lines and yet you are talking about giving Bards better crowd control. My question to you is, what does an Enchanter have that is now unique to their class (and do not say the enchant metal and mana line of spells because those have nothing to do with being wanted or required in a group). <BR>I would like an answer to this question, and feel we Enchanters are entitled to it.”&lt;<P>Simple.  Because ‘crowd control’ is an area of gameplay the needs to be spread around to help groups in combat situations.  Because there should never be a time when one class becomes ‘essential’ for anything more than a few situations.  Bards having crowd control helps everyone looking to create a group.<P>Illusions are, for the most part, amusement spells.  They don’t affect gameplay to the same degree that a lack of crowd control does.   Allowing bards better crowd control _might_ make gameplay better, might fix a problem with the game.  Giving enchanters the ability to turn into undead does not help any gameplay issues.<P>Anyway, keep in mind that this is only a list.  And there is very little chance that the team will want to remove those illusions.<P>Rothi-MT wrote:<P>&gt;”Let's get the real concerns dealt with first before lessening our chances with trivialities.”&lt;<P>Not a problem.  The team can easily distinguish trivial from important.<P>Sutatnac wrote:<P>&gt;”An item I saw on the necromancer list would be appropriate for ours as well. Necromancers said they want more of a variety for spell icons besides the skull. Enchanters also have 1 icon for just about every spell we cast in dungeons - the brain icon. A little variety would be nice.”&lt;<P>That request is basically a request for more icons overall.  It had to go someplace, and it seems most applicable for necromancers.<P>LuckyDaCharmz wrote:<P>&gt;”Issue #1 - *** was this thread started in the casters forum instead of in the main forum??? Were you trying to slip it by us??????? “&lt;<P>Nope.  I just don’t think these things need to clog up that gameplay board.  And they are much easier to find and follow if they are on these boards.<P>&gt;”Issue #2 - Why are group illusions not considered a priority? As of right now there seems to be very few illusions that are granted too us that are ONLY available to enchanters. This combined with the fact that our titles imply that we are all about illusions despite the fact that our last illusions come at lvl 44. Group non-race illusions should be given to us and NOT *****ed about. Just throw it up on test and see if we are out of balance.”&lt;<P>They are not a priority because they are not a balance issue.  It’s a fine idea, but the idea here is not to just think up cool new things, but to look at balance.  The cool things are on the list, though, because they are cool.<P>Feanim wrote:<P>&gt;” * lack of items to protect us better ( we are at the front line much more than any casters AC and HP are very important for us)”&lt;<P>Well, the reason it’s not listed is pretty simple.  In order to give Enchanters enough armor class and hit points to survive the kind of situations that they get into, they’d have to have armor and hit points to match warriors.  You all know that playing an enchanter is dangerous.  Giving them more hit points and more armor wouldn’t change that, unless it was enough AC and HPs to make them truly out of balance.<P>zel45 wrote:<P>&gt;” ITEM: Failure Messages.<BR>Add memory blur to that list. Succeed or fail it returns the message "a mob blinks"&lt;<P>Got it.<P>Silh wrote:<P>&gt;”behind ? How do I give them a rusty weapon then ? “&lt;<P>Good point.  Maybe a little off to one side or the other then.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;” It happens only when you break charm whith invisibility. Do it with strip enchantment and there is no problem. It seems invis breaks charm but somewhere in the code you forget to tell the message sender that charm isnt working anymore and it acts as if charm continue to work its full duration. “&lt;<P>Thanks.<P>&gt;”The only illusion I would like to see. I dont understand where the faction issue is. When I came to upper guk the first time I wasn't kos. After some kills I was. Is there major troubles in this dungeon because of this unfair advantage ?”&lt; <P>Yes.  Because if you can turn into one of the residents of any dungeon, city or whatever, you would be able to go anywhere.  Yes, enchanters can fiddle with their faction.  They can go several places that others can’t.  But a spell like this would allow them to go anywhere.  That would be a major trouble.  No, we can’t just make it so that using the illusion does NOT change your faction.  The faction system is complicated, and it can’t just flip on and off.  For now, this can’t be done.<P>Remelio Gemweaver wrote:<P>&gt;”Patiently awaiting the high MR in Velious problem thread.”&lt;<P>No, no, you misunderstand.  There won’t be a thread on this.  I understand the issue, the team understands the issue.  I listed this separately because it affects more than one class, not because we need a whole new thread on it.  It’s effectively on all the lists...<P>Sabelle_SoS wrote:<P>&gt;”Add to this please: These area affect spells should not affect PCs. As it is, when cast everyone in the area is spammed with the message of each PC in the area blinking, while in truth the only effect is on the NPCs. Stop Blanket of Forgetfullness from giving a message for each PC in range, to lessen spam.”&lt;<P>Sure.<P>Spurious wrote:<P>&gt;” Absor, please explain what this means. Of the items you listed, all the most important ones to me are met with this phrase as the status.”&lt;<P>It means pretty much what it says.  I’ve noted the items that are not balance issues and are more like wish list items.  Good ideas for future use, not something that needs to be done now.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>These are my thoughts on your list of enchanter improvements.<P>The DoT Pet:<P>We dont need this. Yes, during the final epic fight we are buff machines only and we may go in and cast Tash and Recant Magic. We dont need to contribute to the final fight, because unlike Necromancers we were VITALLY important to getting to that fight in the first place. Besides, if you made it so that anytime we tried to melee a monster while we had a pet up, it would solve this problem anyways. We arent a pet class, and while the changes to pets hurt us too, it only hurt our limited ability to solo (That is why we have the stupid things). When people are parsing logs for those epic fights and it shows that XXXX melee class has done Ungodly amounts of damage, what they fail to realise is that about 1/3 of that damage is OURS, given to them through speed buffs, and other abilities.<P>Illusion: Spirit Wolf<P>Although this is a nice Illusion and isnt like Druid wolf form because we are transparent while in this form, I can understand having this taken away from us. (I DONT like it, but I do understand). My suggestion would be to take this Illusion away and replace it with Illusion: Ice Bone. The reason for this is that Wolf form is a signature of the Druid class, whereas SKELETON form ISNT the signature of the Necromancer, LICHE is. ANYONE can turn into a Skeleton, all that it takes is a drop from Cazic Thule. If you do make this change, be sure to make it castable indoors again. And this spell will become useful again for us. If we dont lose this Illusion under NO circumstances give us a Spirit of the Wolf effect from this Illusion. We are a group class, and spirit of the wolf from an illusion does nothing but increase our ability to solo. It would unbalance our class, and if we want SoW, the only thing we have to do is shout "Trading SoW for Clarity". And if no changes are made to this spell, giving us the ability to cast it indoors again would be nice. That was taken from us a long time ago because this illusion used to set us to Beta-Neutral faction, and this really did give us the ability to go anywhere. Now that it has been set to wolf faction, giving back our cast anywhere ability shouldnt hurt us. Or just have it set us to Beta-Neutral again.<P>The Lull Line:<P>Believe it or not, I suggest removing this line completely from both Clerics and Enchanters. And making it the sole province of the Paladin class. If you did this, and gave it a lifetap like resistance check, and made it ONLY castable indoors, this would give paladin class a niche that they could have to themselves and might put that class back into demand for dungeon adventure crews again. Start it at level 9 for them and crown it off at level 60 with Wake of Tranquility. Hades if you made these spells UNRESISTABLE it may not be unbalancing if only paladin's have access to them.<P>Whirl Till You Hurl and Din's Dizzing Draught:<P>Two suggestions here. First, make them a single target stun with a duration of 2 seconds for Whirl and 4 seconds for Din's, thus giving Enchanters the ability to stun a single target. OR make these a stun DoT, with a small (5 point) reduction to Intelligence and Wisdom on the target and a 0 second casting interrupt initial hit and 2 ticks of duration for Whirl, and 4 ticks for Din's. The reason for the small INT and WIS hits is to make these a multiple component spell so they are resisted more often.<P>Tash Agro.<P>Before the Epic Quest Monsters were introduced into the game, I really had no trouble with the agro effect of the Tash Line. Yes, it was a mega taunt. ALL of our spells are mega taunts, it is one of the trade offs of having the power we do in combat situations. The problem is is when we cast these spells on monsters that are part of any classes Epic Weapon quest (And maybe Velious Monsters as well) The agro effect of this line seems to be GROSSLY exageratted on those monsters. So much so that when I cast Tash on Shissar's Wraith in Fear when it was at 50% life, it came over and ate me, despite the efforts of 20+ tanks trying to taunt it off. But in general play (Outside of Velious) the agro of this line of spells is fine.<P>As for the comment of us needing armor. No we dont want armor and hit point items that would allows us to do are job with impunity, but it WOULD be VERY nice to see some items perhaps comparable to the Necromancer's Flayed Skin line from Kunark what most casters are asking for is armor that is NOTICABLY better than the stuff we hauled out of Fear and Hate over a year ago. Armor that got equivalent upgrades like melee and priest classes did between EverQuest (TM) and the Kunark expansion or Velious expansion. Think about introducing this upgraded armor into Charasis or Chardok (Empty Kunark zones for the most part except when raided for Epic pieces) and then upping the AC of the Velious armor slightly to match it. A suggestion for this armor is as follows:<P>Chest: AC 18 stats the same as our Planier robes with maybe adding some more Hit Points or Mana or resistances.<P>Gloves: AC 7<BR>Sleeves: AC 12<BR>Helm: AC 10<BR>Boots: AC 8<BR>Legs: AC 15<BR>Bracers: AC 7<BR>Belt: Make the Sludge Girdle from Sebilis wearable by casters.<BR>Face: AC 5<BR>Shoulders, backs, and neck slot items are all fine from a Kunark perspective.<BR>And if you kept the exact same stats from these items and put them on our Velious items, with minor effects, most casters would be happy. <P>The problem is though is this still wouldnt balance casters versus melee in Velious. (Not just counting resistances either). In order to solve that problem, Verant needs to create some items that make casters better by percentage increases, just as melee gets better by percentage increases from their weapons.<P>Now for two suggestions that werent on your list:<P>The Winds of Tash line that we get Post 50. I dont know about most enchanters, but I do 95% of my work in the middle of a crowd of monsters. and it is not unheard of for me to target myself with our AE Mez to mez the monsters around me. My suggestion is to either change the Winds line to be Point Blank Area of Effect Tashs OR to introduce 2 more Tashs post 50 that are Point Blank AE. The reason I ask for this is that the Tash line lowers MR, and if I cast the winds line in a normal situation, I will end up Tashing myself, which makes the AE Mez that I am about to cast a much more dangerous option because I increase the likelyhood that I will now mez myself.<P>And going hand in hand with the above suggestion is giving us a Point Blank AE mezmerize line. This line would start at 29 with a PBAE mesmerization (18 second mez) get an upgrade at 49 with a PBAE Enthrall (36 second mez) and a final upgrade at 60 with a PBAE Glamore of Kintaz (36 second mez). The reason I didnt suggest removing are current AE mez lines is that there are situations (about 5% of the time) where we really do need to reach out and mez things. The reason that Glamore is the level 60 spell as opposed to Entrance is that at 60 Entrance wont effect the things that we need it to do. A suggested mana cost for this line is 200, 400, and 600 mana respecively for each spell.<P>Sassnik Dreameweaver, Level 53 High Elven Illusionist, Tunare (Krieger)<BR>SkillsMistress of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor responded to a question about why adding better CC ability to bards was not a problem but having undead illusions was as far as class distinction goes.<P>&gt;Simple. Because ‘crowd control’ is an area of gameplay the needs to be spread around to help groups in combat situations. Because there should never be a time when one class becomes ‘essential’ for anything more than a few situations. Bards having crowd control helps everyone looking to create a group.&lt;<P>While your thoughts behind the issue make sense in the fact that it's true, illusions do not truely affect balance when it comes right down to it in a fight, the problem is crowd controll (CC) is the main job of an enchanter.   We pay for the ability to be masters of CC with very low HP, very low AC, a pet that I refer to as my escape speedbump, and the  honor of being the first to die when things go horribly wrong.<P>I have a list of a dozen dozen or so people that I *will not* group with because after multiple attempts to explain mez to them and while screaming at them during the fight to STOP attacking something and use /assist they were unable to understand how to not get me killed.  Because in the end, when someone keeps breaking my mez im the one who's going to die, it's not the bard with his armor, nor is it the bard with his heal song, nor is it the bard with his HAUL a.. speed song, nor is it the bard with the instarecharm charm song, or the bard with tons more hp and weapons and attack skills that actually do damage and hit things.<P>Bards already have a ton of things they can do that enchanters can never do, they already have a ton of skills and abilities that their class gives them that would make them the undisputed champions of CC if you were to give them our powers.<P>In essence what your asking for is us to tell you it's a good idea (it's not) to make us as wanted in a group post 16/29 as we were back in east commons at the orc camps.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The problem is a little bigger than there being no tiny daggers in Qeynos.<P>The problem is that there is no real enchanter guild in Qeynos.  Sure, there is a trainer and a few spell venders, but a lot is missing.  The reason is that there seems to be 2 shops in one: the enchanter guild and the potion venders.  There are about 6 venders in one small building (the enchanter guild) and half of them sell spells and half sell potions.  It is apparent that this is a bug since 2 venders practically stand on top of eachother.

</FONT><HR>-&gt;Absor <BR>Fair enough. But I also don’t want you to expect that item enchantment will be a result of these lists. It’s a big project, and it’s not really the kind of thing that Is the topic of these lists. <BR>&lt;-<P><BR>Really don’t care I’ve been playing since launch the promise has been made so many times I am convinced we will never see this.  If we do the added benefit will be of so little value as to be pointless.<P>-&gt;Absor<BR>Simple. Because ‘crowd control’ is an area of gameplay the needs to be spread around to help groups in combat situations. Because there should never be a time when one class becomes ‘essential’ for anything more than a few situations. Bards having crowd control helps everyone looking to create a group. <BR>&lt;-<P><BR>Don’t care one bit about illusions, okay they are fun but you nerfed them so much to be of any real use, some are ok now and then.<P>But my warning is this, if you take away crowd control and give it to a plate wearing class which is just about to get 252 defence, watch how many enchanters quit the game or start playing rogues, warriors or clerics.  It’s already happening, you make this change and there will 50 chanters a server if you’re lucky.  I can guarantee this because I would stop playing mine; I already refuse to play a buff whore in velious.<BR>If your intent is to kill the Enchanter class then go right ahead if you don’t want to kill the chanter class think very very hard about what else we can do.<P>Now the truth is, if you seriously want to solve a lot of problems that stand today get rid of the idea of every mob over a certain level being able to summon players.  If you do this you give Shamans, clerics any class with root their ability to root park again i.e. crowd control and add the ability for enchanters to avoid a lot of damage by mobs continuously summoning them for casting one tashan spell.  <P>-&gt;Absor<BR>Nope. I just don’t think these things need to clog up that gameplay board. And they are much easier to find and follow if they are on these boards. <BR>&lt;-<P>Well done it always baffled me why you didn’t start them here to begin with.<P>-&gt;Absor<BR>Well, the reason it’s not listed is pretty simple. In order to give Enchanters enough armor class and hit points to survive the kind of situations that they get into, they’d have to have armor and hit points to match warriors. You all knowthat playing an enchanter is dangerous. Giving them more hit points and more armor wouldn’t change that, unless it was enough AC and HPs to make them truly out of balance. <BR>&lt;-<P>Not true, things that annoy me greatly on equipment front. <P>1. Equipment you give to Necros another pure casting class.  This class gets lots of Necro only useable items, why is this it’s truly irritating.<P>An example of items I would love that only necros of the casting classes only can wear.<P>Flayed paebala tunic, 28ac 5int 10str 20Pr<BR>Flayed paebala leggings, 15ac 6int 20hp 20mana 20Dr<P>These with the added benefit that necros can be Iksars who get a racial AC bonus is a kick in the face to all other pure casters.<P><BR>2. Kunark then Velious equipment<P>Very few caster items, those that are available are not much better than was available in the original game, whilst EVERYONE else except but pure casters got massive improvements. WHY this is, is truly bizarre.<P>Examples<P>Cleric<BR>Old world <BR>Ethereal Mist chestplate – 28 ac, 15sta, 15wis, 25hp, 25mana<BR>Kunark <BR>Donals chestplate – 40ac, 12agi, 12dex, 12wis, 80mana – effect:CH<BR>Velious   <BR>Chestplate of stability – 42ac +7 STA, +13 WIS, +5 INT, +50 HP, +60 MANA, +2 FR, +3 DR, +3 CR, +7 MR, +2 PR Effect: Celestial Elixer<P>Warrior<BR>Old World<BR>Indicolite Breastplate -AC: 35+15 STR, +15 DEX, +15 STA<BR>Kunark<BR>Cobalt Breastplate - AC: 45+12 STR, +12 DEX, +12 STA, +50 HP Effect: Invigorate<BR>Velious <BR>Berserker's Breastplate - AC: 47 +14 STR, +5 DEX, +10 STA, +7 AGI, +90 HP, +10 FR, +4 MR Effect: Invigorate<P>Nice improvements now we have <P>Enchanters<BR>Old World<BR>Insidious Robe AC: 11, +8 DEX, +10 STA, +3 CHA, +13 INT, +35 MANA<BR>Kunark<BR>Nothing to speak of<BR>Velious<BR>Resplendent Robe AC: 12, +5 STA, +7 CHA, +14 INT, +60 HP, +60 MANA, +5 CR, +5 DR, +5 FR, +5 MR, +5 PR Effect: Rune IV<P>Miniscule improvements<P>3. Reward verses risk<P>Why do you insist on creating items that no one would want to wear, some of the items in the alter planes I wouldn’t have wore at level 20 never mind level 46.  I give you…<P>Resplendent Slippers, Resplendent Trousers, Resplendent Wristguard<P>Utter junk and this is just a small sample, where is the risk reward.   The other classes outside of the casting classes actually want their planar legs, shoes and bracers, we don’t and this should never be the case.<P>Defence cap<P>Simple increase it to 175 you can’t just keep upping the level of MOB’s from the original game and not increase the defence of classes.  Even this small boost would allow us to survive sometimes; we don’t need the defence or hp of warriors. Although laughingly you are talking about giving our crowd control to bards.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a wizard but would like to see any caster class response to what i posted on the wizard board and hopefully whomever might be looking at this class.<P>TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA ABSOR<P>ITEM: mana regeneration <P>THIS is a REQUIRED for all casters NOW to begin the balance of the caster versus melee imbalance that exists. This is needed for all levels as the trickle down of better gear pre-kunark to melee class has skewed the basic caster melee equation into the low thirties. The trickle down of gear from velious is just beginning and its effects will further skew this imbalance to even lower levels and make the midlevels worse than they are now.<P>A token fix here will produce no good results. You guys study this in combination with efficiency and resists to ALL casters. This is not an option but a necessity in the entire life of the caster.<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency<P>SEE ABOVE AND IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CASTER CLASSES FROM ONE TO SIXTY FOR THE SAME REASONS. Forget about the damage of mages, druids, and necros compared to wizards. FIX the caster imbalance first then work on the individual class differences in your vision of them. DO NOT<BR>fix class imbalance before you fix the basic caster=melee imbalance. <P>The scientific method (and its clear you are not using this) requires that the basic sides of an equation must be equal first, then changes to one side of that equation must be met by an opposite but equal change on the other side of the equation.<P>YOU have a basic desing flaw now because of a lack of understanding of the basic equation for the game. YOU FIXED ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SINCE BEFORE KUNARK WAS BEING DESIGNED AND NEVER TOUCHED THE CASTER SIDE. KUNARK AND POST 50 PLAY INCREASED THAT GAP. STILL FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND INEFFECTIVE CASTER FIXES(NON RECOGNITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OF THE ORIGINAL FLAW STILL WORKING ITS WAY DOWN) PUSHED THE ENVELOPE FURTHER AS VELIOUS WAS RELEASED. <P>SURELY YOU REALIZE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE CASTER FIXES WERE NICE, THEY WERE WAY BEHIND THE MELEE CURVE FOR BALANCE.<P>VEILIOUS AND ITS INEVITABLE TRICKLE DOWN WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.<P>BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION IF YOU CAN,THEN WORRY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES. THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES AND YOU MUST BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE CLASS BALANCE.<P>ITEM: Percentage damage spells<P>Same as above.<P>ITEM: Level cap on spells<P>Put same level cap on melee where they simple cannot damage a mob at all or remove it from the caster side of the equqation.<P>ITEM: Alkabor<P>This has nothing to do with balance, forget about it. They suck and you cant fix em. The game is not geared to ae play on any scale with overcrowded servers. It makes no sense to crowd an already crowded game.<P>ITEM: Flaming Sword<P>Leave it alone and we can let it go to last page of never used spells where it is now. NOT an issue for balancing the basic Melee Caster equation. Mages and Necros have their pet=better sword and thats just fine with me and prolly most wizards.<P>I mean, what the hell is the point of the thing??/<P>ITEM:Harvest<P>A WIZARD specific item that needs improvement but needs to be considered in with the basic caster melee equation and issuse in the first two items.<P>ITEM: RAIN spells<P>AGAIN refer to first two items. FIXING a specific damage spell needs to be considered within the basic melee caster equation first.<P>ITEM: Atol's <P>WHAT is the fizzle thing post 50 in a caster class that is way behind already. Fizzles got worse post kunark. ELIMINATE fizzles post 50. What is the point. Give a resonable explaination of this??????? What is the logic here for balance and fun.<P>LOOK AT FIZZLES ALONG WITH RESISTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST TWO ITEMS OF THIS POST AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, GET REAL.<P>ITEM:Snare/enstill<P>Most wizards never use em work on item one and two above first priority. To heck with em, none of this line is usefull to a wizard now. Fix them later, fix balance first.<P>ITEM: invis vs undead<P>A comment like " I dont know why wizards get this in the first place" is not reguarded as an answer unless followed by because ........<P>I don't know why a paladin, enchanter, etc etc get it either.<P>ITEM:TELEPORT<P>Not the basic problem fix in later<P>ITEM: fade, shadowstep, and yonder<P>DOH<P>ITEM:Evacs, Abscond etc<P>Secondary problem should have been fixed at implementation if they were tested at all by the test team. FIZZLES are incomprehensible as stated above.<P>ITEM: Melee Proof mobs<P>DOH DOH DOH Somebody get him off me??? Somebody get him off me ???? Whats the point here ?????<P>ITEM Diamond Rod<P>Most wizards could give a hoot. Balance the basics first, you have a ton of pre 50 play crap like this, fix it when you can. If you do anything let it cast mannaskin the preferred post 50 skin.<P>ITEM: Imbue fire opal<P>If you dont have the right god who cares??<P>ITEM: Eye of zomm<P>DOH. I have never used it for anything productive and this would probably be the case for most wizzies. BALANCE FIRST<P>ITEM: Damage spell variety, critical hits<P>TIE IN WITH THE BASIC IMBALANCE OF CASTER MELEE IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS POST.<P>ITEM: Lure spell for wizards<P>HERE IS THE DEFINING SPELL FOR WIZARDS FOR UBER MOBS MAKE IT BIGGER AND CUT THE RESISTS. WHY SHOULD A LEVEL 60 MOB RESIST IT IN AN ALREADY DEFICIENT CLASS. IT ISNT EVEN ALMOST IRRESISTABLE AS THAT IMPLIES SOME LARGE NUMBER OF HITS. IT IS FREQUENTLY RESISTED AND I GUESS THE LEVEL CAP IS STILL IN EFFECT POST 50. <P>AT 55 IN EPIC ENCOUNTERS YOU WILL BE RESISTED MORE THAN HALF THE TIME, EVEN IF YOU ARE USING THE "RIGHT" LURE. THIS IS NOT ALMOST BY ANY DEFINITION I CAN ASCERTAIN. THIS IS MORE LIKE "IT MIGHT HIT SOMETIMES WHEREAS ALL YOUR OTHER SPELLS WILL BE TOTALLY GUARANTEED RESISTED.<P><BR>FOR A CLASS THAT HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED SINCE BETA, THIS IS JUST NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FIX TO DEFINE THE WIZARD AND BOTH KUNARK AND VELIOUS POINT THIS OUT.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just my view on the things you've posted.<P>Kind regards,<P>Cixi.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Illusion, Wolf.<P>DESCRIPTION: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors (it is currently outdoors only). It should be noted that Enchanters have no foot-speed enhancement spells at this time.<P>STATUS: None<P>As it is, this spell has hardly any use. You could use it for faction issues, but Enchanters usually have better ways of dealing with that. There's not a lot of places where wolves are more welcome than anything else we have. Having a self-only foot-speed enhancement would be nice (we get this spell at 39, the age Rangers get Spirit of Wolf). Even if it was only as fast as the J-Boots I have right now.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Undead Illusions.<P>DESCRIPTION: These transformations could be considered the territory of the necromancer, and maybe they should be replaced with something else, or remove them from the enchanter spell list.<P>STATUS: None<P>I fail to see why this shouldn't be the territory of the enchanter. It's not because the theme is more fitting for Necromancers that Enchanters shouldn't have it. It's an Illusion, so it's for enchanters, as simple as that. If a Gnome can make you think he's an Ogre, he can just as well made you think he's a skeleton.<BR>Then again, if you're going to replace it with something usefull, go ahead. As it is, the illusions don't give any noticable faction changes, so there's little point to use it, except for the amusement of others.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Lull spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group. It seems that there should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro.<P>STATUS: None<P>Recently I've started a cleric who has this line of spells as well. And while I didn't know very well what these spells did when my enchanter was young, now I do know that they are supposed to do.<BR>They don't work. In a camp with 3 mobs, I can lull two without problems. Pull the nearest one, yet the others still come. Compared to harmory, these spells are a joke.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Mesmerization spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: There are some targets that are unaffected by these spells, either due to level or race. The anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells don’t even cast (costing the caster no mana or aggro). Perhaps this approach could be used for mez spells as well.<P>STATUS: None<P>Well, there's this, and there's the 'You cannot see your target (which is standing right in front of you)' message. Both very annoying, both a waste of mana. Both not logical.<BR>As far as that last message goes, I've never understood why the line of sight is obviously calculated starting from my feet and not from eyes.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Mesmerization spells and overwriting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells? It seems that perhaps they should. Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite mez spells that are of lower or equal level. Base this on the spell level, not the caster level, since the durations are not level dependent. Someone suggested that not having these spells overwrite was intentional (according to GZ) to make playing enchanters more of a challenge. If it is intentional, then leave it as it is.<P>STATUS: None<P>There's two things here really. First of all, there's the AoE mezz and single target mezz. These shouldn't overwrite eachother. Why? Basically because that would make things too easy and thus unbalanced. That would mean I could just always AoE mezz as my first spell, and then pick them off, one by one casting Dazzle, and be quite for a while. At least, I have to make choices. That part is fine.<BR>On the other hand, I fail to see why my 51 Dazzle shouldn't overwrite (read: reset timer) another enchanter's Dazzle. Most of the time, this is not an issue. Groups seldom have two enchanters. But in a raid, you don't want one enchanter (highest level) to have them all mezzed, and the others just have to sit there waiting.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is a call for a change of the color of a monster’s name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know that monsters are under the affects of these spells just by looking. If it is determine that this would be too useful, making it to easy for the group, we might consider making it so that only the enchanter sees these color changes.<P>STATUS: None<P>I like this idea, even if it worked only for Enchanters. But that's only because one has such a hard time targetting one out of three mobs who manage to stand in exactly the same spot. <BR>---<BR>ITEM: Low level Evocation practice spell.<P>DESCRIPTION: Enchanters don’t seem to have a spell like Flare with which they can practice their evocation skills early on. This may be intentional, though, as enchanters are not supposed to be experts at evocation.<P>STATUS: None<P>No, we're not supposed to be masters at evocation. That's why we have slow evocation spells who don't deal a lot of damage. In the end, only having 5 evocation spells pre-50 doesn't reduce my chances of casting them properly, it just makes it so that when I reach level 8, it'll take me two levels to maximize evocation, and make me fizzle a lot at first. Necromancers have the same thing I guess. Wizards don't get any conjuration until level 8. There is a difference however. If a lvl 8 wizard wants to practice conjuration, he just makes an eye of zomm over and over again untill he's good at it. Enchanters can't really cast Chaotic Feedback over and over untill they're good at Evocation.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Tiny Daggers:<P>DESCRIPTION: These items are unavailable in Qeynos.<P>STATUS: None<P>This is a no brainer. But there's no reason to stop at Qeynos. Necromancers can find their bones chips at a fair amount of places, Magicians can find Malachite and Lapis Lazuli at even more vendors. It would be nice if enchanters could buy their tiny daggers at a few other vendors left and right as well.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Pet Positioning.<P>DESCRIPTION: Because enchanters can’t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way. There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master. This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something. Can pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master?<P>STATUS: None<P>Have you ever seen an enchanter trying to loot something? Going back and forth trying to actually loot the mob instead of seeing "Goner regards you indifferently - You could probably beat this opponent"?<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Boon of the Clear Mind.<P>DESCRIPTION: This is a group clarity spell, but it does not overwrite Clarity. Either spell should probably overwrite the other, basically just increasing the duration (and the same should apply to the Clarity 2 spells). It also seems that this spell has a very short useful life span. Lowering the level of this spell would allow its use for longer before they get Clarity 2.<P>STATUS: None<P>We get Clarity at 29, and from 29 to 51, whenever we enter a group, we spend casting clarity on every groupmember except for Warriors, Rogues and Monks. If the Clarity Icon starts to blink, every caster starts to panic and calls for Clarity, even in the middle of a fight. And when we finally get group clarity at 52, we know it'll start all over again in just two levels when everybody will want clarity II. To me, 39 or 44 sounds like a good time to have this spell.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Mask Faith.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. Part of the game is that characters have to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That runs contrary to the basic concept of the world of Norrath.. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don’t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can’t get into if they have a religion). The players are requesting a spell that masks their faith, making them appear agnostic to NPCs. Perhaps the best idea presented would be to create greater rewards for choosing the difficult path of being a pious enchanter.<P>STATUS: None<P>When I created Cixi, 5th of May 1999, I didn't have a mentor who told me to be an agnostic. And when somebody finally told me (at level 12 or so) I refused to restart him, after all, that would take months again. *smile* Since then, my religion has never helped me in any way, and managed to get me killed once or twice. Having the option to mask my religion, however tempting that may sounds at times, isn't really what I hoped for. After all, as you said, "Characters have to deal with their religious choice". But when you finally made religious items, I was hopeing there'd be some sort of reward for religious enchanters. After all, if you were a God, wouldn't you be jumping up and down every time an enchanter, the most agnostic class in Norrath, worshipped you?<BR>But it's not entirely fair to say that I want the "Uber-Wand of Tunare" just because I didn't know any better back then. Instead, maybe you could created a few spells like: "Illusion: Faith Innoruuk" and such who can only be cast if you have a religion yourself. After all, how could an agnostic enchanter fool somebody when it comes to religion, he knows nothing of it. <BR>---<BR>ITEM: Illusions and Link Death.<P>DESCRIPTION: Can illusions remain up during a link death and perhaps while zoning (thought would have to go into changing it when zoning. There are good and bad sides to that change, but if illusions zone, the players become responsible for how they handle those situations, rather than the software).<P>STATUS: None<P>Last time I went link dead, I was dressed up as an elemental in The Hole. Need I say more? I don't care about Illusions when zoning. You know (more or less) when you are zoning. Invis at one side, zone, redo Illusion at the other side. Works fine for me. Keeping your illusion while zoning will kill more enchanters than it'll save. (Because you'll forget to take off your illusion after an evac or teleport.) But in a link dead situation, something you never know when it'll happen, you should come back in the same for as you were before.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: The Essential Enchanter.<P>DESCRIPTION: Some thought should be put into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. If this is determined to be a problem, then perhaps allowing some of the other classes to be better at the skills where they overlap with an enchanter (such as bards and crowd control...) would be a solution.<P>STATUS: None<P>A few reasons come to mind.<BR>- People are used to go somewhere with a single group. Enchanters make a lot of places 'possible' with a single group. Never mind about the Enchanter and bring an extra group instead. It would result in a much safer fight but nobody wants that, since people think it means less experience.<BR>- In Kunark, things hit so hard, you can't have more than 2 mobs beating on a tank for even a short period without all the healers going out of mana. Enchanters can prevent more damage than any healer can heal. (Dazzle 125 mana, can prevent 96 seconds of damage from a mob, that could mean 5000 damage that is not dealt)<BR>- People forget that there are other strategies. I've been in Karnor's Castle with a Paladin puller who tended to "root-park" everything except for what he was fighting. Terribly annoying for the enchanter, but a great tactic. Yes, they still wanted me, for Clarity and Haste, but as far as crowd control went, that Paladin was as good as any enchanter. (I'll agree he can't do that in a dungeon, but I was so impressed I thought I'd mention it.)<P>But all this so-called power we have, also has a big downside which usually doesn't get mentioned. Swift Like the wind doesn't benifit me really. Clarity doesn't allow me to heal more or deal more damage. Dazzle doesn't allow me to kill the mob. (Unless I could bore it to death. *smile*) At 51, with full mana but without a pet, if I get attacked by something over 25, I've got to Dazzle it and run since there's a 50/50 chance it'll kill me. So yes, I'm wanted in any group, and I shine in any group. But I'm nowhere without that group.<P>As far as your solution goes, there might be a thing or two that could be given away to other classes. I think Clarity songs for bards are up to par. Haste spells for Shamans are not however. They should be about as good as ours, maybe even better. And yes, maybe other classes should have the ability to remove a mob from the fight, since that's the purpose of crowd control. The problem is finding a class you can give this without overpowering them? <BR>---<BR>Rune IV:<P>DESCRIPTION: The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high.<P>STATUS: None<P>Maybe I should write down what Rune IV does exactly for me at 51.<BR>Rune IV: Absorb the next 394 damage in return for 236 mana and a Peridot.<BR>The fun thing is, that is spell has a maximum durariot of 90 minutes. Which is completely in line with the wiz/nec Skin spells. As far as I know both Wizards and Necromancers can use this spell as a backup while they're soloing. Asuming that enchanters solo, they'll lose this thing by the time their pet attacks. So either lower the Gem type, or increase the damage absorbed. In return you can make the spell last only 9 minutes instead. Not a single enchanter who'll mourn about that.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Tash Line Aggro.<P>DESCRIPTION: The thought from the players is that this line causes too much aggro.<P>STATUS: None<P>Nah, leave it be. As it is, I can get back any mob being KS'd just by casting Tashania and sitting down. Even if they try to take it with an Ice Commet.<BR>Seriously though, this spell is silly. I've had things come for me after they'd lost about 30% of their health. Staying upright tends to help though, but even then, it's still pretty bad. But once again, it allows for nice things. Just stand at the other side of the room, cast tash on a snared mob and sit down. Just before it reaches you, stand up, and it'll change targets again going back to the main tank. I've had mobs walk up and down the room three times like that. Little purpose, but in the mean time, the DoT's sink in and the casters get mana, and the tanks got their heals. Not really crowd control though, more Clown Control. *grin*<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Global Mana Regen Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION: The idea would be to reduce the power of all forms of mana regeneration. Then, increase the basic level of mana regeneration for everyone, both standing and sitting. Alter this so that the over all effect of meding with Clarity is the same. This would lower the value of Clarity and increase the ability of all casters that are not grouped with an enchanter. Obviously this is a radical idea that would make the game easier.<P>STATUS: None<P>This has nothing to do with Enchanters. It wouldn't even be a nerf, since in the end, we'd lose nothing, except maybe some market value when looking for a group.<BR>It would however drastically change the speed at which classes who can kill things with their mana alone would level.<BR>I think this solution would compare a bit to letter everybody run faster and reduce the amount SoW makes you faster to 'balance' things out. It's clear to see that suddenly everybody can outrun (most) mobs and thus things would definately not be balanced. Increasing Mana Regen wouldn't balance things either in my opinion. But it's easy for me to say that. I have Clarity all the time. *smile*<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Better pet control.<P>DESCRIPTION: Not on the level of control that a magician has over his pet, but perhaps something lesser. For example, if the enchanter attacks an NPC physically, and the pet is not engaged, the pet would attack whatever the enchanter had attacked (this is, basically, a limited form of /pet attack).<P>STATUS: None<P>As it is, using Enchanter pets in a group is not a good idea. This proposition allows the pet to be slightly usefull in a way that it allows us to make it attack things without the need of being attacked. The pet turns into a Physical DoT. It might be an incentive to use a pet, and given the fact that we have 14 pet spells (without being a primary pet class according to some :-p), it would be nice to have a reason to use it. But personally, I'd much rather have a pet that stops attacking the instant it's target become mezzed.<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Targeting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Enchanters in particular would like better targeting abilities. Being able to cycle through all NPCs in view with one key (like F8) would certainly make their lives easier. Though it should be kept in mind that it's not supposed to be too easy.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>Yes, it's not supposed to be too easy. But explain me, once again, how those three drolvargs all managed to stand _inside_ eachother. Once I understand that, I won't need another way of targetting things. After all, if I know how _they_ do it I'll know how to target them myself.<BR>---<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Please take the time to answer this - I and many other enchanters really would appreciate it because we honestly don't get it.<P>Enchanters are the masters of crowd control with second place in the buffs (shamans being number one).  To pay for this we have lousy DDs, one lousy DoT (i.e. Enchanters DO NOT dish out damage), a mediocre pet, low AC and HP, low AC and HP gear, a high-taunt, financially costly defensive buff line (rune), no movement buffs, no snare-type spells and an entire spell catalog based on one type of resistance (magic) with the lowest resistance debuffer (tash) of the game.<P>Of all the classes, we probably die the most often due to the combination of the above spells/skills and lack thereof.  We pay for our ability to mez both in time to regain lost xp and money to buy rezzes.<P>Now you are talking about increasing the CC ability in bards - a class with higher HP, higher AC, a speed buff, a snare spell, a charm spell, higher Defense and Offense, higher Melee capabilities, healing songs and mana regenerative abilities.<P>And you offer in return....a cleric-like pet?<P>In your post you brought up no fewer than *three* 'nerfs' to the enchanter class (that being changes to the class or game that negatively impact on enchanter playability) - (1) take away some of our illusions (a priority) while bumping new illusions to the non-priority list, (2) increase the overall mana regen for folks making clarity less desired and (3) decrease our desirability in Kunark by increasing the cc abilities of other classes such as bards (which, btw, will decrease enchanter desirability in the Old World as well)<P>You've said before in regards to Velious that we still have great and desired abilities and named our speed and clarity buffs - well, you're specifically requesting that the clarity be less valuable, now, which leaves us as haste buffers, something which both shamans and bards can do as well.  <P>You are repeatedly *for* decreasing the effectiveness of the class while steadfastly *against* giving them anything in return - no pet commands, no sow with illusions, no increase in damage spells (save for the dot pet), no increase in Tash MR reduction, no increase in AC, no increase in HP, no increase in Defense, no improvement in gear, no decrease in DD aggro, etc.<P>But you want to spread give other classes better mez abilities (specifically one which already has charm, mana regen, heal, haste and snare and which currently has it's melee/offense/defense capabilities increased in test), decrease the need for our primary buff (clarity), take away a couple of our spells (illusions) and give us nothing in return.<P>Other caster classes nuke better than us, Dot better than us, buff better than us, melee better than us, have more flexibility (i.e. spells versus multiple resistances), sow, snare and heal (three abilities we do not have at all).  All but clerics have some form of mana regeneration already, multiple classes have illusions, necros and druids can charm, necros and bards can mez, multiple classes can root/snare and fear, all valid forms of crowd control.<P>Enchanters are wanted because we do it better and make life easier.  Nobody *needs* clarity to play the game - it just makes things easier.  Nobody *needs* enchanters to do a dungeon (many have come flat out and said they've done without using alternate tactics).<P>AuntieShaynta asked a question which you quoted back in your reply but never answered - what is it that enchanters *do* now that nobody else does?  People constantly refer to signature abilities, yourself included, and you repeatedly say that you don't want to dilute the classes.  Yet class dilution is only brought up when enchanters want to get something and seems to be ignored when it comes to giving our abilities away.  Charm, mez, illusions, mana-regen, haste, slowing mobs...all are things other classes can do.<P>So please, what *is* the enchanter's 'signature ability that no other class gets'?<P>SG<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, trying to keep to balance issues whilst including reasoning or examples rather than pure repeats of earlier posts.<P>I'm 52nd now so will stick to stuff I have experienced up until 52nd.  <P>Tash and aggro: <P>I didn't REALLY start to notice the amount of aggro Tash was causing until I was in my very high 40's so anyone lower than that might not be seeing how bad it really gets.  The increase in aggro doesn't seem to be linear either, the higher the mobs are the much, much worse it seems to get.  <BR>For those who say that we should know when to cast our spells I will give you an example, and this is by no means a unique experience to this zone/mob.<P>Fighting in the Hole against Rock Golems, I have sometimes waited until over one third of the mobs HPs were tanked away before casting Tash, and still got summoned and used for pummeling practice.<P>I don't mind waiting a few rounds for the tanks to build up a bit of aggro before casting but to have to wait over 30 seconds and still get aggroed just seems a bit silly.<P>Every single one of our spells is magic based so give us a bit of a break please as this does not seem balanced compared to the amount of MR it now debuffs.<P>This brings me nicely on to Mem Blur.<P><BR>General aggro and Mem Blur:<P>Mem Blur used to be a great spell, a real emergency lifesaver.  If yourself or another group member had been aggroed and you could manage to get off a quick Mem Blur there was a fair chance you would gain enough time for the party to get stuff under control again.  <P>After level 30ish it starts to get more and more unreliable to the point where now I have to sometimes cast it (or one of it's varients) 4 or 5 times for it/them to have any effect.  Hardly an emergency lifesaver anymore.  I agree that the low level spell should decrease in success as you increase in mob level but the higher level, high mana ones should still be as effective as the low level ones used to be.  <P>I think Verant need to have a think about what they want this line of spells to actually be used for and have a bit of a balancing/tuning session on them.  It's fun and very satisfying to save someone's life with a well timed mind altering spell, that's one of the things we Enchanters like doing so much.  We are Beguilers, we like messing with the minds of our enemies.  And a different message when it actually works would be nice too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Rune IV:<P>I assume that when a spell is created, Verant would like it to be used.  The huge component cost increase between Rune III and Rune IV, given the increase in HP it shields means that the majority (going by posts on many message boards) of Enchanters just skip this one until they get Rune V.<P>As each Rune approximately doubles the HP shield of the previous one (I think it does anyway), why not use the following gemstones:<P>Rune III - Jasper 7gp<BR>Rune IV - Amber 35gp<BR>Rune v - Peridot 115gp<P>About a 4 times increase in gem cost for each new spell level. I'm sure we would survive without this change but it just seems like a fairly logical progression to me and would mean that the spell actually gets used by the majority rather than the minority.<P><BR>A few comments on the latest Summary from Alan:<P>DOT pet:<P>Another type of pet we can summon?  Doesn't really seem to fit in with our class.  If you want to add to our effectiveness in the big single mob fights why not just give us an additional, higher level, souped up version of Boon of the Garou that we can cast on the tanks that really makes a noticeable difference to their performance. i.e much bigger lifetap plus an increase in all mellee stats and maybe HP regen (if they will stack).  Something that tanks in a group would actually fight over to want casting on them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Single Mez overwriting AoE Mez:<P>This would make a noticeable increase in the power of Enchanters in a dungeon environment.  I'm not going to turn it down if you give it to me but I'm not sure if it's wrong or unbalanced the way it is at the moment.  <P>Single target Mezzes of a higher level should overwrite lower level single target mezzes though as they are exactly the same spell line, not a subline.<P><BR>Mezzed and Charmed mob indicators:<P>Not sure why it's needed on Mezzed mobs as they don't move and it's normally fairly easy to see which ones aren't moving. (I know some sway a bit)<P>An indicator for charmed mobs would seem sensible though.  Maybe just the Enchanter's name prefixing the mobs name would be fine.  If the graphics were advanced enough that all mobs of the same type looked different then this wouldn't be a problem. I suppose what I mean is that yes, it would be nice if you could group say that you've charmed the Drolvarg Sentry with the scar on his cheek or the one with the green breastplate, but this isn't possible so a name tag change would be a useful feature, even if it's seen by your group only.<P><BR>Illusions:<P>Almost given up on this topic.  Illusions really don't balance anything and I'm at the stage where I'm not really all that bothered what is done with them but can we just keep at least one unique illusion please.  Werewolf would be the logical choice.  This would mean stopping the Bard Lute drop too, just don't nerf existing items.<P>There is enough blurring of classes as it is, so I don't think Spirit Wolf should get a speed component.  At the level we get Spirit Wolf, SoW potions aren't too expensive for those very rare situations when we can't trade Breeze/Clarity for a SOW.<P>Most important Illusion request is that they stay up on LinkDeath.  On zoning it isn't a big deal as you can always Invis before you zone and the evac issue has arguments for illusions dropping as well as for not dropping. However, LD is normally disastrous when passing illusioned through KOS cities so should be addressed.<P>Lots of other stuff to comment on but I'll be all day doing it so I'll stop now.<P>Regardless of the zone we choose, just make it so that when we log on to play we are going to have a satisfying and fun experience and not a frustrating one and I think everyone will be happy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bodge<P>52 Gnome Enchanter<P>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've posted on druid form aswell<P>Absor said:<P>WOLF FORM FOR ENCHANTERS (Druid defining ability)<P>Lute of the Howler is not my primary concern, it's<BR>more of an example. I don't think that there should be items that grant out of class abilities, unless they are there for a specific reason. It may very well be that the Lute is just such an item. But I also don't like Invis on a warrior item, healing on mage items, direct damage on cleric items, summoning on bard items...<P>The Lute strikes a cord with me because the<BR>Werewolf form is probably THE signature form for<BR>enchanter, and giving it away seems wrong. Now<BR>I've heard there is an in-game story behind this<BR>that would favor its inclusion, and that's great. But that doesn't change my objection to the principle of giving powers from outside of the class, and especially signature powers, via items.<P>Well said and I agree completely!  We as druids, have very few signature items.  Wolfform is pretty much the ony one!  Why do Enchanters get a wolf form, and whats more, SoW is on the list for improvements.  I know the lists aren't final at all, but I feel that if they made the list that means that it's got a bit more than a 45% chance of making it.  Many good ideas never made these lists, so I'm guessing 45%.  I realize you are talking items, but the same logic can be applied to the druid's wolfform. Its our signature thing so to speak, we get wolf forms that no one else gets.  Every other spell is a shared variation of the other class's spell.<P>Thanks,<BR>Baralo Horehound</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor...thanx for rationally responding to my rant.  One thing I think you missed is strength debuffs being useless in PvE.  I can't believe that I am saying this(i play on rallos zek) but isn't this supposed to be a PVE game that also has PVP as a side note?  With that said, strength debuffs should do SOMETHING to mobs that is atleast as significant as something you do to a PC.<P>So instead of hitting for 400+ max damage a swing, maybe the mob will hit for only 375 max damage a swing.

You've decided that skeleton illusions are solely a necro thing even though enchanters are "masters" of illusion.

Plus, all spell gems of Enchanter pets are the little guy icon anyways.  It just simplifies spell finding for us, imho.<P>---<P>ITEM: Mask Faith.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. Part of the game is that characters have to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That runs contrary to the basic concept of the world of Norrath.. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don’t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can’t get into if they have a religion). The players are requesting a spell that masks their faith, making them appear agnostic to NPCs. Perhaps the best idea presented would be to create greater rewards for choosing the difficult path of being a pious enchanter.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>Umm, question:  What about our Temple of Solusek Ro quests, for one non-epic related example or two?<P>I as a worshiper of Mithaniel Marr can NOT go through Neriak safely (a step *required* for both the Incandescent Mask and the spell Tashania), certainly not the Third Gate.  Sure I can just go invis and run my skinny high-elf butt off through Neriak in its entirety, stand right next to a member of the Dead (KOS to me, has a pet also), give the items in question to Mizr N'Mar there in the library where my enchant metal spells are conveniently sold, get out of the area, find out that yes, I won't trigger one of the Shadowknight guards and make it out with 53 hp (my first attempt visible after getting dubious with the 'normal' guard faction), and go back to my standard operating/playing procedure with a few frayed nerves and extra gray hair.<P>Just a question, with an irony attached that I con warmly in Oggok after Benevolence and Illusion: Ogre.  Go figure that I haven't changed any factions there, or in Grobb where I can make amiable or kindly.  I still didn't stay visible in either, however, on basis of the fact I didn't want to find out just how likely I was to get the 'side effects of having a deity' routine in the form of KOS-to-me guards.  I saved that fun experiment for the evil gnome guild in Ak'anon which is part of my epic quest.

</FONT><HR>Illusion Benefits:<BR>There should be more benefits to illusions, such as int bonuses for erudite or gnome illusion, wis bonuses for dwarf or high elf illusion, cha bonuses for wood elf, atk bonuses for ogre, sow for illusion werewolf (by level 44 most people have jboots or can afford sow potions anyway, and if all illusions were useful then the enchanter would still have to choose between which illusion they wanted to use), etc.  This would essentially become more functional if group illusion spells were also implemented, so that enchanters could turn their entire group into gnomes with an int buff or something like that.<P>Divine Aura:<BR>Give enchanters a divine aura type spell that gives them 10 seconds of immunity in case their mezzes are resisted or they are almost oom, so that they have a chance to zone since all the targets will be aggroed onto them.<P>Group Rune:<BR>This would be a nice spell in case of emergencies too, so that if the entire group is low on hp and needs to zone, the enchanter could group rune them and help them all escape.<P>All in one Spell:<BR>I agree that it would be nice to have a spell that gave int, wis, and mana regen bonuses all in one.  That was enchanters wouldn't have to constantly be rememming insight, then brilliance, or glamour, then gift of magic, etc, and also putting a lot of little icons in the corner of the screen.  Obviously this would be a pretty high level spell, so as not to make the other spells void.<P>Creatures Immune to Mez AND Stuns:<BR>When you're in Kunark or Velious as and you run into something that can't be stunned OR mezzed, if you don't have sow or root memmed, an enchanter is basically dead.  I think that at least one of these two spell lines should be allowed on all creatures to give enchanters more of a chance in those types of situations.<P>Targetting:<BR>I agree that there should be a way for enchanters to scroll through the various targets around them, since, especially for people with slower computers or video cards, it is often very difficult to target a particular monster to mez.<P>Religion Benefits:<BR>Being an enchanter of Tunare, I would definitely like to see some more benefits to it besides being KOS in Neriak and Cabilis.  I also think that they should be significant benefits, since the downfalls of choosing a certain religion are significant downfalls.  For example religion specific spells, such as a hp regeneration type spell for tunare followers or something like that (since I think most people connotate tunare with nature and growth), or an item that is Tunare only and allows an enchanter to cast some kind of a healing spell.<P>Item Enchanting Spells:<BR>Not particularly adding a DD proc or yaulp, but this could even tie in with the religion specific spells, and have a healing proc, or a decent damage shield proc, or stun proc, etc.<P>Pet Buff:<BR>It would be nice if enchanters got at least one pet only buff so that they could save themselves the trouble of having to make a new pet after each battle.  Like a huge HP and AC buff but that can only be used on the pet, since especially in Kunark and Velious, an enchanter's pet lasts about 6 seconds.<P>Some of the main points that I just wanted to stress as being the most important in my mind are group illusions, sow with werewolf illusion, a divine aura type spell, and the mez overwriting.<P>Anyway, I hope people agree with me on at least a few of these points and they'll at least be considered.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off I am very glad to see that you are still reading these threads.   Here are my comments on a few of your items: <P>My first and foremost concern is with magician pets.  One of the major draw backs to having a pet, and a fact that keeps them in balance, is that they are extremely hazardous in dungeons.  They can cause things to agro, get lost, train etc.  If the new mage pets that are taken from a creature in the zone carry with them the faction of that creature then this is a HUGE imbalance to the game.  You have just removed *the* major down side to having a pet.   If this is not the case, where the pet doesn’t have the faction, then could we get “Illusion: Mage Pet”? so that we can take on the model and faction of the mage pet for that zone?<P>”ITEM: Illusion, Wolf. <BR>DESCRIPTION: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors (it is currently outdoors only). It should be noted that Enchanters have no foot-speed enhancement spells at this time. <BR>STATUS: None “<P>I don’t think we should get a sow type buff, self only or not.  I do think this should work in dungeons however since it is a self only spell.<P>“ITEM: Undead Illusions. <BR>DESCRIPTION: These transformations could be considered the territory of the necromancer, and maybe they should be replaced with something else, or remove them from the enchanter spell list. <BR>STATUS: None” <P>The race illusions and ware wolf and elemental illusions granted by various items in the game could be considered the territory of the enchanter, and maybe they should be replaced with some other effect, or remove them from the items.<P>“ITEM: Mask Faith. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. Part of the game is that characters have to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That runs contrary to the basic concept of the world of Norrath.. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don’t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can’t get into if they have a religion). The players are requesting a spell that masks their faith, making them appear agnostic to NPCs. Perhaps the best idea presented would be to create greater rewards for choosing the difficult path of being a pious enchanter.” <P>This would be very nice but without some quest, it should be difficult, to prove your faith and convert to a religion this will be useless to 95% or more of all current enchanters.<P> “ITEM: Enchanting Items. <BR>DESCRIPTION: This is on this list mostly as a reminder that we have virtually promised item enchantment to this class. <BR>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item. “<P>When working on this think along the lines of procs and effects, not just stats. <P>“ITEM: Thicken Mana. <BR>DESCRIPTION: More uses for these potions would be great. <BR>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.”<BR>Keep this in mind for enchanting items. <BR>ITEM: Illusion, Change Size. <BR>DESCRIPTION: Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller. It should be noted that size change is, so far, the area of the shaman. <BR>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item. “<P>This is not the realm of the shaman, we are masters of illusion, we can make ourselves look like races that are bigger than us and smaller than us, there should be no reason we can not make ourselves look like small versions of bigger races etc.   <P>"ITEM: Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion). <BR>DESCRIPTION: A spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature. Keeping faction issues in mind, this might be possible if this were to only work on specific NPCs in any given zone. <BR>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.”<P>Keep in mind the mages pet, if there is no faction attached to them, then this should be possible, if there is faction attached to them then that unbalancing. <P><BR>On a related note, on the political side, the "no action is expected on this item" is not very good.  It conveys the image that you are putting it on the list to humor us and you may even show it to the dev team so you can all laugh about it, but your not really going to do anything with it.  A better wording could have been "no action is expected at this time" or "Item not considered 'balance' issue or 'bug' fix: priority low" or something along those lines.  <P> - Mahkahl<P>I hope Abashi reads this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Undead Illusions being the "realm" of necromancers? Does the title "Illusionist" mean nothing? I think any spell with the word "Illusion" in the title is the realm of the Masters of Illusion.<P>If you are seriously considering removing these, consider other classes with spells that are in our realm. Druids and necros both get mana regen spells, illusions, and charm spells. Necros even have a mez that clears aggro. Are these not our realm? I'm not saying to nerf those classes, but quit talking about us stepping on the other classes' toes.<P>Absor, you treat enchanters like they are below the other classes. Its all about us infringing on the abilities of other classes. Nobody ever talks about other classes having OUR abilities. How about rogues and bards getting Illusion items? I can understand rogues being able to use disguises, but bards are freaking musicians, they should have a faction raising song, not something to totally change their appearance. And about giving bards better crowd control...they can heal, run faster than sow, DD, melee (WITH duel wield), snare, buff, illusion (with masks), etc etc. Sure, give them better crowd control, but maybe enchanters should be able to duel wield Short Swords of Ykesha.<P>Here's the point: Enchanters are not overpowered, we are merely different. God forbid we should have UNIQUE abilities! We are desired in groups because we are helpful and RARE. Groups in Kunark shout for healers and tanks just as much as enchanters. Its just that when a group has 3 healers and two tanks they are looking for someone to add something new to the group, rather than augmenting the existing abilities. Most people who play enchanters do so because they have levelled up another type of character and are tired of the same old, same old. Basically this list talks about removing some enchanter abilities and spreading out the remaining ones to other classes, in effect removing all reasons for being an enchanter. Honestly, you might as well remove the class from the game.<P>Finally, agnosticism. In my opinion, this is not such a big deal. Enchanters, as well as other pure casters, deal with arcane forces, not powers bestowed by the gods. Priest classes (clr, dru, shm) get their powers from the gods, so religion is important. Since pure casters do not deal directly with the gods, they have little need for them. From a roleplaying perspective, casters that derive their powers from long hours of study rather than worship might begin to consider themselves god-like. It would be unusual for someone with god-like powers derived from non-divine sources to humble themselves before any deity. Yes, make religion an option for casters, but don't say that they should have a religion and choosing agnostic is somehow wrong. I play other characters with religious preferences, but I would have picked agnostic for my enchanter regardless of the positive or negative aspects.<P>Nizelena<BR>Enchantress of the 29th Circle<BR>Agnostic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Simple. Because ‘crowd control’ is an area of gameplay the needs to be spread around to help groups in combat situations. Because there should never be a time when one class becomes ‘essential’ for anything more than a few situations. Bards having crowd control helps everyone looking to create a group.&lt;&lt;<P>Hmm, so according to your logic then Absor you need to give the other priest classes the ability to xp rez.  Because I don't know of a single person who will go to the planes without a cleric, or pretty much anywhere else for that matter - and it's not solely because of their complete heal.<P>What do you have against Enchanters?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There was SOOOO much I wanted to comment on when I read the (laughable) final Enchanter list, but much has been covered, and, keeping in mind Absor has to read these for ALL the classes, I'll keep it short.<P>MAIN POINTS:<P>Targeting-<BR>Absor said that it was part of difficult, of something to that effect.  <P>Pardom me, but a horrible UI and click detection is excused by "makeing the game more challenging?" Wow.  You know, I respect Absor for the most part, but that's a horrid "Yes-Man" answer.  <P>Now, we ALL know that, at this point, the "engine" is, or at least, has become, a hodge-podge fuster-cluck patchwork.  I assume Absor says this because he knows the Dev team would have to go in, clean up, and do some major re-writes to make the clicking interface NON-horrid, as it is now.  No other class really has this problem.  Most have /assist, and the healers/buffers simply use the F* keys.  We, on the other hand, have to chose the hard way.  This would not be so bad if the click interface was not as COMPLETLY unaccaptable as it is now.<P>MY proposal would be <BR>1) The ability to F8 though all MOBS, from closest to furtheest.  I remember asking how to do that since I was a wee Enchanter.<BR>2) Add the ability to Shift (or alt, or ctrl" click, so that ONLY MOBS could be targeted.  This would at LEAST get rid of the targeting corpses/PCs problem.<P>If mobs DIDN"T stack on top of themselves, this problem would not be.  Unless that problem is solved (HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA,) this needs to be done ASAP.<P>BTW, the suggestion of doing, say F2 twice selecting that PCs pet is ingenious.<P>Illusion: Spirit Wolf come with Sow-<BR>Sorry guys, but I have to disagree.  This should NOT come with SoW.  HOwever, there is absolutly NO reason why we should NOT be able to cast it indoors.<P>Illusion: MoB-<BR>&lt;Ranting and raving about how this is unbalancing&gt;<P>Lets pretend, for just a second, that we are actually gonna apply RL rules to EQ.  Now, why would people want Illusions?  TO GET WHERE THEY NORMALLY CANNOT GO!!  Why MUST this be limited to towns?  There is no good reason.  You say CR would be to easy?  Well then, maybe u should implement those Velious corpse dragging penalites in dungeons (ducks all the horrific flames.)  Of course, u need to fix the horrendous bugs with it that u denied at first so vehimently (amiable dragging amiable = KoS... huh?)<P>Illusions: Undead-<BR>What part of "ILLUSION" is Absor not understanding?  I truly don't know HOW many people have to remind him we are the masters of ILLUSIONS and that LOOKINg like a skellie does not "step on the toes" of necros.  Hell, even most NECROS agree!<P>However much Absor preaches about not blurring the lines, he is ALL about giving our ability to mez to everyone and their mother.  Oh yeah.. I love when the necro mezzes.  I try to mez on top.. doh.. doesn't stick.. and look.. they break, and they come for ME, not the necro.. wonderful.  And the Bard getting mez?? Oh wow.. super for him.. lets just add that to the great things they can do... and if he screws up.. no biggy! He's got tons of armor and can snare.  <P>Ok.. that's enough for now... seriously though... I mean.. no disrepect to Absor, but I SERIOUSLY hope someone at this meeting actualy USES Enchanters (Absor, very honorablely, admited his ignorance to the Enchanter as a class,) else I think we are about to take it up the tailpipe.<P>Malakie<BR>37th Enchanter, Test Server<P>*** No need to Read Absor..

</FONT><HR>Actually, going from previous posts, this is what I would like Absor to post when he has finished this whole deal with enchatners and class balance.<P>First off, lemme get this out of the way.  It's coming, we all don't like it, but the big "N" word is coming.  I don't like it, most of the enchanters around the Norrath will not like what's coming.<P>But this is what I would like to see Absor answer for us in the up and coming days:<P>1) Address &gt;all&lt; the issues he's brought up, in his update, he didn't really give us a status update.  Keep those lines of communication flowing, albeit tough now with complaints of nerfs coming in from all sides, but please, you're our only outlet to what goes on in VI offices.  Please keep the updates coming, and on &gt;all&lt; the topics you brought up.<P>2) Define the Enchanter Class:  I started off with good feelings about this whole, re-define abilities, hopefully a new charm that isn't dictate, and maybe being able to overwrite AE mez with single.  More and more, the simle has been turning upside down.  We are declared the masters of illusions, but undead illusions may get taken away.  We are declared the masters of crowd control, but possibly we will see our defining abilities spread around other classes.<BR>Please, what do we do now?  Are we regulated to just clarity and speed?  Are we going off the mark, and we will still keep all our abilities?  <BR>What are we?<P>Please define us before you do anything else.  It will probably lower the flames to come, you can see it in the sky, they are coming and there's not a whole lot anyone is going to do about it.<BR>But!  If our role is being changed, please tell us, instead of dropping hints.  Or if nothing is being changed, then tell us that too, so we can stop worrying.  <BR>I apologize, I've seemed to have ranted here.<P>I guess my one request out of all of this, seeing the winds of change, and the sands of time fall away from what we used to be.....please answer my question: <P><BR>What do Enchanters do?<P><BR>I hope you take the time to read this, and put a lot of thought into your answer before you post.  Thankyou for your time.<P>Utaman Dal'Illusao &lt;Black Tower&gt;<BR>Lvl. 53 Enchanter, Xegony.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Undead Illusions.<BR>Absor, you're making up your own point here, Enchanters are illusionists, they can look like anything they wish, a rock, a wood elf, a skeleton.  the only limit on it is technical, you can only have illusions for characters in the global file.<P>or at least it was until The Vision started changing daily.  What is the current explanation on what an illusion can look like and why it's not undead anymore?  Remember all your explanations that illusions are not really a change in form, druids really turn into wolves, the skin really falls off a necro, but the enchanter just makes people believe that's what they see.  If it's an illusion it can be an illusion of anything.<P>So anything in the global character file should also have an enchanter Illusion: spell. <P>Until there is a Illusion: Target spell, this is how the Illusionist is supposed to be implemented.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>GLOBAL MANA REGENERATION<P>This is regarding global increases in mana regeneration.  I find this as a good idea.  But do not reduce the mana regeneration of clarity line spells.  Give this a try on the test server and see how game play goes.  This would allow for a faster paced game which everyone likes.  No one likes too much downtime, everyone likes constant pulls. This would increase the playablity of the game.  And enchanters would not be deemed as a nessesity but as an excellent addition.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BARDS AND CROWD CONTROL<P>I find this as a good idea but one needs to careful that it does not make an enchanter not wanted when one can get a bard.  ie mana song and being able to mezz.<P>So i suggest giving them a single target mezz that restricts the bard to playing songs.  ie the bard can not melee.  He would be able to keep "1" mob mezzed and he could weave other songs but not target another mob without the first mezz failing.  By doing this he mezzes one mob and helps the group out with whatever songs he wants to use.  BUT enchanters would have the benefit of being able to handle much much bigger pulls.  If the group pulls three mobs then the bard mezzes one and the group root parks the 2nd mob and then they back up and kill the first one.  Not as clean as an enchanter would do, but it could be done.<P>If you decide to give bards a AE mezz then make sure that on the pvp enivonments it does not effect group members as it does with our AE mezzes also make sure to put a high taunt on this spell so the Bards can see what enchanters have been dealing with.  Make sure the AE is centred around the bard and it has a small radius.<P>personally i would like to see the bard get the first choice not the second (AE) choice.<P>*puts on flame-resistant suit*  I feel that there is a game design issue and that Verant is going to TRY to fix it.  So i would rather give my opions to how to do it then rant the word NO.<P>To all enchanters think of the global regen and the CC as an old cliche  "Where do ya want it? (ie the punch)  our reply "In the guts."  <BR>Go ahead an try to debate with them that you don't wanna the punch...  I'll take it in the "Guts" so atleast i know where i am gonna get hit.<P>Zelbee Silvertongue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters suffer from being unique.<P><BR>Me are considered 'essential' because we are the only ones who can do what we do far better than anyone else. <BR>A healer is 'essential' to any group, however you could have a druid or shaman instead of a cleric. <BR>A tank is 'essential' to any group, but you could have a hybrid, rogue, or monk, instead of a warrior.<P>The role of an enchanter isn't any more 'essential' than the role of any other class, we are just the only ones that can do it. Don't penalize us because you didn't give other classes our abilities.<BR>(Yes, I know bards and necros can mez as well. Rangers can heal in a group but I won't count on them to do so in an emergency, the same applies for other classes and mez.<P>I would also say that clerics are far more essential in a group than enchanters, they are the *ONLY* ones who can res, which is far more nessicary in many situations than a mez or two.<P>Also, about specific items:<BR>ITEM: Illusion, Wolf.<BR>My Comments: Any one find it hypocritical that the reason we arnt getting a foot speed increase is becuase it would infringe on the diversity of druids and shamans, however both of these classes have illusions which were, until recently, something very unique about enchanters?<P><BR>ITEM: 'Charm wears off'.<BR>My Comments: This always happens when you use invisibility to break a charm. On another note is there anyway you can make /pet get lost work on charmed mobs to break the charm? It seems strange that the masters of mind control can't even get rid of a pet.<P><BR>ITEM: Undead Illusions.<BR>My Comments: Why? The only reason you listed for changing this is a roleplaying reason and from a roleplaying standpoint I can't see any reason why we can't look like the undead. Also see Illusion, Wolf for any concerns about "the territory of the necromancer".<P><BR>ITEM: The Essential Enchanter.<BR>My Comments: Enchanters shouldn't be "essential" but still try and make them needed.<P><BR>ITEM: Global Mana Regen Idea.<BR>My Comments: As well all know, enchanters have two roles in groups: crowd control and buffing. You have taken away crowd control in the best areas of velious and in high level one-on-one encounters however we still have our buffs to fall back on in these situations. Most tanks have haste items and either shaman or bard spells can take them to the cap easily and if you make clarity less affective you would be reducing the main reason enchanters are in a group in the first place. You have forced us to be buffers in velious, at least make those buffs as needed as possible.<P><BR>Also I would love to see something like Feigh Death for us, I would even say that we die more than any other class. If I get three resist(and it happens far to often) in a row in many situations I am dead, someway of getting out of that would be great.

</FONT><HR>Regarding the essential enchanter:<P>My question is that if you are going to be giving bards a more 'useful' mesmerize song, how exactly is this going to work?  Is the song going to be more effective than the enchanter mesmerize spells? Less? The same?<P>If you are going to increase the crowd controlling aspects or bards, and even other classes (necroes were going to receive an undead mesmerize I thought I read somewhere, or at least it was being considered) I hope this is not going to replace the enchanter class as an effective means of crowd control.<P>I sincerely hope that you do not give bards, or any other class for that matter, a more efficient form of crowd control than enchanters already have.  To me I think that Bards alread have an unfair advantage of using crowd control over enchanters, and to a lesser extent necromancers in the case of undead crowd control.  Mainly because they have plate armor, and flayed skin armo (basically more AC).<P>Please think about this before giving a prized enchanter ability away to other classes.  We already had our pets weakened, our abilities 'nerfed' on PvP servers, nearly being made useless in Velious, regarding resists (we cann't all travel in huge raiding parties, some of us have to rely on ourselves at times), now I see talk of reducing the effectiveness of mana regeneration spells and giving away our most highly prized abilities such as the ability to mesmerize as well as the illusionary aspect of out class.  At times you profess to not be in favor of 'overlapping' the classes in the game, but your actions controdict this.  <P>On a final note, looking at the issue of balance, I think you (VI) have been unfair is saying that illusions are just for fun, and do not deal with the balance of our class.  I would argue that illusions have a much for profound effect other than the 'cool aspect' of the game.  For an enchanter to make his way through the game and complete enchanter quest we NEED illusions, so again I say it is unfair for you to say they are not important, when in fact they are.<P>For example, the Rod of Insidious Glamour, the 3 incandescent quests, and the holy grail of all enchanter quests, the Tashania Scroll.  Note that these quests REQUIRE actual interactions with NPC's of a race that will naturally hate you because some of us have chosen to follow a deity.  Not just a simple, cast invisibilty, go inside a place where you are KOS, grab an item and gate out, but actually Hailing an NPC, around guards no less, who can see what religion we worship, just becase THEY CAN?  How then can you say that illusions are just for fun? I would ask that when under an illusion, make it so the enchanter, or whomever it may be, would appear as agnostic. NOTE:  this would not wipe any previous faction hits we have incurred, just make us appear to be agnostic, or give us a spell which allows us to appear worship another deity. Don't sell illusions short.  They are an important part of our class.  <P>I did say my last issue would be my final topic, but this although unrelated to balancing our class, I feel is important. Please make the Rod of Insidious Glamour, the Incandescent Wand, Rod and Mask no drop.  Yes this is a wish list item I know, but hear me out.  All, the components used to quest for these items are NO DROP, so why aren't the final rewards also NO DROP.  The Tishania spell scroll is No Drop, and should be so.  Can you explain this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
