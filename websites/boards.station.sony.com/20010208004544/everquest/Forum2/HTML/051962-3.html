</FONT><HR>Ok I see what seems to be people arguing, not only about 2 things, but 3 seperate, but interrelated 'balancing' issues. The first is leveling, the second "killin'", and the third playing appeal.<BR>   1. Leveling. This is what Verant fixed by taking away the Exp penalty. *APPLAUD*  Based solely upon class 1 and class 2 teaming up and exp dished out at the end of a fight, no one takes from the other.  And if class 1 and class 2 do it alone, they get equal exp for equal work.  In this sense balanced was achieved.<BR>   2. Killin'.  People are arguing that the exp penalty being taken away doesn't change balancing, because they still cannot go killin' stuff in parties like the pures and aren't invited (as opposed to not invited due to exp sucking).  Ok, so Hybrids can't do killin' like a warrior.  We are not supposed to.  I have never been denied a group because I am a SK, not a warrior or necro.<BR>   3. Playing appeal. My first character is a SK.  And while I see warriors hitting for tons more damage for me and taking so many hits that I would have died 3x over.  I've never regretted choosing a SK.  A warrior gets wounded and has to wait around to healed by another.  I can run off Tap a few greens (kitties are for eating) and be back to full HP, full mana and killin' again.  I've seen more warriors looking for healing partners than SK's or Palys.  I'm not nocking warriors.  They have their own appeal and uses.  I'm just saying Balance and Playing Appeal should not only have killin' taken into account.<BR>   Examples: Warrior and Cleric shouting they need a necro to help with a CR.  No necro replies.  I ask 'what you want'.  They had no clue where a corpse was.  Memmed my little spell, and got the body for them.  <BR>    I met my favourite group to party with when i was 35.  They were all around 45.  Now I am 45 and they are around 51 to 52.  As you can see I'm not powerleveled, but go and help them on things they are doing.  Never have I felt like I was a 'leech' or not doing my fair share.  That I don't get exp like them doesn't matter.  I group with friends and help and we all get exp based on lvl which is fair.  Just yesterday I helped kill Thrackin (sp?) for a friend's epic.  Me little 45 SK and my friend a 52 SK were the damage soakers (and wow did I soak a lot of damage thanks to 2 great clerics)  We had a rogue doing her backstab/evade thing (she was damage, not soaker, though she did soak her fair share).  And with no warrior we killed him twice (for both people who needed the item).  We only lost 1 person each time.  Thrackin apparently hates Tashan type spells VERY much.  2 groups. #1 2 SK (and me a little 45), druid, cleric, rogue, enchanter. #2 enchanter, cleric, druid, necro, magician, and a semi necro (she was going ld every minute and I don't know if she actually got to fight.  So we had lots of nukers, healers etc.  But it was 2 Sk that took the brunt of the damage and we Lived.  I took enough damage that any of the casters would have been dead 6x over.  And if no necro is around who is going to help find/summon your corpse, or go get it and drag it back without running like a chicken with its head cut off the first time it is hit?  And what Warrior can truly solo at higher lvls?  I have the advantage of dark/fearing<BR>  <BR>Sure there are things I think Sk should get and be able to use for further balance in the 'killin' category, but for the sheer fun and playability of a character class, Hybrids can be fun.  Actually most High lvl 'tanks' I know are SK or Palys, not because we dish out the most damage, or take the most hits (seeing an ogre warrior in a party will make you see your Hit points as a miniscule thing and show you they are Rightfully the TANK of the game), but the versatility is there.  A few tweaks with Disciplines at the high end and spells.  My opinion that all the new 'take from them and give to myself' spells that worked on our previous lifetap/siphon/vortex is what is really the 'Feel' of the SK, and why I play the class.<P>Tabia Thanatephoros<BR>45th lvl Human Shadow Knight<BR>Who picked the class because it said of VERY HIGH DIFFICULTY at character creation and wanted a challenge</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Correcting a mistake is an improvement.  Now correct your other mistakes with the hybrid classes to improve them to where they should be.<P>My hint to Verant:  <P>Balance for hybrids does not mean being 50% worse in melee and 50% worse in spells as compared to warriors and clerics/necros/druids of the same level (pally/sk/ranger).<P>This is a case where 50% and 50% does not equal 100% and thus, is not balanced.<P>It's a case where 50% and 50% = something like 60%.  If 50% and 50% equaled something like 90%, then maybe you'd have a basis for saying that hybrids are balanced.<P>It's like saying a 25th level warrior and 25th level cleric is as effective as a 50th level warrior/cleric/necro/druid.<P>So now that we've gotten your math lesson out of the way...I agree the exp. penalty was an improvement, but it also was a correction of a mistake.  The mistake was your mistaken assumption that a hybrid was something "better" than the pure classes (i.e., 60% warrior and 60% cleric is better than 100% of pure class at the same level).  Again, faulty logic.  In reality, hybrids aren't "better" in any way.<P>I think you're confusing "useful" with "better".  Hybrids are more "useful" where the group is missing a key type of other class (i.e., at lower levels, pally healing can supplement a druid's where a cleric isn't present--or a pally might be extremely useful where a group doesn't have any other healers).  Sure, that's useful, but it's not "better".  A warrior and cleric of the same level will virtually always be far better for a group than two paladins of the same level. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After a week of new experience system, and much consideration on the weekend about this thread (pointed to by Caster's Realm, which is the only way I'd still remember it), I have the following comments:<P>1.  I think I understand the original poster's point.  The experience system fix is because Verant realizes at a big picture level that the classes are MOSTLY balanced at high levels.  If the outcome is considered roughly equal, then the cost to get there probably deserves to be equal too.  The only other experience system worth considering would cost more when the relative benefit is higher but still equal out in the end.  That means that warriors and rogues would go faster until about 40th or so and then hybrids would go faster (they start falling behind in melee abilities and to a certain extent in battle contribution due to the caps on weapons, offense skills, and defense skills.)<P>2.  The poster believes that referring to this general change as an 'improvement' for hybrids is roughly equivalent to removing one of several major obstacles to equality and declaring the problem fixed.  Imagine if we just said that 'separate but equal' in schools was wrong but allowed blatant discrimination in the work place.  The problem would not be perceived as 'fixed' just because you addressed one aspect of it.<P>3.  There is a begrudging acceptance by the paladins and other hybrids that the new system is fair to 'up and comers'.  It is hard to accept that the additional experience in their 'exp bucket' is somehow not earned and somehow not worthy of the reward of additional levels.  Most realize the disruption to the game system and many realize that the exp in that bucket was often taken from other party members, but it still feels like 'theirs'.<P>4.  Although the classes are MOSTLY balanced, Verant's vision for the ATK and AC stats unbalances warriors, rogues, and monks by allowing them too much melee damage v. their hybrid brethren.  Verant needs to demonstrate to itself that relatively small differences in skills make too huge a difference in combat.  It makes since that a warrior does, say, 25% more damage than a paladin, but it doesn't make sense for a warrior to do 100% or 200% as much damage.  By the same token, it makes sense for the rogue to do 25-50% more damage than a wizard (manaless DOT with somewhat higher risk of being IN melee), but not 200% or 500% or (as some believe is the case) 1000% more damage.  That imbalance has pushed Verant to make some Kunark and some Velious monsters EVEN MORE powerful, and therefore unbalances casters and hybrids even further.<P>I've been banging this drum for a year and more but what Verant REALLY needs to do is build static models of various player strategies for each class v. all levels of monsters.  These need to be coded up so that Verant can SEE the effect of additions like manastones and moss-covered twigs on downtime and on combat efficiency.  It is becoming increasingly apparent that Verant is depending on the user base to tell them how things 'really work' instead of being pro-active and KNOWING how they really work.  If analytical tools are being used today, they either are weak or are not sufficiently thorough to detect problems before they become complaints.<P>Another way of saying this is that you guys can run analysis logs too.  And given that you can 'pop' a monster in anytime you want, you can capture results either in the server or in a separate model and log-analyze the results.  The players aren't lying when they say that stats seem 'subtle' and that rogues do a LOT more apparent damage than wizards, especially at high levels.  These things present a sense of imbalance that is more overwhelming than any mechanisms that are in place to manage that imbalance (such as the stamina bar having relatively little impact on combat v. the mana bar--heaven help us if you make us throw that invigor spell even more often, though.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, I really wonder about people at times like this.  Try this bit of logic, and see if it makes sense to those who support the original poster:<P>1) Old system, takes 40 percent more XP(kills), than a warrior.  By this, it's implied that those with a 40 percent penalty should be roughly 40 percent more functional.  Maybe not in damage, but to be balanced, you'd need to be a LOT more useful than a warrior.<P>2) New system, the number of kills needed to advance is the same for every class.  This means that everyone should be roughly as functional as every other class(spread between group, damage output, and ability to avoid damage).<P>What the folks from Verant have been saying is that now that we are using the new XP reward system, you can't look at how it USED to be, but as it is at the time they balance the classes.  They arn't saying that hybrid classes shouldn't be balanced based on the "fix" to XP reward that was recently put in, just that the XP penalty no longer applies when they balance class functionality.  <P>Does that clear it up for you?  Just because you've gone through hell in the past to level does NOT mean you deserve anything special as a reward NOW.  Look at your class based on a level 1 who's never experienced the XP penalty.  Is it balanced, yes or no.  That's all you can do, and all Verant can do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>In my opinion and many others the experience penalty removal was indeed an enhancement, but, and there is a big BUT...the experience penalty removal was NOT in anyway more beneficial to the hybrid community.<P>First, there were an abundance of classes that had a penalty of some sort.  One of those was the INT casters.  They had a 10% exp penalty.<P>Second, they also had classes that had experience bonuses.<P>Third, they are penalizing the hybrid classes and bard and monk with greater death penalties with the new system.  The troll SK has the greatest death penalty and this class doesn't necessarily benefit that much overall from the exp penalty removal.<P>The experience penalty went hand in hand with the need to have the hybrid classes have 40% more to gain a level then those that weren't getting the penalty.  As a result, even though the hybrid was taking more experience from the group with the penalty in place, they needed 40% more to level.  On top of that the penalty was setup in such a way that the hybrid didn't receive 40% more, so they actually levelled slower then the other classes.  It's all in the math.  12% gain due to the exp penalty and 40% more needed to level to next level then the non-penalty classes.<P>Upon removal, the hybrids received 40% exp tacked onto the end of their already given experience for each kill.  But, and the big BUT here is that the hybrids still need 40% more to gain the next level.<P>So, in reality the gain is 0.  The hybrids get 40% more and need 40% more.<P>The bonuses they get are ONLY from the ZEM and from the group bonuses.  Nothing more.  The end result is that they get little additional experience due to the removal of the penalty due only to the fact that they require 40% more to level.<P>The non-penalty classes were receiving 12% less experience.  There is a 12% (this is my estimate) average of exp taken by a hybrid during any kill.  So, adding multiple hybrids to the group and you can see that the non-penalty classes were getting hit hard with multiple hybrids in the group.<P>So, if you add the exp sucked up by the hybrids during the kill and you had many hybrids the exp drain could have been dramatic.  So, removing the hybrid penalties gives that much back to the non-penalty casters.<P>In the case of the INT casters, they had a 10% exp penalty.<P>The monk had 20% and the bard had 40%.<P>As you can see, the removal of the exp penalty did not, in anyway benefit the hybrids more then anyone else.<P>If we look at it from the perspective of the new system, the non-penalty classes get a percentage more experience then they did, plus they get the additional bonuses for ZEM and for the group.  Removing the exp penalty gives them more experience overall without having the additional needed experience to level from the experience tables.<P>In other words, they didn't have the experience penalty, thus they didn't have to have more exp to level to the next level, and thus their experience gain is pure and unadulterated.<P>The experience penalty the hybrids had meant that they had to gain 40% more.  In a solo situation the hybrids had the full 40% experience penalty and they had the 40% more to gain to the next level.  All this did was remove the 40% experience penalty, and with the experience system change they gain 40% more but still have the 40% difference for each level thus negating the penalty, giving them a net of 0.<P>So the non-penalty classes get a bonus on top of the ZEM and group due to the removal of the penalty and they can play and gain exp as if they never played with a hybrid before.  But the hybrids are gaining 0 extra except for the ZEM and group bonuses.<P>The hybrid also receives a death penalty.  This penalty requires that they loose 40% more experience upon a death then a non-penalty class.  Verant saw 40% as a large number so they shaved 10% off that making it only 30%.  This isn't a big problem except that if they don't get a rez then they loose 30% more then a non-penalty class would loose upon death.<P>So, the hybrids get only the ZEM and group bonus and receive a death penatly if they can't get a rez.  This is hardly a greater benefit to the hybrids vs. the non-penalty classes.<P>The argument about the balance is hardly a valid one.  It was a way for Verant to win every class balance argument. It was a way to shut down the discussions.  Here's an example:<P>A_Player00:  I am having problems playing.  I play very well and have been playing for 2 years now.  My hybrid ranger is having great difficulty suriving.  When he goes into battle he gets smacked so hard and the other group members can't get him off me.  I die so often and the other group members are getting tired of it because of all the down time it takes to rez me and the down time due to all the heals the cleric threw on me.<P>A_player01:  I see the same thing, but the bard I play has no offense.  He swings and hardly hits and hits for almost nothing when he does.  I know he is primarly a group buffer and has some nice other abilities, but I find that the bard is having problems because most of these other songs, etc are either broken or are too weak to be effective at level 50+.<P>Abashi or Absor or Aradune:  Class balalance isn't based on whether you are more effective offensively or defensively.  It is whether there's a compelling reason to play the class.<P>That effectively ends the discussion as far as they are concerned.  There's no need to discuss the issues with the broken songs.  There's no reason to discuss the defense issues of the ranger and their survivability.  There's no reason to discuss the effectiveness of the bard songs on mobs over a certain level.<P>It effectively ends all communication and any further communication on the issue becomes whinning in some of the reader's eyes.<P>So, class balance is just about what the player community says it is.  It isn't up to Aradune, Absor, nor Abashi to determine what is balance and what isn't.  It is not some general vague rule stated in some on-line document that determines what class balance is.  It is the player in conjunction with Verant's tuning team.<P>Verant has really described a sliding scale of balance.  This means that they have said that some classes are on the low end of the balance scale and some on the high end.  This means that those on the low end will always perform less and will die more.  The problem is that the persons on the high end of the sliding scale don't get hurt as bad with this vague description.  They can always attack those that are on the low end.  The question becomes then, how would you feel, if you were on the high end of the sliding scale and Verant decided to move you to the low end?  Would you complain or just play your char.  I guarantee you that you'd voice your opinion and try to get things changed.<P>What is funny to me is how they take the high end chars and make them more powerful.  For instance, the way they changed the rogue and made it the necro of the melee classes and then enhanced it even more.  Then they enhanced it again.  The same goes for the enchanter.  They have taken a strong class, capable of soloing 4-5 specs at level 40+ and given it more abilities while classes such as the ranger, on the low end of the scale, received no enhancements for the longest period of time.  Try thinking about how the rogues and enchanters would feel if they moved them to the low end of the sliding scale.<P>I think you get the point there.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>And...my initial post did say that it was judged by me to be a matter of a balance issue, but it asked the question of how much did it affect balance.  My conclusion was that it affected it in almost no way resulting in a nil change to balance due to how it affected the other classes and how the history of changes have affected the ranger in a negative way.<P>The rangers still need to have their defense skills fixed and Verant can't seem to get that worked out.<P>I love how they said they would be changing tracking and when they do the tracking was changed in such a sloppy way.  It now lists the mobs /con to the ranger.  It was supposed to be a ranger only change, yet my bard also sees this /con.  Anyway, tracking isn't something that affects the ranger's balance.  It is, after a certain level, a non-skill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nope, you are wrong on this one.  Hybrids now get 40% more XP than they used to, but need the same number of XP to level compared to what they used to need.<P>What was changed was NOT to the class/race requirement to level, but to nullify the difference between baseline(warrior), and hybrid kills needed to level for people that are the same level.<P>level 50 paladins now need only to kill the same number of mobs as a level 50 warrior of the same race.  If a level 50 warrior needs to hit the 10,000,000 mark to hit level 51, that means a paladin would need to hit the 14,000,000 mark.<P>That's 4 million more XP than the warrior needs.  Now, per kill on the same mob, the paladin gets 40% more XP for the same kill.  So when the warrior hits that 10,000,000 mark, the Paladin will hit the 14,000,000 mark.<P>Previously, the paladin needed to kill an additional 40% more mobs to level to 51.<P>Now, if both die, let's say the warrior will lose 1,000,000 XP, the paladin will lose 1,400,000 XP.  Killing the same mobs at the same rate, which one will get back to where they were before death?  Answer is they get it back at the same time.  Yea, they lose more, it LOOKS like more, but it's gained back at a rate that compares to the warrior.  <P>Where's the confusion here?  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think what people are trying to convey is that when the Paladin, Shadow Knight, and Ranger "balance" discussions come and go, NO ONE wants to see Verant say "Well, we did take away the exp penalty" quite simply because this has absolutely nothing to do with it any longer. That is why it was removed, not because it wasn't unbalancing, but because it was just a mistake to be there in the first place.<P>So when the Hybrids tell you they are still useless, dont bother saying you removed the exp penalty, so its a lot easier, just give them all the defensive upgrades they need to remain viable. <P>The exp penalties are history.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In most group with a hybrid as the highest level, everyone will get more XP under the new system than under the old system.<P>If the hybrid is quit a bit higher level, the hybrid gets less than before, but those groups are fairly rare, because people knew that grouping with a hybrid too many levels above them meant they didn't get much XP.<P>If the hybrid is only 4 or 5 levels above at high levels, the rest of the group gets more than before because of the "linear by level" split, and the hybrid gets more because of the hybrid multiplier, which is enough to offset the loss from the "linear by level" split.<P>Perhaps I'll clean up some code I wrote that lets you specify a proposed party, by race, class, and level, and then shows you how many kills it would take to reach various levels fighting things that are low blue to the highest level member.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay... for the most part I think ALL classes are gaining slightly more experience now than they were before. Hybrids argue that they lose more on death as well, so let's just assume those cancel eachother out.<P>But, there is one more advantage that hybrids get out of this that I don't see many people mentioning, and that is group appeal. They are now more appealing to a group. There are fewer groups that will turn away a Ranger just because he sucks up too much experience.<P>Argue if you will, that you don't think the improvement has much merit, I think you may have a case there. But I'm not going to buy the arguement that there was no hybrid improvement at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Targonis-FW,<P>The hybrid experience tables required that they earn 40% more experience to level.<P>For one reason and one reason alone did Verant tack on the added 40% onto every kill that any hybrid gets.  It was to offset this 40% additional experience required to each level.<P>It would be completely unbalancing to give every hybrid that starts at level 1 after the penalty removal a 40% more experience bonus.  That would make them level much faster.  Add to that the ZEM and group bonuses and the hybrids could be earning experience at an incredible rate.<P>Giving the hybrids 40% more to simply offset the experience table requirements effectively grants the hybrids a nil increase.  They did this because they said they didn't want to run through the experience tables with a level converter which would result in level increases for most hybrids.<P>So, it is clearly a 40% added to offset the 40% more required.  They don't require any more then they needed before.  That is true, but they needed 40% more back before the change.  The 40% more is carried over without change.  The 40% bonus is given to offset the experience table modifiers.<P>This is abundantly clear in what Abashi wrote and posted in Aradune's name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Cleric gets 51 xp. <BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>So,<BR>Before:<BR>Pali gets 40% more xp than cleric<BR>After:<BR>Pali gets 40% more xp than cleric<P>Before:<BR>Pali gets xp that he got before.<BR>Cleric gets xp that he got before.<BR>After:<BR>Pali gets 20% more xp than he got before<BR>Cleric gets 20% more xp than he got before<P>Before:<BR>Pali needs 40% more xp to DING than cleric<BR>After:<BR>Pali needs 40% more xp to DING than cleric<P>...<P>um, it seems to me that the xp penalty was shared with the group equally before.  The removal simply made _groups_ with hybrids DING faster.  Which is a good thing for hybrids, because they are _always_ in a group with a hybrid, as opposed to non-hybrids who ain't. . .<P>Ok.  You've piqued my curiosity.  I'm gonna work out if there is any situation (ignoring death) in which a Hybrid could advance slower now than he did before.<P>Now, how about this situation:<BR>Troll SK.<BR>Baseline Cleric<P>in a group?<P>At L 2, Troll SK has 1680 xp to a cleric's 1000 xp.<P>Kill a 100 xp monster.<BR>Before:<BR>Troll earned 64 xp.  1.25 % of the xp to DING<BR>Cleric earned 38 xp.  1.24 % of the xp to DING<BR>(difference due to round-off error, really)<BR>After:<BR>Troll earned 71 xp.  1.4 % of the xp to DING<BR>Cleric earned 51 xp.  1.67 % of the xp to DING<P>So, Trolls SKs DING faster in a group of two.  <P>...<P>Ok, worst-case time.<BR>1 Troll SK<BR>5 Halfling (Rogues or Warriors, the one with a .9 mult)<P>Halfling mult before was what, .855?<P>On 1200 xp, the group got 1296 xp.<P>Before:<BR>At L 2, the total group xp was 5955<BR>At L 2, the troll had 1680 xp<BR>So, the troll earned 366 xp off the 1200 xp kill.<P>After:<BR>The xp totals are the same, but the group earned 1440 xp, and the troll got 336.<P>Less xp.<P>Yes, there is a situation in which a Troll SK can earn _less_ xp after this patch than before.<P>Not a likely situation.  And, if you are grouping with non-halflings and non-warrior/rogues, it won't happen.  But it can happen.<P>I doubt this was intended.  But it happened.<P>Similar things happen to a lesser extent in any large group with 1 racially penalized race in it.  They are earning slightly more usually, but everyone else is earning _much_ more.<P>And, the Troll SK is not even close to earning 40% more xp than he did before, in any grouping situation, outside of soloing or grouping only with hybrids.  Earning 40% more xp than he did before is what is required for a Hybrid to earn back the additional xp-loss on death that has been added.<P>In small groups, not counting death, and for those grouping with hybrids, this has been a boon for the Hybrids.  In large groups, counting death, all the xp patch did was make people stop avoiding the xp vampires.<P>Just thought I'd get this strait.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't think that the exp issue was really a big deal -- IMHO it was just an excuse for not inviting the hybrid into a group, when the real reason was "Rangers/Paladis/Shadow Knights don't really add anything so we'll just hold out for a rogue or a warrior, thanks for playing though."<P>I didn't see alot of bards begging for groups, because most sensible players know the value of a bard in reducing downtime if for no other reason.<P>I didn't see alot of monks begging for groups and they were penalized as well.<P>I didn't see alot of Troll/Ogre warriors looking for groups either.<P>Seriously, would the post 50 game be any different if clerics suffered a 200% experience penalty?<P>So the real point is that gameplay not exp-bean counting governs who gets to do what.  Until the tanking monopoly of Warriors is broken its gonna be a big blue world.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
