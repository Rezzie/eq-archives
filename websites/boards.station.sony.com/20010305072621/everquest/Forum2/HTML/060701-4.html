Make the other team member KoS if they go to the other teams town!  EX:  If a Woodelf goes to kaladim he would die.  But thats only if hes IN THE CITY ZONE!  I wouldn't want some big ass monster chasing me and I couldn't go to the guards.  + the boat is in Kaladim so that would also suck big time.<P>And I said this before but...GET RID OF EVERY KOBOLD QUEST AND MAKE THEN A PLAYABLE CHARACTER!  I DEMAND IT!  I PAY MY FEE.  I PAY MY TAXES!  PLEASEEEEEEEE!<P>PS.<BR>Make Kobolds a playable character.

</FONT><HR>The idea that 4-team hard-coding would destroy friendships is laughable.  I have plenty of friends on teams other than the ones I play on, and we have lots of fun in game playing together...when we are killing each other.  <P>Another point: Some people are offering a rather skewed view of the history of Tallon Zek and the guild structure on that server in order to support their cross-teaming point of view.  Verant please take these people with a grain of salt.  Heres a good example of a very skewed perception:<P>astrael said:<BR>&gt;On Tallon Zek, the whole xteam healing furor only arose when the dark team, previously completely dominant, began to lose that dominance to a united light alliance. Many "dark" character players began an attempt to destroy the light unity by rolling light team twinks who created ligh-on-light PK guilds. When the light alliance proved impervious to these tactics, they began to agitate for code changes to cripple the ability of multi-race light guilds to fight together in PvP. When my guild offered a guildwar to these 4-team guilds, which would remove the invul healer exploit, we were invariably turned down. In other words, it wasn't exploiting that bothered these guilds, it was light teams allied together.&lt;<P>Frankly this is BS.<P>(1) He says that the early ligh-raced single team guilds consisted mostly of dark twinks.  This is absolutely false.  In fact, most of them came from light raced guilds.<P>(2) "When the light alliance proved impervious to these tactics" --- The light alliance harrased them mercilously with constant OOR healing, corpse camping, traning, and constant profanity, and yet these guilds still survive, even though they still have to endure these tactics today.<P>(3) "When my guild offered a guildwar to these 4-team guilds"  Let me guess??? You are one of those guilds whose average membership was around level 45-50, who bravely offered to /guildwar one-team guilds consisting entirely of members who were under level 20 at the time.<P>Don't forget Single team guilds on this server also include some of the most successful and influential guilds on the server:<P>Warlords of Zek<BR>Nox Noctis<BR>Wraithguard<BR>Final Endeaver (human only)<BR>etc...<P>Anono<BR>Level 57 Enchanter<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heh, nice that Verant is (starting) to balance PvP.<P>Ok, I'm an Lvl 21 Iksar monk playing on Vallon, and I have noticed a few issues already. First of all, we Iksars can't fix faction easily in Grobb or Oggok. That only lets Iksar warriors and monks bind in either Cabilis and Neriak. Although we can get a safe bind in OT (near the shoreline by the wall) that is a bit few. I'm not saying we need to be able to bind in all "darkie" cities (although it would be very nice), but atleast one more. A CR from Neriak to Upper Guk can't be funny, and a CR from Neriak to Lower Guk is BAD. B-A-D  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Another thing which is very annoying is when PK:ers come into newbie zones. The only thing they accomplish is being annoying and a pain in the behind. If newbies were immune until, let's say lvl 8 or something, it would be funnier for the newbies. I understand when people quit PvP(-team) due to being PK'ed while being a newbie. Otherwise, we could get some kind of patriot bonus when fighting in newbie zones.<P>The biggest problem so far must be Cross-teaming. All "Zek" servers are PvP or PvP-team. All other servers are not PvP.<BR>Zek = PvP<BR>Not Zek = Not PvP<BR>So why not play on ordinary servers if you want to be an Ogre and team with an Elf? So either Crossteaming has to be removed 100%, or make it possible to attack crossteamers. They ARE traitors after all.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Another thing which might be hard to remedy is guard pulling. Raids on cities doesnt happend TOO often, and as long as you leave the newbies alone (well, not corpsecamp them atlest  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) that can be entertaining. No one loses exp or any big amount of cash (unless they don't notice that there are about 50 PC's from another team outside their city, they put all cash in the bank). Something which is NOT funny at all is when somebody creates a Lvl 1 char and pulls the guards on you.<P>That leads me to the annoying fact of corpsecamping. That is SO wrong. Corpsecampers doesn't earn squat at corpsecamping except one more enemy. Stop corpsecamping and I will be a lot happier  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>// Thidney<BR>In hoc signio Iksar.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One more thing..<P><BR>1.  Reduce effective AC on casters because of level difference.<P>Let me explain.<P>A level 52 warrior attacking a level 60 wizard has an incredibly unfair chance to hit and deal significant damage based on level difference only.<P>I am a cleric.  When I swing my morning star at a red con wizard, I should hit more than 20% of the time with incredibly low damage rolls (I have 200 offense, 175 1hblunt).  When I swing at blue cons, I hit more often and for higher damage.<P>My morning star should hurt a wizard, no matter what the level difference is.  A level 60 wizard shouldn't be able to laugh at my melee skills.<P>Casters should be fodder for ANY melee attacks that are close enough to hit them.<P>Tael Elamshinae<BR>57th Templar of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the best suggestion so far is to hardcode either Tallon or Vallon to teams and then let people move between them.  That way us "crazy" one teamers can be happy and the other 70%(yeah right) will be happy.  Most people are forgetting that the ENTIRE DARK TEAM has been playing it the right way since day one.  It's the lights that are exploiting the code and hurting the other three teams.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, might as well throw out some ideas here:<BR>As much as I would like to see Rallos go to coin-only, there are a lot of people who play there that would like it to stay as-is. Why not take a good old-fashoined vote? There are those voting thinies that pop up every now and then, why not make this one of the questions asked?<BR>If it stays as coin and item loot, make stuff in bags lootable. That way people might have a chance of getting their ganked items back. Somebody posted that item loot is the only thing that rpomts revenge. What kind of revenge do you get to kill a fully bagged caster and you can't even get any coin because he/she destroyed it all before he/she died? Either that or make spells lootable from the spellbook. Well, that'll probably not happen, but it'd be interesting...<BR>At any rate, exploiters are the biggest problem. I have no problem losing a fair fight or a reasonable facsimile thereof, but my experience has been that most pk's will resort to any dirty trick they can pull to kill you with little or no risk to themselves. Stealthing GMs and Guides somehow and increasing the number of them on the server would be the logical course of action. That would probably be a good idea for all servers actually, as most players know that guides and GM's won't do squat unless they actually are able to witness most transgressions.<BR>Don't change NODROP stuff. It's NODROP for a reason, and the moment you change it so pk's can get more Phat Lewt you will see twinkie pk's running around in full planar making Rallos a bigger hellhole for newbies than it already is.<BR>Also, perhaps turn off PvP for pre-level 5s. That would discourage the daytrippers who just want to kill some newbies while their server is down. The reason the server is so underpopulated, besides the reputation that PvP has of being unblancing, is that the first 10 levels or so (and this isn't a magical number, that's just the general range) can be absolute hell, and people who want to give Rallos Zek a genuine try can be discouraged real easy when they get ganked four times before they can even get their newbie tunic. By level5 5 most players can get out of potential ganking situations they don't want to be in.<BR>Well, I hope this helps.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The victim should not get a faction hit for killing the attacker as this is selfdefense. <P>Buffs and Heals should only be done to the reciepent within the 5 level range of the buffer.<P>Should be some enforment of loot and scoot. ie you maynot stay in the same zone that you where pked in (unless its your home town zone) for more that 5 mins at a time for a 45 min period or you get put into a penalty box for 10 mins.<P>More GMs educated on pvp.<P>Fix the fighting skills of warrior class so when they delevel there skill caps relect there level.. nothing worse than a lvl 16 rogue backstabbing for 160dmg.<P>Place a roving guard in GF.. this zone is very large and seems to be 1 of the few newbie zones that dont have protection.. ie put a guard that walks the path.<P>There are a few more I could think up but these are the main ones that come to mind. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are what I consider good solutions to the problems that currently plague Rallos Zek.  Probably, being on the 4th page of the 3rd repost, noone will in the public will read it, but I hope someone at Verant does.  Oh, and I hope HTML tags work, if not please disregard the garbledey****.<P>&lt;b&gt;To address the risk/reward imbalance:&lt;/b&gt;<P>&lt;i&gt;Faction&lt;/i&gt;.  Only the person who INITIATES the pvp encounter (the aggressor) will have faction affected. You've all heard this one, I don't need to rehash it.  It's merits are obvious.<P>&lt;i&gt;Looting&lt;/i&gt;.  Assign a point value to each equippable item based on stats and item effects (procs, clickables, etc).  Assign a point value modifier for each class to each stat.  In other words, a +STR item would be worth more points on a warrior than on a wizard.  At the time of the death of a player through PVP, the total point value of all items worn by the victorious group or individual is divided by the amount of items worn, coming to an average point value that was risked.  Exclude no drop items from this calculation.  Anything on the victim that has a point value less than that average can be looted, not including handheld items, but including items in bags.  In this way there is a direct, simple correlation between items risked and the rewards gained thereby, and bagging, which makes for a rather boring pvp experience, becomes a very stupid thing to do.  <P>This reintroduces to rallos the problem of heavily twinked newbies.  To resolve this, assign a point value cap based on level.  For instance, say a cloth tunic, ostensibly one of the best items a level 1 newbie could get on his or her own merits, has a point value of 50.  Based on this theory, assign a point value cap to a level 1 newbie of 50.  Now, say a rubicite breastplate has a point value of 50000.  If it's worn by a level 1 newbie, it's point value drops down to that level's point cap, so the rubi now has a point value of 50 and can be looted by anyone who is wearing at least a cloth tunic.<P>&lt;i&gt;Looting rights.&lt;/i&gt;  Only allow a player's corpse to be looted by another player if that player (or the group the player is a part of) did at least 60% group aggregate damage.  In other words, You or your group have to do at least 3 bubs of damage on a victim before you can loot the corpse.  This should eliminate the opportunistic item ganking that is so common right now.<P>&lt;b&gt;To address the melee equipment dependency issue:&lt;/b&gt;<P>&lt;i&gt;"Soulbinds".&lt;/i&gt;  Introduce a few new quests that are a mechanism whereby a player can exchange one of their items for another item that is identical, but no-drop.  Link the value of the item (the point value described above) to the difficulty of the quest.  In other words, make it impossible for a level 1 to soulbind a rubicite breastplate.  That would be bad.  Make these quests time consuming enough that it would be unlikely that people would want to do it over and over again to achieve a full set of no-drop. Make them one way, as well, ie no quests to change an item back to it's droppable form.  This way the overproliferation of many items will be resolved on a continuing basis, which would do wonders for the in-game economy.  <P>&lt;b&gt;To address delevellers:&lt;/b&gt;<P>&lt;i&gt;Experience debt.&lt;/i&gt;  You've all heard this one, so I'll just summarize.  Make it impossible to lose a level.  If you need X experience to be level 10, and you die at exactly level 10, you don't lose level 10, you simply have farther to go to reach level 11.<P>&lt;b&gt;To address newbie killers:&lt;/b&gt;<P>&lt;i&gt;Sliding Scale pvp range limitations.&lt;/i&gt;  Newbie killing is fine, just fine, until the combat between one newbie and another becomes totally lopsided.  There are 3 things that make this happen.  1 is delevelling, which is addressed above.  Another is the fact that even though 4 levels above may not be such a big deal at level 50, it is a VERY big deal at level 1.  A level 1 newbie has absolutely no chance standing toe to toe with a level 5 newbie, pure and simple.  Make the level limit 1 level above or below from 1-10, 2 from 11-20, 3 from 21-30, etc etc.  Not only will this be a big step in making the newbie experience less the hellish trial it is and more a decent introduction to PvP combat, but it will make things more evenly matched across the board, level-wise.<P>&lt;i&gt;Eliminate no-drops at low levels.&lt;/i&gt;  The last thing that makes for lopsided combat between newbies are non-lootable items, notably weapons and no drop armor such as shin armor from Guk.  Easily fixed.  Make weapons lootable using the same point system as described above, but only through level 10.  Allow no drop items on players level 10 or below to be looted as if they were not no drop. <P>&lt;b&gt;To address the issue of exploits:&lt;/b&gt;<P>&lt;i&gt;Empowered, knowledgable guides.&lt;/i&gt;  All of the exploits that matter to people on Rallos Zek are illegal already.  The play nice policies are well written, concise, and logical.  They are also widely regarded as a joke.  Noone who is impowered to enforce them is willing to do so, nor do they have the time.  The GMs are scarce at best, and virtually impossible to get ahold of even when they are online.  The guides are typically ignorant of the issues that really need to be looked at, and instead spend their time changing people's last names, enforcing naming policies, and doing corpse retrievals. <P> There needs to be a pool of guides whose specific mandate is to find and punish exploiters.  A new classification of guides, PvP enforcers, the police force of Norrath.  They would, acting on tips recieved through /petition, investigate people's behavior, invisibly and undetectably.  You see, it's impossible to monitor every zone line, every port, all day every day.  The guides currently don't even bother trying to enforce the play nice and anti-exploit policies because they are already kept busy enough by other forms of petitions, for name changes and lost corpses and such.  Enforcement needs to be a priority of some of your GM/guide staff.  Once this happens, exploitation will go the way of the dodo bird very, very fast, without necessity for code changes.<P>I'm certain there's something that I've missed, and I'd love to hear it.  Please, try and keep flames to a minimum, I've thought long and hard about these points, and though I don't expect everyone to agree, I do hope that people will at least respect me for an honest attempt to describe the path to balanced and enjoyable pvp.  Note that none of these changes would in any way affect the PvE game experience.<P>Kurkati Copperclaw<BR>Black Claws, Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tallon and Vallon were initiallly designed as pvp TEAMS servers, but since shortly after its inception has not functioned as such.  There has only been two teams, light and dark.  Recently, even this has changed with guilds forming that are total cross-team guilds, or have members from every team.  Why have a "teams" server if the game code does not support it?  Change the code, making it impossible to buff or heal members of another team.  This will greatly inhibit cross teaming and preserve the "teams" concept.

</FONT><HR>Item loot as it exists on Rallos, is in direct opposition to Verant's stance on Risk vs Reward.<P>I cannot say that I am in support of coin only, but I must say I doubt that Verant will be able to fix item loot. A movelog would STILL be apprciated if Rallos is to be left in it's current broken state.<P>An alternative that has been mentioned is the lootable head - use the killed PC's head as a lore item that can be exchanged to one's guild for some value (coin/item?).  Use of a new faction could allow for an increase in value as a player turns in more heads - and negative faction with the race of the head's previous owner for balance.<P>There must be a way to continue to have the risk without so easily allowing the lazy PKers to gain all the reward.<P>Also - I love the idea of using tombs to determine which team you are on (good or evil), with only the neutral races being given the choice between the two sides.  That is one of the best team server structures I could imagine.<P>When might a reality check be forthcoming from Verant?  For those of us that have walked down this 'Give us your suggestions' path a few times and watched Verant do nothing, it is hard to have too much faith that Verant will not simply turn their backs on us yet again. <P>-tera</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Add in some twink gear and the rogue is a killing machine.  Now think of doing this with a warrior, get a high level pc to p-level you to level40-50 then delevel yourself to level 20ish.

MANY OF US WANT TO KNOW THE REASONING TO THIS FARCE?!<P>One last thing... clerics and enchanters rely on magic for all pvp combat yet all of our spells are magic based.  Game design issue... MR GEAR is very easy to obtain hence we can only melee *bleh* so we die... so I suggest that in pvp combat that MR's are halfed to accomidate the FACT that anyone can get MR of 100 fairly easy.  Verant has already lowered the spell damage to 66% for pvp so one should also decrease the MR (and other resists) buy half.  I would also suggest that you increase the save rate for root type spells (ie every tick you have a higher chance of breaking out) and I suggest the same for snare.  That way non casters can not exploit the melee people with snare and root.<P>Zelbee Silvertongue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>immortal healing is a problem and there is a simple (well your programers might disagree) solution:<P>make it so the faction hit for PvP teams is not just given to the person making the kill, but is also shared with anyone assisting the kill, (ie those healing). This is a fair way to control x-teaming abuse. Thus an elf imortally healing a gnome killing elfs would recieve the same faction hit as the gnome, this would more then liely stop the elf from healing the gnome, bad fation with your own race sucks.<P>another problem is with the lighty/darky split, since the light races have formed an aliance of sorts, a good way to help the balance of power (lighty vs darky) and to mae it harder to x-team is to split up the lighty teams even more, instead of 3 lighty teams (elfs, humans and shorties) split them into 8 teams (high elf, wood elf, gnome, dwarf, hafling, human, euridite, barbarian) this would mae it harder to immortal heal among these teams and would increase the numbers of potential enemies that the lighties would face (now the gnome has to keep an eye out for the dwarf) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Arkons,<BR>maybe I was wrong about the interrupt. I will test them again. I was sure they did though. <P>Where did you hear that your resistance check is based on your HP? Are you sure warriors dont just resist better because they get the MR bonus after level 25 or such? At level 50 a warriors base MR is 50 I believe. Correct me if I am wrong, but I'm pretty sure that is the case. It is based on their level. <P>I'm not saying you are wrong on the HP thing, but I have not heard that anywhere and am just curious if that is speculation or fact that you heard from Verant. <P>Anyway, Verant IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE the way resists are done. They are not going to change major code for pvp concerns. They may be willing to change some flags but that is all. Like I said.

</FONT><HR>Someone earlier brought up the idea of guild vs guild vs nonguilded PvP teams server. I absolutely love the idea.<P>For guildwar PvP to work you would need:<P>-Hardcoded Guild Teams<P>-Ability to ally with a limited number of guilds, I would say no more then 3. Which gives the ability to heal/buff your allies but you can still attack allies, allowing reasons for faulty alliances.<P>-An account cap that each guild can have, not players. I would say limit of 30 or possibly as low as 20. Allow too many and alliances could become too powerful.<P>Since no other guilds but your allies and guild can help you in a combat situation. It would more promote constant PvP over camp areas. Yes guilds could always form treaties but I doubt many would last long. When your guild comes by and wants to camp something they are currently camping or they choose an ally you dont care for.<P>This would probably take more work then lazy Verant would be willing to put in. Even though the change would probably make PvP servers as popular as blue servers.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings. I'm a level 54 warrior, and I've posted once on the first thread of this topic. I've been in Dynasty of Blood and am presently in The Regulators, two largely PvP based guilds, and feel my input is necesary for helping the outcome of PvP after this thread. =)<P>Firstly, I politely ask you to take a look at my post in the first page, as well as all posts by Arkons (well, all the REAL ones). I have some ideas of my own that I thought of today at work and would like to share.<P>1.) PvP ONLY quests. There is already a flag set for us. Allow PvP only gear in, perhaps, The Temple of Solusek Ro. No drop armors and items that help ONLY in pvp, and would in no way unbalance the PvE game. Items like Egg shaped pumice (what about turning in a level 50+ spell for a bag of pumice?). Good NO DROP resist gear with decent AC. Again, ONLY accessible by those with a PvP flag. This gear wouldn't be exceptionally useful on raids (you can max resists with droppable gear anyways). <P>2.) Channeling. It is nearly impossible to disrupt a high level casting. I have hit someone with a round of 4, plus a kick (at 55 this won't be a problem), and a caster can get off a gate with no problem. Is this right? I recall a confrontation where I hit with a wurmslayer and shimmering partisan for nearly 400 damage, including kick, dropping the caster by nearly half of his life, yet he gated away safely. Another time I was on my necro, and I was attacked. I fled, and while casting gate, was struck by a spell, rendering me unconscious. Next thing I know, loading please wait. I showed in full gear, safely escaped, using my special 'Unconscious gate' ability, I suppose. lol. Healing spells seem especially hard to interrupt. Shadow step isn't possible to interrupt, but LoH is /boggle. Yes I've interrupted it once =).<P>3.) PUMICE PUMICE PUMICE! Please lower the casting time to the time on shadowstep (to prevent running and casting at the same time). AND/OR create a new pumice, melee only, self casting of cancel magic, one buff removeable. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a solo warrior to escape a druid, because I KNOW I have no chance of killing him (assuming he is knowledgeable of his pvp abilities). He can outrun me anyday with jboots, and SoC lets him get away nearly unscathed. He can winged death and run away, leaving me to die. (See comments on my post, or other posts, about unresistable dots). I NEED pumice stones to be able to survive. Not to have a chance at killing him nessecarily, but at SURVIVING. My only choice would be to zone-plug, which is silly. <P>Hope this helps, as I said, check out my first post on the first thread please, I believe there are a few good ideas for solving some major problems.<P>Achazael Hammerfall<BR>54 Champion<BR>DoB/ The Regulators<BR>"How'd you kill me?

</FONT><HR>First off, I think Chieftan on page 3 of this thread summed it all up for me. Nice job.<P>Off topic....<BR>&lt;&lt;astrael&gt;&gt; You know that glass house you were talking about? Hmmm.... Even in trying to show off your largely inflated ego/intellect by correcting gramatical errors, you made one yourself. I'd put the rocks down if I were you.<P>And out of range healing is by no means in the same category as immortal healing. If I am in a raid with 35 Darks on the Lake of Ill Omen, and a person 20 lvls my senior on my team heals me to the event I win my battle is not illegal and works within the design model of "teamplay" you help exploit everyday with your xteaming and immortal healing. (run-on, but do I look like I care?)<BR>That person is defending and assisting his team in combat, that is good RPing and the intent of the server. If that healer were a "Human" and I was killing a human, that is immortal healing. The human I am attacking has no recourse of action, and is doomed to die by an exploit. Now my team member 20 lvls higher can be attacked by anyone from the other 3 teams at the Lake within lvl range. (Which btw, since you all xteam so well, there is almost always someone within calling range to do so.)<P>Immortal Healing = evil exploit<BR>Same teams OOR healing = "team" defense design model, working as intended.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, I do truly hope you read this far. Anyways, although this post with an SK-only concern, I have posted it here because it really only is a concern on PvP servers. I have been playing an SK from the moment EQ went into Beta 4, and on TZ since the day that server went live... just so as you read the following you can know its an informed opinion.<P>HARM TOUCH<P>First, I am the first to agree that the reduction in PvP damage via HT is a GOOD thing in general. HT had become too powerful, expecially at higher levels. Circumstances had flooded in of Lvl 60 SKs being able to "auto-kill" casters. Harm touch in essence became Death touch. The 12% decrease (from prior to the patch) in HT damage in PvP still allows HT to be as viable in PvP as it was before the damaged was upped, while allowing it to be more useful still in PvE.<P>However, the change I do feel needs to be looked at it the fact that HT will no longer respawn upon death. In my (almost) 2-years of playing EQ, and since TZ has opened, I perhaps have heard, let alone seen, of maybe only 2-3 incidents where SKs bind-rushing another and HTing them was a problem. However, I am willing to accept that some (albeit it a huge minority) may feel it is a problem. Below I will make some points as to why I feel it is LESS of a problem than it is made to be on PvP-servers, and finally, a simple compromise that could be integrated with no large coding changes (I am assuming here, but once you see the solution I think you can agree its not a major change).<P>1. A typical Lvl 50 SK HT will do approximately 500 pts damage (rough estimation) in PvP. If they use it, are killed in that battle, they return to their bind-point and must wait 72 mins (I belive this is the refresh time... never actually had the patience to check it in-game) before it comes back. However, a Lvl 50 wizard, killed in PvP returns to his bind-point with no mana. How long does it take for that same wizard to meditate enough to be able to cast a 500 pt DD? 5-10 mins? And that is being generous I would assume.<P>2. Seeing as how SKs, being melees, cannot currently bind anywhere that does not have a "city" flag (i.e. Neriak, CoM, GF), while casters can bind almost anywhere, doesn't this make caster bind-rushing still more viable currently than SK bind-rushing? This leads to point 3...<P>3. When an SK uses his HT in PvP, and then dies during that encounter, he now must wait upwards of 72 mins before he is at full fighting capability. HT IS a very important part of an SKs arsenal in PvP. A caster on the other hand is at full strength againonce all their mana is back... say, approximately 15 mins. So, for over an hour after a PvP death in which the SK used his HT, he is penealized for that encounter. In all subsequent PvP encounters during this time he is far from able to function at full capability. No other class, not even paladins, have this restriction placed on them<P>4. Previously an SK could know that in any PvP battle he could use his HT (provided it was up), even if the encounter was in doubt, because on death it would refresh, and therefore in any other PvP encounter following this death he would not be at a severe disadvantage, even though he had died in the first battle. Now, the situation is essentially that you MUST be sure your HT will kill your opponent, or change the outcome of the battle. Why? To use it and still die means you have essentially wasted your HT, since it will not refresh for 72 mins, even after dying. Therefore, in all subsequent PvP encounters during the period the SK is at a severe disadvantage.<P>SOLUTION:<P>Upon death, if the SK has previously used his HT, and it has not yet refreshed, instead of having HT refresh immediately (as prior to the latest patch), have a 10 or 15 min timer start, at the end of which the HT will refresh.<P>This means that no SK can use his HT for bind-rushing, since those who killed him have at least a 10-15 min repreve. This seems consistent with the fact that a caster who returns to his bind-point with no mana after a PvP death need only med for 10-15 mins to be at full functionality, and cause considerably more damage than an SKs HT.<P>This solution also means that an SK may use his HT in PvP without being concerned that if he were to die in that encounter, he would be at a disdvantage for quite some time even following retrieving his corpse.<P>Its a good compromise. Ask any questions you may have about the reasoning Absor, I know I kind of began to ramble.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Once again Arkons skirts the obvious and tries to portray Dots as being more powerful than dd's.<P>Winged Death and Splurt are unresistable and do their damage in over or under a min.<P>How many unresistable lures can you cast in the 48 seconds of time for Winged Death? The answer is, alot bloody more than 1280 damage worth.<P>You can gate from a dot, you can't gate from a dd.<P>You can pumice a dot, you can't pumice a dd.<P>If you're going for corpse loots, 9 times out of 10 it's going to be a dder who gets the loot as opposed to a dotter.<P>All of the dots are either resisted or full damage, there is no chance for partial damage like dd casters have.<P>It's simple, Wizards want to get rid of the only competition to their kill power (Druids and Necromancers.)<P>And Suuuuuuuuuuure, if an unresistable dot is a problem then an unresistable lure is even more of a problem.

Therefore no ninja looting.<P>2).  There must be a way to make your items no drop ...either through quests or paying alot.<P>3).

</FONT><HR>Achazael you say that warriors stink in pvp?<P>What are you talking about. Warriors are almost impossible to kill. Level 60 wizards wont even go near em cause their resists are INSANE along with Insane hp and combat abilities<P>If anything resists need to be reduced at high levels for some classes. Heck if i unload a FULL BAR of mana i MIGHT take off half a bubble of hp on a warrior if im LUCKY!! Now tell me that warrior needs more resist?<P>Personally i agree with the pvp+ only items but i think they should ONLY work in pve. This would give us in pvp a greater footing towards balancing our abilities towards mobs against those on other servers.

</FONT><HR>Biggest problem on Rallos for me is not the corpse camping, or anything else.  It's how easy it is for Rallos Zek players to lose exp.<P>It's happened several times to me in the last few weeks.  You're fighting along in your group when suddenly a wizard comes up behind you, nukes you twice, and the enemy gets the final hit.  Guess what?  You just lost the last 3 hours of hunting because some naked caster decided to PK you while you're fighting mobs.<P>REDUCE THE EXP LOSS ON RALLOS.  At first glance everyone will say "No fair, they'll level faster" but thats really untrue.  On Rallos and Vallon, no one can wear half their armor because of the risk of naked wizards nuking you twice and taking your 2k pp robe.  That slows us down leveling considerably because everyone takes a lot more damage wearing leather and banded at level 30 and casters have a lot less mana pool because they cant wear more than 3 pieces of equipment safely and have enough time to throw it in bags if a naked caster decides to kill them.  WE LEVEL SLOWER THAN THOSE ON BLUE SERVERS.  GIVE US A LOWER DEATH EXP PENALTY SO WE ARE EQUAL AGAIN.  You've already nerfed SK's on PvP by making their Harm Touch not regen on death, so give us a little something in return.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok... I've heard a lot about x-teaming and thoughts of making it so that the light teams can not cast on each other (buffs and heals).  Well here is the problem for the short and elf teams... they level in the same general area.  Steamfont and Butcher Block are very near GF with one of then easiest outdoor dungeons nearby (crushbone)  That puts the elven team right between the gnomes and the dwarves.  That makes for much more conflict (for hunting grounds) then what the dark races have to worry about.  Who do the iksars, Trolls, and Ogres have to worry about while their newbies level hrmmm?  Think of the zones that they have access to throughout there initail 20 levels?  No fighting over resources.  Now granted that the DE's have Freeport to worry about and the Barbs have no one near there newbie zones to worry about.  When most people join the Tallon Zek server they decide do i want to play an evil or a good race.  Evil characters are more united, the good races are splintered.  Hence that is why the Darks where so overly powerful in the beginning.  Some of us like the thought of good vrs evil... and for those that start race specific pk guilds like HR... good for them for it adds spice to the game.  <P>There are things that need to be fixed and most ideas have been posted already.  But keep in mind that on Tallon Zek it is generally seen as a light vrs dark server.  I find this adds spice to the game.  But remember that the short and the elven teams are at each others doorstep and if certain things are changed so that the shorts and the elves can not interact then there will be a bloody newbie war over resources.  While this is happening the Dark team will go very strong and will truly rule the server.  And as for me... I'll start a dark character when that happens...<P>Zelbee Silver Tongue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The largest concern of the team servers is obviously who groups with who, and the best solution seems to be pretty simple, there are 3 servers for pvp, and there are 3 diferent groups of people who play, 4 teams, gve, and "guildwar" or FFA pvp. Hardcode each server diferently, allow for no benefecial conflict outside of your team on the two team type server, and offer a movelog to whichever of the other two pvp servers people want to be on. I dont think allowing for a movelog to a blue server is fair, people came to this server for pvp, if they choose to leave pvp, they can start over like anyone else that chooses to leave a server. Verant has heavily neglected pvp since day one, and because of this many people have had to adapt the way they play, which is what makes move logs to other pvp servers under diferent rule sets seem fair, but the bottom line is pvp. <P>Im sure theres something else I wanted to say, but smackdown is starting, and smackdown &gt; eq..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
