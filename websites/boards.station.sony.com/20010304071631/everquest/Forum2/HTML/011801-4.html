</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why are dozens of high level bards quitting over this issue?<P>&gt;&gt;Dozens of high-level players quit over every &gt;&gt;issue imaginable. Often I think that in cases  &gt;&gt;like this, the player is burnt out and is &gt;&gt;looking for a reason to bail out or start a new &gt;&gt;class.<P>I wasn't going to post here until I saw this. I don't play a bard (and after seeing what I have seen, I never will) but I know a lot of people that DO (low / mid and HIGH level) and I think this blanket response is insulting at best, arrogant and short-sighted at worst.<P>To assume that high level players are quitting because they are "burnt out" or "looking for an excuse to bail out" is ****y, and shows little regard for the people that are playing this game.<P>Several people have posted here that they "used to love their bards" or that they still DO - but are incredibly frustrated by the deception that has been handed to them.<P>I know Xaria Mawr WELL and I have never seen a person play any class with as much joy as she plays her bard. She role plays her, sings songs for us and works her BUTT off to try and help those of lower level.  She is trying to ROLEPLAY the benevolent bard.<P>Well guess what? She can't do that anymore because even as a level 50+ bard, she can't mez a group of level 10 or so monsters.  Wow, Verant. NICE reward for all that time played!<P>To make a blanket statement that players are burnt out and looking for an excuse to bail simply shows that someone there has blinders on and has to find a reason in the madness rather than considering that the reason they are quitting is because they are upset at Verant.<P>To do this would force them to maybe reconsider if perhaps the customers might be right (whoa, what a concept) and they might have to revisit the issue.<P>I have posted rarely on this board, but when I have, my messages have been short, considerate questions about possible additions to the game. <P>This issue has upset me enough to post here. Mr. Wrinn, Everquest IS the best game of its kind to come out, but the Customer Service is incredibly short sighted.<P>I work Technical Support for a software company. Our programmers are very defensive when we show them something that is broken in the software. Sometimes we ALSO get the standard "its working as intended" speil...but guess what? It's not. When we can sit and demonstrate to them how it is NOT working and that it IS a bug, sometimes they still say "Well, its not supposed to do that."<P>From what I've seen, its common among programmers to be defensive about their code because they think that when someone brings up a bug, its a personal attack.<P>Please, Gordon, look at this again. As a player who plays tank classes most of the time, I cannot imagine the frustration these bards must have. As it is, The only songs I ever see a bard play are: Mana Song, Selos, Regen, and Strength. At level 45+ I would THINK that their usefulness would go beyond this.<P>Just a note from a concerned customer,<P><BR>Finlaen<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I gave up on this song the level after I got it, because it had been so nerfed from when I used it during beta, where it was actually USEFUL. You know - I would mez mobs if we got more than a few, but *gasp* I would still end up taking damage by those that resisted and end up needing heals. At least the damn thing worked. I was by no means a reliable replacement for enchanters, but it did the job, even if a bit messy.<P>After they nerfed chains I nearly gave up on EQ. I have absolutely zero respect for Abashi and the nerfing team. I tried to originally, but decided it was ultimately a waste of time. I mean there's this issue, there's rangers (I feel your pain), there's the necros (shrug, what's another nerf), there's kunark's absurd loot tables (I know Eschaton is proud to sport that piece of junk robe off Silverwing in VP, me personally? I'll go get an FBR for a few plat in freeport), Palad- ..er (LOL, what am I thinking, this class gets tweaked on a whim)...these issues and more, get shoved aside. Especially that VP one, that's a kicker. All these people quit, quitting, or will be quitting because of issues that could be fixed if Verant would get off their collective behinds to do something about it, and satisfy their customer base regarding things that actually WOULD NOT unbalance this god-forsaken game. Oh but they're trying to improve customer service, too. It's ok, John Q. Public, we'll get our man (or woman, sorry) on the Lullaby issue!...of course, she doesn't know jack about squat about bards, but what the hell?<P><BR>QUOTE:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why can't you mez level 1 snakes in Freeport?<P>"A player called me on the phone today shortly before I left work. We chatted for a while about various bard-related issues and this is one of them that came up. While he was on the phone I figured I'd check it out. I was unable to reproduce the claim that lullaby works better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60. In fact, I noticed a substantial decrease in primary resists, though secondaries remained constant, as they should."<P><BR>Abashi claims to have tested chains on level 1 mobs. GREAT. That's SO conclusive! Now try it in REAL PRACTICE. Make a level 25 bard and join a party sans enchanter, oh and bring a stopwatch with you. Any time you are engaged with more than 1 or 2 mobs fire up that Lullaby, then time how long it take for your weak, bardling ass to get gacked. How much healing mana do you think will be pumped into you by your cleric as you scramble to lullaby those extra mobs? I bet more than will ever be used on your tank. The song is a death sentence in those situations more often than not. Oh wait - I forgot, you tested it on moss snakes! The song works fine...all is well.<P>Verant is afraid of overpowering a very underpowered class (I should know, I've slogged through 55 levels) by making this song actually worth using EVER. They are afraid of having a FUBAR repeat of the type that happened when they first introduced Bewitching Bravura, i.e., something on the order of charming Cazic Thule and letting him Death Touch his minions for a laugh. Someone, I don't know who exactly, but SOMEONE over there at the VI had a lightbulb go on over their head, and added a manageable mana drain to the song while reducing the song's power to realistic levels. Bravo! Instead of completely breaking the song, they made it worth using, without being overpowered. Who came up with this? I want to talk to THAT guy! Doesn't this sound like at least a VIABLE alternative to leaving Lullaby BROKEN and completely USELESS in general practice?<P><BR>QUOTE:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Make bard Mez as good as necro at least.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;25-30 percent resist rates by design are not acceptable<P>"There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so."<P>So ADD MANA DRAIN. Do SOMETHING to make it useful. You know, up til 50 we get ONE, count them, ONE song per level. We can't really afford to have what effectively is a "Sense Animal" or similarly useless spell for us bards in our spellbook.<P><BR>QUOTE:<BR>"They aren't completely useless, just reduced in usefulness once the targets go over level 30. That said, we're not opposed to revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly.<P>-Gordon"<P>PLEASE God no...Pixie strike and twilight suck, but are workable. If you touch them they are just another inevitable nerf. Back the hell off, man. leave well enough alone and MAYBE we'll call it even. lafff<P><BR>Byph:<BR>I enjoyed reading your post as an objective outsider that didn't just come to troll and make fun of a broken class. I do have to disagree that we are useless, however. I can do a lot more than pump casters full of mana, it can just be a REAL pain in the behind sometimes.<P>Sartori&lt;Legion&gt;<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Okay. Just a few things to say. First off I would like to say that Verant has been doing a pretty good job on this game. If they weren't we wouldn't play for the amount of time we do :). Secondly, there is obviously something wrong here. I have seen a lot of the "Oh, god! My class has been NERFED!" nonsense since I first started playing this game and IMHO it has never been this loud and this adamant that VERANT IS WRONG! I can't say that I have first hand knowledge of this song before or after the change, but from what I have seen posted and heard in-game I have to say that it is a crippling blow to the bard class. I think the most alarming fact is that Verant seems to be dismissing this off-hand as whining and moaning about imagined NERFing. Can't say I blame them, though. There is a lot of whining on these boards most of the time. PLEASE, Abashi... Verant... listen to these people. It seems to me to be a valid point....<P>Yuiri Hayabusa</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>I can remember when I was in Unrest, way back when it seemed all of the level 20+ players were there.  I can remember how well the Lullaby song worked.  It was great, god only knows how many times I died, but my party members for the most part lived.  When I played this song, it was the only thing I could play.  My normal group was only 5 people, when other people would join us for a night or so, would love my crowd control abilities.  I loved my crowd control abilities.<P>Was it powerful, yes, but no more powerful than Enc Mezzes, less so it does not last as long.  Since my bard was pretty much worthless without my normal group, and I did not want to spend hours looking for a group.  This was sub 32 mind you, and back when people were ignorant of what the bard could bring.  Anyway, I started a Necro as something I could play till my friends got on.  After the expansion, I got my bard to 51, barely half a bub in, and I just got tired of dying and not really being useful except for my mana song.  So I started concentrating more and more on my necro.  Who is now 52, now he can crowd control 10 times better than I can.  How is it, my necro with 80 charisma &lt;== plenty of charisma items, can mez better than my bard of 130 charisma.  It makes no sense. <P>The music that soothes the savage beast, no it is more like the music that enrages the savage beast.  That is what it is.  I suggest all bards to start necros, get some JM boots, and then the only thing you will miss will be Tracking.<P>And nerfing the 23 song was ridiculus as well.  The mob had to be at half life before he would stop while trying to flee.  And that song was resisted a good bit, and you have to twist it with fear to make it more effective.  At one time, I thought that bards were the coolest class, so many different things we can do, but now we are mana batteries that swing a sword if need be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Another "works as intended" for the bards.<P>I thought about buying the next expansion, but after this latest posting, why should I bother?  Something better will eventually be available.  I highly doubt another company can be so tunnel visioned by some 'vision'.<P>Ironic enough, another blue named individual, who for all we as players know is one and the same person on the other end of the computer, will announce that even with all the bards, paladins,  rangers, wizards, whatever class got nerfed lately leaving the game, the overall player base will continue to rise in numbers.  What is the latest thrown number, 280k?<P>My online friend takes pity upon me and will offer gifts to help me through the game.  He has sworn off reading these boards since that drives him to not play for a while, plus he loves his character too much.  I occasionally clue him in about the latest changes and whatnot and the directions the game is going.  He asked when am I going to give up playing the bard and get a real character.  I answer when he retires his ranger.<P>Of course, us bards complaining is pointless, since Abashi already stated that balance issues and all are subjective to Verant's ideas, not the paying customers.  We have but one course.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Axlrose - ...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I remember Geoff saying we should be getting messages on resists that we weren't but he was on the in-house client.  Is it possible that the messages got patched to the retail client, but not the resist fixes?  I guarantee if you play a retail client bard you are not getting the good results that you seem to be getting on yours.  The inhouse client has caused many disagreements before this...<P><BR>Also, I'd like have a moment of silence for the 30+ bards that hung up their strings yesterday.

</FONT><HR>From a paladin:<P>Bard mez is hardly ever used as it stands. It is not a powerful ability, since it's only used on one mob at a time, AND they cannot do anything else. Same with their snare line.<P>If you say that these abilities are unbalanced, Verant is wrong.  Snare, the level 1 druid spell, works MUCH better than a bard song, and the druid can do other things afterwards.<P>Mez.. considering the mobs get a check every 9 seconds, at least, it's not overly useful if it's gonnna break every 3 seconds and the bard is toast.<P>Especially in high level dungeons, crowd control is critical. At the moment, only enchanters do it well, with necros being so so replacements.  Bards cannot do it well, even with a high charisma.<P>Either charm/mez is fine, mez is probably the wiser choice for bard control, since charm is sorta like a mez with attitude.<P>Please look into this.. a level 50 bard should have a 99% success rate for a level 1 critter, not a 70% rate. Think of it as a nuke from a level 50 wizard.. how often do THOSE get resisted?  Not very often, and rightfully so.  And that bard's song gets a check a lot more often than a wizard nuke.<P>Considering bards are supposedly the ones that are able to do anything in a small way.. let them snare/charm/mez .. they can only do one at a time, while a necromancer (vs undead) can do all 3 at a time and dot on top of it.<P>Thank you for listening.<BR>Wyrd</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is an answer???<P><BR>Ester's comment was NOT the answer to the question posed by the players.   Im sure many people would have no problem agreeing that lull should not work "well" vs. over 30 mobs.<P>WE NEVER ASKED FOR IT TO!<P>We asked for it to work....period.  Against anything!  With TWO, count em TWO resists, this song cannot do crowd control...im not saying reliably, or well, im saying AT ALL.<P><BR>This is utterly ridiculous that we cant have a song that used to be functional back to being the way it was.   Id love to see evidence of how it was EVER unbalanced.  <P>This answer is unacceptable, it completely skirts the issue that has been going around for months:   That we cannot mez anything at any level with this song without a double resist so high that you can almost never get through a battle without dying because the mobs (of ANY level)  resist so much on every tick of the song.  <P>I cant wait to see what our next song nerf is to add to the growing list.    I never knew us bards were so powerful that we needed all these nerfs.

</FONT><HR>"There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so."<P>Abashi - This over-concern with "manaless" casting is the critical play balance blunder that you all repeatedly make with Bards.  The limiting factor here is not the manaless nature of the song, it is the fact that a Bard can have no more than three effects active at a time.  Consider:<P>Enchanter:  AE mezzes four MOBs.  During the time that the spell effect holds, the Enchanter meds.  By the time he needs to stand up and recast, he has MORE mana than he STARTED WITH.  Which means that he can not only keep four MOBs mezzed indefinitely, he can do OTHER STUFF AS WELL.<P>Bard:  AE mezzes four MOBs.  Oops.  He CAN'T.  OK, he single-target mezzes four MOBs.  Oops, he CAN'T.  He can only have THREE spell effects active.  OK, He single-target mezzes THREE MOBs.  Already worse than the Enchanter, even if the resist rate is ZERO!  He mezzes fewer MOBs, AND he can't do anything else.  But the resist rate isn't zero.  It's 50-80% on blue MOBs at higher Bard levels.  So the Bard can only single-target mez 1-2 MOBs!  At best.  Even though it costs NO mana.  <P>WE CAN ONLY SING THREE SONGS AT ONCE!!!<P>May I repeat?<P>WE CAN ONLY SING THREE SONGS AT ONCE!!!<P>The fact that Bard casting is manaless does not mean that it is free.  Free casting would allow a Bard to have infinite effects active at all times.  We're limited by the fact that our songs all take 3 seconds to cast and last, on average, for 9 seconds.  That's a BIG LIMITATION.<P>I can think of four classes right off the top of my head that can have SIX persistent effects active at one time, PLUS can cast non-persistent spell effects on top of them:  Clerics, Shamans, Necros, Enchanters.  One of which is a hybrid.<P>WE CAN ONLY HAVE THREE.  Are you getting the point?  To say that ours must by definition be worse simply because ours doesn't require mana is just really bad analysis.  MANA ISN'T THE CONTROLLING FACTOR.<P>In addition, just like every other casting class in the game, we can only have EIGHT SONGS memmed at one time.  The fact that we have a lot of utility doesn't preclude the fact that only EIGHT of the songs are available for use.  If we are 75% caster at the higher levels, those songs should be 75% as powerful as the parent level songs, just on this basis alone.  When you add the fact that we can only have THREE EFFECTS ACTIVE, and that comparable-level casting classes can have TWICE THAT PLUS do other things, our songs should be STRONGER than the base spell in many instances.<P>I don't expect to change your mind.  It's too bad you're wrong.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kenross got it exactly right.<P>I'm preparing a longer, quantified comparison of Enchanter abilities vs bard songs, to show how they balance at various resist rates.  Here are a couple of tidbits:<P>1. A level 34 enchanter can keep 1 or 2 mobs mesmerized forever, and gain mana in the process, even with resist rates as high as 25%<BR>2. A level 34 enchanter can keep 4 mobs mesmerized for up to 6 minutes before running out of mana, even with resist rates as high as 25%.<P>That's the baseline for comparison.<P>Now, suppose Pixie Strike were UNRESISTABLE.  Could a bard keep one mob mezzed better than an enchanter?  No.  At best; he'd be just as good (since the enchanter is perfect).  In reality, because the mez effect from Pixie Strike can break early, the mob would still get to attack at whatever its saving throw rate is -- 10% of the time?  5%?<P>Increase the resist rate to 20%, and now the mob is attacking 15% to 20% of the time, not including extra attacks from song fizzles, bashed bards, etc.  So, with no secondary resists and no mana used, the song is STILL significantly weaker than the spell for a given resist rate.<P>What about 2 mobs?  Here, the bard's effectiveness is more than cut in half, but the enchanter is still perfect.  No attacks for the enchanter, 2 mobs each attacking 20%-25% of the time for the bard.  No contest -- and yet Verant claims that this is overpowered for the bard, but not for the enchanter?  (Don't believe my math?  I'll post the details later.  Oh, and please note -- a bard using pixie strike CANNOT MELEE, because of the way targeting works.)<P>What about 4 mobs?  Enchanter gets hit a few times up front, then is perfect for about 5 minutes, by which time they're all dead or the party has decided to bug out safely.  The bard has 2 choices -- Pixie Strike 2 and let the other 2 beat on him (i.e. suicide), or Lullaby.<P>At a 20% resist rate, Lullaby will result in 4 attacks every 5 rounds on average.  Add in bashes and interrupts, and it's more like one attack per round -- equivalent to only mezzing 3 of the 4 mobs.  Since no bard can take a beating for as long as 5 minutes from a blue mob, this is clearly significantly less powerful than the enchanter version, even at the same resist rate.<P>Conclusion: the claim, that a no-mana song would be "obviously" overpowered at the same resist rate as enchanter spells, is fatuous.  If you actually do the math, you find that bards would be significantly less effective at crowd control even if (1) pixie strike were unresistable, and (2) Lullaby had the same resist rate as Entrance.<P>Care to refute this, Gordon?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, I have a related issue to the bard songs being "broken".<P>I am not worried whether or not the songs work as originally intended, instead I would like to put forth a proposal for improving the bard mezz songs for a completely different reason.<P>Please note that I am not a bard.  Frankly, I'm tone deaf. -)<P>In a different post I listed all the different jobs to be done in a group that I could come up with.  In the pre-50 game (I am not yet 50th level) I was able to find two classes that can do every one of those jobs effectively, except three.  One of those three jobs (revive) is not actually essential in a dungon pre-50, though it saves much down time.  I suggested giving Paladin's Revive somwhere around 39 rather than 49.  the second one (healing)can be done well by more than one class except from between 25-29 and from 40-50+.  As such I suggested giving Shamans and Druids Superior Heal at 39.  These are minor, however, in comparison to crowd control.<P>Only Enchanters are effective at crowd control for the majority of the game.  I do not want to take anything away from the Enchanter class but it is my belief that at least two classes should be able to handle each job needed in an effective Dungeon party.  There should be no one class necessary in a dungeon.  However Enchanters are considered necessary in a Dungeon (especially in Kunark where the mobs are so tight together).<P>My questions to you are as follows...<P>1.  Do you think that each task necessary for a group should have two classes minimum capable of filling it?<P>2.  If not then why not?  I should state here that I do not believe the argument of class purity as many different classes have similar if not identical abilities.  What makes them unique is that no two classes have ALL identical abilities.<P>3.  If yes then what, if anything, is being planned to do to solve the three issues I mentioned above, especially the one with Crowd Control.<P>I await an answer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>On another topic altogether (since this seems to be the only place we're allowed to say anything):<P>I really resent the way this problem was handled.  Last YEAR you introduced a nerf to this song that caused it to drop in utility from one of the top three songs to being tied for the bottom.  Not only did you not explain why you did so, you didn't even tell us that you did so at all.<P>After four months of complaints from Bards, and four months of silence from Verant, GZ tested and determined that the secondary resist message was broken.  At the time, he gave us some numbers about the expected effectiveness.  We KNEW AT THE TIME that those numbers did not match the numbers we were seeing.  We were told that it would be looked into.<P>Two months of silence later, we were told to wait until after Kunark.<P>Two months until Kunark, then two more months of silence later, we were told that perhaps there was a problem and the you would look into it.<P>Two months later, you test this for half a day and blow us off.<P>It isn't so much that you left the song the way it was.  I've been playing this Bard for a year without it, after all.  It's the fact that it took a YEAR for you to bother to respond to this at all.<P>I pay $10 a month like any Necro, Druid or Warrior in the game.  If my class is supposed to be balanced, I expect you to put roughly as much time and attention into it as you do into any other class.  To do otherwise is to cheat all of your customers who choose to play the less popular classes.  Don't offer a class if you have no intention of properly supporting it.<P>I think Bards deserve a profound apology.<P>Even more annoying, I am utterly unconvinced that this song really works the way you intended it to.  Yes, it stinks for high level Bards, as you had wanted, and who cares that a level 50 can't mez moss snakes?  So leaving Lullaby the way it is makes no difference given your decision.  But the SAME secondary resist check that was added to Lullaby was ALSO added to Pixie Strike at the same time, and appears to be part of the Song of Twilight Code.  So blowing off Lullaby just because it's close enough doesn't fix the problem.  The secondary resist rate is ridiculously high, it appears to get worse as the Bard levels up, and Charisma doesn't affect it as we have every reason to expect it should.<P>I will never believe that you guys didn't just completely screw this up until I see:<P>1.  Your testing methodology<BR>2.  Your test results<BR>3.  A description of precisely how the song is supposed to function, which modifiers it expects, and just what those modifiers are supposed to do.<P>Which means, I presume, that I will never believe that you guys didn't just completely screw this up.<P>Song of Twilight (level 53) resists more than half the time against blue MOBs.  A level 53 spell with an average 9 second duration fails half the time right out of the box.  I refuse to believe that you intended for that to be the case.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>one last thing I forgot.  My reason for posting here is obviously that I believe the Bard is best suited to be the second crowd control class.  Their method is different from an Enchanter's thereby keeping class uniqueness, they are designed as a support class and crowd control is MUCH more useful in a group than it is solo.  Finally, I just like the mental image of "music hath charms to soothe the savage breaste" being used in EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>I understand the complexities Verant faces in view of the Bard song being manaless. <P>For example, consider a 3 mob encounter where the bard has a 1/3 success rate. Then on the first cast, the bard can expect to have 2 mezzed with one remaining. So cast again (through the beating) and you have a good chance of mezzing the third while simultaneously having a good chance of refreshing the mezzes of the first two. Now the bard can sing and sing the mez song, remezzing the creatures with no end in sight. There may be resists and thus no refresh, but youll likely get it refreshed before the maximum duration rolls around. Of course, there will be the occasional break due to a random break, not reaching maximum duration. So, with the approximate resist rate of an enchanter, a bard would be able to keep 3 mobs fairly well contained. Not like an enchanter would have any problems in that department either.<P>What I would like to hear from Verant is what they consider to be reasonable success rates for various levels of the factors: CHA, bard level, and mob level. Verant can do primary and secondary resist rates in code, resulting in an "overall" resist rate, but for discussion sake, just refer to the "overall" resist. <P>As far as being compared to an enchanter, bards should be less effective at crowd control, but should still be effective nonetheless.<P>Thus, a bard perhaps should have a higher overall resist rate, but the way things are now, the bardic mez is less than functional, given that the overall resist rate is hideously high.<P>We bards want to be able to crowd control effectively. Clearly, this is an ability Verant envisioned for us, but I think in an attempt to keep it from being overpowered, they watered it down to the point of worthlessness.<P>Verant, if you can give us some indication of what kind of crowd control we bards should possess (right now it is about zero), perhaps we can determine an acceptable overall resist rate for both the bardic community and Verant.<P>There are also other ways to limit the power of our mez also. How about making the bardic mez only mez the nearest x creatures. This limits the ability to x mobs, but would have similar (or at least moderate) overall resist rates to enchanters. Thus, we could effectively manage small crowds, not large.<P>It is my opinion that this line of songs needs to be fixed. You wouldnt know it from my calm discussion preceding, but I am actually quite miffed. I am happy that Verant is at least responding, but there is no way these songs are working as intended, unless the intent was a dysfunctional song - or a taunt song....we have enough of those though. From what I have heard so far, there has not even been official acknowledgement of dysfunctionality. This is what is creating almost uncontrollable impulses to slam my foot through the computer monitor screen. I imagine this is the case for many other bards. Perhaps there is no solution to please both parties, but for the sake of all the is melodious, please admit this is a problem. A level 50+ bard not being able to mez a single creature in a group of five level one mobs is not acceptable.<P>Please keep the lines of communication open Verant. It is the only thing keeping me sane right now.<P>Tunella,<BR>Bristlebane <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR> Do you know how many high level bards are left on Veeshan? We had about oh, 10ish lvl 50s who played a lot when Kunark came out. I can think of 2-3 now, with 1 not playing a lot. Bards are great at low levels, we rock 1-10. 10-30 is great. 30-40 we're ok. 4-50 we hold in there. 50-60, we are sup-par.<BR> Listen. Look at the songs you give bards. They're all great at doing things in a group that is not well-balanced. Not well-balanced groups are fine at the early levels. But you can not survive 50-60 without a good group. <BR> Look at the songs.<BR>  We have a couple areas. <BR>   We have healing:<BR>        Bardic healing was great at early levels when you could make it through a fight without healing magic. It could cut downtime. WHen you hit lvl 40ish.. you can't anymore. You need someone healing just to stay alinve fighting 1 mob. 50-60 is even worse. You NEED a good healer, and you probably NEED a cleric to keep going at a decent rate. Clerics have CH. Bardic healing gets reduced to something used when you have to zone and everyone is OOM. Ok, I'm in FoH. I use that about once a month. Whoop-de-doo.<BR> Another Area of "Strength". Speed songs.<BR>  This is where bards truly have something good to add to a group. However, speed up has been nerfed so damn hard since beta... Listen. There are 3 classes that can speed. Bards, Enchanters, Shaman. An Enchanter with Clarity II can keep an entire group buffed with their best speed, w/o any downtime. Now, remember, you need a balanced group, so at most we're talking 3.. possibly 4 melee types. Most probably max 3, since you need a healer, enchanter, gater. So, umm.. that whole thing with bard songs not using mana is not relevant here, since an enchanter can also keep speed spells up _indefinatly_ on an _entire group_. The only difference is the enchanter speed spells are better, last longer, and the enchanter can do something else while they are up. Now, at level 50 it was different. Enchanters have 2 speed spells, the line which is just speed, and the line which is a slower speed and buffs. At 50, an enchanter and a bard could work together. The bard playing pure speed, the enchanter using the buff line. At 60, the SLOW enchanter spell is better than the FASTEST bard speed. ie. In a group with an enchanter, one of the 2 best songs a bard has is useless. Oh, and the duration of the bard song? about 18 seconds. The duration of the enchanter spell 45 minutes.<BR>Time taken for the enchanter to regen the mana for the spell? oh, maybe half a minute. At most.<P> Now, Shaman are another story. Shaman can run out of mana easily. Still, a shaman can keep an entire group speed up, in fact with a better speed than the best bard song, and still slow and buff if played correctly. Still, this is difficult.<P>And thirdly, the general availabilty of speed items lowers the relative utility of a bard speed song.. well any speed spell effect. However, since this is one of a bards two best abilities, and we get no compensation for this, it is yet another reason why high-level bards are relativly less powerful. A warrior with a RBB or COF is effectivly a warrior constanly playing the lvl 49 bard speed song. However, I know of no item which allows a bard to attack as well as a warrior!<P>Another Strength, Bard Maledictions and Damage.<BR> Have you guys seriously tried to do any maledictions to enemies as a high level bard. Chains, slows, dots, resistance debuffers are all resisted.. A LOT. Again, bards get hit. A resist message for a caster of %50 means that he casts his spell twice, and it sticks, and he goes onto the next spell. Total loss, is 2x the mana cost and the casting time of the spell. Bards are completly different. a resist rate of %50 means we loose almost HALF of our song power. A good bard can twist 3 songs. If they all stick 3 stay up. If one of those songs if resisted half the time, the bard drops to 2 songs.. maybe. Remember, an average resist rate of %50 means that you're going to get a lot of double resists, meaning the bard drops to 1 song. Some of these songs are things you really don't want to drop, like say.. MEZ. So, while theoretically, a bard can speed up the entire group, play mana song, and mezz something. In reality, the bard has to choose.<BR> Now you can say, well, that just encourages the bard to group with classes that reduces resistances. However, the same classes which make a bards songs work better, also make the bard redundant in a group. An enchanter with clarity II can tashani something.. but then, if the enchanter is in the group, why doesn't he just use a slowdown spell which is better than the bard slowdown? lasts longer? Or a mezz, or well.. DoTs suck for both bards and enchanters, but at least the enchater dots aren't AE. The shaman in the group is the same, he can just use the best slowdown in the game. Every single malediction we have is duplicated but better in the classes that we need to make those maledictions actually work consistently.. shaman and enchanter.<P>Mez<BR> I'll put this simply. Again, mez resist rates are incredible using over 200+ charisma and the best instruments available. To get them to stick well, you need at least a shaman, prefereably an enchanter.<BR> If you are solo, and do nothing but stand there and sing the song over and over again, doing nothing but, you will be lucky.. very lucky to hold 1 mob. Most of the time it will beat on you, your cleric, or someone for half of the time.<BR> If you are with an enchanter or a shaman. Why are you mezzing? SHaman slowdown will take care of %80 of the damage, Enchanters will be able to land a real mezz. However, if, for some reason you want to try, you'll find that you can usually hold 1 mob, after it's been tashanied/malosi and you do nothing but mezz the 1 mob!<BR> Come on! Can you really say that this iswhat you want? Are you saying that loosing everything a bard has to give a group is worth holding one mob! No other class comes as close to that at being useless.<P>Buffs<BR> HAHAHA! Ok, Brad's said it, Abashi has said it. We know it. Ability stats are relativly useless. Bards have a bunch of buff songs. Let's all admit they are pretty useless. I mean, a shaman can buff someone up with spare mana. That's not a waste. A bard has to devote 1/3 of his total power/group utility towards keeping buffs up. Let's either make these songs useful, or get rid of them. I mean, who really uses chant of battle? How about that 50+ ac song? Increases ac by 24.. when most people tanking have 1000+ ac? Come on! This is 1/3 of my total power we're talking here, and you're giving me 24 ac?<P>Damage songs<BR> Damage songs have all of the problems of the maledictions, added to the problems of getting decent instruments. In my opinion, you should think of damage songs like you think of weapons. They do x damage, they have a delay, and they have no mana. Yet, our songs are less powerful than most pre-kunark weapons. Is anyone else seeing a problem here. Take a warrior for example. He does x amount of damage over time. Now look at the bard. He's holding an instrument. He's doing nothing but playing damage songs using the best instrument available. He's also doing less than 1/3 the damage the warrior is doing. At 60. This is wrong. Why would I ever want to do this? This could be a great opportunity to gie bards. Give us a lot of different instruments which we can find like weapons. Put all the damage songs on this instrument type.<P>Resistance songs:<BR> Now these are one place where we really shine. However, again, they are mostly useful for people who don't know what they are doing. In FoH, everytime we do something new there is about a 2 week shout for bards. After that, we figure it out, and bards go back to being not needed. In fact, most of the time the bards don't show up for that 2 week shout because we're all playing other classes or have quit. So, you can't even say we were useful then, because most of the time Kal figures it out without our help.<P><BR>So, GZ, what are we supposed to be. At low levels we could get away with being half-warriors. We still did decent damage. By level 60 it's clear that we do not do anywhere NEAR comparable melee damage. Like, maybe down to 1/4 of what a warrior will do. Every other spell class has outclasses us in what their spells do, exponentially, while out songs limp along getting better linearly, if at all.. and quite a few just don't work anymore. A level 60 bard? Let me tell you what my opinion is... why?<P> We may be useful to a group without a clue. Unbalanced, missing several key classes. But, let's face it. 50-60 in Kunark, doing the stuff that's hard. You need well-balanced. And as it stands, well-balanced does not inclued a bard. Everything we do is replaced but better, much better. And we are reduced to pumping mana, except that with clarity II, even that is not really a good use of a group slot. Sure, dump me in a group with 5 melee and I'll make it a lot better. Dump me in a group with 5 wizards and I'll make it a lot better. But let's face it, those groups weren't going anywhere. All good groups start with a tank and a cleric. GZ has said that you NEED an enchanter to get to certain places, so let's start with a core group of warrior-cleric-enchanter. Tell me, in that group, exactly what do I have to contribute?<P>Creediki Starsong<BR>Former Bard of Veeshan<BR>Chronicler of the Fires of Heaven<P><BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to play a Bard because he was unique and kind of a jack of all trades. But lets face it, our resists are so high and our important songs are so bugged that we are very limited in our ability to do anything useful.<P>I participated in a guild RAID on Temple of Droga last night and guess what my role was? All I was needed for was mana regen. Thats it. I didn't even have to melee, just stand back by the cleric and the shammy and regen their mana. Even on the "bad" rooms with 3 or more gobbies it was *more effective* to keep the Cleric FM while he healed the guys getting slaughtered. I did whip out Mez once and guess what? 3 resists on a blue before it stuck for 3 seconds. Whooppeee freakin do. By the time I got the thing mezzed (Charisma buffed, using a horn for "added benefit") my group had hacked there way through the other 2.<P>Abashi, maybe the fact that the song being broken (which it is broken regardless of your lame "on the phone" test) isn't the problem. Maybe it is your "Vision" that is broke.<P>If your so sure that this song isn't broken (even below lvl 30), then why don't you give us some numbers. Tell us what resist rate a lvl 1 mob should have against a lvl 30 Bard (if you say 50% resist by a lvl 1 I think your on drugs), and then POST the log showing the actual data...including attacks!! I know I get the message "a lvl 1 snakes head nods" but I am still getting hit by that snake.<P>Please fix something Verant. You have managed to nerf the Bard all to hell, now do something to improve the game will you. Or else, the next MMORPG that comes out will be the game alot of people leave EQ for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Why do we care what Verant does to the Bard class, or EQ as a game for that matter?<P>I have been pondering this issue. I too was a fervent poster to the official Everquest Boards in support of our class. But you know what? It does little to no good at all. Verant has made it quite clear to me that they will only entertain positive ideas and suggestions for improvements and will dismiss any claims that something is not working right as being "...simply another case of class envy."<P>I play Diablo II. I am given a class with a set of abilities. I receive patches were Blizzard changes various items and abilities of things in the game. I continue to play or I stop playing. I have no problem with that. So what makes Everquest different? Perhaps the time involved in creation of the character. Perhaps the attachment that we have to our characters. Perhaps we just like to argue with Verant. I don't know. <P>So what woke me up? A very interesting quote from Gordon Wrinn:<P>"At some point we are going to have to stop making balance adjustments to classes and focus solely on content development."<P>Followed by:<P>"That point has already been reached. Most of the complaints these days are along the lines of direct class-envy, where one class perceives that they are lesser to another. The problem is that that other class is perfectly happy with that perception. Fixing the first classes issue upsets the second class."<P>So I have retired. No, not from Everquest.....ohh no, I am enjoying this game far too much to quit at the moment. No, I have retired from caring at all what Verant does to any class/spell/item/zone ad nauseam. I will simply play the game as given to me and either enjoy it......or quit. You will never see Kulanae post on the Everquest Board again in support of anything other than new features and ideas that will hopefully make this a better game, or provide ideas for EQ2.<P>So to all of my friends out there still trying to "fight the good fight." I'm sorry to say but you are simply wasting your time. <P>Kulanae Soulsease<BR>49th Bardess of Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

We've listed as broken and have been attempting all this time to get it fixed.<BR>Now that they've looked at it, it's decided that it works as intended because we have NON AoE mez songs which are supposed to be upgrades to the AoE mez song.<P>However, one thing they've yet to explain is, how any spell/song is supposed to GET WORSE when used on mobs of or below the intended level range for that spell/song.<P>I find it all rather asinine myself.<P>-----<P>From: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011785.html<P>Well, you certainly are killing off the diversity you described your "Vision" calling for.<BR>By continuing to allow the bard class to become weaker and weaker through nerfs (intended or otherwise) apparent long outstanding bugs, and a lack of response to direct questions you will have a considerable less number of bards in the game.<P>Sure, there will be those twinks and those PL'd, but once the people playing those characters get frustrated enough at the inadequacies built into the class, dismayed at an experience penalty for a non-melee/non-casting class, they'll quit.<P>Already many of us have since moved on to druids or necros, or other classes, or even more extreme moved away from the EQ world altogether.<P>Ah well...<P>There will be more druids and necros, perhaps the "Vision" can be modified to accomodate the lack of diversity.<P>By the way, here's a few questions that were NEVER answered in ANY of the previous bard posts:<P>Is there at least ONE person at Verant who has played a bard character from level 1 to level 50 using the STANDARD EQ client?<P>If there is ONE person does Verant actually use that person's input, or, as it seems to many of us bards, does Verant just go on assumptions based on what they THINK the effects and results will/should be?<P>When testing fixes and nerfs to the bard class do you test with the STANDARD EQ client before releasing to the live servers?<P>Considering the EXTREME short duration of songs, EXTREME resistances, EXTREME lack of melee, EXTREME lack of power of songs, and EXTREME lack of HP, how is a hybrid penalty justified?<P>Anyway, Jochomo Graven will probably VERY RARELY darken Rallos Zek's server again (not that I've been playing him much since the chains nerf).<P>Thanks Verant!<P>Woohoo!

</FONT><HR>Sartori_ posted:<P>"Byph:<BR>I enjoyed reading your post as an objective outsider that didn't just come to troll and make fun of a broken class. I do have to disagree that we are useless, however. I can do a lot more than pump casters full of mana, it can just be a REAL pain in the behind sometimes."<P>Sorry if you got that impression.  I didnt mean to imply that they were useless.  Bards are still nifty, but their part enchanter aspect has been crippled for no real reason.  A bard supplemented me as an enchanter, filled in for me in a pinch but never replaced me.  That was when the song was working properly before someone threw a spanner into it.<P>I think my only real negative bard comments were I would never play a bard.  I just dont think the class is viable to play with the experience penalty.  Well, that was back when i thought you paid for the experience penalty yourself.  But bards solo alot, and they can feel the burden of their exp penalty.<P>This had to be the most ammusing part of Gordon's follup to me:<P>"&gt;&gt;&gt;What are the parent classes for Bards?<P>Bards are not really hybrids despite having the same experience table. They are a class all to their own. If I had to name something, I'd call them part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid, and part shaman."<P>There you go bards, your not hybrids after all, and 3/5 of your 'parent classes' can bind themselves.  I think bards should get 'at least' a self only bind song as compensation.  I believe in win-win situations.<P>Bards arent a god powerful class or else more than a handful of people would play them, this was pre-nerf.  If the class is blanced and you need to downgrade a particular ability then give them something worthwhile in return to keep them at that same level.  It would reduce the outcry from the players that realise they have been deceived by official statements over the months.<P>I like Gordan.  He has a difficult job and tries his best so i dont agree that people should attack him, afterall he is just the messenger that VI puts here, he cant know every class as well as players that have devoted years of play.

</FONT><HR>Sigh, I dont believe Gordon understands what his customer base thinks bards should be.  Your priority on this issue is not game ballance or customer satisfaction.  If it was you would be posting numbers and much more real answers. And now<P>1) How can a 1 tick song that is 25% effective to blues be overpowered? (not that this is how the song works right now).   you say that you cant give this type of mez to a bard becuase it does not use mana.  YOU ARE WRONG.  not in the exact words you said but the meaning behind it.  Sure you are technicaly correct about mana but if a bard is using 100% of his singing ability he is in effect using 100% of an enchanters mana to be a little less effective.<P>2) the bard target mez seiries would be less powerfull than the enchanters seriese if it had 0% resists.  Right now I can not keep 1 white mob mezed as effectivly and a chanter can keep 3 white mobs mezzed.  AGAIN I AM USING 100% OF MY SINGING TO TRY TO KEEP 1 WHITE MOB MEZZED.  That is equivelent to a 100% of the enchanters mana.<P>Here is your problem IMO, you dont understand bards.  Thier singing is there mana.  yeah yeah we have mana for charm but I think that is only confusing you gordon.  Mana for a caster = effectiveness.  1 pulse of a song = effectiveness.<P>Weather you believe if are not you are reducing the effectiveness to having a bard in your party to being a mana batery that can sing a buff song or 2 between being a mana battery. and can do 1/4 of the damage of a warrior.<P>I WANT TO DO MORE IN COMBAT THAN BE A MANA BATTARY.<P>I want to be 50 to 75% of what a chanter can be for 3 mob crowd control (CC). right now I am 10% of a chanter at 3 mob CC.<P><BR>IGNORE my whole rest of my post but answer this quesztion.<P>For a 55th level bard VS a 55th level chanter.  What is the EXACT percentage of effectiveness you think a bards should be again 2 55th level mobs vs an enchanter using targeted mez.  Effectiveness defined as the % time the mob is not swinging over a 10 minute period.<P>Here is my guess at the answer. 2 mobs over 10 minutes = 20 muntes of potential swings<P>Enchanter 2 minutes of swinging over the 20 minutes of potential mob swinging. IE 90% effective.<P>Bard has 16 minutes of swinging over the 20 minutes of potention mob swinging.  IE 20% effectiveness. (and 1 dead bard)<P>Come on do this test and give us your numbers, I bet the chanter is over 90% effecteve and the bard is less than 20% effective.<P>waright of sol ro<BR>A life without song, drones on</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

That said, we're not opposed to revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly."<P>Ok, since I am at work and don't really have time to organize my thoughts and stuff, I will tackle only the lull song situation...I don't agree with your opinion regarding Lull usefulness in the above statement. I will tell you why.<P>I would like to ask you and GZ if either of you've considered the following facts:<P>1. Lull has a 4 seconds duration<P>2. 25% chance of primary resist and 35 % resist secondary resist. My understanding is that these two are _stacked_ on top of each other. Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.<P>3. Being stunned will interrupt this song.<P>4. This song would only be used in fights with multiple mobs.<P>5. There is a 3 seconds delay from when the song is started until it's actually taking effect. It's Bards' casting time, I guess.<P>6. This song tends to aggro all the critters it affects how shall I say this? hmmm "a wee bit".  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Ok, with those facts in hand, there are some conclusions regarding what a bard must do and face during a fight using this song that I think you will agree that they are logical. <P>Bard must play this one and this one song only. Due to #6 and the fact that the rest of the group will focus on just one critter, all the other citters' attention will be on the bard. Because of #2-#6, the chance of a bard successfully mez all of the critters is pretty much anywhere from slim to none. Do you have any objection to the above conclusion?<P>Ok, let's try and do an in game example of how the song would actually work. Puller came back to camp spot with a bad pull, let's say there are 4 critters. <P>Bard is the only crowd control person in the group. Bard starts playing the Lull song, everyone focus on one target, cleric keeps eyes on bard's hp bar. _ALL_ critters, except for the one being attacked by the group will have the bard on top of the hate list. <P>With the 25%/35% primary/secondary resist on this song, I would venture to say that it's kinda a slim chance that all the critters will be mezzed, and even if they are mezzed, it's _only_ for _four_ seconds. Then the whole cycle starts again.  This is just like rolling the dice every 4 seconds with the odd stacking like 70-100% against you. I wouldn't call it fun.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now you factor in mis-notes, interruption from being bashed...<P>Factor in that those critters that resisted the mez is banging on the bard all this time...<P>Factor in that at higher level, a bard would be killed in less than 3 seconds with anything more than 2 or 3 critters beating on him...<P>At best, when the bard is at lower level, (s)he can so some limited crowd control with his/her song, at the expense of being a mana sponge. Additionally, while (s)he is doing crowd control with this song, his/her group has to do without the benefits of the bard's other songs. <P>I personally would have never play this song unless I _know_ for sure that there is a knowledgable healer healing me.<P>At worst, at high levels, bard dies the second he fires this song up in an attempt to do some crowd control.<P>Those are the reasons for my disagreement over your opinion that Lull is of "reduced usefulness" and not "useless". Please, if you see any flaw my facts and reasoning and/or method of using that song, please don't hesitate to let me know.<P>Thanks.<P>Sincerely,<P>Leftie HEH(R)(C)(TM)<P>PS: My assumsion, before I write this post is that by "reduced usefulness", you mean that it can be use even with minimal effectiveness. If you meant "reduced usefulness" to mean that above a certain level you can't use the song then please disregard my post.

</FONT><HR>You need to fix Bard crowd control.<P>In your 50+ game (wish you guys had some experience in it), crowd control is mandatory.  Root parking is nice, but doesnt really do **** to casting mobs, and lets be honest, most mobs have the melee range of a stolen chinese ICBM, so root parking in a tight spot does nothing.  Necro ST is a great spell.  However, its efficacy decresases significantly above 50, and 55+, it flat out doesnt work.<P>To put it bluntly, you NEED enchanter type crowd control to 'do' the higher level dungeons.  If you dont, you are restricted to bottom feeding zone mobs, or perhaps a few other camps if you have a good group and a good FD puller (which you guys frown on, see the irony?).<P>Enchanter type crowd control needs to be spread to another class, or classes.  Since Bards have the songs ALREADY, it would seem like they should have the song fixed (yes it is broken, despite what you might have posted) to make crowd control more readily available.<P>Fix the songs.<P>Sayleth </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Please know that not only have we done our own testing, but we have talked to GZ and the programmer in charge of such things.<P>Lullabye is working as we intended. The song was not meant to work well on mobs over level 30. The upgrade is the Pixie strike, and then again Twilight. However, even the upgrages were never meant to be as effective as the Enchanter's spells.<P>I am sorry this was not found out earlier. I will continue to look into any other songs that may be bugged.<P>If you have comments on the design of these or other songs please feel free to take them to General Discussion.<P>Ester the Tester<BR>==================================<P>I'm trying to write this as neutrally as possible, but this is one of the poorest examples of Customer Service I've ever seen. Yesterday, Abashi himself posted something to the effect that the Bardic testing was done and that bards would not like the results.<P>Well, you're right, we don't like the results. But I have to say, I'm a lot more disappointed that after all that testing all we got were two simple lines on what you found. You found that<P>a) It's working as intended.<BR>b) It's not supposed to work well against mobs over 30.<P>I expected a lot more after all that testing. I expected to see what was intended and what was discovered in testing. Not only was the statement that you released brief, but it also was incomplete. Where are the results of the testing on the related songs of Crission's Pixie Strike and Song of Twilight?<P>How could you spend so much time testing and then only spend 5 minutes on a statement that affects so many users?<P>Since I was not given what I expected to see, I'd like to ask for it here. I would like to know...<P>a) What the expected resist rates are for mobs below 30.<BR>b) What the expected resist rates are for mobs above 30.<BR>c) What the expected resist rates are for bards below 30 vs greens, blues, whites, yellows and reds.<BR>d) What the expected resist rates are for bards above 30 vs greens, blues, whites, yellows and reds.<BR>e) The level ranges of bards and mobs that you tested with, and the resist rates that you encountered.<P>The reason that so many bards are upset is not because you've deemed the song to be working as intended, but rather because we cannot believe that it is. If you tell us what is intended, you can end all of this debate. All we want is a chance to see what is intended and compare the real world results to that.<P>I would also like to add that the current implementation of the song carries with it a resist rate of 70% for bards over 30 regardless of what level the mob is. I cannot thing of a single spell that fails 70% of the time across the board. (I am reluctant to comment on resist rates below 30 because it's been a long time since I was below 30)<P>Lastly, I have one question. Is the song intended to be unused once a bard reaches 30? I have not memorized this song for use in combat in over 20 levels and I do not know any other bards my level that have. It seems that you may have erred on the side of caution in this case. You've taken a song that had uses and reduced it to a song that I wish I could remove from my song book.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt; For example, consider a 3 mob encounter where the bard has a 1/3 success rate.<BR>&gt; Then on the first cast, the bard can expect to have 2 mezzed with one remaining.<BR>&gt; So cast again (through the beating) and you have a good chance of mezzing the<BR>&gt; third while simultaneously having a good chance of refreshing the mezzes of<BR>&gt; the first two.<P>Er, no.  By the time your re-mez attempt goes through, the mez on the first mob expires and it's awake.  Before you can mez the first again, the mez on the second expires and it wakes up.  The only way to keep three mobs mezzed is if none of them resist Pixie Strike/Twilight.  With a 25% resist rate (which is around what I'd consider acceptable), there's a 42% chance of that happening.  With a 75% resist rate (which is around what it is right now), there's a 1.6% chance of that happening.<P>&gt; Now the bard can sing and sing the mez song, remezzing the creatures with<BR>&gt; no end in sight.<P>Nope, the instant one of them resists, you're back at square one.  Best MO at that point is to ignore the one that resisted (let it beat on you) while you refresh the mez on the other two before they wake up, and hope the third doesn't resist again.  Heaven forbid one of the first two should resist as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Some people may be forgetting, that unlike every other Bard song in the game, Lullabye ALSO only has a one-pulse duration.  Most Bard songs last 3 pulses, which is why we can do 3 songs at once.  Lullabye has only ONE pulse, so we can only sing that ONE song.  So in addition to the normal downsides to a Bard song, it is further limited by the fact that it only lasts one pulse (and is resisted 70% of the time of course).<P>- Zanen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Apologies, this is a repost from another of a jillion bard threads, which I made before I saw this bard thread:<P>I am a shaman. I'm actually a pretty damn good shaman, thank you. I can play primary healer at my level (49), despite people who say that you "need" a cleric at that level. But, if a cleric IS present, I am handily outshined, and that's as it should be.<P>What class holds this "inferior but useful in the hands of a skilled player" position in relation to enchanters? Necromancers have one mez spell... druids can charm animals, which is a sort of extremely limited crowd control... that's really it.<P>Bard crowd control songs USED to be balanced, from what I understand--they were often resisted, their charm can't be chain-sung, etc. In other words, the enchanter versions were far superior, as they should be, but good bards, like good shaman, could somewhat fill the role.<P>95% of the posts I make to these forums are to tell players they are wrong about a balance issue, frankly. I think post-50 rangers are a fine class, I like grouping with paladins, the mosscovered twig needed to be nerfed, and melee-binding is the dumbest idea I've ever heard. But the bard songs in question, which were definitely inferior to enchanter spells, but still useful, were reduced in usefulness after an enchanter spell change, and left broken--how does a song CHANGE mean they are working as intended?<P>Of the two bards I've played with regularly, both canceled their accounts yesterday. They are hoping things change before their accounts are deleted. I miss them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi's words:<BR>"There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so."<BR>Our charm song uses mana, and doesn't last as long as the enchanter charm, or the druid's charm animal, or the necro charm undead... And we don't get our mana back as fast as they do either. So that makes it much more expensive.<P>Desperate Dirge uses mana... and itis out performed by a manaless item that shamans can use. They get a bracer that allows them to continuously chain cast Winters Roar for 250 points ever 9 seconds or so.<P>So bards get to blow their wad of mana (and wait nearly 90 minutes to do it again) to do 335 points to a monster (Up to 4 targets including the bard casting it). Not a bad amount of damage eh? Consider the shaman with this bracer, chaincasting for 250 points over an hour and a half of combat. I would dare say that you are giving the ability of manaless spell effects to someone other than the bard.<P>Also, we have another song that doesn't use mana, and it's not a mez, but it's very limited. The song is Brusco's Bombastic Bellow. A no mana song that does 222 points, and can only be used once every 5 minutes. I think it would be better served to remove the delay on this song, or lower it so it can be used once a minute... That would be 1 time per fight approximately. I don't think that is too much to ask. At least then, maybe we won't be out performed by an item.<P>This is in no way a class envy situation. This is a means to display just how bad bards have it. Frankly, I am glad that shaman have access to such a wonderful ability, as to do damage, non stop, all while spending no mana. It's just that I thought bards were supposed to be all about doing that sort of thing.<P>I guess not.<P>Necose Blakblade<BR>54th Level Minstral of the Rathe<BR>Aka: 54th Level Mana Battery on the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Methinks you whiney bards need to start seeing the forest for the trees, and work with the many advantages you have. So you can't mez. you're NOT an enchanter! you bring a LOT more to a group then just poor-man's mez (That's the necro's role when there is no 'chanter) and mana batteries. A competent bard can do a GREAT many other things, and I always go out of my way to have a bard in group. And remember, I am a NECROMANCER, I don't need a mana battery, I don't need a healer, so WHY would I want a bard? a million reasons. Fantastic versatility, and the ability to make a group so much stronger in so many ways. you are a fantastic class, and If I couldn't stand the lack of binding anywhere, I'd play one too. you guys can do it all, and are very strong as it is. And this is coming from one of those "beloved of Verant" necros here. (which is BS, by the way. we've seen more nerfs then all other classes combined)<P>so you can't solo 2 monsters at once by mez/charming one!   that's not your role anyway! for group support, nothing beats a bard, and if you are SERIOUSLY going to whine, cry and quit over one song not working out, see ya. wouldn't want you around anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Of course it's not supposed to be as good as an enchanter's crowd control--I feel the issue is that there is no "second fiddle" (no pun intended) to the enchanter's mastery.  <P>I can heal very well when I'm "on," but a cleric blows me away.  That cleric has the best resurrections, but paladins and necromancers have a small ability in this field.  Warriors are king tanks, but other classes can fill in for them.
