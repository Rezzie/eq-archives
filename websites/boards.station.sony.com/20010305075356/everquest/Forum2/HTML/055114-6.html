</FONT><HR>Doh,<P>So many people asking for MORE damage output. Please take some tedium out of poison making, but more damage??? Where does it end? Having played rogue for quite a bit now after a wizard, enc, bard.. These are not balance issues for a rogue. Start up way more easy than casters and end up being the king of damage. With the melee/heal being the only way game is played on new zones, this class is a no brainer winner. Nothing wrong with epic I guess.. see 51 guys walking about with them while some classes have 0-3 epics total on a server.<P>Please don't take skills from other classes and add them to rogues. If you add some skills, make up some new ones rather than making every class more or less the same.<P>Top laughs:<BR>"Give rogues the ability to Cut-throat."<BR>"Rogues should get a shield of involnerability discpline."<BR>"allow us to ASSASSINATE any target 47 and below not just a humanoid target."<BR>"Backstab: A dmg bonus on 'frontstab' could be nice."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay if your gunna mess with evade you better give rogues more HP it is sad when a caster can be buffed as well as me in reguards to HP's and messing with evade will make rogues have to tank more at least give them a shot at survival. Second please make made poisons stackable ala shaman potions. Third allow for hide/sneak through zone lines. Other than that i comend you guys for your improvements to the rogue class over the year(s) it has made playing them very enjoyable.<P><BR>Deeon Darkfoot<BR>56 Blackguard of Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello there.<P>I have a few things that I have been thinking about since I was born back in January of 2000.<P>1) Poison<P>Poison was broke then and it's more broken now.  Now it takes me 7 seconds to poison a blade with poison that seemed like a quest to just make 1 vial, that will only do as much damage as I would do if I was if full attack.<P>2) Pick Locks<P>There should be a quest for us to get some Soul Bound Lock Pick.  Alot of good having the key to Seb does if you died after the locked doors.<P>3) Sneak / Hide<P> First I want to thank you for fixing the Problem that caused our Hide / Sneak to fall when we were affected by and AoE spell.  That made Corpse Recovery's and travling just so much nicer.<P> If we could H/S through a zone line that would help alot also.<P>4) Tracking in Towns or Dungeons only<P>Rogues are to city's and dungeons as rongers are to the wild.  We rogues are the people who know the tunnnels in and out of city's.  We are also the people who do all the scouting in the dungeons it would make sence that we could have a 1/2 scale Tracking skill that would only work in the places mentioned.<P>5) I think it's safe to say that Disarm is usless, since at the higher levels (40+) there is not much reason to disarms a mob since most of them have some sort of Magic Weapons if they even bother to use the dang things.  I have no idea what you could do to make it usfull in a non PVP environment.<P><BR>6) Hiding from a battle.<P>I was thinking that "rogues" are known for slipping in and out of combat.  How about a chance to "Hide" from a combat in which you were part of as long as you make no movments at all.<P>So if I were in a fight and it went south the rogue might have a chance to hide and stand perfectly still,  no sneaking, no Attacking with out pulling all of the Agro'ed mobs back on me.<P>This might not get us out of a tight spot but it would at least keep up alive long enough to get the group back to set you free.  hehe<P>Rueny Rosewind<BR>50th Rogue<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please excuse this monk related post, but I'd like to give a monks perspective on Rogues.  Especially since many of you have bought up monks in your arguments and talked up monks abilities even to the extent of inventing ones that we DON'T have.<P>We DO NOT get any sort of lock picking or trap sense/disarm skills.  I have no idea where Zerep plucked that idea from.  Similarly, I have zero idea where Loudent got the idea about haste on monk shurikens.  Last I checked, EVERY throwing weapon a monk could use had rogues on it too.  /boggle<P>And FunkiFeva (among others) please stop talking up the effectiveness of Feign Death.  FD has been nerfed half a dozen times already.  In a group is less than 1/10th as effective as evade.  It stops us from doing ANY damage as it totally takes us out of the fight.  It has less than 20% success rate on any mob over level 32, and even less than that on any wandering mob.  Why the hell do you think we need to /q so often on raids?  You think that's helping our damage output whiles rogues are putting out double our damage (not counting uber-rare T-Staffs or epics here)?  And the rogues I know still tank better than monks.<P>In SoV FD NEVER works while we're grouped and anybody else in the group has done damage to the mob.  Most other places it's also less effective while grouped and we have zero ways to reduce agro.  We can feign 10 times in that situation and still get beat on (quite often until we die).  Even worse, we can't feign pull in the Hole or SoV because mobs path directly to their spawn points.  There are many places in Kunark where feign pulling doesn't work either.<P>In RoK and SoV mobs frenzy on us when we're below two bubbles of health (when we need it most).  In that situation we will never (and I mean never without exageration) get a successful feign.  We don't get a "Soandso has fallen to the ground" message.  It just doesn't work.  I know, I've died to a green drolvarg after 8 successful feigns in a row in FV.<P>For SKs and Necros FD is even worse.  It's a spell which can be interrupted, can fizzle and can still fail after it has been casted successfully.<P>Unfortunately, it looks like VI (in their "infinite" wisdom) will be nerfing evade rather than fixing the bugs in FD.  Most likely, they'll also nerf FD again.<P>Please stop asking for ridiculous things.  If anybody needs an increase to safe fall, it's bards.  Do you have any idea how often they 10k themselves while singing Selos in DL?  You definitely don't need Feign Death and it would totally eliminate the monk class since you tank better and do way more damage.  Would you like monks asking for the hide/sneak combo (ninja's anyone?), picking locks or sensing and disarming traps?  You need taunt about as much as monks and rangers do.  Hell, I'd die a lot less if I taunted less with my low delay weapons.  Tracking is supposed to be for those "in tune" with nature.  Sorry, but IMO that isn't rogues (or monks for that matter).  You have about the same right to sow-speed as monks do (we are masters of our bodies and can only carry 14lb so you'd expect we could move faster than everyone else).  Sneak/Hide should definitely NOT be immune to see invis.  That would make rogues way too powerful in PvP.  Back stab shouldn't be possible with 1hs or 1hb weapons since you can't stab with them!<P>Marinka, monks can't use any of their other special attacks simultaneously.  Same way you guys can't BS and kick at the same time.<P>Instill doubt and Disarm both work guys.  I use them a lot.  Especially when duelling. =P<P>Menolana, enjoyed your post.  Monks no longer do even close to rogue damage (even when both are at the front), we have less AC than rogues and VI don't want us to feign pull.  We're still wondering what our role is at the high end of the game.  On some raids we just seem to be spell-less, non-tracking rangers (before they were fixed).  On most raids (except Hate) we just agro the mob and then die.<P>/rant off<P>I agree with almost everything else and I'd like to comment on some of the ideas that I did like.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Poisons should be combinable in a bear-skin bag like potions.  Poisons IMO should also act like a short duration buff on their weapons like the ranger spells.  I think that would make it much more usable for Rogues.<P>Hide/Sneak should work across zones (so should all illusions).  Illusion mask effects should be self-removable.<P>Backstab messages should be shown like Crits.  But please remove Flying Kick messages, as I hate having my group laugh at me when I flying kick for 3. =P<P>There defintely should be questable armor for rogues, monks and druids.  Pre-kunark rogues were the twink class of choice because of Ravenscale.  Since Kunark it's monks due to fighting battons.  This sort of equipment should be questable and no drop.<P>There should be more dungeons with locked doors, traps and an interesting idea somebody came up with.  Trapped chests with the odd bit of coin and weapons (rusty, fs, whatever) in them.  Put some locked doors in the Qeynos Aquaducts and Freeport Sewers for rogues to play with.<P>SirReal, monks have the same group finding problems as rogues (travelling to dungeons etc), but can carry a LOT less cash.  But I really like the idea of setting traps.  It would be really nice to be able to set a trap in a dungeon so when a wanderer came around the corner it went off.  Be even better if you could target it for NPCs, PCs, or both.<P>Phata, while I don't think melees should get any native SoW ability.  I think a "sprint" skill that drains all stamina (and runs out when stamina is gone) is a neat idea.  All melee classes should get something like that.  Even make it that it only works when you're below half health (running for your life) like going Beserk does with warriors.  It could even be implemented as a button with a slight fear effect.  When used, you run in a particular direction and can't turn.<P>Oh well, I only read up to the end of the 3rd page.  Lots of good ideas, a few bad (or mis-informed) ones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple of points (that very few people will read with the number of posts here)...<P>Background - I'm a 55 rogue on a PvP server.<P>PvP...<BR>It would be nice if rogues had a chance against<BR>casters doing the caster runs up the hill and<BR>disappears trick.  Yea, yeah, we get poison<BR>(assuming you can afford it).  Guess what, it<BR>gets resisted in pvp - Not just a little either.<BR>Have evade have a chance of removing a rogue from<BR>an enemy's target.  At least we might have a<BR>chance against casters hiding indoors on another<BR>floor or using the hill trick.<P>What about a limited tracking of the npc/player<BR>that is the current target ?  With the way track<BR>is implemented (broken), it's mostly useless <BR>anyway, but it might give a rogue a chance against<BR>the evil combination of verant's dead reckoning<BR>"algorithm" and any caster who knows how to run.<P><BR>PvE<BR>Could poison be a bit easier to raise ?<BR>I spent 3500pp today raising my poison 13 points<BR>(182 to 195).  Since I believe it gets more<BR>difficult on the way to 250, 195 looks like<BR>a nice place to stop.  Farm greens ?<BR>It's more cost effective to camp a dungeon than<BR>it is to spend a week farming greens for poison<BR>components.<P>And a note on the nerf whines of the few...<BR>Despite the whining of wizards and such,<BR>double backstab isn't quite all it's made<BR>out to be.  One, it doesn't happen as often<BR>as one might have hoped (10 to 15% I'd guess).<BR>Two, missing both is still quite common.<BR>Three, more often than not, if I do hit for<BR>both shots, at least one of them will be for minimum backstab damage.<P>I really dread what this rebalancing is going<BR>to do to EQ.  Fear of the unknown ?  Maybe...<BR>Fear of Verant's past ?  More likely...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>IDEA-  Poison crafted with poison skill that instantly casts a spell that both kills the user and restores some of the experience lost for dying.<P>WHY IT WORKS-  First, this would only be used when you KNOW things are going bad.  How often do you know this?  Not too often.  Allow res to bring the rogue back to the area, but not restore experience.  The cost should be about 3-4pp and aimed chiefly in the 35+ range, for those new-era dungeoncrawlers.<P>IDEA-  As it is, there's a poison rogues can make that hastes and buffs a mob, but gives it a killer DoT.  What I'm thinking is, keep with this idea and make a self-only poison that buffs the rogue nicely, but has a chance to kill him.  Another last resort thing.  Cleric supervision advised.<P>WHY IT WORKS-  There's natural downsides built into it.  Remember, though, who will risk death to win a battle unless the poison itself actually affects the outcome?  Make it strong stuff.<P>IDEA-  Quest:  Turn in JBoots, get a pair of boots that cast indoor-only SoW.  Of course, don't call it SoW.<P>WHY IT WORKS-  No other class can SoW indoors.  This is generally done to prevent kiting, right?  Well, rogues can't kite, especially in a dungeon.  This allows speedier pulling and CR, two of our nice roles.  It helps push the idea that a rogue is a dungeon's man.<P>IDEA-  In line with the above idea, a sprint discipline activated around 30-35.  For a while, rogues have had no escape skill.  We run, we die, we beg for a rez, etc.  Monks can feign.  Warriors can just suck it up.  SKs, feign.  Paladins, LoH.  Clerics, Invul.  Enchanters, mez and gate.  Get the idea?  We're dead in the water here.  Add something that lets us run like hell for a minute.  Refresh every hour or so.<P>WHY IT WORKS-  Rogues have a chance to live now when the porter dies.  Yay!<P>IDEA-  Illusion Masks.  Player races only.<P>WHY IT WORKS-  I swear, I don't see why this would upset enchanters.  Firstly, if we want even HALF the illusions they have at our disposal, that's a bagful of masks we had to camp, quest, and carry.  That's precious inventory room for resist gear, ph4t l3wt, and supplies.  As it is, I could barely justify carrying an Erudite, Iksar, and DE mask at once, but I would.  Rogues are the masters of disguise, with the right tools.  Most of us like to look half-decent, too.<P>IDEA-  Try to keep our armor colors a dark tint.  Ravenscale- Black.  Woven Shadow(hate)- Dark Green.  Mrylokar's(kunark)- Dark red.  Velious armor- Bright Yellow.  Heh, no thanks.<P>IDEA-  Don't nerf evade.  You have no idea how mad we make monsters, and how hard it is to evade.  30-50% success rate, tops.  Because it's linked to hide, if we're being hit when we press the button, it usually fails to to "moving while hidden".  Don't think of it as a magic portal out of danger, it's far from it.  As soon as the tank's dead, it's coming after me, and evade just prolongs that.<P>DON'T-  Listen to these people about the whole Feign Death, Total Hatewipe stuff.  Some people have no idea what balance is.  It's tough to walk sometimes.<P>REMEMBER-  Monks and Rogues are an intricate balance.  Both are damage monsters.  Both have a few extra abilities.  Now, there is a decent balance.  DO NOT UPSET THE BALANCE.  Buffing rogues and nerfing monks, or vice versa, could make a whole class useless in the eyes of players.  Don't do that, please.<P><BR>Thanks for reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I personaly have no real problems with rogues now, i see no reason to touch them besides maybe a few minor things that would not really effect the class much, i have played a rogue to level 60 untwinked and was personaly happy with my rogue even before the day of the ragebringer.<BR>  <BR>  I am very concerned however about your coments on adjusting the way evade works. When the old hate list was in a rogue could totaly duck out of a fight and go hide in a large raid and never be aggro again, i personaly saw no problems with that, i had saved many chardok and hate raids that way.<BR> The new larger hate list ended that trick. Now you want to change it again, I personaly have never been able to evade a mob off me without someone having done some damage to it, a pet is nearly impossible to evade to as is a cleric that has been healing you, i would greatly stress that you do some tests in the actual game to see how this works as it doesnt work the way you are saying it does, you cant evade and have a mob attack a person next to you just because they are kos, if what you are saying is true a rogue would never die on a raid against such mobs as velkator and the dain.<BR> If anything should be changed with evade it is the possibility of failures, at level 60 i would expect the possibility of a failure to be nearly non exsistant as a failed fd is for a level 60 monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, here are some suggestions for rogues, coming from a rogue:<P><BR>1.  Hide/sneak really should work across zone lines, I mean some of the greatest thrills in eq are sneaking through a hostile town, but every once in a while you get that lame guard who is camping the zone line  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>2.  Rogues have pretty much fallen into the category of monks(dealing damage, not tanking) so I would like to see our offense skill cap a bit higher, as of now it is 5xlevel minus 5, atleast raise it to levelx5 like warriors/monks.<P><BR>3.  Disarm and safe fall are currently almost useless, having disarm worko a little more often, and on magic weapons, while only moving the weapon to the mobs inventory would be a great fix, for all classes, as far as safe fall goes, it caps at 95, witch really makes no diffrence if you carry more than 50 pounds of gear, perhaps raise the cap  a bit, atleast enough so I can walk of the Kelethin platforms without taking damage  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>4.  Make a sepperate spell for detecting hidden, rather than having see invis be the unversal thing, also, rogues should be able to see other rogues of lower level who are hiding/sneaking, you know, master knows more than student  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>5.  Iksar rogues would be neat, currenly there are large unused parts of cabilis, wich would mroe than acomodate a rogue guild, or perhaps even have them have bad faction with cabiblis, and make them train at a bandit camp or some such.<P><BR>6.  Stackable poisons, I see no reason for this to not happen, would make the skill much more practical.  Also, perhaps reduce the cost/diffaculty of raising poison skills, make a few more of the components sold by vendors, less of them droped off annoing mobs, and lower the cost of vials/suspension a bit.<P><BR>7.  Some more interesting weapons would be nice, the way it works out now is: level 5 or so, giant snake fang(or dragoon dirk if you get lucky), level 15 or so serrated bone dirk, level 30 or so slime coated harpoon, after that you have to save up for your trakasaurs tooth, witch I don't have yet.  More weapons like the magnetic dirk of distraction would be cool, maybe have amazing stats but a -10 on str or something, just some diversity, some nice offhand weapons that aren't piercing would also be wonderfull.<P><BR>8.  Make ravenscale a little more usefull, right now most of the piecers are pretty lame, like boots/leggings/helm/bracers, take off the current stats(stamina on leggings, charisma on boots? I don't need those stats) and put something usefull on them, like dex, or str.  Also a quest for ravenscale would be nice, I got really fed up with doing lotto's for my class armor, maybe make it nodrop.<P><BR>9.  This is my last one, not to important, but let rogues use Vik's Dark Defender! Hehe, I would love to use this weapon, but it is warrior only, just a  hope  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>That's all I got for now, I might be back later if I think of something more.<P><BR>Ronie Frown<BR>48 Rogue, Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Doh, forgot about Absor's silly little evade thing.  Really though, evade coulden't possibly work like you say it does, I've been in situations before where I turn of attack, evade, it still attacks me, I leave attack off and wait for evade to pop back up, use it again, then finaly the thing leaves me alone, I really do wish it droped us to the bottom of the hate list, but most of the time it takes 2+ evades to get a beastie off you, so making it less evective would really really suck  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Ronie Frown</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a Rogue alt and find I am enjoying him more lately than I do my primary character.  (No, I didn't twink the heck out of him either  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )  I enjoy him but not because of his power, far from it.  At the mid to low levels a Rogue is still a hard sell to a group.  Anyways, the comments I have on the class are pretty simple.<P>1) Fix poison.  Add some training poisons that don't take days of farming greens.  Add stackability if it is feasible.  Change the spell nature so we won't be interrupting stabbing that MOB.  Heck, I just want some workable weak poisons that I can use for flair.  To date I have not used one effectively.<P>2) Make questable mid-level armor.  Cazic Thule is a Rogue nightmare.  Folks rarely want a Rogue in their group (all the better to sell the phat l3wtz later) and often want them to roll with everyone even when they are there.  (That is another issue entirely and both sides have good points.)  Make it tough, make it like the Burning Rapier if you want!  Just bug Kendrick to draft something sometime perhaps.  If not a full set of armor, allow for a few more Rogue quests perhaps.  Heck, I think we would all love a 40 something quest that builds on the Burning Rapier itself.<P>3) Keep Roguish fashion in mind when designing armor.  Perhaps the Assassins gear is set for the Rogue who wil sacrifice everything for performance.  Likely, I'll never own any anyways.  Still, on most races, this stuff screams many things but Rogue doesn't seem to be one of them.  I can almost buy a Barbarian highwayman hiding around a corner but I cannot see neon-clad harpoon-weilders sneaking through a city of Elves.<P>4) Show backstab numbers as criticals do as an option.  We all like to see a big hit once in a while (and hope no-one sees all the whiffs and minimum damage hits).  It would also allow groups in the teens to thirties realize that we *are* contributing more than just moral support.  I would say make it optional if possible as not all my Roguish brethern might want the publicity.<P>5) Have a care when re-evaluating Evade.  If it is broken, please adjust it until it does what it is supposed to.  Just test your results and see that it *is* working.  Not all Rogues are level 60 and I can attest that I get knocked around plenty as it is.  If we start becoming big healing sponges then grouping becomes difficult to say the least.<P>Well, that is all for today.  By and large, I love the class, its image and what has been done to make it viable.  Please remember though, we may swagger a bit and are certainly quite effective in certain circumstances, but not every Rogue is level 60 DWing Willsapper and Ragebringer.<P>cheers,<BR>Celeris Tujimson</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rogues do WAY too much damage in relation to monks and warriors. Monks and rogues should be very close in damage done. Either boost monk damage or lower rogue damage.

</FONT><HR>I would like to see the following changes many of which have already been discussed.<P>1. Pick pockets- pick pockets was a fun skill until it was discovered that picking pockets actually steal from your group. Now in a non pvp environment stealing from others when they have no oppertunity for retribution is simply not fair.  I would like to see pick pockets changed so that it creates cash rather than taking money and items off of mobs. This would allow rogues to be able to enjoy the fun of pick pocketing without the social mayhem caused by taking from the group.<P>2. Hide- I would like to see hide flagged so that it is activated whenever rogues zone.  As someone that often does CR for strangers, I sometimes find myself in the situation where i am pulling a corpse and go LD. This result in my untimely death when I log in only to be seen. It just doesn't seem in the spirit of the game or the best interes of the community for this to occur.<P>3. Escape skill-rogues are sorely lacking of an escape skill. It is quite embarassing to be traveling and have a green kill you at full health.  I know that there was a period in beta where hide would revove rogues from the hate list. This ended up being a source of abuse as players hid and backstabbed repeatedly. I really think that with the implementation of disciplines a hide discipline that removes the rogue from the hate list is now viable. With a timer of an hour, such a discipline would not allow rogues to solo and would not allow for them to effectively use this skill for splitting mobs efficiently.<P>4. Velious armour- Velious armour simply put doesn't look roguely. Please address this. This really detracts from the game. <P>5. Damage shields- Damage shields are too powerful. At level 59, I have to run from greens with damage shields. It is rediculous that mobs so much lower than me are still a threat. Dispelling is often not an option because the damage shields are burried deeply behind other buffs and the casting time on mrylokar guantlets (which is a very rare item) is generally too long to be able to get cancel magic off before the mob interupts.  I propose that damage shields be changed so that they are resistable if the mob is green and partially resistable if the mob is blue to counteract this problem.<P>6. See invis mobs in velious: There are entirely too many see invis mobs in velious. In many zones if you die you are forced to find a necro and summon corpses because it is absolutely impossible for a rogue to sneak in. I would like to see that rather than have areas where everything sees invis that mobs be similiar to those in sebilis which randomly see invis. When a mob randomly sees invis a skilled rogue can use sneak to bypass the mob.<P>Thank you,<BR>Coriscic Hemlock &lt;Platinum Sphere&gt; Karana<BR>Level 59 blackguard<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More weapon between 7 dmg and 10 dmg and make them alot easyer to get hold off. Curently weapon prices go from 600pp for a sbd to around 3k for a slime with nothing realy in between.<P>Evade allow evade to work of classes pet's currenty rogues are useless in a group without another melee class in it. <P>Lure skill .. group classes alway's brings some specialty to a group, crowd control healing etc rogue have now specialty skill for use in a group.<P>Poisons are far to costly to make, take way to long and have so limitted uses in how there used.<BR>Every rogue guild should have a merchant that sells most items need for lvl 1 and 2 poisons at least. Increase drop rate of farmed item's as well.<BR>Applying/using poison is fairly usless. The best suggestion I have heard is poisoning daggers (quest off hand only and very slow say dly 100). When you apply a poison it add charges to that dagger. Say 5 for the lvl 18 dagger. You would then be able to zone/log etc and still keep the charges on the weapon. When the dagger is used it proc's like a normal weapon thus using one charge of you dagger. By having 3 different types of daggers this give you a choice of what to use and when. There would need to system in place to limit repeat uses of the dagger.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) HIDE/SNEAK : this skill is great, but there s a huge problem with it : i can t rely on it... unlike invisibility spells, it drop as soon as i zone or i get LD (and i get LD a lot). I will give you 2 examples : <BR>- i m KOS in Thurgardin, and i can t WITHOUT help zone safely to Great Divide, because as soon as i zone i aggro the 2 guards right there. I dont think there s a Roleplay reason why an hidden rogue should aggro Mobs, it s only the Zone Architecture.<BR>- As a modem user i m LD a lot, today i died twice because i lost connection while sneaking  in Lowerguk : the invisibilty effect from spell last even after camping, please give us the ability to choose HIDE as default so we don t pay a very expensive price to a technical problem. They re enough mobs that can see through hide to add more stress, we are scout no ?<P>2) SOLOING : I realize that a rogue is a powerfull classe in a good (full?) group : i really need a great taunter (can t evade with only pet tanking, i guess pet have a different Hate status), a healer, an enchanter and an evac to do a good job. Rogue does nice damage now, but don t forget the prize we pay for it : we are the less versatile and the worst soloing classe in the game. What i would like to be change is not a trick or a skill that will allow rogue to solo mobs, but something that give me a chance to run to the zone if i aggro a green mob when alone : i can die REALLY quickly with ONLY ONE greenie  hitting me, cause a rogue solo is very weak : no backstab (that mean weak offense), low HP, no snaring/rooting/gating spell, no Feign Death or Fear skill /spell (Instill Doubt work 1 out of 40 tries, even maxed), no Divine Aura, etc  : give us a chance of avoiding a lame death because a mob 15 lvl lower decide that a solo rogue was an easy breakfast. <P>3) POISON : yes stackable of course, but the main reason why i don t use them (beside the pain to rise skill, gather component and get enough money/time to do it) is that at high level the poison effect are too weak : a successfull Backstab does about 450 dmg, twice that with double BS at 55, why should i bother making a 250 DD poison potion : i will use posioning if instead of creating a potion i could create a one shot weapon (poisoned of course, range or melee) with more special effect (snaring effect, few second root, see chapter above to help rogue <P>About the EVADE NERF : i remember the time when ranger were dying a lot, because they were dealing damage and couldn t tank well (that s why you gave them JOLT) : well keep in mind that rogue have LESS hp (1500 at lvl 55), no buff abilities, no snare/sow to outrun a mob, ... maybe an uber tester with uber ac can tank a little, but nerfing EVADE will result in rogue's death a lot of time, and it s definitavely not fun (read many players ll get burned playing EQ). As a side note EVADE is never working when i play with Pet classes, so if you nerf it change it in this way as well : give pet Agro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors currently get 1 point of magic resistance per lvl. Could rogues get 1 point of magic sv and 1 point of poison sv per 2 lvl's. Mainly a rogue that get's rooted/snared while pulling mob's is dead sv magic will help against that and we do make poisons thus the sv poison.<P>Throwing weapons could I please do more then the base weapon damage. Damage should incraese inline with normaly melee damage. Also increase the number of throwing weapons (Not STAR'S please we are not monk's).<P>Pickpocket comes for the mob's general loot. If hunting this take for the groups overall loot, which does not go down well with group members especialy at low lvl's . Could the coin from PP come from a seperate pool which doesn't effect group's loot.<P>Backstab's if I miss a backstab because the target is out of range the BS button is greyed out still. Could it please reset straight away like range weapons do. In high lag against moving targets it is often almost impossible to get a backstab. <BR>Also if a backstab misses could there at least be a role to see if it hit's like a normal attack. After all I am behind them it hardly likely that I will miss completely. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a level 51 rogue on the Nameless Server. As my levels have increased I've noticed my skills become less and less useful.  It really saddens me because I enjoy my class but there are many improvements needed to make a rogue actually be something people would look for when they are forming a group.<P><BR>1.  Backstab-  Sure backstab is high damage but in my opinion the big hits don't land often enough. From my experience maybe one out of 2 fights I'll land a backstab for max damage most of the time my backstabs are in the 100's , very rarely do they hit 200.  Now with the high damage weapons that other classes get at higher levels our backstab is no different from most high level meleer's normal hits.  I group with a ranger who hits for 100 regularly which already makes my backstabbing ability obsolete.  I think there should be a bonus on backstabbing after level 50 to equal out the high damage output the higher level tank weapons do or put higher damage peircing weapons in the game to equal out the high dmg tank weapons.<P>2. Sense traps and Disarm Traps -  Until Velious this ability was useless, on the old continents I have seen one trap that was a rock that goes up and down in Sol B that disarming it really has no use.  There should be more traps put in some of the dungeons in the game to make this ablitiy actually useful.  The new zones will help this yes but still thats only 2 or 3 zones out of all the zones in the whole game where this ability is actually needed.<P>3. Picking locks -  Now if there is one thing that aggrevates me it is locks that cannot be picked.  What is the point of putting pick lock in the game if you are going to make locks unpickable.  Such as frozen shadow.  My group got slaughtered on the 6th floor and instead of me being able to actually use my ability for once to get our corpses I couldn't pick any of the locks.  Then when I petitioned a gm he asked me why I didn't just pick the locks.....Sense a problem there? <P>4.Poison - Please god make poisons stack in inventory.....<P>5.Feign Death - This has been talked about many many many times, and probably will never be implemented but it would make the rogue class so much better and useful for a group.   Feign death is given to a necro and a shadowknight but not a rogue.  A master of theft, lock picking and sneaking, trickery,  but not faking his own death?  Now if you ask me a rogue would definetly fake his own death if it was needed and would most likely pull it off very well.  <P>6. Illusion masks-  Where are our new illusions =o( .  Bards get werewolf , elemental,  and rogues are stuck with erudite, iksar, and dark elf?  We are supposed to be able to sneak around cities and disguise ourselves but are stuck with only 3 masks.  Not a big thing but I think we deserve more illusions.<P>7.  Hehe Pretty Colors-  Assasin armor.....Yellow and Orange?  Now explain this one to me. I know you guys at verant like to make the game colorful but this is rediculous.  What sort of moronic assasin would run around with yellow and orange armor on?  I'd assume one that wants to die....<P><BR>I love my class and no matter what would never give up on it but these are just the improvements I think should be made to make the rogue class better....<P>Just my two copper peices<P>Jerricho Mobrobber</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<P>I'm also one of those 2 year rogue veterans that survived to 50 pre minimum backstab, pre evade, pre everything.  I was one of 4 lvl 46+ rogues on the server (Quellious)pre kunark and pre lvl 60 cap.  I just wanted to add a post in agreement with the majority of what is said and add a few variations of my own.<P>Parry and Dodge.  Please increase a rogues ability to dodge inversely with a decrease to a rogues parry.  Ideally so that Dodge would be at 205(ish) while parry was somewhere near 100.<P>I am a rogue built for speed and built to let someone else take the hit.  If you swing at me, am I going to take my little dagger, step into your swing, and try to knock your sword aside?  Realistically speaking I am going to duck, side-step, or (dodge) the attack.  In Parsing the log I have left continually open for the last 3 weeks, I have scored 97 dodges to 140 parries which leads me to believe that my rogue character has been getting a little too personal with the weaponry of my enemies.  It also makes sense that if Rogues are given a Dodge discipline and a Riposte discipline, Parry should be our lowest defence skill.<P>Rogue skill- At level 51 we become Rake's.  Not the most considerate thing you could call a rogue, but I would expect that we should share some similar traits with our namesake.  Please at levels 42 and 50 (or so) give us two "Rakish" skills to add to our collection.<BR>Lvl 42- Kick dirt.  We fight dirty.  Outdoor zones only, cant be done while swimming, it's a 1-3 second blind.  Preferably a 30 second refresh that doesn't gray out backstab, but I'd be happy with a 10 second refresh that does gray out backstab.<BR>Lvl 50- Mug.  The life of a bandit is one of leaving unconscious forms shoeless, penniless and with a large lump on their heads.  It's a 1-3 second stun with a 10 second refresh that most definitely would gray out backstab.  Blunt weapon in main hand is a must.<P>Epic weapon-  There I am dressed in all black with a shiney silver dagger the size of my arm.  Please recolor the epic weapon to match that of ShadowKnight Epic weapon.  I am unconcerned about the effect and you can leave it as is if you so choose.<P>Epic Quest-  Please have someone at Verant give you the ACTUAL step by step that is supposed to be needed to finish the quest.  Then have one of us rogues who has finished it tell you exactly how we did it.  The weapon itself is epic, but the quest has too many shortcuts.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put our epic weapon quest on par with wizards and warriors.  Upcoming rogues are looking at the Ragebringer as just another weapons upgrade to get at lvl 51 instead of our class defining weapon.<P>I can do (and did) my rogue epic quest in 4 days (16 online hours).  That is not an epic quest.  Especially when there are 20 Ragebringers on Quellious to the 2 Wizard epics, 4(?) warrior epics, and 1 mage epic.<P>Changes- <P>Bag you get from Malka is not reward for Vilnus's quest #3(burning rapier quest).  Please change reward to a stack of three or four "tokens of loyalty" that can be used one at a time to spawn Stannos.  This way it requires the rogue to first off complete the mid-level rogue quest for the burning rapier.  The fact that there are 5 times as many ragebringers out there these days as there are burnging rapiers is a tribute to that quests designer and really shows the difference between the dedicated rogue and the uberguild wannabe.<BR>Why complete quest #1(weapons, non Burning rapier) from Vilnus when the reward is the exact same item that you loot from the quest mob in Steamfont that you MUST kill in order to complete the quest.  Please remove the static drop from the quest mob and make it a 5-10% random drop as is seen on General.<P>Quest #2 (robes) is made simplistic by the fact that the two hardest to get robes (one of which being no-drop) are commonly looted off of the mobs that spawn at night in Kithikor (I got both of mine during my General raid).  Please remove the two robes as drops in Kithikor.  Force the rogues to explore zones they probably have never ever ever ever zoned into before.<P>Bad facts about Rogue Epic Quest-<BR>Only class that does not have to kill dragons or other dragon-sized/dragon-rare spawns (Venril Sathir, Royalty in Chardok).<BR>Our ONLY hard to kill spawn can be spawned once every 72 minutes and are spawned when the player chooses and not on a random timer like other quest mobs.<BR>Rogues need never touch foot in Kunark as 100% of our quest is done in the old world.  We only touch the planes briefly to pick up an item that we need kill no mob to aquire.  Doesn't it strike you as odd that you can only get lvl 51 (ability to get ragebringer) but buying an expansion and yet no expansion is included in the quest?<P>i'm sorry if I step on any of my younger rogues toes in my complaints about our epic quest.  But just look at the fact that every 51+ rogue in a guild (it need nto be uber, my guild is 15 members strong) has the ability to get their epic in 4 days and then compare it to any class that needs to kill Venrilo Sathir (once a week spawn) or kill Innoruuk or Cazic-thule (need to clear an entire zone and then kill a once a week spawn) or kill Trakanon (3 day spawn) or kill Severlious, Ragefire, Faydedar....<P>This is our epic weapon.  It doesn't get any better than that weapon, no more upgrades to it.  Now do you want every single lvl 51+ rogue wielding once or would you rather have the dedicated lvl 57+ rogues be able to display their weapon as a symbol of perserverence.<P>Raslla Tangletoe (hoping to get changed to surrname "the Snitch")<BR>Guildleader, Stormriders<BR>Quellious Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

When a mob has little or no cash or little or no loot, who do they look at to blaim?  Come on, you made it so hybrids can't steal exp so make it so we can't steal loot.<P>- Pick pocket should take loot from a seperate stash that includes throwing items, poison components and if possible some no rent items.<P>- Pick pocket usually yields cp, sp... rarely gp depending on the mob.  Give the rogues a skill so they can throw copper peices.  After practicing my pickpocket skill I had over 400cp on me.

If you evade to someone that has done no damage, once you hit it it turns right back to you, and it will not make it go after someone across the zone.  I doubt seriously you have tested it for yourself, but you should.  Evade is good as it is, and don't just bring up nerfing it all calmly like it's not worth talking about.

</FONT><HR>Just a few things:<P>- Sneak/hide should stay trough zones and LD (a simple invis is often far better for scouting, and Rogues are supposed to be the best scouts).<P>- Post 50 Rogues are balanced, but since we are just warriors with less HP before that, give us something else. Why not move the speed increase while sneaking to the 40-50 range ? That would only improve scouting, nothing overpowering.<P>- Dissimulation, lvl 52 discipline (1 hour timer). Hides you and removes you from all aggro lists. It will not help soloing, it will not allow more damage, it will only give a chance to escape an angry greeny or to survive to ONE bad encounter during a CR or scouting.<P>- PoG armor... Please, make it black, or dark grey, or.... whatever...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hi. i play a level 60 rogue. (deletar on solusek ro) i've been playing a rogue as my main character since the game came out(yeah, when rogues sucked). i'm not one of these newschool twinks.<P>rogues are fine. honestly. if your looking for a broken class. fix wizards.<P>only things i'd like to see fixed are:<P>a) if you hit duelist and assassinate a mob, it trys to multiply 32000 by 2. fails miserabley. and you end up doing 0 dmg to the mob that you "assassinated"<P>b) full speed sneak(the level 60 rogue innate ability) doesn't work while swimming.<P>c) ragebringer is too easy to get. quest either needs a higher level cap (i suggest 60) or 1 or 2 more "uber" mobs to be killed.<P>d) evade while levitating is screwed up because evade is jury rigged into the hide skill and you can't "hide" while moving. while fighting a dragon and stuff people are moving around and if someone bumps into you or something it screws up your evade. and against some mobs you need dmf or lev or you get screwed.<P>e) more items that add +atk.  armor doesn't matter jack for rogues. we already got the best weapon (freebringer). i'd like to see some more items like lodizal's belt. cuz the only stats that matter for a rogue is weapons, haste, and atk. (we all have 255 str and cheesebringer for haste)<P>f) remove the graphic for the assassin's helm. all the other classes either have a plate helm look. or a crown(no graphic) look. plz make assassin's coif crown graphic.<P>g)if you aren't going to let us sneak across zone borders. make a rogue only item that is improved invis instant cast. so we can zone with that. and then resume hide/sneak on other side of zone. i dont konw about you, but i think its friggen LAME to be a level 60 assassin master of stealth and have to ask someone for invis to zone into pog. <P>h) some sort of escape mechanism. perhaps a discipline that made instill doubt 100% sucessful with the kick always hitting. and the fear unressitable (except by ubers so it couldn't be sploited...i'm just talking like "oh crap see invis greenie on me" type thing)<P>i) there are 3 checks to see if instill doubt is successful.<BR> -skill check. <BR> -hit or miss on kick (armor class of the mob makes it harder to scare, go figure)<BR> -fear spell being resisted<P>j) poison isn't worthwhile. is it suposed to be?<P>k)effect on myro boots is a joke haha. (effect: fade). its a low level shadowstep escape-type spell. and rogues have 0 channeling. so it can't be used if being beat on.<P>l)you nerfed mark of karn because it healed rogues and rangers and other dual wielders too much.<BR>HOW BOUT NERFING THE DMG SHIELDS OF MOBS CUZ THEY HURT US TOO MUCH. KK THANKS PRECIATE IT ^_^<P>m)related to point above. even if you turn off all filters. dmg shield and others hits/misses info as well as hp total updates still gets sent to the client. turning those filters off does *nothing* to reduce lag.<P>n)needs to be a way to have more than 6 skills able to be used. currently there are only 6 slots for skills to go in. and before you make some sort of spell slot analogy. these are a pain to change around. especially with the new velious interface.<BR>as a woodelf rogue here are the abilities i'd like to have up<BR>1. hide<BR>2. sneak<BR>3. disarm traps<BR>4. sense traps<BR>5. forage<BR>6. pick pockets<BR>7. sense heading<BR>ok thats all i can think of right now but there's probably more. my point is theres not enough skill slots for the skills i'd like to have ready to use.<P>o)bone razor is 10/22 off of the dracholich in the plane of fear.<BR>gpk is a dagger off of nagafen 9/25.<BR>trakasaur tooth is 10/20 off a soloable mob in trakanon's teeth.<BR> --risk vs reward--<P>p)ebonsting. need i say more?<P>q)the exp "bonus" that rogues had actually made it harder for rogues to level, because it only benifited you when soloing (which you can't do). and exp was rewarded in a group based on exp total (which rogues had a really low one)---thanks a lot for fixing it... AFTER I MADE 60!<P>r)instead of nerfing evade and donals. nerf the damn mobs that hit for 850 quad hits and have 200k hp. oh but donals is too strong. guess we'll just have to get 10 clerics and send them in 2-by-2 using CH's and have the other 8 med and rotate like that to duplicate the effect. you can't beat smart players with your nerfs. sorry :(<P>k i've degenerated into whining so i'll stop now. but hey this is whineplay :)<P>feel free to ignore q and r. but the ones above that are concerns i'd really like to see addressed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm interesting.  I always felt that it dropping Rogues to the bottom of the hate-list was a huge drawback of evade.  <P>For instance... In a Paladin main tank/Rogue secondary group, if there is a pull of multiple mobs and the cleric heals the Pali (main tank) agroing extras onto himself... when the rogue goes to pull these mobs off by doing alot of damage gets them agroed on himself and then brings them back to the main fight, but is getting too hurt and evades the mobs just run straight back to the cleric. <P>Basically all damage prior to evade is forgotten.  Which means if you want agro on you (which usually most melee classes want a little more agro on themselves than their casters adn healers) then evade is hurtful when it drops you to the bottom if there isn't an obvious NEXT on the hate list.<P>In a group with a War this is a fine tactic because the war has more agro built up than the casters/healers, so a successful evade just puts all the agro onto the war until the Rogue builds it back up again.  In a group with multiple Rogues and casters/healers you can definately see this dynamic.  In fact, because the Rogues are acting like primary tanks in this scenario they don't use evade at all.  As it would evade onto a caster and not the other Rogue as you would prefer it to do.<P>By not dropping Rogues to the bottom of the Hate list it is actually better.  As a Rogue can evade multiple times in a fight excessive agro is not terribly difficult to get rid of.  However, building that agro back up is, especially in situations were Rogues (a non taunting class) need to get a Mob off their 'weaker' groupmates as fast as possible.<P>I'd actually see this change in agro as a bonus, and not a detriment.<P>ROGUES IN GENERAL:<BR>Rogues pay a lot to be what they are at 51+ levels.  They really are not that diverse a class and do not lend that much to a group than any other melee class can do better until after the skill caps get uncapped again at 51 and minor buff spells and such of hybrids become non-essential or easily replaced by a procing weapon or a piece of armor.  This is when they become a force.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rogues are balanced. <P>We give up our soloing due to our excessive melee powers. And because of that there ALWAYS is a group that benefits for our melee powers.<P>We don't need to be any more powerful but I'd hate to see us being made less powerful from what we now are. The evade change sounds good if it doesn't affect current working on basic combat situation.<P>We (I know I speak for the community now, hands down) love being harder to play properly when it rewards us with enormous amount of damage dealing potential when handled properly. <P>And we (again for the community, flame me at safehouse please if needed =) don't want the class to become candy to play because we don't want the rush of morons in. Currently they get bored at latest on low 30's if they don't learn the trick.<P>Kalaks Kostaja lvl 46 haffer rog of Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not going to repeat everything, just had one interesting idea to add. There are apparently some items that when right-clicked have 1 charge of something that turns them into another item. Create a bunch of such items, with chest icons, that are useable by rogues only, that turn into OTHER items, and you don't know what until the rogue does it. Kind of a workaround to not being able to have mobs possess chests that need to be unlocked, if you understand what I am saying. Obviously, these chest-to-something items should not result in class-specific anything (unless it's into a nodrop rogue item).<P>In fact, have EVERY item that is dropped in the game have some chance (like 10 percent, or 5 percent) of being in 'chested' form. Groups could certainly still get along fine without rogues, by saving those items to be later unlocked by a trusted rogue. But it would also be additional incentive to WANT a rogue, without otherwise affecting balance in any meaningful way. Of course, you have to trust the rogue...but that makes it interesting.<P>56 enc / 55 nec / 53 rog / 50 war : Saryrn<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I too think that Iksar rogues should be added.  There is already an entire faction of Iksar outcasts (The Forsaken), many of the NPCs in this faction are rogues.  There are a number of places that could be used as a guild hall such as the sewers of Cabilis, one of the abandoned buildings in Cabilis, or maybe you could use on of the Forsaken Iksar camps or forts outside of Cabilis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I posted this on the bugs page, but then found this discussion.  Sorry for posting twice, but I believe this may be a bug.<P>I play a rogue on Aynoe Ro. I have found when hiding and sneaking that I become visible when doing actions that I wouldnt expect to become visible.<P>I am not sure if this is deliberate or a bug, but let me try and explain.<P>I am a half elf and snuck into Neriak, I was going to the bleak fletchers in Neriak. I was level 5 and hidden and sneaking. I got behind the fletcher in Neriak and purchased some supplies I was still hidden and sneaking. I krept out of the bleak fletchers and as I came round the corner saw some guards passing to and fro infront of the warriors guild (I think). I believed that I was OK as both the hide and sneak buttons where still greyed out and I was moving slowly in sneak mode. Imagine my suprise then, when all the guards suddenly descended like newbies to a free weapon. The first guard hit me and I got the message "you have moved and are now visiable". Then I died. This happened a few times while retrieving my corspe. I would creep silently back into neriak. Get past guards and the like. All the way to my Corpse. Retrieve my belongings, stand up. Still hidden and sneaking. Take a couple of steps forwards and then all the guards would descend on me. I got the "you have moved and are now visiable", then I died again. To fix the problem I summoned my corpse to a dark corner. Retrieved it, unhid, and rehid then I could sneak past the guards.<P>The next time it happened I was level 6. I was hidden and sneaking about North Ro. I came close to a party of adventures. One of them cast colour spray. I recieved the "You are protected" message. I was still hidden and sneaking because the buttons where pushed in and I was moving at sneak speed. I krept off and got a bit too close to two skeletons that where by the ruins. Again I got the "you have moved and are visable" and the skeletons descended on my like flies to a corpse. This time though I was luckier and ran for it. Escaping by the skin of my teeth.<P>So why was I becoming visable to monsters after speaking, retrieving or getting too close to spells? Has anyone else had this problem? Is it a bug?<P>Thanks in advance.<P>Vortigern<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055114&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055114&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
