</FONT><HR>Today I was in South Karana with my 21 enchanter when Ziann of Divine Vengeance was strolling around SKarana shouting for Quillmane. Well after a while I thought it'd be fun because I was bored just to shout out "Quillmane! w00t! cloak!!!" he immediately /tell'd me asking where it was. I said I had looted it already. He then proceeded to verbally bash me and tell me that I was a gimp for not giving him that cloak because he had camped 60+ hours for it. Damned if I could guarantee someone would let me loot for camping stuff for a long time. He told me, and I quote, to go on living in SKarana like I mattered in norrath. Turns out if you dont give Divine Vengeance, or at least Ziann, the "ph4t l3wtz" they want, you are, and I quote, disrespectful and a gimp who needs to "Die in H***". He followed me around SKarana invised (I could see the bard song effects) in what I guess was waiting to KS from me. He also tried to /duel me a few times, even following me into Lake Rathe. Once I returned to my group he then proceeded to KS from us at the aviak tree at least 3 times before we got fed up and /petitioned, only when he heard my group member suy ay "/petitioned him" did he say he final verbal bashes and pack up and move along. The guide answered and I had apologized for bothering her as Ziann had finally left, the guide told me that there was nothing I could do and to /report any verbal abuses I get from then on. Which I will do if it happens again. I just wanted to through this out into the community as I never knew that people existed in this game that thought themselves as higher than other people and guild.(he even said my guild was crap because he never heard of it) and that they assume rights to any loot they are camping for simply because they have spent camp time for it, as I'm sure 99% of us have spent ungodly amounts of time trying to obtain an item. Well I wish the best of luck to you all and I hope you dont disrespect Divine Vengeance like I supossudly have done and just hand over all your loot to them instead. I'm sure glad I didnt actually look the cloak though and I was just joking around. Amazing what 1 joke a few words long can reveal about a guild/individual isn't it?<P>-Zephlore of Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well this is how I see it.  After you decided to have your little fun you should have told him in tell that you were joking you didnt see qullimane or loot the cloak that everyone is going nuts over.  The way the other person behaved was not very good either and is not exceptable.  If he was following you around you could petition the GM for KS'ing/and interference with game play  which are both bannable offenses.  but like the guide said you would have to get screenshots of the verable abuse he was saying to your group or you in tells. <BR>He should have just done a who on you and found out your level and know that you could not kill quillimane anyway.  <P>Also dont judge his guild by the actions of one persons.  Take care an maybe I will see you in game sometime as I happen to be at paw right now.<P><BR>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 30 Summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only reason I kept referencing Divine Vengeance as a guild about this issue was because I have never heard anything respectable about the guild so could only assume their members act in similiar ways. Show me some honor from their stereotyped high level jerks guild and I will change my thoughts. But as long as I only hear of horrible actions done by Divine Vengeance, I can only assume the guild as a whole believes in such behavior.<P>-Zephore of Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Although... I would like to add that I remembered that Vann was a leader, if not that then a council member of several "uber" guilds back on Karana, and was respected by me from what I had heard of him. So when I did a "/who all "Divine Vengeance"" and saw Vann I decided to talk to him about the issue, assuming he was at least an officer or such. Vann was very mature about the thing and we discussed it quite like normal human beings. So I commend Vann on his actions, thus I can't say all of Divine Vengeance is bad. Yet that was the first good experience I've had with the guild, which I hope shall continue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zephlore,<BR>   Well I really cant comment about the guild itself as I have not ever grouped with or even saw anyone from that guild that I can remember.  That doesnt mean I havnt seen them I just dont recall thats all.  Besides I am only hearing one side of the story.  It very well maybe true this guild is like that especally if you said they came off a split server I would tend to agree with you more as they could come right in and have control of most of the best loot.  Now on this board when it first came up there was a simular accusation about a few people from Hale Ohana.  It defenitily made for good reading as both sides were arguing over the message board but personnaly again I never had any problem with them or interaction that is probably due to I am not high enough to group with there main char and 2 high for the alts.  I am glad that you at least got to talk to someone about this issue.  I hope by posting here and getting your fustrations out that will be able to let it go now and get back to having fun in game.  Also remember dont burn to many bridges it might be one of the divine vengence that saves your bacon one day.  Also I have no affiliation with them whatsoever I was just stating what I believed from reading your side of the story.  <P>If it does happen again or with any of there guild members harrasing you remember to do the following.<P>As much as you are pissed off dont get nasty or snotty with them becuase when you go to do the report function that takes the pictures of the conversation you want to be the one that is being abused for no reason and not getting into a pissing match.  Defenitly report and petition that they are interfering with your game play.  I dont think harrasment get them in much trouble but interference with gameplay is a banable offense.<P><BR>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 30 summers<BR>Terris </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>           Divine Vengence is a very respectable guild and have done some very respectable thing's for me. IE Saved about 40 of us from losing all our gear in Fear on a very bad break.Many times in karnor have gotten res's from Cleric's of this guild.The one and only time i have seen a disturbance with DV was with a bad pull in Karnor.Word's were exchanged in ooc. After about 2 min's the DV puller apologizied coming to left moat where we were.That highly impressed me.<BR>           I dont really hold much faith in your claim.<BR>    1. You didnt play fair claiming to have killed Q. Which is very much soght for by mages being there Epic Quest requirment.<BR>    2.You  had not enough courage to admit to him that you had just been kiding and were sorry for the distrubance.<BR>    3. You list he said die in hell. Truely you must have been shocked beyond your brief year's.<BR>    4.You said he followed you.If this be true Id bet youed said some things to feed the fire that you left out of here and didnt want to use /report cause yuoed be just as wrong as if yuor story is true.He was.<BR>    5. You say that you have heard nothing but ill about the guild but yet at only 21. You now so much about them.If you are higher then 21. You hide your main.<BR>    6. The biggest thing .

</FONT><HR>Yet, not too amazingly, all of your assumptions ar e wrong.<P>1.) I claimed a killed Q for fun because he WASNT a mage, he was a bard, which in theory, was preventing MAG from getting their epic part. If he/she would've been a MAG, I wouldn't have made that /shout.<BR>2.) I didn't immediately admit to the shout being a joke because when his first verbal abuses came through, I thought it interesting to see how Divine Vengeance, which I had been told to be a disrespectful guild, would act. After the whole argument, I told him it was a joke, he wasnt as mad but continued the abuses.<BR>3.) Yes, I was quite shocked when someone would tell me to rot in hell for a simple few-word shout which he had no proof or reason to believe, as again, he was a bard who had almost no use for it, he was level 60 so obviously better equipment, and he had levitate song so didnt need the effect.<BR>4.) He followed me without any provoking, I was amazed at that. But no, I did nothing to abuse him in any way other than laugh at his abuses towards me.<BR>5.) My character that this issue occured with was 21, but i also have a 52 WIZ, 39 NEC, and 26 DRU. So yes, I am familiar with Divine Vengeance.<BR>6.) Again in my above posts, all rumors I had heard were reinforced by Ziann's actions. I had heard nothing positive, so I could only assume since I myself have had more than a few bad experiences with them, plus rumors, that their guild believes in such behavior.<P>Hmm, all shot down, quite interesting indeed dont you think? Well i'm done posting here. This issue is pretty much useless to discuss as nothing will be done. I did get Quillmane yesterday and let a 60 MAG loot it, his last part he needed, for his quest. I even got a Ornate Rune Shield and Siren Scale Robe out of it. So I do NOT want to prevent MAG or tick off MAG about this. I did it because a BRD, especially a 60 bard with his epic weapon, had no use for it and was only preventing MAG from getting it.<P>-Zephlore of Teris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zephlore,<P>    First of all I have to make some assumptions on this.  You sit there now blasting me and I did nothing but offer my opionion on the situation.  IF you didnt want it you should not have posted here.  I dont see where in my opionion I am bashing or slandering anyone.  Now to take your points that you are making as of your last post.<P>1.  In your post no where do you state that Ziann  is a bard so how am I suppost to know that he is not a mage?<P>2.  When I stated you should have said it was a joke.  You made no mention that you said it was a joke until your 4 follow up post which was after my second I belive.<P>3.  What you are reporting is that he stated something and it is consider hear say unless you can prove it that is why the guide told you to use the /report command to have it all in writing that is also what I had suggested in both of my posts to you.<P>4.  I took you at face value for that, that he was following you around and I suggested to you that you could report him on interfence of game play.<P>5.  You claim to have other high level characters.  If you do you would know how the report/petition process works as I am sure you would have had to use it on an occasion or two.  Second you never made any mention that this is and alt. character.  Third if you knew about Divine Vengence and the way you percive them to be why did you even bother to carry on with this knowing nothing good would come from it.  That leads me to belive you dont really have these other high charcters or you just dont know to ignore a bad situation.<P>6.  Next time you want to rant about something you should explain yourself fully.  So other people can see your point of view.  I read your orginal post and felt compeled to reply to help out a person with a situation by explaining what actions he can take the next time. If this situation had/has arisen again.  But all I get is blasted becuase I am suppost to know everything about the whole situation with really hering the full story or the otherside of the story.<P>Last but not list maybe you should not have joked about it.  Just give it some though before you do things.  Dont forget also other people could be reading this post and formulating opionions off of what we post also and may hold it against us in game one day.  Like I said in an earlier post you dont want to burn any bridges because that bridge may be the one to save your bacon one day.<P>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 31 summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I wasnt going to waste my time posting here but since "Zephlore" is such a joke I will.<P>After 10 straight hours of camping Quillmane I was a bit frustrated.  Zephlore thought it would be funny to ooc "quillmane dead, cloak!"<P>I immediately sent her a tell asking where and saying I will reward her well.  She replied "already looted lol".  So yeah I got pissed off.  She then proceeded to ooc/tell me how since Im a bard I dont need it anyway and that it was too bad that I was camping it since she got the cloak now "lol".  Yeah this pissed me off more.  So I wandered around looking for Quillmane more and spotted this enchanter.  I noticed she was twinked so I hung out a bit.  Zelari (the enchanter) continued to say how just because I was in DV I had no right to it over anyone else and that all the "phat lewt" doesnt belong to us.  Funny all I was doing was camping Quillmane.  She continued to taunt me thru tells, saying things like "lol", "youre a bard, you dont need it anyway", "too bad you were camping him, I got him anyway lol". And yes I do have that logged.<P>At this point I kinda snapped, I said some mean things and KSed 2 aviaks from her before I cooled off and left.  Im 190 days played Ive *never* KSed anyone until this situation so yeah you might say I was really pissed off at this psycho.<P>About an hour later I got some tells from Zenolan.  He was wondering if I had gotten the cloak yet.  He started saying how I should not have gone off on Zelari, blah blah blah.  I admitted I had had a short temper there and Zenolan explained that he was in fact Zelari.<P>Just to refresh peoples memory - Zenolan is a known Ninja-looter and KSer.  He ninja looted a smr and fbss and has KSed many many people.  He has been ostrascised because of these actions.  I knew his name right off.  Im sure many of you do too.<P>So basically Zelari/Zenolan/Zephlore is a headcase who thought it would be funny to screw with my head after a 10 hour camp in South Karana.  Then after I got pissed thought she would trash my guild and me in ooc and on this message board.<P>I have no regrets over this, still think Zelari/Zephlore/Zenolan is an extreme gimp.<P>She should have been the one petitioned for harassment.  Obviously she has other motives to post this here and to blast my guild on ooc like she did and to pick me out in the first place for her cruel joke.<P>Anyway I leave you to your judgements and her to her own world.  I will not be replying on this board again and will prob not even come back to read this again as it still upsets me a bit.  Im happy to see people somewhat understanding my situation here.  I was very frustrated about this and yes I dont see anything at all funny about Zelari/Zenolans "joke" or taunting tells.<P>And I find it funny that this person assumes I was camping the cloak for myself.  Let alone have the gall enough to tell me I dont need or deserve it if I chose to use the item for myself.<P>So just a warning, be wary of grouping with "Zelari" "Zephlore" and "Zenolan".<P>If I had it over again I think I would have petitioned and reported her for harassing me, although I doubt any guide/gm would care.  I find it better to work out situations for myself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zephlore,<P>  So late me get this straight.  You are not denying taking the loot stated by Ziann.  Your comment you still pissed about that after a 1 1/2 years.  Ouch that is not a very noble thing to do.  Now I have heard the other side also.  Finding out about your past history would tend me to belive Ziann position a little more but again I was not there so I dont really know the situation.  But I do know one thing you did start the whole thing with the joke.  Maybe you do not understand EPIC quests are a pain in the but.  I have only got a couple of pieces for my epic quest and those are the foraged pieces just passing through the zones in question.  Since it is now appariant that you do have other characters you should also know the mage quest is the hardest by far epic quest.  I can see where people could get a little testy even if someone else is helping out another mage.  Granted Ziann shouldn't have KS'ed you that is also wrong he should have petitioned you.  But like your subject matter states.  This doesnt sound like Divine Vengeance is a bad guild.  Dont forget every guild can/could have a few bad apples in it.<P><BR>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 31 summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zeph, you need not wonder that people on those long, nasty camps are a bit short tempered when making jokes about their supposed victim and target. I don't know either of you and I grouped with members of Divine Vengeance in the past and cant say anything bad about them. But I can very well imagine how Ziann must have felt when you told him you killed Quillamane. My druid camped Dyllin Starsine in Highpass for the second page in <BR>the Testament of Vanear Quest at level 20.<BR>You don't know what kind of jerks are around and what things they invent to get the camp. My first spawn poofed after i killed him and got killed myself. No body (i was bound in highpass, so no chance that it took more than 2 minutes to get back and i didnt use a dot).<BR>I petitioned about it but as usual no gm online (5 pm gmt +1). I waited for the next spawn and about half an hour before he was supposed to be there a cleric came along and told me that he killed him half an hour ago, so i can go because it would be a long time before he would spawn again.<BR>I kept my temper, but you probably can imagine how <BR>i felt. So even if it was a joke, think a bit more <BR>about the victim and how he must feel.<P>Gnomb Goodbasher - Officer of Scarlet Underground<BR>level 38 warrior<BR>Kallandros Nobleheart - Officer of Scarlet Underground<BR>level 25 paladin<BR>Ethandrea Wolfsong - Scarlet Underground<BR>level 20 druid<BR>Alanadale - Scarlet Underground<BR>level 15 bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have recently been camping the gnoll spires in sk and being a wizard i am not in high demand (actually saw 3 other wizards of comparably level doing lfg shouts at the same time as me) so i occaisonally sit back invised and watch what goes on.  I noticed quit a bit of repeated behavior from one individual.  On a previous camp our group was having our pulls stolen by this individual, repeatedly.  So I saw an oppurtunity to do some spy work the other evening.  The south spire was uncamped so i began forming a group.  This individual showed up with a monk at her side and they agreed to join.  They repeatedly stole pulls from other camps and laughed about it.  Quite a bit of other rude behavior about others that came up asking to join (their were four of us) they would just ignore them instead of at least responding to them.  Then something quite dreadful was about to happen (i went ld so phew!) the started a fight with grizzleknow without the consent of the others in the group. Now its fine if you want to take on something that big by yourself i don't care.  But i would prefer to keep my kindly faction with the treants thank you.  Now who do you supose was responsable for all of this bad behavior, hmmm none other than Zelari the one who started this posting.  I think we have located the source of the corruption in south karana and its not the DV (which btw i am not too sure of, they seem a bit rude to the lower levels but it may have been the ones i ran into)<P>Fuedyan Wandiliare<BR>Wildrunners of Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>burntboy120,<BR>   Well I was camping the Hill the other day with a mage I usually group with we were waiting for our chanter,cleric,warrior friends to show up before another evening in paw.  Well I here Zelari shouting in the zone how he was ninja looted by someone for some rare drop off a rare spawn.  Most of the zone was pissed about it airing out in shout so I shouted take it to tell along with a few others after me.  Zelari had the gumption to tell me in tell to turn my shout off.  I told him I dont have to turn my shout off as some useful information would/could come over it.  He should take his complaint to tell and petition if this really happend.  Now the other person was stating that no one in the group wanted the item so he looted it. I bet Zelari found out what it was after and what it is for than started the whole shouting match.  Because the person that looted it was not in the group.  So that mean the whole group had time to loot but chose not to when the time was up I guess this guy looted it.  They differ on if he asked or not but this guy seems to be a cancer and I have developed a good set of friends there and told them all about him and his complaining.  Maybe its true maybe its not but you might as well avoid a headache if you can.<P><BR>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 33 summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well after reading all of this, I think I can come to few personal conclusions:<P>Zephlore has poor tact, is rather immature, and has ninja-looted in the past. An act that is inexcusable even after 1 1/2 years. His joke was childish, spur of the moment and he should have owned up to it to save dignity. He didn't so it is a reflection of his character and therefore his word holds little weight.<P>Divine Vengeance is like most other "uber" guilds: they feel that they have some sort of 'right' due to the fact they have camped the longest, played the longest, etc, etc. Their members are decent enough in most cases, but have perhaps become a little too prideful in their quest for Epic Quest gear.<P>If I was on a jury for this, having heard both sides of the argument, I would have to side with Ziann. My reasoning is simple: Zephlore brought this upon himself through an ill-advised shout. It was mean-spirited and childish. <P>So the penalty should be: /ignore Zephlore<P>Ziann should also be reprimanded for losing his temper. Penalty: put the computer keyboard down for one week, step outside and take a walk. There's a new thing out there called "life". Find one, you will like it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>IN my experiance I have found Divine to be a reasonably good guild and we have never had any problems with them.  <P>Anyone can lose their temper, people after all are only human.  Also people can be jerks at times.  2<BR>days ago Quil popped in front of me and lasted about all of 6 seconds.  She also dropped the cloak.  I had thought they changed this cloak to a tradable one, but I was leery of even checking it for fear of picking it up as I had my no drop tag turned off.<P>In any case after doing a quick check in the zone I came across several mages ...one had a bad reputation and had been threatening in ooc people saying the cloak was his since he ahd been there so long.  One I did not know and one I knew casually who was a very nice mage whom I ahd run inot before<P>Needless to say this mage got her cloak form out of the blue by a more or less stranger and will no doubt be VERY happy for life ( grin )....as a druid while the cloak is nice I dont need lev ..so to me it made more sense to simply pass it on.<P>The point is, you get alot more out of life by being nice then by not.  Your actions usually will betray your true intent and people often have LONG memories....about both good and bad things.<P>Tortiebear Sleekpaw 54th druid<BR>Leader &lt;Clan Destine&gt; TT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't care if they knew you where camping it!<BR># 1. problem with that is there is no camping of a mob, especially a Roaming one.  If I saw bildge in Dagnors first TOO dang bad,  I will kill him and I don't care if you have been online for 80 plus hours looking for him.  If I run by Quillmane in South K I will kill it.  I don't care if I saw a shout every 2 minutes saying Quillmane IS MINE,  I have been camping it for 3 days.  As long as I don't KS the mob I AM IN THE RIGHT and have done nothing wrong.<P>I do not like judging a guild for one person's actions, however one Person can give and ENTIRE guild a bad rep.  If you have a problem with a large guild's member, Give a high level person in the guild a tell and ask to have an officer of that guild contact you.  DV has a pretty decent rep as far as I know and will certainly handle a situation that involves someone in their guild<BR>causing someone a problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum7&number=7&thisthread=000072&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum7&number=7&thisthread=000072&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
