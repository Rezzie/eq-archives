</FONT><HR>I agree with Lashanna_The_Wiz post about the levels description.<BR>What has driven me through the levels till now was the reward. I thought that when attaining 50 I could then join an ubber guild and get into raids. I'm still 40. <P>I just play occasionally: during weekends and a few hours per night. I started my wizard at March of 1999. It was extremely difficulty of finding groups after 30 and just playing a couple of hours after finding a group (some days I couldn't even find a group in 4 hours of gameplay) made me level slowly. I was 35 at april of 2000 and now I'm 40 because I started an enchanter(7), Shaman(9) and a bard(30) and spent money and time doing quests and buying items to twink them with my main. I now play much more my bard than my wizard: I just don't have 2 hours everytime I play to spend looking for a group with a wizard. Now I think I was being foolish (and stubborn to keep using the wizard) to pay and have to wait all that much each time. I soloed a lot but I had extremely downtime waiting mana regeneration and it was hard to find enchanters with clarity at soloing zones (they're most of the time grouped for exp or loot remember?). I found outrageous the times I met enchanters soloing ALL the specs at the tower at Oasis that couldn't even sell clarity affraid of me stealing one of their precious 6 specs spawns. <BR>   This week I logged in with the wizard (40) and went to SOLB to try to find out where to get my bards a Carnal Pauldrum. Seeing two ppl LFG I decided to form a group and we went to pool and I forget about the pauldrums (it seems that now some places are more deserted and a smart wizard can start groups and go to some good places -- perhaps the only way to get into groups is starting one). Some more joined and I assembled a full group composed of me (wizard) a warrior, a paladin, a ranger and 2 monks. They had powerfull weapons and armor for their levels. A little time later after we formed a full grouped I noticed that my 39th nuke were landing only when the kobolds mob were already running or already dead(most of the time). If I used bonds of force certainly the mob would be dead by the time my spell landed. So I had to switch to lower level nukes and discovered if I casted a 24th level nuke I could damage the kobold. That same amount of damage was done by one of the monks in less of 2 seconds. I wasn't lagging or had that bug in SOLB. Hilarious....<P>   I asked them to bring more mobs at once since there wasn't an enchanter to mezz I could be more useful using AoEs. I memmed circle of force... 3 mobs... two came and I was dead in matter of seconds even with shield and skin and the groups almost could not notice I was in trouble. Luckly I always bind outside the zone I use to hunt (I learned that it helps to mantain my place in the group so I do not lose too much time to get back when I died). I also got a 39 (yes thirty nine) res from a 53 Cleric in exchange for a port to DL (helped a little bit). When I get back to the group I found a way to contribute to the group by actually helping them lose less hitpoints. When more than one mob came I root parked it so it would not hit more party members and they quickly took the mobs one by one. My skins spells also helped me not losing HP when root parking. It was the only benefit I could add to the group. Seeing an enchanter looking for group, some party members subtly mentioned about how an enchanter would be great as they could actually mezmerize and give them haste. Acknowledging that hint I promptly left the group and logged in with the bard. <P>   It's a pleasure to shout Bard LFG and hear "come to XXX quickly". I think you should try it. And you can also twink them with powerful items (not top of line but yak and mix of Singing Steel and Lambent really rock at the beggining, also give them a djarns amethist ring and a AC 6 65Hp ring you see some power).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well maybe some of you remember me. Hiya Grim, thought you'd be in a padded room by now over the wizard issues.<P>I would like to point out that it is very unlikely that wizards will ever be fixed, back in beta wizards rocked, then came release, all wizard DD's had their damage halved and generated more hate/agro. Think about it now though, druids, mages, cleric all out damage us at on level or another and a great many cleric  and druid spells at low level not only cause more damage but cause secondary effects such as stun and intterupt, when does a wizard get their first stun? The more I think about it, perhaps a solution that VI should consider is the addition of secondary effects to all wizard spells, fire burns for a few rounds causing more damage, cold slows opponents for a while, lightning/magic stuns and interrupts. This wouldn't address the dd damage output vs mob hp problem but it would give wizards an added attraction to groups. I doubt VI will ever fix the wizard though, so I doubt I will ever play EQ again, far to many issues have been left unaddressed far to long.<P>Sylper</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really, really wish I was one of those wizards who "never had a problem" finding groups.  That's BS anyway because all classes will have problems finding a group from time to time.  <P>Only with with my wizard it was practically every day--even after I could gate 6 different zones!  If you can't find a group from one side of the world to the other and it NOT some bogus reputation problem, there is a problem.<P>The only time I even bother to try grouping with my wizard is during the morning hours when most Americans are at work/school.  Even then it's still hard to group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a wizard on luclin and I must say its embarassing when a druid can outnuke me, a magician can sit there and do nothing while his pet works in the group and I have to med the whole time.  When I started the game the cute little booklet they gave to us said wizards were the master of offense, thats a crock.  All verant has done is make every other caster class more powerful and left wizards alone, it seems to me like wizards are no longer balanced and no longer fit the defenition that was given to them.  If verant can't up the power on wizzies, I say give all my levels to my druid so I can have some power again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LOL, gotta love some people. one minute al is saying he doesn't add anything more to a group then a wizard, the next he's stateing without a pet he's dead. pick a side, solo or grouped. if your grouped, then with no pet your a wizard with no root, snare, stun or evac, but with WAY better damage shields, free arrows (if you choose not to give your puller free arrows thats your problem), free food and water if needed, water breathing, heatsight, CoH and resist debuff (you say get a shaman, do they debuff better with the same spell then you?). now i understand that some of these aren't used that much, but nether is evac. we have only 1 stun at 20 with a 6 sec recast delay untill we hit 49. root, now that its stackable with snare makes it a bit more group friendly, but is shared with so many other classes that its not that big an issue (makes me into a backup CC) and snare is helpfull, but is a short duration. now add your pet. that puts you ahead on the group friendly bit.<P>now for solo, you say without your pet, your dead, well, without our mana, we're dead. wanna know what the difference is, your pet regens health way faster then our mana, you can summon a new pet if yours dies while we can't summon a new bar of mana (don't say harvest, its a half bubble to a bubble once every 10 mins, how would you like to be limited to 1 pet every 10 mins?)and if you see your pet dieing, you can gate, if we see our mana almost empty, we have to choose, try one last nuke to kill it or root and hope it sticks, then gate. personally i think its easier to judge if the mob your fighting will be able to take down your pet befor its ready to run then it is to judge if we're going to get a resist. oh, and what about way red mobs. you know how many times i watched my mage friend get attacked by a specter in oasis at lvl 14 and survive? what wizard can boast that??<P>if you choose not to summon a pet appropriot to the lvl of the zone your crossing, thats your choice. if your 40th lvl and are to cheap to summon your 20th lvl pet to cross WK, then you deserve to die. summon pet and cross. if you get attacked, the pet will jump in and give you enough time so you can gate or run, or summon a higher lvl pet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't get it. VI starts to balance wizards from 60 lvl. I remember once alan said 60 lvl isn't meant for everyone to get and he's absolutely right. The only wizards I see on my server are the ones that are in huge guilds, those guilds that tend to disrespect other guilds on the server. This is a generalization but I found it to be true . It feels that these lvl 60 spells were placed to help those wizards already at 60 lvl;hence, help those huge guilds as a result. I would of felt better if VI worked on something that would of helped all wizards, like work on faster regen or bump up are efficiency ratios. It just bites that the first thing they come up with is with 2 spells at 60 where most wizards will never achieve, per Alan's own words.

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;You know this is amazing. Mages need to stop trying to compare Wizards against them to determine if we are balanced or not. If you are not a Wizard us true Wizards dont wanna hear it. At least I dont. On the Mage thing.....While your sitting on ur butt your pet is wreaking havoc. Wizard sitting on his butt...his grp is getting pounded. Making people not want the "lazy" Wizard around. Then on the other hand you can summon as many mod rods as you can stand to get back into action. Wizards have to sit it out and hope like hell 10minutes go by and Harvest can recycle. I say that because how many mod rods can a Magician summon in 10 minutes?? How much mana will be gained from those rods?? My beef is not with Magicans its with our honorable design team at Verant. So people stop getting all upset about us finally about to get some bones.&gt;&gt;<P>Well, you're wrong on several counts.<P>FIRST: Wizards are the ones who insist on attacking MAGES everytime I read a Wizard post. If I read an attack on my Class, then I am going to respond and refute the fallacies.<P>SECOND: Weren't you reading??? I said: our pets are NOT WANTED IN GROUPS. Which word in that statement do you fail to comprehend?<P>THIRD: Mod Rods are LORE. It takes 200 mana to conjure one--and for this, we get 150 mana back and we lose 200+ HP.  Do the math  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bottom line: Wizards have valid complaints. Very Valid. But don't try to blame Mages for them. WE didn't design your class or ours. Both of us are screwed.<P>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tator and Valiso...hmm, where to start, where to start.<P><BR>The first thing you need to do is get out of your head the notion that "Mages have it better than Wizards". I am not BSing you. I can't convince you. I want to, but I can't  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">. You'd have to play a Mage inorder to understand what I am saying.<P>The casting time on our spells is so long, we cannot, repeat, cannot cast pets while being attacked. EVER.<P>I can be beat down like a presumptuous dog 3 or 4 times by a MOB while attempting to cast my 'nearly as powerful as Wizard' DDs (of which we only have a very few, btw). Yes, that's right---in many cases, we keep the same DD for 10 or more levels and the casting time on these spells means death automatically unless we have a pet up and ready. Note that in order to travel safely, we cannot have a pet up. We're constrained to use inviso and hope someone will SoW and the inviso lasts long enough to reach a zone point. <P>So, think about that. Our one and only lifeline is something we cannot use to travel through any moderate to extreme danger area. To do so means instant, automatic death.<P>Useful items: well, well, well. I wish I could make you both into lvl 25 Mages right now so you can see just how 'useful' and 'wanted' all the spells in your book are. Let me spare you: ziltch, zero, nada, null, void, game-over. Our summoned items are scorned by even true newbies---and RIGHTLY SO! Any Necro, Druid or Chanter can replace anything we can do---and do it better.<P><BR>Now, recent additions of spells (expediance, summon companion, etc) haven not been fully tested. I use them, yes. As nice as they sound, they are 'barely worth it'. Just enough to force us to buy them (with unbelieveable cost) and try them. The Jury is Still Out on these.<P>Again, I say: Mages don't have it better than Wizards. We have it just as bad, only in a different way. Magick in EQ is worthless unless you play one of the 'favored' Classes. Wizards and Mages, apparently, are not in that l33t group.<P>Alc<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually if you add up the costs of all spells and divide by the number of spells Wizards have the most expensive ones (longer casting too), primarily because of the ports, which are spendy and slow.  So Wis casters aren't quite as hampered by mana cost as it would seem initially, they just have a lower mana producing forumla than INT casters so they feel it more.<P>Magicians DO have it better than Wizards... for the first 50 levels or so.  The class is better built for Everquest, since the game is about killing things, not about travelling or seeing things.  Magicians just kill things better, and thus are more useful to a group.  But that doesn't mean Mages need NO work for the first 50 levels, that was the point of the class talks, to bring up issues only the players would know to the Verant staff.<P>After level 50, both classes have issues, but the situation reverses, Magicians are actually worse off (although I suspect they aren't as creative trying to solve their problems as Wizards, I hear Mages talk about what trash their AE Rain spells are past level 50 all the time while Wizards use theirs to try to do enough damage and like them).  Mage pets past 50 follow the Wizard blast scheme: no more powerful (in fact less so in some ways) but with more variety.<P>This would all be well and good... but the MONSTERS get more powerful, which kind of makes the spells more pathetic as you go along.  What braniac came up with this scheme baffles me, but that's where we are right now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought.....<BR>Ok first off I do not beleive in PLing or Twinking. I chose to experience my characters from statr to finnish and get a real sense of how they work. With that said...rant start....<BR> <BR>Think of a fully twinked warrior<BR>-haste items<BR>-awsome dmg/dly ratio weapons<BR>-amazing AC and HP<BR>-can by FAR outdamage a non twink warrior at the same level.<P>Now a fully twinked Wizard<BR>-total of 200 int=max damage dealt<BR>-+mana items are extremely hard to get and if it did have some it would make a big difference.<BR>-crap weapons (not that I would EVER want a wizard to stand up and melee a mob-that would take away from med time=less nukes)<BR>-Can not by FAR outdamage a wizard of the same level. Not by a long shot.<P>How about raising the 200 INT cap for wizards? Oh wait then we can solo better, nope cant have that, even though we can't find a group so we must solo. Ive always used stuns to save my ench's rear when mez breaks so teh tanks can keep tanking and my mana source can stay alive. Give me more with less cast time. IT IS HELPFULL to a group. How about a root stun, also would help in raids. SCREW the area spells if you are not in an AE group or dont know what it is, they are unwanted. What were the first thing you heard when you cast an ae spell in a raid and had mobs that were mezed? Nothing you could only read Loading Please wait because you just took out the enchanter and the only real crowd control indoors, and then the other 2 mobs and the adds that came in went after you next. AE spells are only good for one type of group, leave them be cause they are fine for it. Get someting else going for the average group that we may see in Norath. Why is it that only INT realy does anything for a Wizard? Yeah ac and hp are nice but hopefully we arent getting hit. Oh wait forgot about the hellish amount of agro our "BIG" nukes do to mobs. Speaking of which forget the idea of huge dmg nuke totaly. The increased agro will make it self nerfing, "WONT BE USED" ,for grouping. You want to give us an uber mob super nuke make it long cast, zero agro, zero resist/low mana. Thats the only way to make that rout work. Clerics dont have time to heal casters when their tanks are getting smashed too. As for making buffs for wizards when they group...what the hell is that. Still makes it so we have to look for the "perfect group" so we can contribute to it. And whats with this whole "against soloing" thing. Grantid I hate going solo. But to think solo is all good besides the non-social aspect is crap. Solo people, whatever class they chose, get descent exp, crap pp, zero loot for their level. I think people seem to overlook the fact that few wizards are selling in EC.<BR>----------End Rant----------<P>Eeommis<BR>49 Wizard<BR>Circle of Titans<BR>Bertoxx<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I played a wizard in P4 of beta and tried it at release.  Gave up period.  I believe the best way to get wizards fixed is to the the most logical thing.  Don't play them.  If Verant wants the class to survive they will then be forced to fix them.  If not they will kill them off.   Either way the problem is solved.<P>EQ is an immature game built by programmer who know how to program but knew nothing of RPG's before this.  They are bound to make mistakes and more importantly they will have no experience with the issues of fantasy design.  I think they have done a great job given there foundation.  But EQ is lacking.

</FONT><HR>At levels beyond 24 wizards are almost useless without an Enchanter in the group.  Both the Enchanter's Breeze and Tashani allow the wizard to be useful to the group, take on the mobs at somewhat the same pace as the other classes.  But the most demoralizing part it that it is very hard to find a group that will take you.  There seem to be too many of us around (and not enough enchanters).  My wiz was my first character and I've spent a lot of time on him (as much as I can).  But it's sort of sad, by the mid-20's they're just not playable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tator, despite your stated intentions, you have offended me.<P>You don't know the first thing about playing a Mage, yet you spare no effort in telling me how to play it (I, who have leveled a Mage to 47 and twice to 34 in groups and solo). I don't believe I've made the foolish blunder of trying to tell Wizards how to play their class---but I could, if I wanted to continue the offense. But, like a Mage, I'll merely smile at the ignorance (a little disdainfully)and ready up the /ignore thingie.<P>But first, you should realize that Mages are masters of aggro management. We have to be or we don't level at all. We have to guage aggro on not only ourselves, but our pets and so forth. It is the Wizard in the group who, time after time, I note nearly dies because of mis-managed aggro--NOT the Mage.<P>You're arguments about soloing further demonstrate your lack of comprehension regarding the Ways of the Magi. As do your comments on travel. <P>Of course grouping is different from soloing. Since I play one of the few, really viable soloing classes and have done so for many levels---and you play a Wizard that can only manage this with jboots or some other prop, don't you feel you're being a bit presumptuous in suggesting I don't know how to do it?<P>Er, uh...don't tell me about Wizards and travelling woes. You get to port almost anywhere on Norrath at your merest whim while Mages have to beg for ports at another's convenience. One could argue that having both ports and massive damage spells places you in the same category as Necros, Druids and Chanters---however! since I've personally seen the many tribulations your Class endures, I graciously spared you this infamous label. Don't push your luck.<P>Also, don't presume to tell me when I should or should not have a pet up. Again, I've a feeling I know a bit more about this subject than most Wizards.<P>Don't assume that I or any other Mage hasn't tried Eye of Zomm. It's one of our spells and your Class gets it. Why don't YOU use it? Could it be that you also recognize it for the worthless crap it is? But, regardless, I have actually used this spell while sitting waiting for any boat ride (er, something you're probably not familiar with). Any Eye of Zomm spell is absolute crap. Find me one Caster (Mage or Wizard) who truthfully disagrees with that statement.<P>Conclusion: don't try to tell me how to play my class and I won't tell you how to play yours. We'll both get along a lot better and we might be able to get those yahoos on the Live Team to make some real changes for both of us.<P>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The effectiveness of AoE's in groups is minimal at best unless you build a group SPECFICIALLY for AoE's. 3 wizards 2 enchanter 1 cleric(for when you die of course heh) outside of this I dont believe AoE spells are worth a damn, even then your only using the PB AoE and not anything like the horrid Al`Kabor line. If they are going to bother giving us AoE's something needs to be done for mana efficient and harder to stop the casting to make them truly worth while.<P>The next topic would be Rain spells, recently there was a chance which stopped pets from taking one of the pulses of the rain spell, BRAVO, something good for the wizards, Rain spells are very efficient for damage vs. one mob. The only thing which still bothers me about rain spells is the resistance, very rarely do i see all three pulses connect on a blue mob, also even when casting this at 80% with the recent patch the mob will sometimes frenzy on me and melee have a hell of a time taunting off me. So for rain I'd personally like to see a little less agro and a little less resists.<P>Next I'd like to mention the fizzle rate on a couple spells. Shield of the Magi and Atols Spectral Shackles. I fizzle these spells more than a level 30 shadowknight with ward undead for the first time. Well maybe not that bad but it still enough that I have wasted a bubble or two just trying to cast one of the friggin spells. I dont know why they suffer from an extreme problem with fizzle but it's noticable.<P>Direct Damage, honestly our direct damage has seen a little improvement in our primary arsenal, the lowering of lure spells to under 50 (great for youngins in raids). But I do have one big complaint from 49-60 why do i have to wait for 11 levels go get a big banger? Yes I know your going to say well the Drought Series does more damage for less mana, but it doesn't fit the bill in cast/recast time vs. Ice Comet's one hit wonder. I'd like to see a little larger series nuke spells be added to the 51+ spell line just cause i like seeing 4 digit numbers flying across my screen.<P>Wizard Equipment, I can go on for days on this but will keep it short. Wizards get about 3 Items in this game which make them "UBER" for lack of a better term, The Conflag Robe from Velkator, Sorcerers Robe (and the likeness from kael and thurg quests), Robe of Invocation from Veeshan's Peak. The Conflag and Rend robe are great for the damage they deal and thier cast time. The Sorcerers Robe is more a joke and slap in the face for Wizards of the appropriate level, putting a 340 damage lure spell on a 30 second cast is a little redicilius. Reduce the cast time to 3x the normal cast time of the spell then I wont complain about this. As for the rest of the pieces of armor, I could definatly do WITHOUT O`Keils Radiation on my boots, if i really want this spell I'll mem, same goes for Elemental armor and Chill Sight on legs/bracer respectively.<P>The last major topic which I would like to touch upon would be group effectiveness and value. In a group sense I only have two things to offer, that's damage and evacuation. We as wizards have the glorious ability to slow a groups effectivness after 2-3 mobs by saying 3 magic letters OOM. No I'm not agroing the monster and no i'm not doing redicilious damage either, about 2-3 nukes per mob and i'm all out of mana, and just 1 nuke i'm hardly doing my share of damage. This is sad and makes it very difficult for wizards to get groups because we slow down effectiveness instead of speeding it up. Our other glorious group ability is teleporting out of a messy situation, while this is good this is the last thing I want to do, so i dont consider it something I add to a good group unless we have some bad times.<P>To wrap this all up in a neat&tiny little package without stepping on any other classes toes (outside of the SK Fizzle comparison that probably made a couple people chuckle if you know waht i'm talking about) There are several areas that I feel could use some looking at and maybe some tuning. Do I have suggestions on fixes, SURE! but that would be a whole nother topic and one man's ideas doesn't necessarily express the vision of the whole.<P>Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope that for some it might shine a light in your face that we dont need to say someone else has it better/worse to point out the flaws that we can point out.<P>Sindarius Sol`Star<BR>58 Evoker &lt;Conquest&gt; - Lanys T`Vyl Server<BR>sintilius@yahoo.com<P><BR>P.S.
