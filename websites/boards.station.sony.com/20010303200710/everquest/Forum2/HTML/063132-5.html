</FONT><HR>It is their product legally. No way around that. But given they are trying to build a community based game, minimizing contact with that community is bad business.<P>If it is THEIR game which THEY get to make changes at will for any reason they see fit. Then what you get is one person's vision of a piece of crap that no one else wants to play. That is called BAD BUSINESS.<P>Face it. This game was not finished when it was released. This game still is not finished. In fact this game will never be finished until it is irreplaceable.<P>EQ as it came out of the box was not a good game. EQ around the point prior to RoK was a great game (excluding tradeskills). All due to players, not developers. Then the developers reign in control again, and make changes as they see fit. Post-RoK/SoV, and EQ is not that great of a game, simply from those changes made as they see fit. In fact, for those that have been here from the start, things are looking worse then they ever have, as we gaze down from post-50 hell.<P>We are all walking out eventually. But if we get pushed out the door and neglected, then that time is now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't see how you get to "I think this board is about to be taken down" from "They should just change things as appropriate" and "Very interesting perspective."<P>"Change" is a very specific word.  It is different from "eliminate," "discontinue," and "take down."  It just means "change."<P>The impression that I get is that Verant is unhappy with the direction the boards have headed in, and it seems that many posters here feel the same way.  Several suggestions have been made as to changes, some of them quite good, and unless Verant has totally lost touch they will try these kinds of changes before taking the drastic step of eliminating the message boards entirely.<P>I am always amused, though disheartened, when I see someone whine that a blue name hasn't responded to THEIR post.  For example, Absor has commented on the cleric heal/aggro issue since the patch was implemented.  People may not LIKE what he had to say, but it HAS been commented on.  Yet, we still have posts EVERY DAY that are *demanding" that a blue name come and say something to THEM.  This is often defined as harassment.<P>Now, Verant is partially at fault for this in that the boards aren't run particularly well, nor are they run in any kind of organized fashion.  That being the case, I think (and I believe Verant is GOING to think) that changes to the way postings are made and replies are given will change.  After all, why should we have to rely on either luck or finding it on another website when Absor, Abashi or Aradune come on and make a comment about something?  Clearly, this is inefficient, and it serves to allow other posters to be ignorant of the fact that the issue has already had a response (again, liking the response is a different issue).  On the other hand, since people DO demand that they get replies within the threads themselves, why should Verant be held responsible because somebody doesn't want to take the time to find the post where it was discussed?  Clearly, if there were fewer threads going on this particular problem would be alleviated greatly.<P>To sum up:  No, I don't think the boards are going to come down.  While there are probably some frustrated people at VI who think it would be a good thing, calmer heads will likely prevail and they will simply change some formats.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Everyone keeps making my point for me though. How could you possibly feel that there is a moral or legal issue? That is....very strange. I bought this game for $40 a year ago. I have spent about $40 for the expansions. I have spent about $120 for the monthly fee. For a grand total of $200 or so. I have over 42 days played. That is over 1000 hours of enjoyment for $200. That is less than 20 cents an hour. They owe me NOTHING. I would appreciate if they would eliminate useless expenditure such as this board to insure they do no go out of business and I lose my invested time. But owe me?

</FONT><HR>I strongly disagree with the original poster.  It is a two edged sword that allows a developer to make dramatic changes (besides bugs) to gameplay in a game after release carte blanch.  If a developer expects to make these changes at will, contrary to normal software development practices, then the players should expect the developer to actively seek feedback from their customers related to these changes.<P>For example, Diablo2 got a tremendous amount of grief in its balance patch.  Why?  Because the players did not expect to have any influence in any future patches (they expected them to be only for bugs since they do not pay per month, unlike EQ), so they were justifiably angry that Blizzard made such dramatic gameplay (class) changes after release (whether they were appropriate or not).<P>In other words, if MMORPGs developers are planning to constantly change gameplay AFTER release (one side of the sword), then they better be willing to LISTEN to current customers before those changes are implemented (the other side of the sword).  If they are unwilling to seek feedback, then they better test enough before release to 'lockdown' gameplay (like Diablo2, no sword at all), because unilateral changes (other than bugs) afterward will not be tolerated by the majority of the players, their customers.<P>Frothgar, Cleric of Butcherblock<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Morgian, I didnt make myself clear. I didnt mean for that statement "if it sucks worse than it doesnt then quit" to be your typical "if you dont like it quit" comment. Well, sorta. But isnt that the real truth in it? If you dont like something more than you like it, you stop doing it (generally - unless you are insane). I was directing that towards those that seem to think that Verant OWES them this board. I feel if Verant is smart and wants to stay in business they will provide an extrememly effective and efficient means for their customers to provide input. I do not think this board is productive towards that end. At least not productive ENOUGH to be worthwhile. I believe that they can come up with something better for less money. I think that this board does NOT help with issues nearly as much as many here feel. And whoever took what I said regarding waste elimination out of context to think that I ONLY meant that this board will run EQ outta business, you are wrong. This board, and other useless ventures in ANY company is indicative of a larger problem. Waste is like ****roaches, if you see one, guess what? I work in the automobile industry, and there is a classic example of what I am talking about. We dump millions into band-aids for faulty processes. We cant see the forest for the trees. Verant needs to step back and ask themselves, IS the message board providing our customers with the maximum support we can deliver considering our budget? I say NO it isnt. The next step is to band-aid the boards. Limit posting, etc. I say take it one step further, and suggest they admit it is a failed process and develop a new, BETTER one. Brainstorm other ideas and invest in them. Understand that the message here is to develop BETTER customer support, not reduce it. This may mean limiting the direct customer contact and expanding other avenues. I may be wrong. How can I criticize the most succesful MMPRPG EVER? Maybe if they did it any other way, they wouldnt have been so successful. But that doesnt mean they shouldnt explore other possibilities. NOT to do so would be irresponsible (towards their families, the stockholders, and their customers).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about having a board for each server and the GM moderate it?  Maybe hire more GM's, one for chat and one in game?<P>The GM's can meet on a regular basis and compare notes.  Similar problems on different servers could be explained/clarified whatever on a Read only type board where anyone from all servers could read it.  GM's would know exactly what the players on their server want/need.  It would be better PR provided the moderator is congenial.<P>Lock people only to the board they first sign up for. For example, if you play mainly on Karana server and you sign up for that one you can only log onto that one.<P>I dunno, could be a big headache but it is my opinion that having ALL the customers on one general chat board is a major problem.

</FONT><HR>"This board does not cost them money, it makes them money. That is why they will not stop it."<P>I do not understand this, Verant has 2 FTE's for this board, they live in San Diego, that is about $150-200k per year in salaries, benefits, etc alone.<P>The only money maker I see on this board is the ads on the top of the pages. Ads do not pay for being there, they pay for click throughs. Although this is a very active board, I bet the click through percentage on the ads is extremely low. The price paid per click through is also based on the audience, so on CNN.com a premium is paid for click through (well educated audience with disposable income) while on these boards, no offence everyone, the audience is largely a bunch of students with little to no money to speak of, I bet they are lucky if they get a penny per click for these ads.<P>And yes, I realize that on really hot sites the advertiser may pay for impressions, but that is pretty much going away, and few sites can boast a crowd so affulent that advertisers will pay for just being there these days. <P>If however there is some other eways that Sony/Verant is making money off these boards that I can not see, I stand corrected. But at a glance I would have to say that this site, like all customer support functions, is a money pit. Customer Support is a nessesary evil in buisiness, you spend money to keep customers, it rarely if ever gains you any. I the particular case of this board, it actually fails to even keep customers lately, it may even be responsible for a large percentage of those who have left.<P>The average player knows little to nothing of what is really going on in Norrath with quests, skills, ratios, etc, but a 5 minute trip to these boards lets him/her know exactly how fruitless it is for them to level up unless they fit a perfect profile, and how their class is the worst in the game. Now they are bummed out and start feeling bad about something they used to love/enjoy.<P>I know that happened to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The Station is not a method of making money for Sony, at least not in the way being suggested re. advertising hits etc. What it is is a section of the 'service' side of things that sony provides. This is used to back up the real money making of the selling of the games and in terms of EQ the monthly bills.<P>The question for Sony/Verant is, is it worth maintaining this side? Does it help make the game better, keep people interested in it, or in any other way improve the way things work for them. Our opinions on this are obviously of interest because we are the people the boards target.<P>I do enjoy reading the boards, but the general discussion board is the worst of the lot. It has the most uselss posts of any of them. There is nothing to be gained by Verant from this particular board. But shutting it down would probably transfer the rubbish to the other readable boards.<P>One problem I do see is that of time. Someone posts a problem on this board. Verant see this, have a look, get some testers to test, discuss internally whether to fix/alter test some more, make the changes. test some more. This takes a fair bit of time. Within a day of a complaint going on the board, there are hundreds of other people saying, why isn't this fixed already. Verant say ' we are looking into it' and people expect the fix to be patched the following hour. It doesn't work like that, its not that simple.<P>Again its difficult for Verant, they supply a game but one that changes and requires customer interaction and hence really provides a service. Most companies providing a service listen to their consumer base and make alterations accordingly, with patches, fixes etc. If only some of the people wish a particular change it can be toggled on and off. This is where Verant has the problem. Can i turn Cleric heal aggro on and off? nope. The people who are happy with it are happy, and the people who aren't aren't. Its a cliche, but you can't please all of the people all of the time. So there is always going to be complaining. Whilst this can be taken on board just because a number of people are unhappy with something is no reason to change it. More people have to be unhappy with something than who are happy with it. <P>This is hard to judge since the people happy with things are out playing the game and not making a fuss, so this board just attracts those who are unhappy.<P>Personally I would maintain this main board, but not bother responding to anything as being a complete waste of time. Keep reading the more specific boards (caster, melee etc.) server GM's should read the server specific boards.<P>And update a method for providing ideas/complaints in a more formal system. What the user wants is a method by which they can say I don't like this, I want to see this and have it happen in a very quick time frame. This is never ever going to happen and would be bad if it did. Post the idea, keep playing the game and if it becomes too much then quit. Come back later and see if things have changed.<P>I have probably strayed from my original intention of what to post, and probably strayed from the main topic of the thread.. oops. Just started typing and my fingers forgot to stop.<P>Hope it makes some kinda sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The boards serve a very good dual purpose.<P>A) They permit people a forum to blow some steam.  To publically say what is bothering them in a harmless way.  <P>B) They give Verant some player input.  <P>This is not to say that Verant should cater to every suggestion and demand that becomes popular on the boards (and we all know they don't.  Melee Binding.)  However, the boards, at the least, provide an illusion of some semblance of control over players environment, by the players.  This keeps most players happy enough to continue playing the game.  If Verant simply decides that they will no longer listen to anything said on the boards, and outright states this fact, I suspect their subscribership will start to decrease.<P>All in all the boards provide a relatively cheap forum which combines player polling, a complaint department, and the illusion of importance to the players themselves.<P>The players do not want to be forced into Verants World Now, with no means to have a say in the matter.<P>Whether their say has any weight or not is immaterial.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well, i'm 42 years old, and maybe these Boards ought to go, but please oh please dont try to make me believe that someone either does, or is supposed to read them all or respond to them all on your end.<P> there are currently 3 good threads on the first page well over 100 to 200 posts long that are specifically ASKING for a response, and ya know what?<P>                NOTHING<P>    two of them are over a week old.<P> So if to better the Game, you need to shut down Boards so you won't have to be bothered by reading the Posts you don't respond to anyway, then go ahead. i'll still pay, and i'll still play, just don't insult my intelligence by inferring someone on your end is reading  and/or responding to these threads on a daily basis, other than jumping in and locking those they don't<BR>like or find offensive, i have seen little or no input from a "blue name" on this Board for quite some time.<P>  Not trying to insult, just stating fact.<P> and now it appears there is a movement to close down the Boards so the people with ideas, suggestions or even just plain old rants won't even HAVE a place to express them. couple that with the reality that it is EXTREMELY frustrating trying to get thru to 1-888-STATION and i'd have to say ,without intentionally being negative, that here we will go again down the path to poorer<BR>Customer Service.<P> Ok, beef up the Call Center, and kill the Board, but don't do one without the other.Or kill the Board anyway,since no one responds to the posts anyway, and there is a chat room on line.<P> thats just my take on it.and by the way, the "SPELLBOOK" thread is one of those i mentioned that is 2 weeks old, has been split, but no "bluename " input. there are 2 more.<P> now, convince me again about how much time someone on your end is investing in reading /responding to board posts?<P>           thanks- naz<P> p.s. - i still love the game, still aint bashin verant employees, but please dont try and make me believe something is so when it obviously isnt.<BR>  <BR> by the way, the Guides on Drinal are great, four stars for them, they do a great job."aladan" or "adalan" in particular, have heard many good things about him. see ya-<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Dexx back on page 1. Remove the boards. Endless amounts of crap gets posted here and the adults who genuinely want to give good input have the suggestions covered up with the little kids sarcasm. Its human nature for these folks to complain and complain cause they feel that if they do it enough you guys will give in to there complaints, then the nerf thing happens and that opens up another can of worms. Just for example,....when Absor opened up the threads for Enc's to finally have input as to what improvements for class balance they would like to suggest,....over 900 people gave input. Sadly,...most of the really good "fixes" that i seen posted by longtime players and myself were covered up by the little kids and their "I wanna look like a Frogluk,...give us Frogluk illusion" and such. There was so much input for Absor to go through and but too much crap to weed out from idiots that i felt that most of the real quality fixes we wanted were not noticed.<P>Please,....these boards are out of control and i and others get caught up in the negative input from negative people and many such as myself want to give good input and not have a big debate on here with others about it, Period. Absor and others i bet get tired of weeding through the crap from these people,....i know i would,..i'm sure they have to be!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How ironic that this thread is now too long and I have to skim / skip the majority of the posts.<P>Anyway i just want to state that I agree, as a form of feedback this board has outgrown it's usefulness.<P>I have a suggestion that maybe would resolve this. Sadly tho my forthcoming suggestion is probably so far buried in this thread it will be overlooked.<P>Worth a shot so here it is:<P>A group of representative players.  I would like to see two or three players from each class and from a variety of servers who communicate the voice of EQ players to Verant.<P>A total of maybe 50 volunteers chosen by either verant or the players or both.  They represent the best interest of their class/server.  Give them a board to moderate.  Have one person supervise them.  They take the player suggestions/complaints/etc to Verant.<P>With a large number of volunteers to moderate at the boards they could respond more to player concerns and filter out the useful information from the not-so useful.  <P>From Verant's perspective it would be easier to listen to a small group of players than trying to follow the thousands upon thousands of posts on this board.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem is not the board. The problem is also not Verant. The problem is the majority of the posters.<P>Like it or not, but the quality of a board is depending on the quality of the posts. It doesn't matter what board system you use and how many people are posting. Want some examples?<P>Compare the "General Discussion Board" with "The Newbie Zone". Same company behind it, same board system, but worlds apart.<P>This board is so heavily used that people like to see it as a platform to become "famous". And since it's so perfectly anonymous, one can vent as much as he want (within a few guidelines). Why are there "trolls"? Because they want to be. They don't act trollish by accident, they act trollish out of their own decisions. This is the first major problem.<P>Then we have the problem that everyone here is an expert. You hardly see posts like "I'm not quite sure, but I think xxx may be a useless spell in my view." Most posts are "XXX is useless... and I have PROOF" or similar. As soon as someone is showing a weakness, he get's bashed and told: "You obviously have no clue, so stop commenting". <P>Then we have the replies of the blue names. Why do they post so rarely? a) They are only human. b) They are not allowed a simple mistake. Remember when Abashi (I think) said, that you don't have to look into the book to med at level 32? He got laughed at, called names and so on. And then there were the equations: Abashi says medding with books stop at 32 = Abashi has no clue about casters = Abashi has no clue about the game = Verant has no clue about the game = Verant sucks. People tend to exxagerate (sp?).<P>Most of the posters here think they OWN a response, because THEIR issue is the most crucial one. If there is no response, then Verant has no clue. If the response is not a total agreement to the post, Verant has no clue. If someone else sees the fact in another view, he has no clue and is a troll.<P>It's sad but the more "official answers" you get, the more people think they can expect one. And if none comes, it's bad.<P>On "The Newbie Zone" the situation is totally different. In the last 12 months or so I have seen about 2 or 3 blue posts. And that is what keeps the board so great. You don't see posts like "VERANT, READ THIS" or "ABASHI, HERE IS THE PROOF". The people there don't expect an answer and therefore don't beg for one. But still they can discuss issues with each other in a mature way. And still they can express negative aspects and discuss it without getting into a flame war.<P>So, what is the solution? There is only one solution that really works. The posters have to change. Stop flaming others, treat everyone as a human being, express concerns and critism in a mature way. Accept the blue names as human beings. THIS would cure the board.<P>but what do I know... I don't have a char above level 50 and haven't killed vox so many times that I can call it "Yard Trash"... <P>Ellegon </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063132&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063132&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
