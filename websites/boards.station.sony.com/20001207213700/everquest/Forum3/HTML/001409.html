</FONT><HR>Whistling Fists quest seems to be broken.<P>A little background: the quest is started by Master Raska, who says, "The legendary Whistling Fists are said to work only on the hands of a monk. They are said to bestow great power on the wielder.  It is written that they were crafted by the gods who devised the disciplines of this caste."<P>I've found a couple other dead end content concerning the fists, mainly "the fists are amazing..." types. However working on the Shackle of Steel, Master Rinmark tells you that his student Veltar was also looking for the Fists.<P>Bring this up with Veltar, and he says "You seek the Whistling Fists?  I also.  My quest lead me here.  Within Droga is a gnome metal contraption which was to help me translate a spectral scroll I found within the City of Mist.  I can tell you no more."<P>(A side note about this dialog... why the hell can't he tell us more about how to translate it? did the idiot forget already?)<P>Anyway, this is where the quest seems to be broken. For a while one of the cells outside of Veltar had Tinmizer's Stupendous Contraption, it looked like a potery wheel, that you could pick up off fo the ground.<P>Well, now that potery wheel is an 'Always Works' and as far as I can tell, the contraption hasn't been replaced in Droga.<P>Now, I gather, from having to get a scroll from CoM, that this is a pretty high level weapon, along the lines of the Fiery Avenger. I just hope it doesn't take a year to get the finished quest in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Tenzarin about the level of difficulty with the Shackle of Copper Quest.  I have been hunting for Kwinn for about 2 months now.  The one time that I did see him, he was killed by a drolvarg very quickly.<P>The odds are highly stacked against us Iksar monks with this one.  Kwinn's placeholders could be any of the hundreds of generic drolvargs/frogloks/leaches wandering the zone.  To actually kill it, have Kwinn be the next spawn, and stumble upon him before he's taken out by an NPC seems pretty impossible.<P>I've only heard of a handfull of people (from any server) who have been able to actually acquire his head required for the Shackle of Copper.  Yet, there are many more who have simply skipped this quest and completed the next "harder" shackle quest.<P>Qween Drakaar &lt;Iksarian Broods&gt;  Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree about Kwinn, after spending over a week here I was lucky enough to see him twice, and unlucky enough to watch him die twice. Both times I was unable to save him due to the number of mobs on him, I tried the 1st time helping him to kill the dog he was fighting but then some frogs joined in and he was dead, the 2nd time I just tried killing him hoping against hope that I would get the kill. After that one I left and did the shackle of bronze quest in only a few hours. My guess is the person who writes the quest has never really tried to do any of them. As the next shakle of Steel is also broke, it seems the copper key has never been seen in the game yet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Many of these Iksar quests are fun some are not, but at least half seem to have been broken, not the best track record.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well some of these have already been answered/adressed in other threads so dont count on much change.Sorry for my cynical tone, but being almost level 50 without having all the quests completed is rather silly.<P>Shackle of Copper : Per Ester Kwinn is on an encounter table that is shared with a kazillion other mobs so the only to make him spawn is to frag the entire NE quardant of the zone til he spawns, doing so lessens the risk of his demise. Yes, I share the opinion that this is ridiculous considering Fuzzmin and all those wurmslayer npcs share the same faction/kos trouble but they spawn every 10 minutes too. Spending several hundred combined hours (if you include the Stone and Rock quests needed for the shackle of Bronze) on a bracer that is a mere AC 5 is a bit over the top. In a nutshell the risk/reward/wasteofmytime ratio is all fouled up.<P>Shackle of Steel : per Ester the NPC in Droga who is supposed to drop the third piece of the copper-nickel key is not even in the game. <P>While we're at it, lets summarily assume that the REST of the Iksar Monk Shackle Quests are guaranteed to have problems since every one so far has. Send a Dev Team member to perform these all personally before wasting thousands of player hours filled with anger, disgust and frustration finding out they are merely bugged, overlooked, or made teriffically over-difficult.<P>thank you =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I'm pretty sure that the risk/reward/wasteofmytime ratio isn't even considered in the Vision.<P>As to whether or not the shackle quests are worthwhile, well we can only hope that when they are are working properly (and I don't mean camping two months for one idiot to show up in Firiona Vie) that the final reward will be worth all the effort put into it. Sure, generally quests aren't worth it, but we have been seeing improvement, take a look at the final outcome of the headband and sash quests. (Ok, I know... it's "almost" worth all the effort, but it's still an improvement.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Shackle of Rock problems.<BR>On the part where you have to collect items for iksar master, one of the items you need are intact skulking brutling choppers.<P>These are way hard to find.  Only 2 I have even seen have been one on hill by bandit lake with tons of green goblins around it (and thats after slaughtering all of them a few hours before) and another in between the lake and the giant fort. (after slaughtering everything for at least 5 hours).<P>I'm suggesting bumping up the spawn rate a little for people trying to get the choppers.  Until then, people pretty much have to kill everything in the south part of the zone for a whole day, or kill the hill by bandit lake every day till a brutling spawns.<P>I was lucky enough to know about the hill spawn as the first time I stumbled upon it I saw one. (coming from overthere zone to cabilis).  I'm just saying bump up the spawn rate a little, this is supposed to be a low level quest not a mid to high level quest where you might expect something this hard to find.<P>I have the shackle, so its not so much an issue to me, but I feel that this cannot be what the quest makers intended the difficulty on a 4ac 0.5weight item to be.<P>Also, from starting the shackle of copper and shackle of bronze quests:<P>Shackle of copper:<BR>need to make kwinn indifferent, theres almost no way a level 35 (or so) monk can kill this guy without getting kill stolen by surrounding mobs.  It's bad enough it takes forever for this gent to spawn, that he gets killed almost immediately by drovlargs or frogs.<P>Shackle of bronze:<BR>I would suggest making the foragable items for this quest tradeable. (at least some of them).  What kind of joke is this to give a monk a quest where they have to forage rares when they cant even forage water or food consistently?  After about 24 hours on this quest I have finally obtained an unholy coldstone (someone camping alchemist), plains pebble (bout 5 hours foraging in south karana), jade magma (very easy, just killed a miner in frontier mtns), and heart of ice (even easier than killing a miner).<P>I can accept the fact that we have to somehow give 2 carnelian stone to tektite in the evil fortress in overthere to get a piece for the quest.  I can even accept that we have to go all the way to permafrost and kill an ice goblin priest (or 3 or 4) to get an unholy coldstone, but having a timesink in zones where we cant possibly do anything but just stand and forage for hours on end is rediculous.<P>warsliks - petrified redwood.  By the time we can do this quest, the only things that even spawn in warsliks that we can get experience from are iksar bandit lord and grachnist the destroyer.  Would it really be so hard to make this item tradeable?<P>burning woods - radiant mediorite (sp?)  Pretty much have to sit at the frontier mountains zone line for hours and forage.  Can get exp here, but as soon as a few wurms spawn were kinda stuck.  They are just way too hard for a level 35 to 40 group.  They sometimes hit for 107s? Level 35 iksars have about 800hps?  Hence the problem here.  Can we make this one tradeable?<P>I dont have a problem with the frontier mountains fools gold, because thats where we actually can hunt stuff while we wait.<P>Rile's sand coin.  Please, like any iksar monks around level 30 to 40 hunt here.  Please make this one tradeable so we dont have to sit in front of iksar master for hours before turning in the complete box just foraging away.  Please make tradeable.<P>I believe this is the first real decent shackle, but the amount of time it takes on average to forage these items in areas where we cant really do anything but stand still and be bored is just sad.  I would ask something like make them easier to forage at our skill level, but you're not going to do that.  You make the coins for the nostrolo tambourine quest tradeable, whats so wrong with making a couple of these foraged items tradeable?<P>You really have no idea how mean it is to expect someone to sit in a zone where they dont get any experience to just forage for hours on end.<P>Just trying to see some improvement here.  I dont expect any quest to get streamlined, I just want casual gamers who dont have 40+ hours do finish one little quest to have a chance.  It took less time to get my monk way better items than this.  Lets see, my monk has 2 sarnak earrings of station, shrunken goblin skull earring, 2 fighting batons, full crescent except sleeves and head, crown of froglok kings, azure sleeves, runed lava pendant, white wolfhide cloak... The list goes on.  All of this equipment took less time and effort to get than the shackles of copper and bronze.  How sad is that?  I don't think its too much to ask.  I don't think it would lesson the content of gameplay and pride a monk should have over their quest item.  I just think it would make things a little more fair for people who don't have 8 hours to play every day to get a shackle or two in less than a few weeks time.<P>Mandicus 46th barbarian shaman<BR>Zakani 35th iksar monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry to hear about your toils on Bronze quest, but my friend , I'm afraid you ran into nothing more than bad luck. Many of the foraged items arent that difficult and no where does it say you are expected to earn ac while doing it. The redwood could have been foraged while camping the bruteling, the coldstone while getting your wolfhide cloak, the plains pebble on the way to everfrost, Riles sand coin can be foraged on any of the umpteen times you may take the Bloated belly to the Overthere/tim deep. (I personally foraged the sand coin while killing Oowomp for XP)<BR>As far as tradeability , I could swear that frontier nuggets, redwood and radiant meteorite are all trade-able ...unless they've been changed.   I'm sorry you had such a lousy experience, but I'm afraid it can all be chalked up to bad luck. As a matter of fact in the relatively miniscule time it took you to get your intact choppers (nothing less than a miracle to see two brutelings) I'd say you're in far better shape than most doing this quest. I know you had a way better time of it than me and I was level 45 before I finally found my bruteling. In fact, I had Bronze before Rock =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We cant offer a complete list of buggs/anomiles in the shackle quests because when we encounter one, we screech to a halt. We are unable to complete the shackle of steel and therefore have no idea if the subsequent quests are in working order.

</FONT><HR>I know this has been mentioned, but I really want to complain about the skulking brutling spawn for the the shackle of rock quest.  I've been looking for the skulking brutlings for over a week and several levels, and I have only seen one.  Of course, with my luck, that one only had shattered choppers.  My disappoinment was palpable.  I have all four of the fingers for the one hand, and the gloves from the goblin pitfighter(I finally figured out that spawn), but I still don't have an intact mandible from a skulking brutling.  PLEASE increase the spawn rate of the brutlings, or at least make it so that they ALWAYS drop the intact mandible.  I've spent way too much time wandering around Warslik's Woods looking for one tiny piece of a very long quest that will earn me a fairly heavy, low AC bracer that is just like the one I have.  And the bracer is required to complete the next quest.  This is not fun anymore.<BR>A monk friend of mine has also been trying to complete this quest has been searching for the brutlings with me.  He told me it took him less time to get his jboots(on another character)than he has spent searching for these brutlings.  I don't think that's sarcasm, either.<P>Morlose of Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I feel like a total whiner about this when all of you are working on mid to high level shackle quests and this is supposed to be a low level quest.<P>The reason I mention it is that it is one of the first quests that a monk can do. It seems to be a proper initiation into the Monk quests =)<P>It is the Monk Training Bag quest. Initianted by Master Bain. Very simple quest 1) kill swamp leeches 2) kill Escaped Froglocks. Ooops escaped froglocks are very rare spawn and are used on several other quests. So the only way to kill them is for you to be the only person camping the right areas of the swamp.<P>I had a pretty good system down for getting Escaped Froglocks that would yield about 2 per real life hour (and you need 6 for each piece of sparring armor). I need only 3 more pieces of armor to complete the set.<P>It seems that with the new patch something is amiss. Now I have 1 after 2 hours of hunting.<P>It does seem to be an oversight on someones part. If they were only used for one single shot quest, I could understand the very rare spawn rate. But they are used in multiple quests. One of which can be run multiple times.<P>My guess is that are supposed to spawn at the same rate Froglock Escorts do. After the Escorts spawn (which is 2AM if I remember correctly).<P>The reason I mention is that speaking with other low level monks very few complete this quest even once and mention that quests are not worth the effort based on this one.<P>And honestly after reading the posts here and how little thought was put into the quests I probably will not do any more. Which is a real shame. With a little more thought and planning they could actually be pretty more a part of the game.<P>Kurrlee<BR>Monk of 18 Ales<BR>E'Ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As stated before, there are two broken Iksar monk quests.<BR>SIDE NOTE: the Shakle of Copper and Shackle of Broze both WORK FINE. I have both. They are way to difficult for the risk/reward but they both are mechanically working fine.<P>Doing these from memory since they have been broken for about 2 or 3 months.<BR>------------<BR>1. shackle of steel (starts with Iksar Master in Timerous Deep)<P>After completing the shackle of bronze, he begins the shackle of steel quest (with a reference to the whistling fists also).<P>Iksar master gives you a two part container called a key base. It is for the coppernickle key.<P>The iksar slave in Droga (Veltar) mentions Dalnir and says the other half of the key is "in here"<P>In dalnir a nickle key drops off of the penkeeper. ID puts it as part of the coppernickle key.<P>NOTE: at first key was bugged and would not fit in to the key base container from the master. They have fixed that portion of the problem. Now the key fits.<P>Presumably we are looking for the Copper Key. the iksar slave text puts it in droga, but it does not drop.<P><BR>2. Whistling Fists (not the robe)<BR>This quest starts in East Cabilis by giving two pieces of a torn note to a master (notes drop of of bandits). The master gives you in return an ancient thin flute. Veltar in Droga ads to the quest as does the iksar master in Timerous Deep. Veltar (iksar slave) mentions about a gnomish contraption. a gnomish contraption used to spawn near his cell but is now a "always works forge" Veltar mentions something of a note off a spectre in City of Mist also.<P><BR>--------<BR>As far as i know, those are the only two iksar monk quests that are started but clearly broken. Both seem to hit a dead end in Droga. Also, all of the shackles after the shackle of steel have no way of being tested right now, so they may be broken also.<P>So far the copper was broken by not having fingerbones drop off fingered skeletons in kurns. The bronze was made undoable for a short while by removing Tekitite out of the game. People may bring up these problems, but they have now been fixed. The same goes with the nickle key not fitting into the key base, it is now fitting.<P>Please help us out bro, thank you for your time. This means a ton to us lizzie monks.<P><BR>ONE more "possible" problem. The Monk Particle weapon quest is coming together slowly. There is definatly a bug in a quest in qeynos (the gnoll scrolls, when given to the bookbinder, gives you an item that is bugged adn causes you to crash when you zone or inspect it) The icon is wrong on it. At any rate most monks believe this quest to be the start of the monk quest item. You give this NPC 4 gnoll scrolls and he returns them as one item and asks they be bound in Freeport. You cant get there because you crash when you zone.<P>Presumably you get the scrolls bound, return them to the guy in Qeynos and he sends you to Erudin Library (speculation).<P>We have found that he quest can sorta be started without doing this by going straight to Tomekeeper Danl and giving him the item he is looking for (blind luck found this out).<P>As i said, this may or may not be a monk quest start, but the gnoll skin quest is 100% broken nonetheless. We kinda thought that it was going to be fixed this patch, but alas it was not.<P><BR>Again thank you for taking the time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tehre is a new quest mob that talks about Tizmiziers wondrous contraption or something to that effect right inside Akanon.  Has anyone checked this out to see if it is the scroll translator ?  I think this might be our best bet to solving the Whistling fists.<P>-Tuco<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It has been so long i didnt have all the information at the top of my head.<BR>Veltar mentions that he came to Droga to look for a gnomish contraption to translate some notes. A gnomish contraption used to drop but has since been changed to the "always works" forge.<P>There are 6 notes that can be found in the combination of City of Mist, Kaesora, and Mistmoore.<P>Combining em in the new always works forge doesnt work. No one knows about the contraption since it no longer is in Droga.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So Ester, you previously mentioned that when the quests were fixed you'd make sure that Gordon would put something in the patch messages.  Does that mean something pertaining specifically to these quests or just quests in general?  Also wanted to bump this thread up as well as posting before we go waste our time on still-broken quests.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
