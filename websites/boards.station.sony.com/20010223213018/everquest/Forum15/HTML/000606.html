</FONT><HR>After looking at some of these posts over the past few days, I know now why people call this the whining board.<P>All you hear about is Rangers vs. Warriors….<P>You never hear about:<BR>Pallies Vs. Warriors<BR>SK Vs. Warriors<BR>Bards Vs. Warriors<P>And you know why…. Pallies, Bards and SK know their role in the land of Norrath. It seems that a lot of Ranger try to play their class like a Warrior. Let me be the first to tell you, in case you do not already know…. IT WILL NEVER WORK!!!! If you want to be a Warrior then……….. MAKE A WARRIOR!!!!!!<P>I play a Ranger and I do not see what the comparison is. Warriors are just all that -WARRIORS. They are big, burly and strong. Warriors are supposed to be standing in the middle of a fight taking all the hits. <P>Rangers on the other hand are “Light” Tanks….  For example: when you pull multiple mobs the Ranger taunts the mod off the healer or caster and get hit on until the main mob you are fighting is dead. Now if you have a good Warrior in your group he will taunt the mob off of you and on to him.<P>If you are in a group with no Warriors or other tanks sure you will get bet on, but if there are other “tanks” in the group all you need to do is not taunt as much.<P>I am just happy with slashing, blunting or piercing anywhere from 20s to 40s and the occasional 75 to 90 when I use my Wurmslayer. I am also just happy with the fact that I normally wield my weapons twice as fast as a Warrior. I know I will never hit for the 100+ on a consistent basis like a Warrior but if you add my damage up and that of a Warrior, you will find out that I do my fair share of damage. Most of the time it is just under what the warriors total is.<P>The key to a Ranger is…. KNOW YOUR ROLE AND PLAY WITHIN YOUR ROLE!!!!!!!<P>Learning how to use all the abilities of a Ranger is also a key to success.<P>Am I saying that I would not like more AC, Bind/Gate or better attacks (Higher damage DDs, DoTs orAttack Skills)……… NOT AT ALL!!!!! It does no use to complain about it. Just learn how to live in the boundaries that you are given. Sure we get picked on a lot. Did you ever stop and think the reason why Rangers get picked on is because the other classes are jealous of what abilities we do have. I mean think about it ………with DD, Healing, DoT, Snare, Buffs (Str, Agi and Shields), Damage Shield, Root, and don’t forget SoW, all of this just makes Rangers a more formidable class.<P>So if you are getting tired of taking a lot of damage…. All I am saying is DON’T TAUNT AS MUCH    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh and another thing, the following quote demistrates that you do not even know how to play EverQuest let alone a ranger:<P>"All I am saying is DON’T TAUNT AS MUCH" <P>If you knew how to play EverQuest, you would know that not to taunt means not to be in the zone when the fight occurs. If you hit the auto-attack key, you are taunting. If you cast a spell, you are taunting. If you are sitting in agro range of a fight, you are taunting. Most rangers do not even have an active button for their Taunt skill.

</FONT><HR>stop whinning god damnit, first of all, pallies/SK's are the "UBER" taunters. you don't need anymore AC, cause that's the price you pay for being the only hybird able to duel wield!<BR>a pally/SK can't do even 50% the dmg you can do at 51+ using two lamentations. you can't see the different between a warrior and a ranger in dmg when it comes to post 50. so just stop whinning cause you got no reason to, you can snare, root, heal, invis, forage, levitate, duel wield, kick, track, buff, DoT, WHATEVER else you can do.<P>according to verant you're not there to taunt, you're there for dmg dealing. if there are no other "deffensive tanks" in the group, then yep, sure.. TAUNT! just wasting cleric mana if you don't have a tank that can take the dmg like a man. <P>anyway, pallies aren't that much better at that. but whatever.. that's just what verant says.<P>once you get your friggin' planes armor and UBER low dly weapons you can outdmg a warrior. I've seen it before and experienced it myself in a group with 5 other rangers in hate. that's all.<P>51 Cavalier of Rodcet Nife.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You in fact have posted wrong information and are attempting to make it seem true.<P>"...cause that's the price you pay for being the only hybird able to duel wield!" & "so I'm just saying, you have to put up with crappy defense cause you're the only hybird able to duel wield"<P>Wrong. Bards get dual wield, as well. Bards are a hybrid class. So it is a fact that 50% of the hybrid classes get dual wield and 50% of them do not.<P>"check out the posts that rangers put up bout how crappy their defense is."<P>Yep, been there done that. Did it right after reviewing all those post about paladins not doing enough damage. Seems to me that your very rant in this thread is leaning to the side that paladins (and shadowknights) do not do enough damage. If this is true, this the reverse can be said about ranger taking damage (an argument I personally do not completely agree with). <P>So, what we have here is a post that was orginially made by a troll (notice he has not been back?) to slam rangers. When a few rangers came foward and reasonably defended the class pointing out the lies, you come along to add fuel to that fire. You post a rant against rangers and then tell us to calm down when we tell you that you are lieing and are a troll. Please get your facts correct before you attempt show us how very intelegent you are. <P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 54 summers<P>PS&gt; Stupidity is when someone opens there mouth and spews no facts.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love it when morons come around. It is just so easy to pick apart this stupidity. Here goes.<P>"and you may look at them as hybirds to enhance your great arguement, but just don't, cause we all know that bards are put down as hybirds cause they can't be put into any other catagory too well. I never saw verant say that bards are hybirds, but they heavily refered to pallies/SK/rangers as hybirds, leave bards out of this..."<BR>Ah, yes I think of them as hybrids, becuase they are hybrids. Verant has actually stated they are hybrids. I usually take the word of the designers of the game before I take the word of some moron who cannot think. A Hybrid class is defined as a class that has many but not all of the abilities of more then one other pure class. People who think that a Hybrid is a class that combines a warrior class with something else really are not thinking for themselves. They are blind and stupid. If you want to classify bards classes, you may want to consider then a combination of rogue and enchanter. But all that is beside the point since Verant has stated on the definition of these boards as well as on the general discussion board post that bards are hybrids. They are less then their parents class in that specific area that they match up (ie. Bards ability to pick locks is less, bards do not have the full range of spells that enchanters have, ect.) When there was a experience penalty for hybrids, bards had this penalty as well. I am sorry bud, you cannot dismiss the fact that bards ARE a hybrid class just because it does not fit in your little whine.<P>"...and many other people think the way I do..."<BR>And many people used to believe that the world was flat. It did not make them any more correct, now did it? But if truth be told, very few people believe what you believe. You are really alone out there in your ignorance.<P><BR>"how does my "oh-so-much-better" tanking abillities come in handy at raids on uber mobs? why don't you try to answer this one! and not with a stupid argument like, "ohh.. ummm, how does my dmg-dealing come in handy?""<BR>I have a couple questions here. Do you realize how really stupid your agrument is. You are basically saying that your tanking ability is not worth it on raids and then saying that we cannot say the samething. Really, how ignorant can you be? <P>Next question I have is How many raids have you actually been on? From your post, I would believe that it is none. And I would guess that your character is level 12 or so. FYI, on major single battles against large single mobs (like Trak, Vox, Sev, ect.), no one tanks. No class can stand up to a sustand attack from these mobs. Does not matter if you are a ranger, paladin, warrior, etc. No one can tank these mobs. Damage output is done by the casters. You sole job is to be there as a target for them so the casters can cast. You die. We die. Everyone dies. Simple as that. Unless you are a rogue or a monk, your damage output really does not matter. It is the whole groups damage output that matters.<P>"...cause you can out-dmg a warrior by 54, if you deny this, and it just means you didn't get your uber low delay weapons..."<BR>Actually, this is both true and false. On those very raids the you are whining about, rangers do not out damage warriors. Warriors out damage rangers. In most cases, warriors will save their disciplines for these battles. Should the warrior choose to use one of the offensive disciplines, they will out damage most everyone but a rogue who is also most likely using a discipline. <P>Now, in normal grouping situations, a ranger could and will out damage a warrior over sustanted period of time. They are able to do this only because some of their 50+ spells give them this edge. If you are taking only melee damage, rangers will never out damage warriors. Warriors have a high offensive skills. They get critical hits and crippling blows. All of these give warriors a melee damage advantage over rangers. It is only when rangers bring in their spells, that gives them a slite edge.<P>"...and plane gear, I've seen..."<BR>You have seen? You mean that you have never experienced it yourself. How is it that you think you know, if you have never played it? I have seen a pilot fly a plane too. Does that make me a pilot?<P>"lvl 54 you should already be fully equipped with all that stuff doing almost as much dmg as rogues"<BR>This really shows that you know absolutely nothing. Can you tell me how it is that a ranger is doing almost as much damage as a rogue when their melee skill are less then those of a rogue (in all catagories like dual wielding, double attacking, piercing, ect). Then you bring in the 100+ backstabs that can occur about ever couple seconds and do not require mana or resisted to to the fullest. If you really knew the game of EverQuest, you would know that rogues do the most damage of all the melee classes (as long as they can do backstabs). Monks come in second since they have the highest offense skill ratings and some of the best weapons. Rangers and warriors are tied for third. Followed closely by shadowknights in fourth place.<P>"so don't give me crap like that please"<BR>Then use your brain and try to think before you speak. If you do this, most intelegent people will not give you crap. It is only when you make stupid comments like those made above that people give you crap.<P>"I'd like an answer as to how does my "very skillful" tanking come in handy on uber mobs raids."<BR>Well, you should not be thinking you can tank those mobs. Warriors do not think they can tank those mobs. Why do you think you should be able to do something that a class that is a known expert in the field is unable to do.<P>But now if you mean to ask about those tanking skills in normal groups, I really have to make the same comment you made against me. If you are high level and have problems tanking, then you should be looking at your gear. I bet you use a Black Pearl Chocker. Bet you used to use a Serp Bracer, as well. I bet your earrings are str/wis only earrings. You should not have problems tanking if you really have all your planer gear and the right excessories, now should you?<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 54 summers<P>PS&gt; Again, I give you this piece of advice that you seem to have missed last time. "Stupidity is when someone opens their mouth and spews no facts at all." Please take your paladin whine to a paladin whine post. They will love you there.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So if a ranger is a weaker warrior, and a rouge can out damage a warrior, then how can the "toned down" melee skills of a rouge possibly come close to that of a rouge?!<P>Maybe a ranger can out damage a warrior... I have yet to find out on my own but suggesting they can out damage rouge (with a backstab of hundreds of damage every 8 secounds) is like saying clerics can out solo druids...<P>I can tell right now that you know even less about this game then me! and that's saying something considering I only got EQ about 1 month ago.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

ON A PLANE RAID DUDE! how bout that? haven't experienced my ass, I've been to plenty of raids, vox, naggy, all planes, VS.. but my best experience when it comes to that was on a hate raid when I was in a group with 5 other rangers, we kept getting all the exp, those rangers were doing MAADDD dmg, the other tank group was a buncha warriors and a rogue, and with the casters out of the way saving their mana for emergencies, my group was outdmging everyone, the rogue several times backstabbed for 200-400's, but we still outdmgd the other tank group. so again, please.. don't say stuff like that, because you don't really know whether I experienced it or not. so here you go..

</FONT><HR>Up until about 35th level rangers, warriors and SK do the same amount of damage (do the math on dual wield and you will see you are better off with a 2hs before around 35th).<P>Past 35th, rangers out-damage both pally's and SK. Then again, once they get past 45th they have rougly 33% less HP and effective AC than both the other two class when personal buffs are used.<P>BTW. I have yet to meet a pally or sk that can consistently keep a mob off a ranger dual wielding with a haste item. Rangers need the defense to survive the pummeling they take from 50+ not before.<P>Remember that the way the combat system works is based on the difference between ATK and AC, not raw AC. Therefore if a ranger with 900 AC is compared to a paladin with 1000 AC - it is NOT a 10% difference. It is much larger than that - roughly 40% more damage taken.<P>Longetalos <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kainor,<P>How do you know that your group out damaged any other group on those raids? Unless you have turned on all your messageds and subject yourself to the spam that cause, then parsed the log file afterwards, you do not know. Just because your group got credit for the kill does not mean you outdamaged anyone bud. I once say a soloing monk get credit for a Naggy kill. Man, was he lucky on achieving the full unshared total of that XP, but you cannot tell me that that one single monk outdamage every other person and their groups on that 30+ event. To even suggest such a thing is the height of not really thinking about what is occurring. There is a bug with big raid XP divisions. If you do not know that by now, you are being told now. You cannot trust that "you gained experience" message in believing that you out damage anyone else.<P>That being said, if you had 5 high level rangers on that raid in your group and they were going against 5 high level warrriors, I sure hope that those rangers out damage the warrior. If not, what use was their for the ranger to give up HP and AC. But I will tell you this, it is is more likely that those 5 rangers will die quicker then those 5 warriors. Be it in that raid or in a general group. <P>If you believe that you need to do the most damage of all other class in a multi-group raid, then you are thinking the wrong thing. What makes you think that your paladin should be able to come anywhere close to the damage of that ranger? Damage output is good and necessary. But tanking ability is also good and necessary. It if was not, you would see raids that have only rogues and monks with no warriors, shadowknights, or paladins. You do not see an all rogue and monk raids. Paladins are accepted on raids just as often as rangers or shadowknights are. Bards are excepted more often but they play a different role. If you are a paladin and are attempting to compete against a ranger spot, you really are not competing in the right location. It is just as bad as a ranger trying to compete for a spot better suited by a paladin.<P>Finally, yes you are coming here and *****ing. I ask you this, where in the title of this thread did it say anything about paladins? Where in the orginal post did it say much about the disadvantages of paladins. In fact, the orginial post was stating that paladins do not complain about their class. Your very complants here are an obvious flame against the ranger class proves for a fact that paladins do complain about their class. And the reason I keep calling you names like "moron" is because you are so off the mark it is not even funny. If you had one piece of an articulate and justifiable argument, I would not be so harsh no matter how much I disagree with it. But instead, you come here and make statements like:<P>"I'd like an answer as to how does my "very skillful" tanking come in handy..."<BR>"a pally/SK can't do even 50% the dmg you can do at 51+ using..."<BR>"so just stop whinning cause you got no reason to, you can"<BR>"I have to go over this over and over again, how does my "oh-so-much-better" tanking abillities..."<P>Making these type of statements on a ranger hating thread, how do you expect any of us to react? Especially since most of it is not true.<P><BR>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 54 summers<P>PS&gt; A small suggestion. If you are finding it difficult to find a purpose in easy raid events like planer or Vox/Naggy raids, I would suggest you look at your own actions and what you are trying to do rather then look at class abilities. If your whole whine about raids is with regards to raids of Venril Sathir type mobs, then you should realize it is a hyrbid problem and not exclusive to paladins. Rangers are being reject from those raids just as much as you are. And if the whine is about Trak/Kunark dragons/SoV, then you should realize it may be your level. Level 51 is really not sufficient to raid these much more difficult mobs. Those are more a level 55+ raid game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alrighty, lets talk about the 55+ game.<P>First of all a few simple facts. Rangers do buckets of damage. Warriors are usually outdamaged by rangers. Warriors in my guild are always complaigning about this. Warriors have lots of HPs and lots of AC and tank well. Rangers don't take hits well. When Jolt works its wonderful. When jolt fails... it really sucks for the ranger.<P>Shadows and Paladins take hits better than a ranger. They do signifigantly less damage than a ranger. <P>Rangers and Bards at 60 can tank uber mobs with /disc. Warriors/monks/rogues can as well.  Shadows/paladins/casters cannot tank uber mobs.<P>This is not any class "sucks" thread. Just pointing out a few differences.<P>Oh and for the record, I have been to 5 of 6 planes now, and sufficently geared for my level.<P>GLAUX 54.3 Reaver of the Ogreish kind</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Glaux,<P>First, no one "tanks" uber mobs at level 60 in a raid system. Sure they may use their discipline to hold off the mobs attack for a few seconds, but no single person tanks a mob like Trak or VP dragons. To do so will see you dead quickly even with a discipline.<P>Second, I will not disagree with you that rangers and bards received a very good discipline at level 60. And that shadowknights and paladins got a bit shorted on that. In fact IMO, shadowknights got screwed the most on that topic. What is up with giving a discipline that has a refresh time against all your disciplines and one that requires you to use another skill that has an extremely long refresh time. That SK discipline is a one time use thing and requires an SK to hit 2 different buttons or make a special hotkey that does this.<P>But all that being said, rangers are NOT perfect and they DO NOT suck. Shadowknights are NOT perfect and they DO NOT suck. Paladins are NOT perfect and they DO NOT suck. This thread was started by some troll who just want to say that rangers are a bunch of whiners. That is simpily not true. This troll also wanted to say that shadowknights and paladins are unplayable. That also is simpily not true. Would you not tell people that they are wrong is I started a thread that said "Shadowknights are a bunch of baby like whiniers who have been spoiled by their mommy so much that they do not anything"? That is basically the point that Zubris and Kainor have been making against rangers. Is it true?<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 55 summers<P>PS&gt; BTW, to use your own past words agaist you bud, if you feel cannot tank at level 60 then maybe you are playing the wrong class.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wadin,<P>   I agree with you... none of the Hybrids "Suck" or are "Perfect". Each has advantages... each has weaknesses. The one question that still needs to be answered is where do hybrids fit in the big picture?<P>  As for tanking ubermobs... let me rephrase slightly. First of all your right Wadin, people don't last terribly long against uber mobs even with disc. However ripost/weaponshield/&lt;what ever the bard disc is called&gt; do allow those classes a longer survival time (i.e. 15 seconds rather than 5(yes I know these number aren't quite right)). <P>  Each class has advantages. Shadows can solo fairly well (i.e. Karnors, Skyfire, some parts of SoV). Rangers do lots of damage, can solo reasonably well into the low 50s. (A guy in my guild still solos blues at 55 with his ranger... I have no idea how he does it but he does...) Paladins offer stuns/second heals/ buffs (good for pets/ normal group symbols/ etc.) I have seen paladins soloing up to 53ish... but the fight was really close and the paladin was well geared.<P>  Bards... bards are very hard to classify.<P>GLAUX</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm honestly amused. I've read and heard a lot of comments by players of many classes saying that some other class can do something better than they can and the first thing that comes to mind is: If they can do it better than you, why not be one of them?<P>That said, I must say I know there are a few issues with the way things work in EQ and all we can do is hope Verant listens to us when we point out the things that need to be fixed.<P>I laughed when I read that rangers are the only hybrid class that gets to dual wield and cheered when someone pointed out that bards also have this ability. I laughed when it was said that bards aren't hybrids and cheered when it was pointed out that they are. I laughed when I read that rangers are the uber taunters, and laughed again when I read that paladins and shadowknights are the uber taunters. I play a bard of 21 levels and while I admit this is barely 1/3 of the character levels available it has been my experience that I get attacked by mobs even when there is a ranger, paladin, or shadowknight in the group. I even get attacked when there's one of each in the group. According to the class descriptions I read on Caster's Realm, the only class in Norrath that is more hated than bards are enchanters. Picture this, a ranger goes out to pull mobs while the rest of the group waits to hear "Incoming". This isn't rare, I'm sure you've all seen it before. Now, when the ranger returns to the group, followed by something he snared, and when that mob arrives it very frequently attacks me first. My very presence annoys them, and if I happen to, god forbid, play a song...I basically paint a target on my chest.<P>I started playing EQ around Thanksgiving of 2000 and have tried a few different classes. Played a druid, monk, and necromancer each to 10th, a shadowknight and enchanter to 6th, and a paladin to 5th. Then I started playing a bard and decided that I'm happiest with this class. There are some things I wish Verant would change, but no other class appeals to me quite the way the bard does so I don't complain that a warrior tanks better than me, that an enchanter controls crowds better than me, or that a rogue's skills are better than mine will be when I eventually get them. Try to just be happy with what you can do and if you aren't....maybe you need to think about some sort of change.<P>Oranaiche Gaisgeach &lt;Heroes Transcendent&gt;<BR>21st level bard (and climbing)<BR>Vazaelle server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oranaiche,<P>Your statement has a lot of truth in it. Bards and enchanters have a large taunting factor to them. Does that mean they are taunters? Not really. Taunters are the classes that you wish to be able to taunt mobs off another. In most cases, bards and enchanters do not wish to be the one responsible for taunting mobs off another. Therefore, they really are not taunters. They just have a high taunt factor due to the nature of the spells or songs that they are using.<P>Rangers, paladins, and shadowknights are taunters. They are classes whose role it is to taunt mobs off others. They do this in what ever manner that they can do. Because of their ability to use more then just a Taunt skill button, they are able to achieve this ability much easier then the pure melee taunt classes (warrior, monk). <P>In your particular case though, it is true you get the attention more often then others. The major reason for this is that many of the people who play taunter classes that you are grouping with still have not learned all the aspects of their class. They are still learning, just as you are, at the 20 levels. It is the case in higher level play, that those other players will be able to keep mobs off of you. Sure you will get hit. Sure you may die even there. But it will not happen as often as when you were at your current level. And when it does happen, you will notice that it is because much more is messed up then just an inability to get mobs off of you. Things do get a bit better for your class as you level. People will learn what they need to inorder to correctly utilize your beniefts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 55 summers<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladin / Shadow Knight Defense =252<P>Ranger Offense = 250<P><BR>-----------------------------------------<BR>Paladin /Shadow knight Offense = 230<P>Ranger defense = 200<P><BR>-------------------------------------------<P>Paladin Shadow Knight Armor Class = 2-3 points higher on each piece, warriors 5 -6<P>Ranger Armor (chain based is lower)<P>---------------------------------------------<P>That said. I guess most Rangers.. flip and flop one way or the other because we have no defining role in a raid. Pali's and SK's are tanks. Rogues/Monks/Warriors/Rangers are damage dealers. That's fine and dandy but how come Rangers have 52 points less defense than ALL of the other classes that swing blades and stand in mellee range. IF we are such damage dealers, then for 50 points of defense we should be 50 points of offense HIGHER than the MOST damageing class. Lets list this in order:<P>Best Tanks:<BR>Warriors<BR>Palidans/Shadow Knights<BR>Monks<BR>Rogues<BR>Bards (hey they do have 252 defense)<BR>Rangers<P><BR>Most Damage:<BR>Rogue<BR>Monk (these two classes by FAR outdamage any other class BTW)<BR>Warrior/Ranger we do abouyt the same I have pared me against a warrior with same weps and level and he outdamaged me by a good bit over an hour but the diference per fight was not that much)<BR>Bard<BR>Shadow knight<BR>Palidan<P><BR>Hem ok, so a Palidan /SK is the second best tank in the game. Rangers are worst at tanking, but to make UP for that we are the 3/4th most damageing mellee class. All I am saying is WHY are we Hybrids supposed to be LESS than a pure mellee class? Why can't we be the BEST at something? Hell  at least the casters that are not group friendly can go solo... where as hybrids usually take up space at Karnor Entrance or The zone in in sebilis and /ooc for a group for two or three hours then log off.<P>Pure mellee wine: but but you get spells..yeah ok whatever<P>Talan<BR>57th outrider</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The reason u see hybrids comparing themselves to warriors is: first warriors are BROKEN, and we hyrbids in theory are 3/4 warrior.<P>Ok 1st why are warriors broken..<BR>Warriors are by far the best tanks and do 3rd best melee/hyrbid damage in the game. YES a warrior will out damage a hyrbid even when the hybrid is casting(even though in most cases that just makes the hybrid do even less damage)<BR>So where do we hyrbids stand then?<BR>The problem is u cant have a class that takes hits supper well and does very nice damage too, its like making all wiz nukes lifetaps. It leaves the rest pretty much alone with out a group, because they cant compare.<P>As far as the 3/4 warrior, palies or sk dont do 3/4 of a wariors melee damage, i am not sure about rangers but i doubt they do 3/4 of a warrior damage either, this means we are not 3/4 warrior, and as far as out spells...... there is just nothing to be said we all know how usefull those are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;&lt;The key to a Ranger is…. KNOW YOUR ROLE AND PLAY WITHIN YOUR ROLE!!!!!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Dunno why I'm replying here because it's really pointless. I'm bored I guess.<P>The foregoing quote really misses a critical fact.  I will assume the author is a recent ranger.<P>I started my ranger a few months after the game became public.  At that time the ranger was the EQUIVALENT to a warrior/sk/pal.  We were ALL tanks.  The armour available was pretty much close in ac (The days of Rubicite).  My rangers role was a TANK. PERIOD.  THAT is why I created him.  I WANTED to play the tank and have some neat utility spells.<P>Verant, ON IT'S OWN INITIATIVE, without asking if the players WANTED it, CHANGED that role.  They did so by increasing substantially the defense difference between ranger and ALL the other meleers and they made the AC differences between ranger usable armor and the plate wearer's armor even GREATER than it was before.  The end result was that rangers got pummeled and pummeled bad. I could NO LONGER play the ROLE I WANTED to play and WAS playing for almost a YEAR.<P>So I was PENALIZED for having devoted a YEAR to the class simply because Aradune decided to unilaterally change the ranger's role.<P>Your comment ONLY has validity to those making rangers NOW.  They are doing it with open eyes.  But your comment has NO validity to those rangers who were created pre ROK.<P>Maxxius Insanius<BR>57 ranger - Nameless<BR>52 ranger - Tholuxe paells<BR>50 ranger - Cazic thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that trade of AC/HP for dual wield, straight up, is asking to get your butt kicked. Not only does your attack increase which increases your taunt, but it decreases your defense so you can't take the increased hits as well. As for this statement:<P>So if you are getting tired of taking a lot of damage…. All I am saying is DON’T TAUNT AS MUCH  <P>In group encounters, I use the taunt button about as much as the spell glimpse...and still am more often then not the center of the mob's attention. I even just stood once, not attacking at ALL, and still had the mob's attention for the first 5 rounds of attack. I am routinely backing out of fights, and dragging it with me for a while...I can't NOT TAUNT without NOT ATTACKING. We need some way of moving down on the hate list before the 55level jolt. <P>And its obvious that you don't play a ranger...real rangers are never as rude and crass as you...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000606&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000606&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
