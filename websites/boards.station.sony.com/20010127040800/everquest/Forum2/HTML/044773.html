</FONT><HR>Im going to make this very very simple.<P>In the interest of the final ballancing of the paladin class, here is what Paladins ABSOLUTELY NEED to be balanced post 50.<P>1. A SERIOUSLY USEFUL discipline/spell for high level encounters that make them desireable on big raids. <P>Such as a 30 minute reuse lure resist stun that interrupts any mob; or SOMETHING to make us valuable on raids over the million warriors out there such as:<P>The chance to interrupt ANY mob with a successful bash for 30 seconds with a 30 minute reuse.<P><BR>2. More weapons that are NOT ballanced for those who can wield two weapons. More 1h in the 19 24 range (like ebon mace) and more 2h in the 32 40 range that dont require ruining dragon faction.<P><BR>Here is what paladins really SHOULD have but don't ABSOLYTELY need.<P>1. Increse the amount LOH heals by 125 hp per level post 50. An 1800 hp loh on a 4500 hp tank is just two bubbles and just not enough.<P>2. More buffs (castable on everyone) that stack with cleric spells like divine strength such as a stackable AC buff. (This does not include the rediculous idea to add resist disease to paladins as is on test now.)<P>3. Increase the level 60 Sanctification discipline to 20 seconds. As it is now its almost useless since its impossible to know when a mob will cast an ae breath spell.<P>4. Change Holyforge to auto crit/crip for 10 seconds vs undead. Even at 3x the normal crits for 2 minutes this barely does anything at all. Not to mention the total lack of undead mobs except in one zone in Velious.<P>Plain and simple.

</FONT><HR>Hmm. Better put than your comment in that other paladin thread. Ignore most of my reply in that one Beld.<P>I have one question for you though. It is an honest question, not a sarcastic hypothetical question:<P>Why is it so important that paladins have a discipline that makes them more useful on epic encounters? The way I see it- normally a guild or small league of guilds undertake these missions. With my guild experience, you get to go no matter what. There is no scrutinizing question about optimal paladin performance, you're one of the kindred, so you get to go.<P>My confusion stems from lines like "we need x to be more desireable on" epic encounters. To me that sounds like a 'pick up raid'.<P>I know that doesn't make a lot of sense, but that is why I asked my question. What is the dynamic of an epic encounter that would make you think we need a tool to be more 'desireable'.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Further suggestions:<P>- Create a new spell similar to the Color Flux line, called Wave of Reverence, with a higher mana cost and lower stun duration.<P>- Create a new spell similar to Mark of Karn, with the healing portion totally removed - just a damage shield neutralizer.<P>- Create a new spell, similar to Concussion and Jolt, except PBAOE, and increases aggro instead of reducting. <P>- A discipline or spell at 60, with a 10-20 second complete invulnerability, but allows casting/attacking (somewhat of an upgraded DA)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im really wondering if the Ghoulbane wasn't just a big mistake... an over powered weapon that set too many false impressions about Paladins.<P>Back in the old days, pre Kunark, a 15/34 weapon with a 160pt proc vs undead really let a paladin stay respectable in melee because they could do damage close to the dual wielders.  They were still doing the least damage of any melee or hybrid, but it was still respectable.  Because  ghoulbane was 1Handed, a shield let them stay close to warriors in the AC department also.<P>The thing about the Ghoulbane was that although it had an insane ratio for its level, paladins couldn't dual wield so it wasnt _really_ overpowered.<P>Rangers had a valid complaint because they gave up strong armour to dual wield and the Ghoulbane let Paladins get close to Ranger damage and still wear armour.  This sounds good on paper but, until a LOT of paladins started getting Velorium and Kunark came out, it really didnt matter all that much because the AC on the Ranger chain armour was pretty dang close to the Pal/SK armour anyway.<P>ShadowKnights, especially the small ones, were pretty much out of luck because there was no common 1H weapon for them with such a nice ratio.  If they wanted to bash it was most likely gonna be while wielding a weapon that other classes could dual wield.  This meant that it was gonna be wielding a weapon with a more normal ratio.<P>In Kunark and there was no Ghoulbane upgrade.  ShadowKnights got some nice 1H maces and whatever but it was a long long time coming.  There were barely any Paladan only 1Hand weapons at all.  A new level cap of 60 and a bunch of new multi-class 1H and 2H weapons meant that paladins couldn't really keep up anymore.<P>The lack of Paladin 1H weapons with ratios that are too good to be multi-class weapons has pushed paladins even farther down the melee damage list.  They were already last.  The margin is just larger now.<P>There have been a lot of complaints, even by Belduki I think.  There has been a long time for this to be corrected if it was an accident.  <P>But Verant has not added new 1H weapons with extrodinary ratios.  From where I'm sitting, it seems like they are saying that Ghoulbane was a mistake and that paladin melee output was too high before.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I have had differing opinions with Beldukil in the past this post is very well presented and 99% correct.  I hold back 1% because like Gilfalas I see no reason that LoH is not a Complete Heal of all the targets hitpoints past level 50.  <P>Also we do desparately need more Paladin only 1 handed swords with good ratios.  Ghoulbane Mk.II and Mk.III if you will.

</FONT><HR>I don't know how many of you Paladins out there agree with me. But it is to my understanding that Paladin are the "Holy Defenders" of their god. Hence, the clerical abilities. New weapons would be nice, but I would (and this may be just me) love to see improvments on defense based spells/items/stats/etc... Wave of healing is a great example of this. As a defender in the group, it is my responsibility to defend those who are bieng attacked and can't do their job (obviously, tanks do not apply here). A caster gets hit, it is my responsibility to get that mob off of him, so he can continue to help the group. Spells such as stun are great for this, but once the mob is taunted off of the caster you turn to the puller and resume assisting him. All the while the tuanted mob is hitting you, and your taking unnessisary damage. A DS would be wonderfull for this. I would consider it a defensive spell. Diving Purpose is another great! example. Althought it is only a 10hp/tick regen, it is self only (which I think it should be) and it is stackable with chloro. I've heard many great ideas from you people. I think some of those should be greatly considered. But making us tanks isnt the answer. Its not our job. Just my opinion though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I MUST agree with this.  As a higher level Paladin I'm starting to see the problems are class has and how others view us.<P>1. The spell or disc: This is the one we need most.  We don't want to render Warriors obsolete, instead we want to give large raiding forces a reason to take us along.  I have friends and I'm in a good guild, but that should not be the only reason I'm invited to a raid.  I should have SOMETHING to offer the raid besides chatter.<P>2.  Weapons: At the high end game there are only a select few weapons that we are willing to use.  There are a number we can use, but most we will not because they were created with dual wielders in mind.  Paladins need a few weapons that have good damage delay ratio that are useful to us.  Ghoulbane was an excellent weapon for it's level, but too many Paladins are forced to use it at high levels when it's nearly useless, this is simply because we don't have a choice.  Verant, you once promised that you would address this issue but we have yet to see that happen.<P>As for the SHOULD have stuff:<P>1. LOH: Without a doubt this needs an upgrade.  It is extremely frustrating hitting that LOH key and watching a warrior get back two bubbles of life.

</FONT><HR>IMHO, I think pallys should push hard for LoH improvments (reduced reuse time, improved performance and so on).  That is something that won't draw complaints the way weapon upgrades will, and shouldn't be considered unbalancing by VI.  It is realy silly when you think about it, the more you practice your LoH skill, and the more time you serve your god, the less usefull the skill becomes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Large Raid Usefulness is one of our biggest complaints, to be honest.  To the poster asking the question, follow me here on this logic.<P>First off, our 2 parent classes are probably the most desirable classes on large raids.  Large Raids aren't always successful, and the idea that <BR>'we'll be invited anyway because were guilded or friends' is a ludicrous explanation for the current situation.<P>Now, where other classes have massive amounts of Solo Power, or are very powerful at some point in their career, and thusly have been told that they aren't as powerful on Large Raids, we, the Paladin, have never had or wielded such solo ability or power.  We've had to group for all of our lives just as our 2 parent classes have.<P>Discipline Defensive can and does mitigate 10s of thousands of points of damage through the course of its 2 mins in an epic battle.  Currently, you'd be better off taking 1 warrior than almost any number of Paladins on this raid.  Conversely, you'd almost always be better taking 1 cleric than any number of Paladins.<P>Where is the justification that a class derived of 2 of the best Large Raid classes has no large raid usefulness YET shares the same dependance on grouping through all levels as its parent class?  Where is the justification that even the other Hybrids have received Large Raid Usefulness through Disciplines, yet the Paladin has been left in the dark?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This would let us be more useful in our defensive role. Just make sure it won't stack with Divine Aura or rune type spells or it will be too powerful.<BR>More weapons!  Yes!<BR>And a useful spell at 50.

</FONT><HR>Paladins up to 50 are fine right now.  The problem is after 50, the other pure melee classes just skyrocket past paladins.<P>Now paladins pay an exp penality.  At 51+ this penality causes us many problems in getting groups and leveling.  <P>Against boss mobs(pretty much all mobs in SoV ;p) no disiplines(good ones anyway) really hurt us.  We are supposed to be defensive warriors.  Why not a good defensive disc after 50?  <P>Our damage output is pathetic compared to well equiped melee classes.  This super low damage output is ok IF we got compensated somehow.  What do we have an exp penality for if we are inferior to pure melee at 50+?  <P>Now their is talk of pallys getting resist disease????  OMG you have to be kidding me.  Sks are getting summon corpse, the necros best offering to a raid group and we get resist disease??  PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A JOKE!!  What an insult  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.  Why not a small exp res at 52 or something?  Maybe a 40% res like the 39 cleric one?  At 52+ you need a cleric and will have a 49/56 res avail so this would be a often unused, but nice spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree Beld<P>Paladins need a skill that will make them more useful on raids. Our damage output on ubermobs is sub-par, our heals are sub-par, we can't stun nor interrupt the mob, and all of our buffs (excluding Divine Strength) are excelled by spells from other classes. As of now, there is no actual *reason* to take a Paladin on a raid ahead of another class.

</FONT><HR>I completly agree with this post.<P>PaladinX: Not all paladins are blessed with a guild who do raids regularly.<P>Also on Brell Serilis we have a rotation system where guilds sign up and take their turns at various dungeons/mobs etc. Most of the time the guilds aren't big enough to do it on their own, and ask for help. So you sign up and hope they accept you. If paladins don't bring anything significant to a raid, why would they invite you over a warrior? (just an example)<P>Which is the case right now. It's nearly impossible to get into a raid like this unless you know/are friends with the guild in question. Raids aren't posponed because there isn't a paladin on the raid. (note: I don't want that to happen though, was just an example).<P>If we had the discipline Beld suggested, "The chance to interrupt ANY mob with a successful bash for 30 seconds with a 30 minute reuse", then Paladins would be needed on big raids to stop mobs from gating! What a novel concept, we're not just some other joe there doing barely any damage and not tanking too well. What I mean to say is, right now on big raids we're nothing but warriors with crappy weapons, lower defensive and offensive skills that do nothing significant. We can't use any of our abilities on a raid other than LoH. Which has also become weak. ie "An 1800 hp loh on a 4500 hp tank is just two bubbles"<P>Anyway, enough of my ramblings.<P>I hope you take this post seriously Verant. Because this is the real deal, this is what every 50+ paladin is hopeing for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I read Bel's post, and though I've never complained about anything in this game before, I have to agree with his post.  <P>I'm just now reaching lvl 50 and already I'm starting to notice some inequality with paladins at the post 50 lvl.  We sort of have become an opportunistic class when it comes down to raids.  We are a filler class, if no paladins show up for the raid, so be it, we are not really needed for anything.  For a raid paladins really can't be backup healers, 8 or 9 Greater Heals (depending on mana) really don't do anything for large groups.  Our buffs are almost all overridden by better ones  The only reason to use LoH on a warrior is to give the cleric some time to cast CH, cause LoH just doesn't give enough hp's (but even then we can only do that once every 90 minutes)<BR> In fighting situations paladins are outdamaged by every other melee class and our AC is average at best when compared to other melee classes.<P>Put this all together and you get a class that is as I mentioned a filler class, one you take on a raid when you need to fill out a group, not because you need one.  As I see it now the smart paladins out there are managing to scrounge out roles for themselves occasionally (enchanter gaurdians or taunting tanks if they have all their stuns and some good equipment), but again this is stuff that a raid group could find useful but is not really needed.  <P>I don't know, maybe it's just that paladins haven't found out how to best play the post 50 lvl class, but as more of us reach that level it's getting hard to believe that this is the case.  <P>What I do know is that SoV is more geared towards raid groups than a single group, and I think this has made paladins more aware of the problem.  <P>That's why I have to agree with Beldukil on his suggestions to improve the paladin class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll keep my thoughts directly tuned for paladin's in Velious.<P>We are prefectly fine pre 50, life gets very hard from 50-60 for us in Krunak and our effectiveness goes down drastically, especially our melee damage output but we still are useful. But the lands and monsters in Velious totally destroys us.<P>Problem : Melee Damage and Weapon Selection<P>There is a price to pay for having spells and paladins pay for it via melee damage output. We are the least damaging class out of all the pure melee, hybrids and bards, somehing I know and accept. However this gap is widening drastically from Krunak to Velious. Rogues aside (who do around 6-7 times more damage than me) most pure melee classes do around 2-3 times more damage than me. If I wield my best 2hander I can reduce this amount to around 2 times, but using a 1hander its still a huge gap. There is a price to pay for using a shield sure....thats reduced damage output but in Velious there is absolutely no reason to wear a shield as I'll explain later. <P>Solution:<BR>A greater selection of weapons, especially 1h NON dual wieldable weapons would solve this and satisfy paladins. Only *1* mediocre-good paladin only weapon has been found in Velious, I'm sure you'll tell me there is more (laugh) but they must be so rare or hard to get that it might as well not exist. It should'nt be abundance, avaiability is also just as important. Right now when it comes to paladin weapons we have neither. <P>Problem : Discipiles<P>Personally I couldn't care less about these but maybe its because the 2 unique disciples paladins got are utter trash. If disciples are meant to be only flavour for hybrids then it has left a bad taste in my mouth.<BR>HolyForge - undead crit/crip for 2 mins...needs to be always crip/crits for 10-15 seconds. I've used this disciple around 10 times now after the supposed 3*chance upgrade and have only gotten more than 1 crit blow on one occasion when I used a jade mace, most of the time it only goes off once or not at all. This disciple's uselessness is compounded by the fact that I have YET to fight a single undead mob in Velious....and I've looked around for some.<BR>Santification - I havent used it enough to comment, however 10 seconds does sound like a very short time.<P>Solution:<BR>Improve em or I like Beld's solution of a bashing disciple. Change Holyforge into a 2 min disciple that any bashes you do during that period are "almost" guaranteed to INTERRUPT. Now that sounds like a raid disciple and doesnt sound too unbalancing considering the insane refresh time on Holyforge at level 60 anwyay, and I doubt anyone would go do a raid without a paladin with that disciple. <P>Stuns and Bashing<P>Take em away. Its pretty obvious with the expansion containing giant and dragon type mobs that these would be useless. I dont think I've successfully interrupted a 54+ mob in expansion yet with bash. Its just like an extra attack these days. As for stun, if it isnt resisted by the uber MR mobs it doesnt actually stun the mob anyway. In Krunak there were very few giant type mobs, juggs and boss mobs only couldnt be stunned. In Velious nearly every mob is a giant type mob, and can't be stunned. As a paladin, bash and stun are probably our most unique offerings to any group, and these have been totally destroyed in Velious and IMO hurt the most. <BR>Solution:<BR>Bash should still have a *****CHANCE**** of interrupting giant type mobs.<P>Problem: LH<BR>It just doesn't heal enough anymore and takes too long to refresh. LH isnt what it used to be past 50.<BR>Solution:<BR>Increase LH's refresh rate...its 85-90 mins at the moment, make it 50-60 mins at level 60. <P>Tanking<BR>Woah, if your not a warrior, rogue or monk you might as well leave and go back to sebilis. Any mob that is unslowed cannot be tanked by anyone but the above 3 classes due to their fast refreshing defensive disciples. Even slowed mobs are tough these days. The hp bonus we get, counts for naught when you are fully buffed everyone has almost the same hps anyway. Classes with the higher defensive skill caps (warriors, monk, rogues) rule in expansion and here I mistakenly thought we were the second best tanks. I still get owned with 1100+ ac and 4700+ hps in seconds with normal YARD TRASH mobs, forget about the boss type mobs. I feel sorry for the majority of EQ suscribers who after getting sick of the Eastern Wastes decide to try to move on to the newer lands and find that unless they are in a uber guild there really is no point.<BR>Solution:<BR>The damage is done here, and its more widespeard than just hybrids. Casters are also practically useless here, its all melee and clerics. Maybe remove that useless resist disease buff from test (only fought one mob where I thought it worthwhile to buff resist disease in my 2 years of playing this game) and give us a FAST casting self only heal. Make it a really bad mana-hp ratio I dont care, but give it the casting time of the yaulp line. It will allow us to tank mobs while healing ourselves at the same time. <P>Before anyone responds there are still great things about the paladin class, I have focused on the negatives and the outstanding paladin issues on this post. While I doubt any of these issues will be solved I just want Verdant to be aware of the issues confronting the paladin class. <P>Sludig<BR>Level 60 Crusader<BR>Night Masks<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Beldukil and I am quite happy with most of the changes that are on Test.<P>As for holy forge.  You guys have changed it twice now and it is still the most useless disc yet.  Just remove it please.  All it does is depress me a lot.  Other than that I think you are on the right track with hybrids.  Additions like divine strength, and the new ranger stackable buff are a great step forward.  I don't want pure melee discs.  I want unique one like have been given on the most part.  Also the proposed change with melee spellcasting is a great job.<P>I am glad to see you recognize certain problems in the hybrid game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
