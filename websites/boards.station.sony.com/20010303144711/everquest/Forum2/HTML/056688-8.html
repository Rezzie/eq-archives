</FONT><HR>I think someone should get a systematic way of finding out the answers kind of like the scientific method.  Form a hypothesis - There are many hypothesis out there so start on ONE of those and then - Collect data - Get as much data on everything that would be involved as possible then - Experiment - Do all experiments that could be thought of to either PROVE or DISPROVE the hypothesis.  This way, you could eliminate certain things which would make the a bit easier.<P>So far, what I personally think, is that this whole "Lets say the dictionary to every NPC" thing just wont work.  I mean, cmon.  Do you really think Verant would expect players to sit there and feed words into NPC's spending coutless hours doing so?  I highly doubt that and I dont see that as being any sort of a fun puzzle.  If anything, there should be a clue somewhere of what to say if that is what is needed.  A key word should be given by some NPC or another.  I would hold back on continuing this for a while untill other options have been explored.<P>I do believe that the plane has to be done in sections and a speciffic order.  Perhaps the first room you come into is one puzzle.  After that is complete, you get an item that is used to start the next.  I dont see much interdependence on the puzzles but there might be some.  I suggest going to the beginning and do all your initial experimenting there first.<P>I believe that once the zone is cracked, it will lead to the "real" PoM and this is just a gateway...A test if you will.  This stuff has been said before but Im just re-stating it because it seems to make the most sense out of everything.<P>The cards may be the key to each puzzle.  We DO know that the cards are a key factor so work with that.  Try to get a list of which MoBs have the reputation of dropping which cards and use only those dropped in each "section" ONLY in that section.  I dont see this zone as being a "run through it, collect all the cards, then give them to someone to pass"  It seems more complex than that.<P>Bristlebane I think is the last puzzle to figure out, the ultimate goal of this zone I think is to find the Cazic Thule (I think thats the missing one, sorry if Im wrong but you know what I mean) puppet and get that to BB himself.  After that has been done, the real PoM will be shown.<P>Well, thats just my thoughts.  After reading this entire thread and following it a few times a day, this is the stuff that seems most reasonable...Though, I always have a very good chance of being wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Irontail --<P>I was on Allakhazam's site and he spoke of new NPC's who are tlaking about the Realm of Heroes.

</FONT><HR>This is a partial repost ... regarding the new NPC's ...<P>******* REPOST *******<P>I dont suspect the gem thing becuase the nPC says that Bristlebane took back the gem .. but anything is worth a try at this point 8-(<P>You say, 'What lovely treasure is that?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'A lovely gem, far more beautiful than even the most delicate and fury feet of a halfling lass! It was larger than my face, and sparkled more than the most pure of Jumjum catching the rays of Karana's blessed skies! Indeed, it was a divine treasure to behold. . . but little then did I know that such a treasure truly belonged to the King of Thieves. . . and merchants himself! But no, such truths still would not have [stopped me]! <P>You say, 'So, what did stop you?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahh ha! I was not stopped, and the gem was mine! Right from beneath the arms of Bristlebane himself did I take it! That was when he noticed me. . . and that is when I was taken from the humble life of a merchant and placed within the glorious [realm of heroes]! Of course. . . Bristlebane took back the gem. What a shame. Indeed, quite so. <P>8-(<P>Bristlebane took back the gem. What a shame. Indeed, quite so. <P>**************************<P>What I didnt mention is that I did give one of every type of gem I could find or buy including most of the Imbued Gems I could buy to Fenj ... no answers .. hehe. But if someeone want to come up here and kill him b4 the next server reset they should find about 3k worth of gems on him .. hehehe.<P>Also as far as the Dictionary concept .. the only real thing Im trying to do there is to eliminate any possiblility that there is an activation word ... like "lost" or "forgotten" or "hero" or "jester" or "joker" or "crazy" or "black" or "white" or .. just about anything that actually might make sense could be an activation word that while 200k ppl up here would find accidently ... as so few ppl are here atm ... Im trying everything possible.<P>As far as the stages being done first, second, third ... I dont disagree that this may b a possibility ... but Im sort of out of ideas to try on the little guys out front 8-(<P>There might b 5 puzzles out front as I can see it ..<P>1 - The little halfling Ritta being chased by the bee (she screams for help .. saying the bee is after her and going to get her .. then when she gets to the other end of the zone ... she tells the bee .. that was fun lets keep playing this game and runs off screamming again ... The bee will not assist her when attacked, but follows her where ever she goes around the zone including when being pulled) ... I know this is a puzzle, but it seems very small by compairison to the rest of the zone, and everyone who comes .. tries to do something with her .. so I have not put much energy into her.<P>2 - The "poddle dops" and the "NOT poddle dops", etc .. a whole bunch of misc mushroom ppl that are all static and drop squire cards. Not really sure what to do with them 8-(<P>3 - The halflings and the chest in the forest ... also interesting .. but not sure what I can try that we havent already tried yet. 8-(<P>4 - The guards on the castle walkway .. only wandering NPCs that assist anything that can get near them and each other .. "My Finger" and "Not Yours" ... 2 hand models that walk the ledge. "My Finger" is a large hand model and "Not Yours" is a small hand model that follows the big one back and forth.<P>5 - The trees ... a few (Very few) are actually smaller then the rest of the forest .. Most trees and sky and walls in the forest claim "you can not reach that from here" as if something is clickable out here ... this is why Im having a hard time finding the exit that was pointed out .. cause everything claims it's clickable.<P><BR>Although I agree that each of these migh be small puzzles to them selves .. Im not of the thoughts that they have to be done in order, mainly cause once you get inside you, there is not real direction to go ... there are many portals that lead back and forth to each other and seem to cross over all over the place .. and as such would be very hard to do in a linear pattern type of puzzle that you got from A to B then to C.<P>Anyways .. once we get NPC's marked out and pictures of every NPC in the zone, it will make alot more sense . 8-)<P>Also I didnt try to dispell the white stallion .. great idea .. I will today . 8-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nirah, throwing a dictionary at the NPCs is pretty much like putting a jigsaw puzzle together with the picture face down. It is not fun, but it will probably work if anything will.<P>As to a scientific theory and hypothesis goes, I am sure that is agreat idea, but with nowhere to even begin that makes it real tough.<P>I still stick to my first thought way back when.<P>It's broken and the means of testing it are not showing the problem, so nothing is getting fixed.<BR>(Please prove me wroong, I beg of you!!!
