Tell me what needs balancing for bards. You may as well give me bugs and broken stuff too. But my focus is going to be on things that are needed to move bards closer to 'balanced' in the game. This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one.<P>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine with that too.<P>Please, be detailed where you need to. Try to avoid abbreviations, my simian mind can't decipher many of them.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here's my 2CP.....<P>My main charater is a Bard.  I am not a "power gamer" and therefore, after only having had EQ for 6 months I have just recently ding'd to LVL 21. most of the issues addressed are for Higher levels and that's fine.  I would like to think that my higher level bretheren are building a more enjoyable world for me. However, I would like to point out that while some people feel that the lvl 20 mana song is useless, I personally think it's a great addition to the game. In their early 20's I've found bards to be at an "awkward" stage where their melee is awful, and their songs not entirely helpful.  What better way to help out your group than giving your cleric faster mana regen??<BR>   Also to address "auto-twisting" (i.e. Not having to manipulate hotkeys to play multiple songs at once)  I think this is BS.  Part of the challenge of playing a bard is mastery of this skill.....AS A PLAYER.  I for one am proud of my low-level ability to keep 4 songs playing at once, simply based off my Real-life coordination, and timing my songs according to their duration.  I'm very sorry if others feel that this skill is "boring", or too hard to master.  Fine. Play an enchanter or a wizzie if it's too challenging. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One of the things that bugs me being a bard on Bertoxx is looking around at people in Karnors or Old Seb or wherever I play I see people with Epic quest weapons.  Mostly clerics as everyone wants their guild cleric to have this weapon.  But Ive seen people now bearly 50 with their quests complete.  The Epic Quest for Bards was made WAY too hard!  <P>1) The competition for Naggy/Vox scales is extremely high!  There is very little chance Im going to win the roll when around 20 other people want to roll on these scales.<P>2) If I level too much I can no longer go on Naggy/Vox raids that leaves me with near unkillable mobs that no one wants to mess with Gorenare and I forgot the red dragons name.  Still there is gonna be competition between who gets the scales because I certainly cant solo these guys.<P>3) Killing Trakanon this I think is easy to understand.  What other class in the game has to do something so complicated as to kill Trak?<P>When this quest was put together bards must have been thought to be some sort of Dragon Slayers! Those three dragons being the top nasty ones but then there are the Three wurms or drakes for the second page although this part isnt all that hard.<P>I know this quest is supposed to be hard and complicated but at this level of difficulty the quest is near impossible.  There is NO bard wielding their epic on Bertoxx to date that should tell you that the quest itself is far too hard.  Please fix the quest!!  I would really like this sword but there is no way I can obtain it or any other bard for that matter. (not to mention there are better things out there nowdays)<P>That does bring me to anouther point.  There really are quite a bit of good weapons out there for every class except Bard.  I see every sword wielding class can use a wurmslayer except bards so almost every tank I see is using one, however, thier offhand weapon can be any that the choice in a huge selection.  As I and many other bards Ive seen are not very rich you usually see is with Ssoy or something else we have before we can afford a real weapon.  I personally like the low dmg very low delay weapons we get but there are so few of them that the ones that do drop like Sionachie's Partisian now can cost ya up to 12k.  Or symphonic saber that Ive seen go for 30k on Bertoxx.  The lack of selection is driving us bards broke.  It is possible to make some of these weapons that are warrior only or rouge only or ranger the people that seem to get them most Bard usable.<P>Also, I have obtained Shield of Songs and found that it doens't stack with other songs well.  When Playing shield it overrides Niv's Melody of Preservation and all resistance Buff songs that Ive tested it with.<P>And on a final note I would like to note that ALL hybrids or tanks recieve reposite and parry at mid to low lvls.  Bards get them at 53 and 58?  Any good reason why?  We already have naturally low Hp and Ac do we not need these things then?  Also ya know the dodge that caps at 125 is nice oh LOL Forgot to mention when we do get parry and rep it caps at 75.  Take a look at other hybrids defenses and think Balance please.<P>I think that is it ATM.  Hope I help with some suggestions and bring some light to the need of bardic balance.<P>Lalia Starsong<BR>51 Minstrel<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the More Powerful Songs vs. Melee debate...<P>Why can't we have a little of both?<P>What I'd like to see on the Test Server tommorow (or whenever):<P>-Haste Songs will now stack with both items and spells. The Ervaj line has been changed to it's original Mana Drain.<BR>-Bard Songs have been made more universially stackable. For example, Shield of Song will now stack with Nivs and other such songs.<BR>-Selos Accelerando and Selos Song of Travel and SoW (And other druid/Shaman Movement increasing spells) Now Stack<BR>-Regen Songs now stack with Regen spells when played. No More turning off Cantana so the Enchanter can cast C2, no more turning off Hymn of Restore so the Druid can cast Pack Regen, etc.<BR>-Bard Mez and Snare now stack with other classes Spells, Such as the Necro Darkness, etc.<P>And on the Melee Side:<P>-Riposte and Parry Caps have been doubled, and thier attainable level bumped down by 15 levels apiece.<BR>-A Small Double attack has been added at 75 at level 52<BR>-Walthin Fireweaver now gives a quest for a mid-level Bard Weapon<BR>-The Effect on the Melodic BP is now permanent Selos Accelerando as played on a Normal Hand drum by the Bard wearing the BP. If you wish to go faster, Playing Accelerando or Travel on a higher level drum will overwrite this effect.<BR>-A Drum-like Animation has been institued for all Percussion Instruments<P>And on the Armor/Weapons Side:<BR>-Many Plate items and Weapons that had the Bard Tag left off them have had them added.<BR>-Many Bard-specific armors that were mistakenly assigned chain AC have been bumped up to Similar Paladin/SK Hybrid Armor AC Levels.<P>And a New Song Line:<BR>-Tavern Teleport. Check your local Tavern to find the Song Scroll you need.<P>----<P>Of course, This could just be me being crazy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Dalakar Daystar<BR>Bard of Passion<BR>Tarew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just thought of something the other night that is actually balance related and effects more classes than just the bard.  Here was my train of thought.  Please comment on it if you get down this far, Absor, (I wouldn't blame you if you didn't)<P>1.  Ok, once all the classes are balanced, they should be getting the exact same xp for kills, right?<P>2.  It seems to me that you are factoring pet/charmie power into the 'balance equation', am I right?<P>3.  Then why do pets/charmies take some xp on a kill?  Isn't this like the hit that hybrids were taking for their spells?<P>Hope you have time to respond!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I can't imagine anything that would cause more despair in the bardic community than for us to come out of this final tuning process believing that our concerns weren't addressed only because we failed to explain them clearly.  <P>(And when you have 200 people talking on one side of a discussion, it's easy to fail to be clear.)<P>If you want, we could nominate 3-5 respected bards to speak for us, so that you really could have a dialog rather than a rabble.  I would be perfectly happy to let bards like Kaearia, Thott, Ro-kenn, etc. speak for me, if that would allow you to dig deeper into the issues we're most concerned with.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One thing that didn't get addressed ever:<P>I think we should be able to start songs while sitting.  After all, we wind up twisting a lot; the ability to sit while twisting regen and manasong would be a nice bonus.  <P>Also, to the people who don't like the autotwist idea:  <P>I agree.  A lot of a Bard's skill is in twisting. However, some Bards have poor computers with bad connections and can't really afford to get better ones.  I used to have a 56k modem and a 200 mhz cpu with 64 mb RAM, and I could twist two songs.  Maximum.  Something should be done to ease twisting for lesser system Bards.  <P>Also, during downtime, the most efficient thing to do is twist mana and healsong.  I won't do it unless we absolutely need it because that is not fun at all.  I'll play mana with the occasional pulse of heal, or if we're really badly hurt I'll twist the two of them, but otherwise it's one or the other.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>A handy summary of my post: five reasons why and how a bard is not balanced after level 50 and what can be done about it.<P>The chief imbalance that bards have comes after level 50.  Kunark and Velious were designed to require "the perfect group" of a cleric, enchanter, warrior, plus three other of any class.  Dungeon crawling is nearly impossible without these 3 classes, yet I find myself less useful than a druid or a shaman would be in a group like this.  In addition, on multigroup raids (which nearly always have plenty of enchanters, clerics, and shamen), the only benefit I provide is clarity song and very, very pathetic melee damage.<P>Why is it that bards are so unuseful in these cases?<P>1.  Haste songs do not stack with haste spells.  We get 11 different haste songs, but the 2 that supposedly do stack require an instrument (meaning our only melee damage is from punching) and do not provide any noticably increased attack speed with enchanter hastes (most likely people are reaching max haste with just items + enchanter).  In addition, a level 60 (SIXTY!) bard cannot haste a group to a greater extent than a level 16 (SIXTEEN!) enchanter can!  (And the same is true of a shaman's first haste buff.)  If haste songs are supposed to be a staple of our class, they should be enhanced a bit, don't you think?  Suggestion: make all haste songs stack with haste spells, but not other haste songs or increase the amount of haste given by our songs.<P>2.  Healing songs do not keep up with the amount of damage and amount of hitpoints of Velious and Kunark mobs after level 50. When a cube hits my party member for doubles of 200 points, 20 points of healing just doesn't make the grade.  My suggestion: raise the amount of healing done by Niv's (level 47 healing song) and possibly also increase the amount of healing on Cantana (level 55 song).<P>3.  Pixie strike (level 28 mesmerize song) is still too resistable.  As an example, I dueled a ranger who is the same level as I.  He took off *all* of his magic resist items (base magic resist of 24, I believe) and I put on all of my charisma items (bumping my charisma to 185.)  I was resisted 9 out of 10 times when trying to pixie strike him!  I cannot dream of replacing or helping an enchanter by doing crowd control with this amount of resists.  Please reconsider the resist rate for this and song of twilight (level 53 mez song.)  Making any enchanter mez overwrite our songs would also be a kind gesture.<P>4.  The mesmerize resistant creatures in Velious have changed the dynamics of crowd control immensely.  Charm is the prefered method of crowd control in Kael and other such places.  However, bards cannot charm anything of significant level (it is possibly capped at level 55, but I am not positive about that) and charming takes huge amounts of mana.  As a bard, I could be incredibly useful for crowd control if I could charm giants deep in Kael Drakkel.  But I can't because of the level limit.  I would suggest that bards get a charm song at level 50 or 51 that did not require mana (so that crowd control doesn't require the bard to sit for mana regen!) and could be used on anything blue or green (so bard soloing is not a significant issue).  And while the programmers are at it, *pleeeeease* add no-charm tags to gods, major dragons, and any other powerful beings which are just like the no-mez tags on giants, some golems, cyclops, etc.  Charming a god is funny, but it isn't balanced at all.<P>5.  Here is a little known secret outside the bard community: in the course of battle, bards rarely get hit and raising defensive skill is nearly impossible.  But when we do get hit (almost always because of more than one unmezed mob present), we die nearly instantly.  On test server, you raised defensive skill on bards.  We are not a defensive hybrid even with this change!  Why?  A ranger is a *better tank than a bard* because<BR>1. a ranger can get nearly the same AC as us or even more because our armor at higher levels is chain class AC, <BR>2. rangers have far more hit points, and <BR>3. rangers dodge, parry, riposte, and have agility buffs along with a naturally high agility.<BR>My suggestion: make us the other hybrid that is good at *offense*.  Paladins and shadowknights make great tanks, but bards don't.  Below level 50, bards are quite effective at damage dealing and poor tanks, why not the same past 50?  Dual wield should be a clue we are geared for damage dealing.<P>Thank you for reading this and I look forward to good things to come!<P>Mellodie<BR>I wish that they could "call me Mello Yellow"!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's my reaction to what I've heard from Test.<P>Defense skill raised...<BR>Well, I personally wouldn't put it -equal- to warriors, but test is a test.  <P>What it DOES fail to address though, is our other defensIVE skills...Parry Dodge Riposte.  I really wanted to see those get consideration, especially considering that Parry and Riposte are capped VERY low, and the gap between their cap and the cap of the other hybrids is VERY LARGE.  I would like to see that gap become smaller.  We wait until post 50 to get both skills as is, and we STILL take more hits than anyone else (most all unintentional :P  welcome to song aggro) we could use the help on defense.  <P>Also related, our other miscellaneous low capped skills.  They REALLY need to be looked at, the game's now scaled to level 60, giving me a skill that caps below 100 and calling me a jack in that trade is kindof absurd (when the parent of that skill can cap at 200+...)  I'll accept worse in given skills, but I at least want that skill to be applicable.<P>Having success with a skill, 2/3rds or 1/2 of the time that the skill's master would expect success, is my suggestion for balance.  Bards get the skill later anyway, and would be significantly less effecttive yet the skill would be applied in a useful way so that bards could pinch hit, yet only to a point, in the skill's master's absence.<P>Breeze song - makes complete sense...from the standpoint of symmetry.  Continues the interplay between clarity and manasong.  Probably should've been added when Breeze was.<P>But, this is not where bards need balance help.  I've always felt that bards were solid low-mid, and I played them then with hybrid penalties, pre kunark, when Rubi was still dropping.  Now that there's more content and the penalty is gone, I think that they're perfectly fine pre 40, and I still enjoy bard from 40-50, I just understand that is where the problems start to show.  <P>50+, bards need balance help...a lot of people have put forward ways to do this, but it's simply fact that 50+ bards lose a lot of their usefulness to song stacking, song strength/resist rates, and the need for specialization in post 50 groups and take an absurd ammount of punishment from low capped defensIVE skills, while having most all of their miscellaneous skills go from basically useless to a complete waste of time.<P>In summary - <BR>DefensIVE skills- gap between bards and other hybrids needs to shrink somewhat (parry riposte dodge)<P>Misc Skills- need their caps raised so that they're useable.  See above suggestion<P>Song Scaleing- All our songs are scaled to a pre 50 world, they need to be scaled for 50+ play<P>Haste Stacking- This would improve our all around usefulness post 50 significantly.  We need more post 50 to do than mana.<P>I probably was repeating myself from my first posts here, but well, it's Bard Talk so until I see these issues either implemented or flatly refused, I will talk =)<P>-Nadira Andante<BR>Bard of Rallos Zek<BR>They're not Portal Campers, they're the welcomeing commitee!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First, kudos to Verant for making a bard class! It’s the first RPG in many years to take up that effort other than of AD&D and Bard's Tale (my all time favorite classic RPG). UO has bards, but I don’t really think they get much credit for their effort (or lack of). I think this class is my most favorite class (in general), and look forward to it when a game actually matches my expectations (you were on the right track, but not quite there) I also applaud you with coming up with song stacking/twisting, which I will say is very revolutionary (if not totally realistic <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>1) Give us an official list of which songs/spells were not designed to be stacked with other songs/spells. This should be public knowledge at Verant (I won’t speculate if it is), and should be given to players as well. I doubt this lack of knowledge could be considered a bonus, although figuring out the _first_ time *might* be considered fun. At least give some in-game documentation of what the songs/spells do, like a description. I know there is a lot of web pages that have most of this information, but c’mon Verant, this should have been here since day 0.<P>2) Give us more song slots(10)! 8 is woefully inadequate (am I alone here??). I know this was “cast in stone” by Verant, but so were a few other things that have changed lately, so please add this to the list. Consider that all other casters typically just get spell upgrade, and can buff and then remem other spells with minimal trouble. If you need to, I will give an LONG winded reasoning behind this, but simply put, bards are playing far more roles than other classes in a group from moment to moment, and need more flexibility that any other class. Considering our mem time, changing songs mid-battle is not an option. Knowing what songs to sing at a given moment is challenging enough, let alone which ones to mem! Remember, we still can only have 3 of those songs up at a given time, but this would allow us to contribute better overall to the group. <P>3) Higher defensive skills, add evade and/or higher dodge perhaps. We should be close to the rogue in our defensive skills, IMO, and not a warrior. I don’t have the numbers available while I post this, so this might mean we lose some AC, as long as our ability to avoid blows increases some to help compensate (not necessarily an even trade).<P>4) Some of our songs need a larger radius. It makes sense to some degree that our battle songs require us to be close to the fray, but for the Selo’s songs it does not. This has been asked for fairly often, and I want to add my vote to it.<P>5) Adjust our songs to be more group/stack friendly. This may mean lowering their effect (say with haste), but have our songs stack with other effects. <P>6) Don’t keep giving us new songs with weaker/stronger effects, which would turn us more into casters that get spell “upgrades”. You have a good idea making songs scale with the players level, and I would rather see our songs adjusted accordingly than getting a new version of an existing song. The primary case is the Clarity/Cantana songs. <P>7) Make our damage songs stronger. Our combat skills are fairly decent so far as I can tell (I’m only 31 right now, so I will leave the high end game to those that are there). We certainly don’t do anywhere near the damage of the other melee classes, but I can live with that, so long as our songs are considered our primary “weapons”. <P>8) (Warning, wish incoming) Allow us to make some instruments. Even allow for magic ones if we get the right components. I would love a “make instrument” skill. If Verant thinks this would be too abused, perhaps they can add minimum levels to use these crafted instruments. Make the bonuses better/worse than the store bought ones, and you can control the maximum skill via level. I could argue that instrument making is a trade skill, and as such there wouldn’t be a level restriction on skill level, but this skill is more akin to gnomes’ tinkering that a more neutral trade skill.<P>9) Give us the correct instrument graphics. Strumming a flute/drum is a disservice to the bard class, and should be given a lot higher priority that simply “probably never”.<P>10) (TOTAL DREAM) Give us some real music for our songs. Maybe for starters make each “type” of song (based on the icon?), have different melodies. This might be asking a bit much, but I’ll gladly trade in our nice flashy light display (which I never turn on) in for some nice tunes. This could get tricky, but I would be cool if two songs that don’t stack have music that clashes <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>11) I personally, would gladly give up my plate mail, which has no place on a bard’s body IMO. We should have been a chain class (or leather even), and given higher damage avoidance (akin to rogues), as well as a lower agro effect on a mob for our songs. I know I have probably earned the hatred (or at least disdain) of many an EQ bard by this position, since most are clamoring for higher AC. (This is my primary complaint of non-realism about this class and how Verant designed it)<P>12) If I assume #11 isn’t going to happen, I can’t think of what else that would balance us, in relationship to other classes, since we are for the most part a unique class, and using our own set of rules. I think that the “no-mana/lower power” argument is misunderstood, and that we cannot be compared at that level with other casters. We get to have at most 3 song effects active at any one time (those with 4 I applaud your cash flow, if not your sensibilities <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">). All other casters can have a lot more spells active at one time, be they DOTs, buffs, and/or debuffs. This should be given a much larger consideration IMO, regardless of the “no mana” cost. <P>Bugs:<P>1) Fix the known bug with spells failing to take hold while a certain bard song is active. I doubt this is the intended behavior. <P>2) Fix the song ends/starts/ends bug. This is definitely not a “minor” bug, and I think that Absor just wasn’t aware of the frequency of this bug. It happens several times an evening for me, and mostly due to lag I would suspect. <P>Well, this is my longest post ever, and I hope at least someone got this far <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thank you for your time.<BR>Mithrus Wulfsong<BR>Bard of 31 seasonings<BR>E’ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>A little about me first: I play at the higher level end of the spectrum on Torv and am generally a very happy bard (except when asked to play manasong during CC). My bard is my primary, although I do play other characters. I play in groups and I do not solo for XP, being a highly social player; and so I admit that my view is tainted towards this style of play.<P>First to address the Test changes:<P>Defense cap: I totally disagree with the raise. Firstly, it's usually a moot point for bards at higher levels (We aren't being continually struck unless it's all gone really pear-shaped). Secondly, I in no way feel that a bard (someone who's speciality is after all singing) should have the same cap as a warrior (focused combat class). Pallies and SKs are defensive hybrids, while I see bards as ideally being more balanced in offense/defense. We simply don't deserve the increase.<P>The decrease in mana-song to 20th: In some ways this will assist bards in getting a group. On the slightly negative side, it turns us into mana batteries 12 levels earlier; and if there's one thing we hate it's: 'Play mana song'. During the early 20's we are very fine crowd controllers, but by around 28th this is fading into a secondary roll, so another focus for the level range 27-31 might be a good idea (As a class we definatly go through development phases). Lowering manasong to 27th might do that, or you could choose to enhance other bard abilities in that level range, giving bards another interesting tempoary niche. <P>Ok. Now moving on to an important point...the logic behind any changes and our class. This is wholly my perspective on the bard class and is essential to understanding my suggestions.<P>The bard has already been defined as a 'support' class, offering a uniques and flexible play style at the cost of a high skill demand. The main defining points of a bard (from a slightly RP point of view) should be that we travel easily from place to place, are welcome anywhere and that we enhance our collegue's performances by bringing out the best in them by focusing their attention through our song. We also use our songs to muddy the minds of or opponents and cause doubt and confusion in them. On a 'RL' note, bards are a hugely complex class to play, requiring a good knowledge of every aspect of game play: stacking, combat, crowd control, pulling, zone knowledge etc etc. Additionally, playing the class requires more physical effort than others. The upshot of this is that the bard should be a relativly good class due to the demands placed upon the player: Most bards are retired in favour of more 'powerful' (not nessesarily specialised) classes that are easy to play in comparison.<P>Now onto the suggestions:<P>Travel: Bards are masters of the open road. Our travel songs reflect this well. Increasing travel song range would be mildly useful. A 57th level travel song incorperating aspects of lvl 51 with ITU function might be nice, but might well be unbalancing. My main suggestion is that you look at the way the 51st travel song works. I am aware that all buffs that suffer partial failure cause the whole buff to drop and this is 'working as intended', but this is can cause parties huge problems (and downtime due to corpse finding and rezzing before they even get to their hunting grounds)... a strung out party member is aggroed by an invis seeing creature, looses speed, levitation and see invis immediatly and thus falls behind the party (possibly taking hefty falling damage too) and has a very high chance of death before the party can react. Would it be possible to cause this song to cast 2 or more 'seperate' buffs per pulse, with the invis being a seperate componant, the breaching of which does not cause speed failure etc. Make the new varient untwistable if you like to remove any exploits this might open.<BR>Secondly, how about a 30-ish level speed/levitation only song which operates at the speed of the level 5 song? Gives mid-level characters an interesting enhancement in a vital field.<P>Faction: An entertainer is historically welcomed almost anywhere, regardless of his own background. Storytellers were recognised as 'neutrals' due to their important roll of news bringers. If bards are to have any niche of their own, then this undoubtbly should be it - currently both enchanters and druids have less faction problems than us. I would like to see the 'welcome anywhere' aspect to be a high class priority. With the SoV expansion, you made faction an important play factor (good call), and it would be nice to see bards excel in the faction department. <BR>I don't know how you would implement this. But I could make a few suggestions:<P>A very good self-only faction song that us allows us to be welcome in most areas - unless we've really dumped on the proverbial doorstep.<P>A half-decent group faction song. Working the same way as above, but with a lesser effect, allowing a 'It's ok...they're with me' kind of effect.<P>A charisma boosting song.<P>A 'fiddling' of the faction system. Higher initial bard factions perhaps. Or maybe a 'fudged' faction system, giving bards equal faction hits but greater faction boosts for good deeds (after all...we'd make sure we advertised!). Not sure if this is possible to implement though.<P>Combat:<BR>I see us as a balanced, yet compatant combat class. I don't want or see the game logic behind massive defense increases. We don't have taunt, we are not tanks. I would rather see a mild damage output boost or similar as our melee damage is very poor. This particularly stings at high level where many of our buffs are superceeded by other classes and we sometimes feel that we are decidedly not a load-bearing member of the party and low on the list of choises for slots (Usually we're bought in to just make up the numbers or as secondary CC...certainly not for our combat buffs, snaring and slowing etc). I don't honestly know what to suggest. A slight offense increase? Backstab with a '50' cap (not too unbalancing..remember that we're already concentrating on other stuff in combat and that we are supposedly part rogue)? Double attack with a 50 cap at 50th level? Frankly, I was ok about our existing combat abilities (although I did think they were fairly poor), but with the large enhancements to other hybrids I'd feel we were loosing out if we did not have some kind of boost in combat (especially after enhancements to other's mana pools, with no change to ourselves).<P>On songs:<BR>It does seem that many of our songs are pretty useless and need looking at. Most of the topics have been discussed and I see no point repeating them here. <P>Haste:<BR>I do not believe our haste should stack with chanter or shaman haste, though it should be remembered that in later play stages, this facet of our use is overshadowed by those classes. Generally our haste songs are fine. Even on multi-group raids, a epic toting 'chanter removes our use as a haste buffer. The 5% and 10% haste buffs are a joke. Maybe if they didn't require an instrument, then the gain would outweigh the loss (our removal from combat and use of a slot in our twist pattern). Not requiring a instrument would also give us a useful haste-buffing roll in the afor-mentioned situations.<P>Snares & slows:<BR>These are really unreliable. If we want anything snared with approaching 75% reliability then we need to be only singing snare, and not twisting anything else. please, please, please give us a fixed or at least mean effect length boost. I obviously see that when there is are better 'slowers' in the group that we should not be using these, but it's frankly embarrasing to have people rooting mobs rather than trust our snares.<P>Debuffs:<BR>These have been well addressed elsewhere. Some need a serious looking at.<P>Other buffs:<BR>Resist buffs are great. Nice job of giving us a niche there. Maybe a higher level pure stat buff song would be nice, rather than resorting to a level 1 song or using just the stat buff componants of other songs. Cha buff song would make a lot of sense for the class and is sadly lacking (You could name it after me! =P). Seems strange that I have to get a troll to cast a spell to make people like me more. Regen buffs are nice. mana song is nice, but PLEASE give us an icon. It's REALLY annoying to be told to play mana song at least 20 times a night because everyone turns off bard messages. I don't know why there is no icon, but it's a simple fix that would for sure make every bard a little more cheerful. Any chance in a higher level (45th?) mana song with slightly (25-ish%) increased effect if used with a wind instrument - this actually makes them a little more useful and gives us another play option (also helps reduce down-time when there are no epic weilding types and we're grouped with either a buff team or rezz team).<P>Autotwisting:<BR>I'd rather not have my class de-skilled. Physical and mental demands and having to try to keep excellent situational awareness despite these chores are I believe fair payment in exchange for good abilities - as long as we get those abilities.<P>Equipment:<BR>Generally I'm happy with our gear, with the obvious exception of the singing steel effects. Food and water creation is fine, water breathing is fine, but the invogor, heal and zomm effects were very poorly thought out. We don't want anything unbalancing. I'd trade a limb for an effect like the ranger BP. Even summon bandage would be nice. Heck... summon rose so we could entertain people would be in keeping with the class.<BR>Our items are functional and also look damn good and coordinate well - something that is well in keeping with the class.<BR>BoH was a really, really good idea.

</FONT><HR>JackFetch,<P>Yes, there are circumstances in which a bard can be made to feel useless.  If an enchanter mesmerizes your would be pet, first explain to him that your trying to charm stuff, and the damage output you can provide is much higher than anything else you can do.  If he is using AE charm, there's really nothing he can do to keep from causing you problems, so time your charm so that you can break his mesmerize with punches (stop singing charm if you miss repeatedly, try to get your punch skill up to max) an charm immediately after.  This will allow you to get your pet, and keep it off the chanter.<P>If he gets upset, tell him that you tried to let him know what your playing strategy was and that he was interfering with it.  If he starts to get all huffy, tell him to find someone else and disband.  If you don't like being a snobby bard, your going to be kicked around into a mana battery role all your bardic life.<P>As for tashani making fufils useless, this just isn't true.  Tashani drops magic resistance by a fair amount, fufils drops it even more, and best of all, they stack!  Mixed together, this makes an NPC's magic resistance so low as to be almost negligeable, unless your speaking of a god or another extremely resistant (or immune) creature.<P>As for your point about haste being useless, I've never minded giving up singing haste for people if there's a shaman or chanter present, because there's more I can do.  The only time I'm so useless that I can do absolutely nothing but play mana song and melee is when I go to plane of hate where things are not just highly resistant, but their typically 4+ levels higher than me, which makes them even more resistant.<P>Last, you were saying consonant chain is useless if someone else snares.  Yes, that used to be the case, but it is no longer.  Chain is the best snare in the game, it doesn't inhibit other snare's or root's now, and it has about a 20-25% slow on the melee of an npc that doesn't seem to inhibit shaman slow's.<P>Under_Dog said,<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Some issues that I believe are invalid, or need info:<P>Desbarolis - Bard soloing is limited when they hit 15 to 30. I totaly disagree, I have been able to solo effectivly from 1-35. Not the entire time, but at each level I soloed at least a few mobs on my own. But I disagree with bards soloing in the first place.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Ok, let me re-state.  A bard 15-26 can not *easily* solo.  I don't consider bellow kiting an effective means of soloing, as it takes in the neighborhood of 5-10 minutes to kill a high green or low blue at that level, let alone something that will give a decent amount of experience.<P>Once you have consonant chain and fear, you can sort of kite, but the resist on fear is somewhat high (guestimating at 40%), with consonant chain having an unreliable duration ... and then you have to rely on your very poor melee skills to beat the thing to death.  If your going to fear kite as a bard, might as well team up with a druid.<P>gestaltmind said,<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Remove the need to twist.<BR>1) it is a 'twitch' video game skill not in line with the rest of the game (except trade skills which are very dependent on mousing skills).<BR>2) it cripples your customers (which trade skills also do)<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Play another class, this was designed from the outset to be like this.  If you remove the ability to twist from the class, we're just another caster, but we can wear armor.  How would we be different?  How would we be unique?  And besides that, I really like the fact that there's so few bards out there, and the reason that there's so few is because of how hard the class is to play.  I don't want it changed now, or ever.  What makes the class so fun to play is how unique and versatile we are.  There isn't an 'easy' way to make us this unique and versatile, and doing so would give us an influx of people who would still know nothing about the class but enjoy playing it because it's not longer hard to play.<P>You think I see it as an 'elite club'?  So be it.  But if everyone's going to think bard's suck, I'm going to enjoy proving them wrong, then laugh at them when they run off to make their own bard, give it tons of gear, then give up when they realize it's not as easy as I make it look.<P>I enjoy being good at what I do, I don't want people who know diddly about the class coming in and making me look bad like what happened with druids.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a little nerdy, but I think it shows why I don't think Bards are well-balanced in the 50+ game, and I hope someone will pay attention:<P>At low levels, Casters have power which you can roughly calculate as:<P>(M * D * E) / C<P>where:<P>M = mana per time unit<BR>D = duration of effect<BR>E = apparent power of effect<BR>C = mana cost per effect<P>Assume that Bards are roughly balanced at those levels.<P>At higher levels, ALL of these scale up for Casters.  Average mana regen is higher, spell duration is longer, strength of effect is greater, casting cost is less, so total power may look something more like:<P>2M * 2D * 2E / (C/2) = 8 ((M * D * E) / C),<P>or 8 times the power they had earlier.<P>M never increases for Bards.  Their limit is the amount of time it takes to cast a song, which never changes.<P>D never increases for Bards.  Thier songs all have the same duration, and it never changes.<P>C never decreases for Bards.  No song becomes cheaper.<P>That means that, in order to keep Bards balanced at high levels, the following equality has to hold:<P>2M * 2D * 2E / C/2 (caster) = M * D * e / C (bard)<P>where e = effectiveness of Bard song, which reduces to:<P>e = 8E, e.g. the Bard song needs to multiply in apparent effectiveness not by the factor of TWO that casters get, but by a factor of EIGHT.<P>They do not.  They scale up linearly by level, if that.  Some have additional effects added to them.  That roughly balanced things prior to perhaps level 45, although Verant watered down the balance by making dual mistakes:  1) making each component effect weak (because the song had multiple components) and 2) making the resists higher (because the song did more).<P>In fact, multiple effect songs have a lot of drawbacks, and are virtually never as good as they appear on paper.  The two biggest are:  1) they don't stack, quite often not even with other Bard songs that overlap in only one component, and 2) it is rare that all of the components of a song are used at one time.<P>This does not take into account two other severe limitations that Bard songs have:<P>1) Bard songs don't work if the Bard dies, camps, goes LD, leaves, or just wanders a little bit out of range<BR>2) Bard songs only work on the group the Bard is in, and can never be used to help more than 5 other people.<P>Bards can melee, but meleeing often reduces singing effectiveness and vice-versa, because many songs need instruments, while other songs require too much attention to be paid to targetting to allow the Bard to melee.  Further, the melee contribution of a Bard lesses in comparison to pure melee classes as they both increase in level.  This implies that, in order to keep Bards balanced overall, their total casting effectiveness should increase FASTER than the casting effectiveness of pure casters.<P>Bards have a number of advantages that need to be considered when counter-balancing things:<P>1.  They can sing on the move.<BR>2.  They are only interrupted if they get stunned.<BR>3.  They can sing indefinitely.<P>The first of these doesn't get any better as they level.  The second gets worse comparatively, because Casters get channeling and become better able to cast through combat as they get higher in level, while Bards never do.  The third is always a factor.<P>This is why I said, quite seriously, that Bard Bard party buffs should be BETTER in APPARENT effect than the equivalent buffs others can cast.<P>Verant seems to have a number of "rules" stuck in their heads when it comes to balancing Bards:<P>1.  Bard songs are manaless and hence free.  This is wrong, please read the previous posts in here explaining why.<P>2.  Bards are "child" classes and as such, the apparent effectiveness of a song should never be greater than, and should usually be worse than, the "parent" class.  Bards are NOT hybrid casters, they work MUCH differently, and this way of balancing them does NOT work at high levels.<P>3.  Bards have a wider variety of things they can do than other classes.  But things don't work out that way.  Why?  Because:  a) we can only have the same 8 things memmed as anyone else; b) we are LESS able to modify our songlist in battle than others because it take us MUCH longer to mem AND we have to sacrifice doing things while doing so; c) as we level up, more and more classes have abilities which overlap ours, and theirs are better; and d) many of ours don't stack.<P>Absent a couple of ridiculous suggestions in here, Verant could make ALL of the changes on this list and Bards would STILL not be balanced at high levels.  Verant really needs to think VERY CAREFULLY about how Bards ACTUALLY WORK if they want to pull this balance thing off.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm amazed at the bards that feel playing in a group with an enchanter is a waste of time. I love playing in a group with an enchanter. If you feel that your only purpose is crowd control, then of course you will have a problem. <P>It all depends on the group and the MOBs, but the only times I feel like a non-contributor are when there is some idiot in the group that does not know how to play his own class. Want some examples? Try a ranger who nukes. The wizard who brings out his biggest gun the minute he sees a MOB and then runs around screaming "get him off me!"<P>Sometimes it takes a little while to figure out the right combination of songs and strategies, but any group larger than 2 is happy to have me. There's always more action and less downtime after I arrive than before. Experiment a little more.<P>One complaint. When weapons "proc" during a battle, it sometimes creates too much lag. "Blade of Fiery Lamentations" comes to mind.<P>I do find it hard to group with just a wiz or just an enchanter. Bards don't make very good tanks and those two classes have no way to avoid damage once the crit starts on them. Even then, Pixie Strike will get the crit out of the way long enough for the caster to get a spell off.<BR>Tzinger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Balance...<P>Don't give us replacements, scale the songs to be equally effective as levels increase.  How many times more damage does a warrior do at 36th from 12th (Bards don't get double attack, kick, bash, backstab, critical hits, etc. BBBellow is our replacement)?  Shouldn't our songs scale that well?  Do other classes lose the ability to charm, lull, or mesmerize at certain levels?  Why should Bards?<P>If Bards are not tanks get rid of the Plate and move us significantly towards the rogues or monks defensive abilities. If we should be able to tank our HPs need a significant increase.  If we aren't a combat class, lose duel wield and improve the power on our songs.<P>Select a primary roll for Bards to play in a group or make them sufficiently effective as a second choice in several areas that groups will say things like (seeking enchanter or bard, seeking shaman or bard, etc.).  In a melee group that has no other caster (or maybe the only caster is a wizard) I am welcome every time.  In a well balanced group Bards are seen as a waste of space.<P>Group ability, foremost allow superior spells to stack with our songs or overwrite them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry but if you think twisting songs takes skill you must be paralyzed from the neck down.  Its the easiest skill to master out of playing the bard.  Its harder figuring out what spell to play when, and which ones stack.  There is no reason that we should have to mash keys all our lives.  I wouldn't mind if the auto twist thing only allowed two songs so you could do heal/mana in downtime.  Then there would still be an advantage to twisting.  <P>Still though, I think auto twisting is an excellent idea.  Also bump Parry, Riposte down quite a bit.  We don't have the HP to tank anyways, and frankly it wouldn't hurt anyone else's niche.  If the skills actually had enough of a cap to do something (say double), that'd be nice too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Mana song at 20 is a great idea.  I'd like to see more songs added, and haste stacking as well though.<P>Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My biggest issue that I have about my class comes from the lvl 32 mana song. Up until lvl 32 I loved the challenge of joining a group and figuring out the ideal 3 songs that I could twist to boost performance as much as I could. I couldnt wait for lvl 32 as I knew I could contribute so much more than I had. The problem with this song is that the puls of the song does not carry over for all 3 pulses as most songs do therebye making the song "untwistable" in that even if it is twisted with 2 other songs the mana song will only boost 1 pulse. At first it wasnt a problem as I would twist 3 songs and melee then ONLY play mana song during downtime. However... being lvl 46 now I honestly must tell you that in many of the groups I am in it is most efficient to keep mana song going by itself and not twist. I am not referring to jerk groups that tell me to just sing mana, not knowing all my other skills. I dont run into groups heavy melee like in my younger days that can take on vellious mobs etc. I tend to find myself more and more in caster heavy groups or melees with 2 healers at least. Therre are few situations anymore where I can justify not keeping mana song going solo. My old twists would commonly be a haste, regen, and slow/snare combo. These days I almost alwways have eaither a druid/ranger/necro,sk who takes care of snare or a shammy/chanter who takes care of slows and haste for me. I am not whining about songs because I can always find a song to make myself somewhat situation as I believe any bard can. The thing is the songs that I am left with dont often add up to the benefit I wwould give a group by keeping mana pumping steady. If you could just make the pulse on this song carry over all 3 pulses, I could pride myself once again on being an uber bard who keeps his groups buffs box as full as he can while still maintaining optimum efficiency for the group. We are Downtime destroyers and mana song is very key. I believe this one change would not overpower us yet would bring back alot of the fun I have been missing out on since my 32nd song was scribed.

</FONT><HR>Howdy Bards and non-Bards alike,<P>I've skimmed over the last few bard-talk threads, and read something that caught my eye.  I'm not sure who stated it (It's late and I'm not about to go wade through another hundred or so messages), but it said that levels 20-25 are the weakest time for a bard...<P>I'd have to say that this is COMPLETELY and UTTERLY untrue.  In fact, this is our strongest time!  After all, if you do what most of the smarter bards would do at this level (I.E., twist Hymn of Restoriation, Chords of Discordance, and Denon's Disruptive Discord all while switching instruments), you wouldn't need a group--You could just solo your way to 30.<P>About ten days ago my bard, Ensis Arament, hit the big 20.  Got my nice lil' surname, picked up my AoE Slow song, and ran on over to Lake Rathetear.<P>Now, a week an a half later, I'm level 29, and should be 30 by Wendsday.<P>It isn't a great accomplishment, but I'd just like to prove that I averaged nearly a level a day.  This was while balancing out school and work in my schedule, so I had a maximum of 4 or 5 hours to play per day.<P>Did I group?  No, not really.  I grouped once, when I went to the Lake of Ill Omen for the first time.  I vowed never to group at that place again... it was a complete waste of time, I could solo the monsters we were fighting, and wouldn't have to wait for the warrior to heal up, or the casters to meditate back to full.<P>Bards that don't seem to understand their true capability, and twink bards, have the strange notion that they have to group at these levels, and all other levels past 10 or so.  They think that because most of our songs affect the whole group, we are a grouping class, and can't do anything without a meat shield in front of us and a cleric behind us.  I'm just out to disprove that, since levels 18 - 40 or so is our peak times.  We can solo those levels... and probably higher, up to 50, through charm kiting.<P>So, adding a level 20 mana song will appease those who don't know how to use a bard to his fullest, but it isn't required, nor is it a balance issue.  I'd rather you take the enchanter's breeze away before giving the bard it, but that wouldn't be balancing either.<P>Sorry, just had to have a small rant there.<P>G'night fellow bards,<P>Ensis Arament<BR>Cazic Thule<BR>29th Bard of Veeshan<P>P.S. By the way... to all you bards complaining about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome... if you really think you're going to suffer from such a thing, then don't play a bard!  I don't see where you get off saying that you're going to get a disease in your hands by pushing buttons... I mean, I type, and twist 3 - 4 songs at once... I haven't felt anything wrong at all.  Then again, I just may be young, but I've been doing this since EQ made its beta debut.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
