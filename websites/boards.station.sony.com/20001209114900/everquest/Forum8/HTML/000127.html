</FONT><HR>The Gnome Tinkerer named Snik on the Cazic-Thule server is attempting to design a Gnomish Pogo Stick. He tells me that by removing all items from ones hands, and placing this in the main weapon slot, it will allow a person to begin to jump continously for an extended duration without loss to stamina. He says that so far his design is difficult to steer and has a tendency to go off in directions not chosen by the jumper. He mentioned also that stopping was done either by jumping off which results in damage to the jumpers posterior or is also achieved by running into an inanimate object, like a tree or a wall, which results in the jumper falling off and again receiving damage to his posterior as well as damage to the nose from contact with the said object.<BR>Despite these inherent difficulties, he feels that it would eventually be a good way for gnomes to travel quickly across country or to flee from creatures.<BR>He gave me a quick demonstration in Kelethin, and the last I saw of him, he was flying off the edge of the platform. I won't say what his parting words were, as they are most likely unprintable in this forum.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just read through the Tinkering list, some great ideas there.<P>The Coin Changer is just a wonderful idea, I would love it even if it charged a 10% surcharge (so 100 cp would tranform into 9 silver) and took up an inventory slot.<P>A 'Gem Cutter' that somehow enhanced a gem (most likely by enhancing it's sell value by 5-10%) would be difficult to code since there are so many different gemstones out there and it would be nightmarish to code them all in.<P>Spiky armor seems to be a common motif, and I  think that it would be very nice if it ran remotely competitive to Bronze / Banded armors and provided something along the lines of a permanant 1-5 pt damage shield, as with the Barbcoat Druid line as opposed to the 10 and 15 pt damage shields suggested in some of the submissions.<P>From this very list I love the idea of 1 chg self-only Gravity Flux boots that then follow up with a 1 tick Levitate effect (so that you float back down from your sudden accelation).<P>I also loved the idea of a 'gnomish pogo stick' that it armed as a 2 handed item and allows nearly unlimited stamina-free jumping.<P>This idea of movement-enhancing equippable gear could be expanded to 'gnomish finned sandals' that that provide a SoW effect underwater, but a Snare effect when on land (ever try to run in swim fins?).   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Some sort of 'spring' boots that have the effect of jumping everytime you possibly can at no Stamina cost are also an interesting theme, since they would have to be unquipped if the wearer wants to actually walk anywhere without bounding about (and possibly plummeting to his death in some areas) uncontrollably.<P>Wearable items with usable pockets would be interesting.  I know that we already have belt pouches and wrist pouches, but they don't really work right now since you can't equip a container.  It might be cool to have a special suit of gnome-crafted leather armor that included pockets for Size small items in almost every portion, from wrist pouches (1 small slot) and belt pouches (2 small slots) to pocketed trousers (2 small slots), neck pouches (1 small slot), pocketed sleeves (1 or 2 small slots) and a many pocketed vest (4 small slots or even 2 medium or 1 large slot, depending on how it is crafted).  Some silk versions might exist for the robe classes.  Naturally, a Gnome wearing this sort of armor would be sacrificing armor with statistics, resistances or a better AC, but some might find it worthwhile to have the ability to carry many concealed poisons, etc.<P>Exploding firewater 'mines' sound too difficult to code (since they have the whole duraction thing before the server regards them as a dropped item and the aggro radius issue), but 'grenades' that you can toss with throwing skill and do minor damage (perhaps even minor DOT damage as the 'gnomish fire' sticks to you and burns) could be cute.  There could even be a secondary check coded into the throwing roll and / or the Tinkering craft roll to make them causing the thrower / crafter to have a chance to take the DOT damage instead on a failed roll!<P>A 'camoflouging cloak' could be tailored with special silk from the reclusive hiding Drachnids of Kunark and certain mirrored trinkets to create a cloak that has charges of Hide.  Perhaps these flimsy silken creations would have only a single charge each, but be relatively inexpensive to make and replace.<P>An item that would be particularly popular would be the glob-blaster, involving special glues and giant spider web glands and stranger contraptions.  This large weapon would fire a sticky strand of goo at a target and act as the Snare spell.  Unfortunately it would only have a few charges before it jammed with it's own hardened secretions and had to be rebuilt from scratch.  (Kinda like a weaker multi-use version of the Wooly Spider Net or a very limited use variation on the Silken Whip of Ensnaring.)<P>The Portable Pneumatic Ladder or Folding Steamboat or even Clockwork Steeder (riding spider) would take up an entire inventory slot and function as the appropriate item when fueled with Firewater (each item would count as a 1 slot container, when filled and Combine is hit, it is replaced with the Ladder, Boat or Clockwork Steeder as appropriate which lasts until the creator right clicks on it (like a vendor) and 'loots' the original one-slot device off of it (sans the firewater, which is expended).  The 'Ladder' would act as a normal ladder but extend to several heights (determined by the distance present, not the caster), the Steamboat would function like a normal Boat, but travel faster and might be able to hold two small passengers comfortably and the Steeder would function as jerky SoW while ridden (bobbing like Levitate with annoying clicking noises, it might be a little slower than sow as well, perhaps ranging around 1.4x normal running speed and stopping for fresh Firewater every zoning (having dissappeared and reappeared in inventory as the folded up version in Loading) and pretty much ignore your own encumberance level.<P>Of course someone will see a Gnomish Wizard gallumphing along on his Clockwork Riding Spider and promptly begin whining for a horse of his own, so perhaps we should skip that one.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The Folding Glider would act like Levitate but fall down like Scale of the Wolf if the user is attacked (with possibly fatal consequences!), it would work when equipped on the back slot and would also be powered by something (perhaps fresh spider silks to patch the retracting wings), and would be 'unequipped' and dropped to inventory by a hit on the user (as if disarmed).<P>I see a similar mechanism for Clockwork Pets, ranging from 8th, 16th, 24th and 34th levels (exactly, not varying as with other pets, and all lacking Duel Wield) and requiring a bar of Enchanted Silver, Electrum, Gold or Platinum to charge for a time resembling Rogue Cleaners, Clockwork Tinkers or the Cargo Clockwork (but appropriately colored, silver, gold, etc).  Each would take up a full inventory slot when 'folded up' and remain until 'looted' by the creator or destroyed (which will be QUITE expensive to replace, so keep it 'alive!').  Who knows what sort of black metallic Minotaur or Drake-beast will be produced by some post-50's Gnome that must be powered with a bar of Enchanted Adamantite...<P>A full suit of 'powered' gnomish armor based loosely on the Power Gloves (perhaps they can be a component in the Class armor recipe) with pluses to Strength, a decent AC and perhaps some of the enhancements mentioned above (springing boots, or some sort of weaker Scale of the Wolf effect, a minor Barbcoat style damage shield, etc, etc).  Make it only wearable by Size S warriors of Brell (and not the size S/M Elves).<P>There is endless room for fun in Tinkering.  I hope that it gets a good treatment in upcoming trade skill enhancements.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the Clockwork pet idea, the item would definitely have to usable only at appropriate levels to prevent twinking.<P>Since you can't just set arbitrary skill caps on the pets, since a level 6 Gnome twink could have 150 Tinkering skill, one way to level cap it is to create a mob-dropped component for each level of pet that is No Drop and can only be Activated by someone of appropriate level, transforming into the actual (also No Drop) ingredient required for the recipe.  (Example:  The Vibrating Hammer and Vibrating Gloves transform into each other as an Activatable Effect.  In this case, the No Drop loot item might have an effect to transform into the No Drop recipe ingredient you need, but only as a one-shot Activatable Effect that can only work if you are at least 29th level.  Rather simple fix to any twinking or power-leveling fears.)<P>In this case, the only person that can actually craft the pet has an ingredient that only a person of 'X' level can have.<P>I mainly see pets as semi-permanant.  This pet would be costly to make and once created would be No Drop and fill up a full inventory slot as a one-slot container.  It is be 'activated' by placing a bar of the appropriate enchanted metal within it (or appropriate vial of Thickened / Clarified / Viscous / whatever Mana) and clicking Combine.  At this point the 'Pet Shell' container would close (and remain unopenable) and a Clockwork Pet would appear next to the user, functioning as whatever level or sort of pet is deemed appropriate for balance reasons.  Once you zone or camp, the pet poofs, like any other.  If the pet is actually killed, well, that gets expensive since you will either have to repair or completely replace the 'Pet Shell' in your inventory.  At any time, you can do /pet get lost or go invisible and have the Pet poof normally.<BR>Pets would come at 8th, 16th, 24th and 34th levels.  Each would be creatable at the next higher rank (12th, 20th, 29th and 39th levels) and would never progress beyond these crafted levels.  (Meaning that a 49th level Gnome Tinker activating a level 34 pet gets a level 34 pet every time.  It won't be 'more or less' green at any point.)  Since most pets are spiders or rats, no Dual Wield needs to be considered.  By limiting these pets in these ways, it should remove the clear balance problems that would result if a Gnome Cleric or Rogue could tinker up a Dual Wielding Pet of his own level to accompany him.<P>A cheaper disposable pet would be harder to rationalize IMO, since fitting multiple disposable one-use pets into ones inventory seems somewhat hard-to-swallow, even for a fantasy game.<P>Although mini-pets with no functionality at all, like Charlotte-sized 'clockwork spiderlings' that accept no commands and don't even attack in defense of your life could be cute.  Just critters to follow you around and look neat.  They would have to be fairly inexpensive to make to be worth the time of making them.  These would be fine to be made at any level, although they should remain No Drop and only creator-usable IMO.<P>A higher level version might even be as tough as a normal Rogue Cleaner (Rat) or Runaway Clockwork (Spiderling) and be just as much of a toy, but a miniscule bit more useful since it would be able to attack and follow pet commands, etc.  Since these critters are only somewhere between 1st and 2nd level (not the bigger Rogue Clockworks out by the Mino caves, those are up to 10th I think), it seems unlikely that they will be highly sought after for powerleveling gnome newbies...  Even if it is decided to have the larger 8th-34th level Pets be uncommandable for balance reasons (like Enchanter pets), these smaller ones might respond to various /pet commands.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yup.<BR>Maybe you could compare a low level tinkered pet with a damage shield. That's what an enchanter pet can be wieved as. Even so, compared to a damage shield, a pet can be killed (a damage shield can be debuffed, but not many mobs can do this). <P>I can't really see how a low level pet, doing 1-6 damage or so, not taunting, can be very unbalancing, especially considering the probable cost of making one. It will cost too much for a low level. (And face it, high levels helping lower levels have a billion better ways to do this than give them expensive tinkered pets). I think that if Verrant wanted to they'd be implementing balanced pets, it just takes a bit of work...<P>Or maybe they feared the cry: "Unfair, it's only makeable by gnomes!". If so, why did they implement tinkering in the first place?<P>Piip Ignatz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, I'd say make the pets NO DROP and only usable by a certain level character.<P>Mark I (lvl 1)only usable by any gnome.<P>Mark II (5th)usable by level 7+ gnomes.<P>Mark III (10th) usable by level 14+ gnomes.<P>Mark IV (15th) usable by level 21+ gnomes.<P>Mark V (20th) usable by level 28+ gnomes.<P>Mark VI (25th) usable by level 35+ gnomes.<P>Mark VII (30th) usable by level 42+ gnomes.<P>Mark VIII (35th) usable by level 49+ gnomes.<P>This means that while I can tinker the Mark II or Mark III pet at level 1, I still won't be able to use it and can't give it to someone else (since it's NO DROP).<P>This would resolve the 'unbalancing' problem.  Gnomes get a special ability, let them use it.  We are the best at really nothing and only get crappy ultravision (compared to Dark Elf or Ogre) to compensate.  Heck, gnomes aren't even 2nd best at stuff.  Make all the components not stack and only purchasable in Ak'Anon.<P>Gnome Mages and Enchanters and Necros already get pets, so it wouldn't help them too much and the pets are pretty weak for the level that they become available, so as not to make them unbalancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
