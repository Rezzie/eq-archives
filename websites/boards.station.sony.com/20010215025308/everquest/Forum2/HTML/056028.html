</FONT><HR>I sold a Wurmslayer in the EC Tunnel today. Unfortunately the person I sold it to was unaware that the Wurmslayer does not fit in any bags and requires its own inventory slot... Naturally the Wurm fell to the ground *WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF DROP CONFIRMATION* and was immideatly looted by a dwarf named Tagyerd of Questors of Moy that had taken a strange interest in my trade. A Guide respinded after a few hours and delcares that anything that drops is fair game.  So let me get this straight, you drop your wallet by accident and someone picks it up.. you ask for your wallet back and the offender says sorry you dropped it, it's mine now.. So you call the cops right?  only the cops come and say to bad you dropped it and anything on the ground is fair game... yea right. I even submitted a /report of Tagyerd saying he took it!!!  He openly admits to what he did.. is this not a clear violation of play nice rules?.. i mean heck forget a violation of morality.  In a situation on a non-pvp server (Cazic) where people literally CANNOT police themselves, Verant must stop this kind of garbage from occuring.  I certainly want to take matters into my own hands.. but how?  The thief is protected by the rules.  And how are people supposed to know that Wurmslayers dont fit in bags? SAD...<BR>Hope this doesnt reflect to poorly on Questors of Moy, for Tagyerd is only one member and they should not be held responsible.<BR>&lt;end rant&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Drewbles,<P>Since you did send a /report, I find it even more likely that there may have been a scam.  Did the person you were selling to petition and report as well?  Did the GM talk to them?<P>I would say that the slogan should be "let the buyer beware."  In which case, it would be up to your customer to do the petition.  You might want to send the report, and your own petition as a witness... but you should not make it your responsibility.  For one thing, the GM can't give the item back to *you* since you *did* get the money.  For another thing, it *could* be a scam where the buyer is an accomplice... therefore, leave it up to them to get justice if they seek it.<P>If I were you I'd offer condolences and offer to bear witness in any way I could, but hold on to all the money until you get word from the GM that the situation was resolved or unresolvable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Those dirty bastages, it was a scam for sure in my eyes. Why else would the guy take so much interest in your trade? He had to have known to snatch it up as soon as it hit the ground.<P>So here's my question. Say you get scammed by ****face and he gaffles one of your best items somehow cause you're not on your guard. Obviously it wasn't meant as a gesture of kindness or you wouldn't be screaming at your monitor at the top of your lungs. So what is ok for you to do in return? Can you find every monk that you know to follow him everywhere he goes and constantly train on him? Can you gather 14 ogres to stand around him in a circle so he can't move? What can you do? He F'ed with you, why can't you F with him? I'll bet that the GM's just pay all the attention to what you are doing wrong rather than why you are doing it. <P>Regardless of the game mechanics, a stunt like that deserves HUGE retribution. If you know what's good for you, you'll dedicate the rest of your EQ time to get that punk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Amethyt...this is not UO.  Not relevant.<P>Breathe_Rathe...this is not real life. Not relevant.<P>Hitpawz... Explicit retribution is not supported in EQ.  Any deed that was done to you was done because you participated.  If it was a scam, you were outsmarted.  No retribution is required.<P>Be clear about one thing... I would not play a character such as the thief.  I strongly dislike that the thief stole the Wurmslayer.  I sympathize with the victim.  But, I am strongly against having GM or guide intervention when it an avoidable player action results in a loss for that player or the interested parties.  If some sort to thing occured due to a bug or other unavoidable action then I feel it is appropriate for a GM to guide to step in.<P>So I don't have any argument with anyone would finds the theft reprehensible.  My point is purely along GM / guide intervention in the game.  It should be minimal and only under unavoidable circumstances.  The magnitude of the avoidable event has no bearing.  Whether its the loss of a rusty dagger or the loss of a level 50 corpse with full regalia... GMs and / or guides should not intervene.  And yes, it applies to me should it ever happen.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>NetProphet,<P>The other side of that coin is that many people would consider the item dropping to the ground a bug.<P>There are many possible solutions.  (1) trade is cancelled and item returns to its original spot (btw, this is another exploit... as mentioned in passing by another poster, people will ask to see a Wurmslayer in a trade window, then hit "cancel" really fast hoping you don't have a main inventory slot free for it and it will fall).  (2) item lands on pointer.  (3) Trade window stays up, with a warning showing up in chat box saying "You must have a space available before you complete the trade."<P>One more thing, though, for the original poster... the "no warning" issue.  It does, in fact, tell you "there is no place to put that!  The item has fallen to the ground!" when you complete the trade.  *You* would not have seen the message, but the customer would.  granted, it's not much... but if the buyer claimed there was no message at all, they were undoubtedly part of the scam.<P>And as a general warning, arrange trades in /tells, not in /say.  If people hanging around can know you're going to trade a Wurmslayer, you're more susceptible to this kind of scam.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The knowledge that the wurmslayer doesn't fit into a bag came to me when I read this post. Don't expect everyone in the game to know every little technical detail about every little item. Maybe all his bags were full and the only spot for it was in his regular inventory and since he may be a warrior, weight limits may not have forced him to throw it into a bag. I mean, Jeezus Christ, the fact that the stupid 400 pound spear thing didn't fit into a wrist pouch is irrelivant. What's relivant is that he was robbed by a player that took advantage of the game mechanics and had no regard for the "play nice" policy. The item should be promptly removed from the thief and returned to the person that it was legitimately intended for. <P>I'm glad I read about this because I know about a way that I can get myself jacked by other players and hopefully avoid it. I'd like to think that the wondefully supportive and dilligently cooperative folks at Verant would use the half second it takes for their minds to determine this was an injustice and GIVE THE ITEM BACK!!! Besides, shouldn't the trade be cancelled if one party cannot receive an item rather than it being placed on the ground for the rat snatching vultures? And doesn't it give you the message that it's going to be dropped on the ground AS it is being dropped rather than give a confirm box?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Amethyr, <P>First sorry misspelled you name in last post.<P>Second, even though UO is not relevant, I do find it intriguing.<P>I like the UO model better.  EQ is a bit limited it is tight restrictions against direct interaction between characters.<P>In UO, you could be killed by any other player and ALL your stuff taken.  So, the law and order in UO is more direct.  I remember when I was victimized, it upset me and I vowed to get retribution.   Sometimes that came in the form of getting friends or the slow deliberate planning of gettting powerful enough to one day return the deed.<P>In EQ, none of that is in play.  So you have few options:<P>1. Move on<BR>2. Petition and bring in an out-of-band influence<BR>3. Be clever and try to find a way to get back.  One must be clever because there are rules against many forms of retribution, such as harrassment, KSing, training mobs and all other forms of "obvious" poor gamesmanship.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is clearly covered in the rules and the guide book. Yes, the guides have the right to forcefully return any items stolen. The guide in question is wrong, and merely didn't want to deal with the situation.<P>No item should ever drop to the ground during a trade or disarm. Anyone who takes items dropped is exploiting the game, and is thereby grounds for a warning or banning.<P>I'm sorry to say, but you have no choice but to contact the head GM for your server. If they refuse to deal with the situation, then I'd advise the players concerned to cancel in mass. For Verant will be telling you that they do not hold up to their own agreements, and as stated many months ago, players can not steal items dropped in bugged trades or disarm.<P>Anyone who doesn't understand this needs to rethink moralities. This is not real life. Real life has no rules and is vastly unfair no matter what humans try to create out of it. This is a game, and games do have rules. The rules exist to create a fair environment that can not be found in real life. Grief players will always exist to try and disrupt these rules in order to make others suffer.
