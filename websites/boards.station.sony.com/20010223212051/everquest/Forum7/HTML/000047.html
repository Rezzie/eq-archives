</FONT><HR>Dear fellow EverQuest players-<BR>  I have a dilemma in which i need your help. I have created a character named Caution. This name was allowed by the filter over a year ago. Six months ago he reached the 2oth level and I choose a last name of Explosive. In order for me to get my last i had to petition. Therefore the name Caution Explosive was allowed by GMs. On 11/19/00 I reported a bug to the Gms. During this time they Now considered my last name inappropriate and proceed to delete it. When I repeatedly ask for a reason they refered to rule number 6. Rule number 6 states "Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin)." Since the words caution and explosive ARE relative to the game setting why was my named change? IF you think that that is all listen to this. When asking for a explanation of why it was inappropriate I was ignored. Since I repeatedly ask a gm for a explanation I was PROMTLY BANNED from EQ for 7 days. I am asking for the players of EQ to give me some feedback on this issue if they think it was inappropriate or not. Please all comments are welcome.<BR>IN addition this happened to 5 other friends of mine in the party that i was in.<P>	Caution<BR>	-30th lvl Banned De <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I personally see nothing wrong with the name.<P>Perhaps the GM’s consider that since it is something found in the real world they will not allow it here. Or maybe they felt as if it lacked the appropriate imaginary spirit that they wish to instill in the game. Or maybe even they are just jealous that they did not think of it first.<P>What ever their reasons are I feel the very LEAST they can do is explain their decision to you in detail. I personally find a generic response such as refer to rule 6, impersonal and inappropriate for a gaming environment that promotes a since of community.<P>As far your being penalized goes, I do know that the GM’s here are very busy people. I fully understand why they do not wish to deal with repetitive petitions from players. I am also aware that a lot of players seem to have little or no understanding of they work load that is placed on GMs and quite often are rude and discourteous when they do not receive the answers they want.<BR> <BR>I am not saying that you are one of these players, but your post does say that you repeatedly petitioned therefor your penalty is just. Perhaps in the future when dissatisfied with the results of your petition, you may wish to try alternative methods of communication in effort to resolve the problems.<P>Lastly, the thing I have learned from your post is if a player has a boarder line name, they should think twice about reporting bugs, or petitioning at all. Seems the reward for concern over the gaming environment as a whole, just may be a penalty. <P>Character name/s with held for fear of retaliation.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although it is not a name that I would have chosen for myself, it is.. well an amusing name. If it was approved once, well then I do not feel that it can should simply be overturned just because a different gm type thought otherwise.  Approved is approved.  I can sympathize though.  In playing another online game (text based game) I chose a name called Mojonaya.  I made the darn thing up, and I thought it was an appropriate name for a healer type who was trying hard to go with the whole witch-doctor motif.  10 levels later someone petitioned a gm saying that it was the name of a regae band somewhere.  Goodness I had never even heard of it.  And they made me change my name.  But yet there were people running around calling themselves things like Darapper or other Kewld00d types.  I was mad but well it is the way of the world that not everyone agrees.  So as cool as your name was to you, someone else in authority decided it was not so cool.<P>As far as being banned.  Eww that is icky, but they have rules for a reason.  They are darn busy folks.  Look at all of the things they have to deal with including all of the bug related stuff (which is what got you in hot water to begin with) So although not getting a nice reply from them explaining why things happened was not so cool, banning is sometimes the only way to get some people to stop being annoying. Next time, try e-mailing, it might work better and someone might actually take the time to write back.  <P>Just for giggles, was this character a wizard?<P>Setminka<BR>22nd circle Monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately, there seems to be no communication amongst GM's quite often.<P>Many times, like you said, GM x will ok a name, then sometime down the road GM y says, "we need to change you name".<P>From a game programmers perspective I can let you in on a little bit of advice we need to adhere to: "It is easier to give something to players in an online game, than it is to take something away". Once a name has been ok'ed by GM x, it should NOT be taken away by anyone. That is just asking for trouble. Now, I have seen some names I have petitioned because obviously no GM would allow them like Bigkak.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>IMHO, banning a paying customer from the game for a week [shudder: imagine the withdrawl] was a tough decision that the GM made and I feel certian that they felt they had adequate cause or they would not have.  Did you give them reason to ban?  Were you argumentative? Combatitive?<P>   I saw a character's corpse a few days ago called Yahoohotmail and I thought it was probably one of the best examples of a disgusting evasion of the rules I have ever seen.  That name flat out offended me.  <BR>   Now if I were in charge and had to weed out all the names that didnt belong in the game, wouldn't you hold me to be fair and go exactly by the rules so that I would be forced to throw out the Cautions as well as the Yahoohotmails?<P>    I'm going to be hated for being the devil's advocate but you all must admit that in EQ there must be policing and arbitration by the GMs to keep us from sliding down the evolutionary ladder into UO-ism.  With arbitration and policing there are going to people happy with a decision and the opposite as well.  Don't let it ruin your enjoyment, just take it like a man and keep on keeping on.<P>    I can't resist typing just a bit more.  You all must admit that the GMs have a difficult and unenviable job enforcing rules in a fantasy environment.  We are all basically out to have fun.  If they make a decision and you do not like it, appeal the decision with rational argument (like the woman said above, in email probably).  If that doesent work ask them to pass the request to their supervisor.  BUT...  if you start a thread to flame the GMs and incite revolt and unrest among players because you did not follow the rules and were busted for it than you are a WHINER! <P>   Thats enough for now I guess.  I'm just going to go put on my flame-retardant underwear and wait for the resonses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
