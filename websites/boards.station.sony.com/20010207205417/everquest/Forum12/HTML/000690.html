</FONT><HR>First of all I lets take a look at wizards as defined by Everquest.  I will post it here verbatim as a easy reference point and it is as follows:<P>Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals.<P>Balance Issue # 1<BR>Magicians can come pretty close to dealing the same level of DD a Wizard can at nearly any level.  Also a level 44 Cleric can outdamage a 43 Wizard.  <P>Solution(s)<BR>I propose one or a combination of the following solutions:<P>1)Increase DD of spells.<BR>2)Increase mana pool of wizards.<BR>3)Increase mana regen rate of wizards (naturally).<P>It makes the most sense to me that wizard dd spells should by far exceed that of any other class in terms of actually damage per cast as well as speed of casting.<P><BR>Balance Issue #2<BR>Wizards have no pet, no heal, no damage shields worthy of note, and harvest is only good up to a certain level.<P>Arguments to support wizard is out of balance:<P>1)Magicians get a spell granting HP Regen and powerful DD line.<BR>2)Clerics get Direct Healing and Good DD line.<BR>3)Druids get Direct Healing, HP Regen Line, and Good DD line.<BR>4)Enchanters get Mana Regeneration and Good DD line.<P>Mage and Chanters get a pet in one form or another potentially not only saving ones life but also allowing them to use far less mana than a Wizard.  (Supporting the suggesting of increasing the wizard mana pool).<P>Clerics and Druids get the ability to heal and Do strong DD casting too. (Supporting wizard DD should be far greater).<P>Wizards suffer on both HP and Mana Downtime.<P>One of the following paths should be taken.<P>1) Increase wizard DD spells.  I think they should do 50% - 200% over any other class of equal level.<P>2) Increase mana pool if increasing wizard DD is unacceptable.<P>3) Increase wizard natural mana regen rate since we rely more on our mana than any other class. (ie. no pet, no heal, no significant mana regen).<P>4) Decrease wizard spell cost if increasing mana pool is unacceptable.<P>5) Provide wizards with some sort of heal and mana regen ablity.  Granted this should be to a lesser degree of a druid/shaman regen and to chanter clarity lines and like many wizard class spells they would be self cast only to not unbalance other classes.<P>I realize high level wizard get manaskin which is a step in the right direction but it comes pretty late in life and is not as valuable as it should be.  At the level attained it should be around the power level of clarity.  I would venture to say for this line of spell it should be (wizard level / 2) giving the same level of power as a chanter of that level as a guideline.<P>Also Wizards are very weak in the early levels and rightfully so but in the latter levels we should have no equals.  I would say as an example a level 60 wizard should throw a DD spell around the 3000 level and the next strongest class a mage should hit for about half that for about the sama mana cost vs any target.  Their pet should make up the other half in some way.  For specialty DD like Clerics/Necros to Undead and Druids/Mages to Summoned they can about for about half as much as well but for a lesser mana cost.<P>To me DD is what a Wizard is mostly about.  I think the balance should be focused here since according to wizard definition our DD is our Defense.  These are just a few of the ways from my personal perspective as how the wizard class needs to be balance as in my personaly opinion wizards are the class that most needs to be balanced.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've played a wizard to 34th, a mage to 35th, and an enchanter to 40th (so far). The wizard was my first character, and after playing these other classes, I am left wondering exactly what "balanced" means?<P>It seems to me that Wizards are not enough different in terms of a clear practical benefit they deliver to a group as compared to other classes. Wizards have potential to deliver a lot of fast damage. This would be a clear practical bennefit if it were true for MOST of a wizards life. This does not seem to be the case as in order to survive an encounter in a group, a wizard is forced to space out the damage done. The primary goal of a group is to kill things, and currently a wizard does this about as well as other classes with DD spells but brings no other benefits to table (assuming the wizard has an interest in self preservation).<P>Perhaps wizards should be to allowed to cast at full throttle with impunity. Where another casting class would get the mob frenzied upon itself, the wizard would be relatively safe.<P>One thought as to how to accomplish this might be to allow a taunt to push the wizard below the taunting attacker on the mob's hate list (or something equivalent based upon taunt). While this would not help a wizard in a solo situation (which could use some help), it would help a wizard in a group, and let the group benefit from a wizard chain casting DD's or AOE's where other classes would risk death.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I agree completely with all the above. Why couldnt these ideas have been listed on Alans' Class Talk thread ?? (where are those threads located, btw ?) <BR>  One thought that occured to me is giving wizards a line of effective, low mana and low aggro stuns. It seems to me that this would help us in groups; and increase our general fun factor, by allowing us to do more in combat. This idea is probably second to the ones mentioned in the original post, but worth a thought IMHO. <BR> I really dont feel that the wizard contributes much to a group, and havent played my wizard in about months - despite him being my highest level character.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>they gave us the brain bite spell.used in combat can chain nuke quite well.although they need to make it less resistable.i agree that our mana pool needs to be increased.my equipment makes up half my mana at 52 and i cannot kill a blue conned mob.something wrong about that.i am now forced to solo lower mobs so get less experience.would like to see a wizard only mana staff in game.make it rechargeable.that way can increase our mana for a fight med then recharge staff then med more for another fight.oh well just a thought doubt they do anything good for us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, one of the first serious posts regarding how to "fix" wizards.<P>We do not need a pet.  What we need, is to be masters in our oun domain, and that domain is magic.  It should be natural that we would be able to gather mana from our surroundings quicker than other classes (and harvest, although nice, is not near enough).<P>We (wiozards) are more dependant on mana more than any other class.  Others have pets, or the ability to charm an animal or other mob to fight for tthem.  Wizards, once out of mana, are simply dead in the water.  Why should a pet class, that can significantly do more damage, be permitted to have as much mana / gain mana back as us, when truthfully, they do not even need it to the same degree we (wizards) do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Every class has upsides and downsides.<P>Balance #1 - Wizards are best magic damage dealers, hands down.  How often do clerics have the mana to cast their DD ??  A clerics job is to heal.<P>Your solutions:<P>1) You already do great DD's.  <BR>2) If you are constantly running OOM, you aren't being very smart with your mana.<BR>3) Group with a bard or enchanter.<P>Balance issue #2 - You mentioned what all the other classes could do, but forgot about the stuff you guys can do.  <P>Magicians - Don't get evac, TP, snare<BR>Clerics - Don't get evac, TP, snare<BR>Druids - hehe, you got me on this one<BR>Enchanters - Don't get evac, TP, snare<P>Solutions:<P>1)See 1) above.<BR>2)See 2) above.<BR>3)See 3) above.<BR>4)See 3) above.<BR>5) Group with a healer/bard/chanter<P>Wizards at high lvl's rock.  Have you ever heard of "lures" ??  They allow you to do damage to mobs that no other caster can touch.  Many boss mobs require Wizards to deal the finishing blow when mob becomes enraged.  Try going to Plane of Hate or Sky without a wizard.<P>Ever been in an AE damage group ??  Wizards can do more damage than any other class in game.  <P>I see too many people complaining about what their classes can't do, instead of focusing on what their classes can do.  Verant is constantly nerfing classes because people have class too much envy.  If you don't like your wizard, play another character.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Do you actually play a wiz Morphius? Given a lot of the 'facts' you point out, I question that if you do, it is over level 50.<P>For example:<P>&gt;Wizards are best magic damage dealers, hands down<P>Actually, at least 3rd, maybe 4th or lower *except* on mobs with high resistances. Under 50, the latter are an extreme exception and you can't do much about them til 44 anyways.<P>Your answer to everything: evac, TP, snare<P>First two don't do anything for an XP group for the most part, especially after 50. Snare is something that gets done by the wiz if there is nobody else around to handle it. It's nice, but is generally not necessary.<P>Lures.. nice, but they still get resisted a lot on the mobs they are supposed to be useful on, and with the poor mana efficiency they have it makes things even worse.<P>Been in AE groups.. they are nice, but, in general, they aren't really that much better than a really good normal group. And they are a lot harder to keep going than one.<P>&gt;Wizards can do more damage than any other class in game. <P>Hehe... On paper perhaps, too bad it doesn't work out that way in practice. Also, their are only a few circumstances where what you are talking about even becomes useful. Can it be done, sure. Can it be done on a normal basis in just about anyplace you care to name? Not a chance.<P>Why don't you go use your AE on say, the Guardian of Takish in PoG and get back to me on how useful it is.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000690&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000690&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
