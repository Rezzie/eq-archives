</FONT><HR>Four minutes went by from the time the boots were discovered to the time they were looted.  I believe the decay time is 5 minutes.  (please correct me if I am wrong)  Since people don't hit timers when normal mobs die, it was not easy to guess when the corpse would decay.  Further, the corpse was not noticed to be gone until the full five minutes had passed.  It seems highly likely NO ONE would have gotten them if they hadn't been taken.  Personally, I would rather have let them rot than deal with that sort of a fight.  It is a game about fun, no item is worth the game not being fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Firstly Dont put words into my mouth.<P>I left / step down from Servants of None leadership DUE to multiple things not any specific one.<P>Please dont speak on things you dont know of <P>Like I said.. I dont HIDE here.. I respect your wishes to remain anon here. <P>ANYTIME you risk one person in your group whatever the reason  your wrong   because that one person could be the meatshield/savor of another etc etc.<P>Second I did say to you on the phone that the 45th cleric pissed the 60th off.<P>the REASON you were coming was to hang out get xp and have fun.<P>christ man  we had a 60th cleric watching us and a 45th in the group. True before you logged in we only had the 45th  and really how good can a 45th cleric heal a party of 50+??? <P>anyhow.. we got the cleric 60.. you logged in .. I invited you.<P>IF YOU LIKE I WILL POST THE WHOLE EVENING.. I do not lie.<P>On the other hand.. your "story" of them DOES not match the log I posted. what does this say?<P>You go into how your older with family etc.. spin doctoring your name bro. when FLAT out you HANDLED the situtation WRONG  had the Warrior died and the paladin was next  and you refusing to heal him .. well eventually I woulda went AND that IS what of course concerns me. as you know once your CC guy is down the group usually dies too.<P>Correct way to handle would have been to leave the group and seek other hunting. THAT is what i would have and HAVE done in the past. <P>Imagine I said well .. i wont mezz no more until i get 100PP from each member.. be the last group id be in.<P>You talk about what happened before you were there as if you were. Sure the cleric pissed off the older cleric. I had a TALK to that cleric though and made her see it in a different light  at that point she said oh.. ok  and made amends with the 60 cleric.. BEFORE YOU GOT THERE<P><BR>So you want to show me your a man of honor..<P>Want to let everyone know you were not wrong.<P>Post your clerics name , If you were not wrong you will have no problem grouping.<P><BR>Im Gazz and thats how I see it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>opps, forgot 1<P>"Slayer97 tells the group, 'heal The-ACCUSED because i wont"<P>I guess you missed my complete heals on the main tank (not the looting 42 pally but the level 52 tank). Why? Because the 45th cleric didnt know what she was doing! Ask gazz!  That is the whole reason WHY they asked me into the group!<P>Also note:<BR>The ACCUSED<BR>45th cleric<P>- They were both in the same guild.  And prior to me coming there was a HUGE argument about, get this, LOOT! Turning of the Unnatural!  You see this group had a level 60 cleric! The level 60 cleric wanted TotU spell, the 45th cleric started an argument over it! Guess what, 60th cleric left the group BECAUSE of this!  Now 45th cleric remained (Gazz should have booter her!) even though she didnt know how to heal a 52 tank AND just caused a huge argument.<P>Remember, I knew this. I also knew this is why they asked me to join!  And upon joining I noticed that the 45th cleric was in the same guild as 42 pally (The ACCUSED looter).  This is why I freaked out! In my mind I see two things:<P>1) ***IMPORTANT*** 45th cleric was a PROBLEM for starting LOOT ARGUMENTS causing the 60th cleric to leave!  KEYWORDS: Loot Arguments!<BR>2) Pally/cleric item drops. Not a great item, not even a rare item!  BOTH me (cleric) and pally want the item. All assumed this! The 45th cleric did not want the item.  The SPAM from fights was flying (look at the damn log).  Next thing I know 42 pally HAS LOOTED THE ITEM.<BR>3) Since the 42 pally had less hp, I TOLD 45th cleric let me watch the main tank AND Gazz our enchanter, you heal your friend 42 pally.<P>Now come on. 45th cleric and 42 pally happen to be in the same guild. 45th cleric and 42 pally are obviously friends. Just 1 hour ago 45th cleric causes a 60th cleric to LEAVE OVER A LOOT ARGUMENT.  Now what do you expect me to think??? I assume "my god what jerks! Just 1 hour before they argue over loot. Now the other member takes loot without rolling!"<P>Of course im going to be pissed GIVEN THE IMPORTANT HISTORY that Gazz didnt post!  Gazz was mainly mad because (and you can see this in the log) his day was going bad, and at least one person in this group ALREADY caused loot arguments and caused a member to leave! It was NOT, I repeat NOT my fault things didn't go well.<BR>Look at the LOG! I was healing (so was the other cleric) in this fight spam! Apparently the 42 pally was concerned with PRIVATE TELLS instead of doing his job. And ultimatly he ends up looting the item, now TWO people in the group (and in same guild) have been the cause of a loot argument that caused players to leave!  And you think im to blame? LOL!  I blame Gazz for not posting the log in context  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"oh and Slayer blame yourself for the need to take this public ;0"<P>I never did post the 2 player names involved in the argument so I don't really care.  In fact I could care less about any of it because:<P>1) It has no impact on me in the game<BR>2) Its just a game, I (unlike others) have my priority straight.<BR>3) Again, I treat others as I am treated.  Idle threats and foot stamping dont scare me.  Once toons start paying my bills priority will change  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Too bad I dont keep logs, I could post some juicy ones myself.  But this is just a game, other than the people im real close to in the game, and other than the people who are nice, I couldn't care less about other toons!  *YOU* take this game to seriously.  I played UO for 4 years almost (even as a PK!) and yet, I manage to have alot of friends in UO.  The players I PK'd had NO IMPACT on me.  I played AC and had friends there.. Play EQ and have friends there.. In fact I can count on ONE hand the number of people who I had problems with in EQ, and I CARE LESS about them! Its the other 300,000 that matter :P  And if someone manages to piss me off (and I really believe I wasnt at fault, like in this case) frankly those are the jokers I dont want to hang with.<P>There is one reason to stay in EQ/UO, and that is your RL and close friends.  And its also about helping others (that deserve it). Nothing else means a damn thing and will have no impact on me.<P>One thing for sure though, High level in EQ seems to bring nothing but frustration and the fun level drops fast.  My cleric will probably never reach level 56 for my next res anyway, simply because I don't have 10 hours to spend on raids.  If I want fun I will play a lower level character.  If I want to help someone I will play the cleric.  If I don't like someone, they can make feeble attempts to blacklist me I frankly dont give a crap because this person isnt worthy of my time anyway :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alaira - Gazz is right that I have a hot head  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But in all honesty I dont have a hot head until something provokes me AND im fairly certain I am right.<P>A month or two ago I did make a mistake, and when I realized this (the next day) I apologized to the player and we have no ill feelings.<P>In this case that isnt going to happen because given the full context I believe I was right.  Did I need to fly off the handle? Probably not but thats "just the way I am" provided I strongly believe im right.  You cant teach a dog new tricks "im old... I fart dust!".  Gazz should know me well enough by now to know this wont change  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now the only reason I brought up real life is to say that this "personality trait" doesnt seem to hurt me there.  Frankly I find that although im at times "colorful", people appreciate the honest feedback.  And just as in game, in real life I will admit and apologize when im really wrong in the first place.  If I think im right, nothing will change my opinion EVEN IF it causes people in the game not to like me! Why? Why not!  Would I want to hang out with someone I dont get along with in the first place? NO<P>In the past Gazz has, IMO also done things wrong.  But I stick by him in any case because he is one of the reasons why I even play EQ!  I even follow him to other guilds because I would rather hang with friends than strangers (who wouldnt??).  For all the times I thought he was wrong, I still remember all the good things about my playing ability (I think my cleric is good) which were taught to me by him.  <P>Since our mud days Gazz has provided me with a pretty solid background on RPG's.  He helped me learn just about everything in EQ.  In fact I cant think of any better players than Gazz!  But when im faced with a problem and I think im right, I also learned throughout life to stand up for yourself.  I do it to the extreme! And I will also goto extremes for people like gazz if required.  Even if it means someone in the game will hate me!  I simply dont care because friends are important, in EQ you are a bunch of pixels and your game friends for the most part will be gone when the next game appears.<P>Gazz also backs his friends and me. Gazz is also hot headed like me (although he might not admit it).  Thing is, unlike me Gazz tries to resolve the situation without hurting EITHER party, and sometimes he does this with great success other times its simply impossible.  In this respect we just have different personality (and you cant teach a old dog new tricks).<P>Funny thing is in RL you realize this and just deal with it since not everyone is perfect (im not, gazz isnt, nobody is).  You knew that 15+ years ago yet you still keep going.  If EQ manages to make him stop grouping and dealing with me in game it is sad indeed simply because its just a game!<P>I do want to say that other than gazz (gazz is the only RL person I know on Karana... I do know RL people on other servers), I do have other close friends on Karana.  I group with them and we dont have problems. In fact even with gazz I only had 3 problems with other members to date (including this one) that lead to a heated argument.  We have had MANY MANY times we never had the slightest problem!  It's not like this happens all the time, so there is no need to blow it out of proportion.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I never mentioned any conspiracy of the left.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  I'm on the left.  There doesn't have to be any conspiracy to observe that parents have given up actually mentoring their children, and have delegated that role to TV and school.  Yet, neither of those educational or entertainment companies can teach morality, respect or discipline.  <P>Instead of getting involved in their children's lives, parents just pop in a video.  Kids need to be loved and taught and disciplined (and there is more to this than just punishing them when they are bad).  They delegate their role to day-care or teachers, when neither of those institutions are capable of providing either love or discipline to the necessary degree.<P>And I do place blame on the economic forces that encourage it.  I think too many parents have gotten caught up in the rat race and think that having more money will make them better parents, when in reality, the opposite is mostly true.  My wife stays at home with my boys.  We do without a lot of luxuries in order to benefit from the luxury of mom teaching my boys.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I would post logs too if I wanted to drag things on and on but there are two problems:<P>1) I dont waste my time logging everything because im not paranoid.<BR>2) I just created a simple small post and then dropped it until I get a log posted 3 days later  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>PS: I could see if "The ACCUSED" wanted to respond and post logs, I can't see why gazz felt the need to.  And he even posts it as if he is defending himself, when really he had no reason to defend himself because the post wasnt about him.  I guess some people feel the need to impress others in this pixel/toon based world, I dont.

This is the only thread I've ever mentioned the subject when it wasn't part of the TOPIC.  And that's because it was by you one of the vocal anti-druids, and is such good evidence of the monopoly.

</FONT><HR>Phelan42 - A simple course in reading comprehension would work.  Read the replies again and note that the looters friend/guildmate caused people to leave the group hours before I was even there.  Why? She started an argument over loot.<P>Also notice where gazz (in the log) complains about dying and getting a level 39 res. Whats this mean? He was pissed and the group was doomed long before I was there.<P>This is the problem with the log, it doesnt show the context of what happend hours prior to this.  Also note I have no fear of getting groups, it never was and never will be a problem.<P>So why did I reply to keep the thread alive after the log?  Because the log does not define what happened and is a lame attempt of someone to try and proove something for some wacky reason.  My life doesnt revolve around EQ so I guess you will never see my point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with slayer97. TELLS do not count for you to loot it. If folks were saying it in the group say, sure. But you got 5 min before anything rots, that's plenty of time to finish the pull and lotto afterwards. Btw the group leader should wait with giving lotto #s til after a pull, or tell everyoen to wait until its done.<P>Oh, and once THE ACCUSED did loot, I would agree he should be out on lottoes til everyone else got something.  Maybe he was told to loot it by 3 folks, maybe he wasnt' (we dont' have his logs).  That leaves 4 other people that didn't say jack to him (there's 8 people in the group).<P>Wyrd</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Either that or the pally was busy doing the private tells/responds while everyone else was fighting.  WE ALL SEEN gazz say roll. And I kept saying "wait", "roll" because they wouldnt stop so we could.  This is why nobody rolled. Now why the SK took it upon himself to tell the pally privatly to LOOT was plain and simply wrong because he knew I wanted it too (read the log closly, he even SAYS this to me).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Then you put your group at risk over a semi-common drop by refusing to heal a member of your group under any circumstance. You go farther in that you threaten to withhold healing services from the entire group unless they agree to your terms and that heavy penalties are applied against the looter. You strike out most harshly against another person for a mistake that you contributed to. You wished death on a person for something that was partially your own fault, and all of that was after everybody tried to make apologies and concessions to you. <P>To top it off you come here spewing about how much of a jerk everybody else is.<P>I don't care how you try to spin things by including statements about your RL, or things that happened when you were not even there(which have been refuted by a person who was there), or your personal bias against members of a certain guild. It doesn't matter how you spin it, you wrongly lashed out and demanded harsh treatment of another after your own mistake.<P>As to rolling after; rolls were asked for after, repeatedly. You did not respond. Regardless of the situation that brings some responsibility to you all by itself.<P>What really gets me though, is that you honestly believe that you acted in what is a perfectly 'ok' way to treat the people you group with. <P>Don't bother insulting me again; you know nothing of my in game play, or grouping style. We've all been provided a rather nasty example of yours, one that you yourself verified as true. I do not say that there was no right to feel upset; being upset is a natural human state, especially after this kind of mistake has occurred. What I say is that you created the much greater evil in your response(s) to the situation(wow, this really is the kind of stuff that you need to tell a child).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well... not voting for or against the poster... I had my own deal about 3 months ago.  I lost my temper, and took action to find out I was wrong in my assumption.<P>I died and was in the other side of Highpass, had to run back to the orcs.  we had just kiled the Orc that gives the Pack with 25% weight reduction.  They all rolled, and I rolled trying to make it back and won.  But someone in the group picked up that bag before I died.  By the time I made it back to the group, this guy went LD.<P>Well, I stayed for another Hour.... came back later.  Petitioned this guy, and told the Guide I didn't want to accuse this guy but it looked fishy the way it happened.  Had the others in my group tell this guy I was looking for him... and it took 2 weeks before we met.  I had sent a letter of complaint to customer service and tried to petition again in that time frame...  Then I found out this guy was in England, which is a 5 hour difference with US East coast...  He would never be on at night, cause when I got on around 8pm... it was 1am there.  And the only time I got to see him was Very early Saturday morning.  I felt like a jerk, and told everyone I talked to about this that it was a Misunderstanding....  I started to give a bad reputation to someone without knowing all the facts.<P>From what I see here...  Seems like there might have been something wrong...  But I'm not so sure the Paladin was all to blame in the incident.  Just to humor yourself, why didn't both of you Roll...   It's a 50-50 chance that he would have won.  What if he Won ?  The fact that he looted it without consent would have been mute.  But instead, you lost your patience and acted like a jerk... same as I did when something like this happened to me.  I won the Roll... you never did...  Did it ever cross your mind you could have lost ?  I'd be funny if you meet him, and decide to roll just for keep sakes and find out you lost in the Roll... what gives then ?<P>There were more than the Paladin involve in this...  You focused all your anger on one char, when it seems like 2 or 3 sent a Tell telling him to loot.  I've looted things at times when someone sent a tell to me.  I'd be pissed if someone would react in your manner.  Sometimes in the heat of battle, you don't have time to think... and considering that it was 4 minutes after the kill.... it was about to dissapear anyway and be lost forever...<P>Learned to chose my battles in life, and it sucks big at times....  but this is a battle you should have kept between you and your friend.  You'll have 2 sides here, and you'll only have a side putting you down for your attitude no matter what.  Is it worth it in the end ?<P>Oh well...  I just pray I can get 60 minutes of play tonight... got 30 minutes in the past 5 days...  THAT sucks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"I'd be pissed if someone would react in your manner"<P>Right.. now im still amazed at why 45th cleric wasnt booted for pissing off the 60th cleric about looting a ToU spell.  Course you dont see how gazz freaked out and argued with her prior to me coming.<P>You dont see the whole story.  The group had issues long before I came along. And gazz was pissed off long before I came, I know this because I was on the phone with him  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  In fact he even says this in his own log!<P>Also again, I was healing the people I was watching over (as the 45h cleric and I discussed), even after Gazz left. She was healing the 42pally and I watched 52champion and 52enchanter (gazz) as we planned.<P>I don't really know why im bothering (probably because im posting on work time lol), but you simply cannot see all the events of that night.  And even worse phone conversations arent logged. heh  This is the reason I didnt bother keeping this thread alive from 4 days ago until last night when the partial log was posted.<P>*looks at watch.. lunch time*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMG Slayer97, you have to be embarassed. You were POUTING! LOL. Sure I would have said something. I would have said, "hey, uh, I wanted to roll for that...". And then, "no worries" after the apologies. Maybe asked if I could have his roll for next item. I prob woulda gave him a /bonk. Whatever, it is a game. You pouted! That is priceless. No matter what you have done in your life, or what you try to convince yourself, that is pouting, and you know it (you have kids). Its also priceless that you LIST your life accomplishments and age here like that is a good thing! WOW, this thread is like watching a home video of someone acting like an idiot.
