</FONT><HR>Thanks Soluis.  Of course, such an idea would have to be gone over with a fine toothed comb to insure it could not be exploited.  For example you'd have to avoid "loops" where you could get infinite mana.  But still, better ratio and group type mana regen would be -something-.  I didn't create my nercro to be a support class, but if I am forced into that roll, at least let me DO it.<P>scr.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> The entire point was missed. Over the head...747 at 35,000 feet...wooooosh! Even if we wanted to be some miserable second rate support class, we couldnt even do that. Let me break this down so those of you without a clue will understand.<P>Necromancers can control their hit points(their life), Necors have masterd the art of death, and in doing so have gained more understanding of life. We can make our little red lines go up and down whenever we want. <P>A Necro can make mana(the magical force behind all spell power) for themselves by depleting their own health with spells like Call of Bones, Lich, Arch Lich, so on. <P>Necros can in turn decide to use this mana to:<BR>a) use it for an offensive or even defensive spell.<BR>b) use this for a tap(a spell that takes hit points from a target and gives it to the Necro)<BR>  i) this in turn helps create more mana(see a pattern?)<BR>c) give this mana to another caster who may need it. Such as a Cleric or Enchanter or Wizard.<P>Now...heres the trick. The Necromancer goes into hell zone X to fight boss mob Y with his guild buddies. <P>Boss mob Y is almost completely magic resistant(80 to 90% spells cast dont hurt it). The tanks are taking a beating, the cleric is running low on mana. The Necro can:<P>a) blow all his mana trying to land a tap on boss mob Y.<BR>b) give all his mana to the Cleric and then sit there and do nothing.<BR>c) Lich up anyway and pass off mana to the Cleric, in which case leaves the necro low on mana and low on hit points sitting there doing nothing.<P> Perhaps it is because many of the anti-necro players have never tried a necro past level 20 that causes this total lack of understanding of the class. If a necro can not tap his target, he cannot generate hit points to generate mana to pass to other casters. End of story. <P> I personally did not pick a Necro to wind up being a second rate support class. Necromancers are damage dealing classes, they always have been and always should be. You have basically taken this class up to level 50, killed it, and started a completely new class from the same character.<P> To those who say "but passing mana to other casters is still VERY important". Thats like the scene in The Breakfast Club, where Claire basically says that if it wasnt for geeks there would be no popular people. Its very condecending to assume that we as Necros actually enjoy passing off all our mana, at a horrid ratio I might add, to you. And to suggest that we should have expected this sort of role reversal and we should suck it up is such a blind one sided statement. Stop a minute and imagine what it would be like if Clerics all of a sudden couldnt heal anymore? But instead they are expected to pass off their mana to the wizards. Or what if the melee classes were only allowed to use a single 1h slashing weapon with a delay no lower than 38 and a damage no higher than 5? The outcries would be legendary, even for this messageboard. Oh, but since its only Necros suggesting something be looked at, we will just flame them and tell them how to play their class..even though you never played a Necro before.<P> Its sad, but I have started a Rogue and a Warrior twink. The Warrior is now at 32, the Rogue is at 3, but I'll get him up there. I hate the fact that I spent so much time playing a class that was originally billed by Verant as the second most powerful damage dealing class in the game, all for what? So I can be the Copper Top Necro and twitch Clerics and Wizards. Feh... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I -do- think that the issue of the L56+ uber encounters being warrior/cleric only preserves needs to be addressed.<P>Some of this could be done by introducing artificial requirements or new spells that are silly except in uber encounters.<P>For example- give the enchanters a fast 1 second duration very expensive stun.  It's not much- but it lets you slow the monster that tiny amount.  So you are DOING something.<P>For example- give some of the mobs irresistable lifetaps to heal themselves- and then turn around and give the necros a spell to protect against these lifetaps.<P>For example- the lure series that lets wizards do SOMETHING to the mobs.<P>For example- an expensive to cast (Sapphires) high level pet that burns itself out in about 10 minutes but that does good damage (allowing mages to do damage) and make 4 of them (sapphire, ruby, etc) fire/earth/air/water with elemental attacks that can damage foes.<P>The idea is to give the casters some L56+ spell that lets them affect the uber encounters in SOME way.  I mean as an enchanter, my role in uber encounters is to sit and buff.  I might go for one or two uber encounters but I just get really tired of sitting there being buff slave.  I spent 50 levels charging into the mix of melee to stunz or getting whapped so my pet would join the battle and here I am with no post 50 pet (so my L46ish pet won't do any damage) I can't stun, I can't mez.  I just get to haste/clarity/magicresist people before the battle and then I can log out and log in my monk.  HUH?<P>It wouldn't be so bad if there was some variety- extremely high hit point- high AC- NOT magic resist monsters.  Monsters with different kinds of resists.  Monsters that did MEDIUM damage but hat boatloads of hit points.<P>Instead it mostly seems to turn on<BR>Huge amounts of hit points.<BR>Decent AC but hittable<BR>Total magic resistance except to Wizard Lures.  Can't be slowed or affected by magic period.<BR>Summons<BR>Hits for LARGE amounts of damage.<BR>Again and again and again and again.<P>---<P>This is the time to be creative<P>Mobs that Snare<BR>Mobs that Charm<BR>Mobs that have disease area affect attacks<BR>Mobs that Slow<BR>Mobs that Root<BR>Mobs that Knockback<BR>Mobs that Steal Mana<BR>Mobs that cast gross spells that can be interrupted by stuns- but not 0% or 100% of the time, only 30% or 70% of the time.<P>A lot of the things you see in mid level encounters are not reused and everything settles down to..<P>Hmmm lets make a "killer mob"<BR>Okay 200k hit points, quad hits for 200, unaffected by magic.<P>The problem with this is - less or no strategy.<P>I understand the necros problem.  He got in the game understanding his role and it worked for 50 levels.  Then suddenly, only clerics and warriors need apply.

</FONT><HR>Guys, look on the bright side..  what better way to kick this habit than to have the rug pulled out from under you after 50 or so levels of play.  How could anyone have anticipated such a change in job description post 50 (well, post 55 for me) when uber encounters are becoming all the more common?  Why work toward becoming a Warlock (60 Nec) if all we'll do is feed mana or perform mop up duties?<P>This ominous truth looming on the horizon has just about killed my motivation in playing this game.  No, I won't be starting yet another alt.<P>I haven't solo'd with my necro since 47 or so being as I have a regular group I've played with since the 30s.  A well played necro (emphasize: well played) in a single group dungeon crawl is hella useful.  Noone is debating that.  I just love stacking my two best pact spells on the main tank and tapping health back, pet backstabbing all the while.  To me that is the epitome of a necromancer.  (DOTs, backup crowd control, darkness, etc are of course helpful as well)<P>I refuse, however, to be incapable of anything but mana transfer.  Whats the fun in merely responding to "gimme gimme gimme" requests all night long?  Addressing the cleric analogy.. at least clerics need brainpower to know when to time the casting of healing spells.  Its not like we can see everyones' mana bar.  And it won't even be remotely efficient without a constant supply of Regrowth, when you're facing mobs you cannot tap for health (rules out Lich).<P>The tired issues of the skelly effect DD and the DOT bug have been beat to death with no response.<P>People here aren't by any stretch asking to be uber post 50, but rather to just have some measure of worthiness in the end game encounters.  Is that unreasonable?<P>Good day.<P>Xalax, 55th Erudite Defiler of The Rathe<P>PS - As an aside, I was very pleased to see bardic crowd control addressed.  The other night a 55 bard was doing some amazing things for us in Sebilis, at one point mezzing up to 4 mobs at a time.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like either lure taps or lure dots idea. Necros are offensive spellcasters and should do about same damage via their dots (or taps) comparing to wizards with their dds.<BR>Mages are in same boat: give them less powerful lures, maybe 50 to 70% of what wizards have. They have pets to make up for that, for example fire pet being 100% immune to those dread fire AEs most ubermobs use might be extremely useful.<BR>Enchanters: someone suggested an unresistable stun idea with huge mana cost so it wont be used on naything else but ubermobs.<BR>Basically every class should bring something to a raid, i just dont see a valid reason of some classes being unable to do any damage to ubermob via spells, being a pure caster with nil melee ability. Please tell me how is that unbalancing to give every class something they would use other than summon useless fireworks and mod rods or be a mana battery at horrible transfer ratio?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the reply, Absor.  I can see where you're coming from, but let's take a quick look at some numbers:<P><BR>SPOILER WARNING:::<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<BR>:<P>(All from eqcaster.com's utility)<P>I'm going to find the best DDs for a wizard (Who have the most mana efficient) and the best DoTs for necros (Who are the subject) and the ratio for mana transfer spells (this includes the Lich line).<P>(Necro spells will be denoted by at * in front of them. Wizard spells will have an + preceeding. Ratios are either Mana cost to mana given [higher is better], damage to duration [higher is better], or damage to mana [lower is better].)<P>First, let's examine the mana transfer line:<P>*Covetous Subversion: To cast, 300 mana gives 100 mana. 3 sec to cast, 8 sec recast.  3:1<P>*Sedulos Subversion: To cast, 400 mana gives 150 mana. 3 sec to cast, 8 sec recast. 2.6:1<P>Now for Necro DOTs and (undead) DD spells:<P>*Envenomed Bolt: To cast, 320 mana. Does 110 (direct damage) and 1022 in 7 ticks. 6.1 sec to cast, instant recast. 160:1 (ticks)<P>*Splurt: To cast 237 mana. Does ~1500(?) damage in 16 ticks. 4 sec to cast, instant recast.  93.75:1 (assume 1500 damage)<P>*Ignite Blood: To cast 250 mana. Does 1176 damage in 21 ticks. 4 sec to cast, instant recast. 56:1<P>*Pyrocruor: To cast, 400 mana. Does 1998 damage in 18 ticks. 4 sec to cast, instant recast. 111:1<P>*Exile Undead: To cast, 250 mana. Does 675 (L55) to 725(L60) damage to undead. 5 sec to cast, instant recast. 2.7:1 (L55) to 2.9:1 (L60)<P>*Chill Bones: To cast, 210 mana. does 505 (L55) to 510 (L60). 6 sec to cast, 12 sec recast.  Gives Illusion: (white bone) Skeleton to target.  2.405:1 (L55) to 2.429:1 (L60)<P>Now, wizard spells:<P>+Ice Comet: To cast, 400 mana. Does 1110 (L49) to 1120 (L50). 6.3 sec to cast instant recast.  2.775:1 (L49) to 2.8:1 (L50)<P>+Rend: To cast, 280 mana. Does 774 (L79) to 784 (L50). 6.3 sec to cast, instant recast. 2.7:1 (L49) to 2.8 (L50)<P>+Draught of Fire: To cast, 215 mana. Does 643 (L51) to 688 (L60). 3.0 sec to cast, instant recast. 2.99:1 (L51) to 3.2:1 (L60)<P>+Voltaic Draugh: To cast, 215 mana. Does 658 (L54) to 688 (L60). 3.0 sec to cast, instant recast. 3.0:1 (L54) to 3.2:1 (L60)<P>+Sunstrike: To cast, 450 mana. Does 1615 (L60) damage. 7.0 sec to cast, instant recast. 3.58:1<P>Now for Health to Hitpoint spells:<P>*Lich: To cast, 5 mana. Takes 32 hp, gives 20 mana. Illusion: (Dark Bone) Skeleton, Gives Ultravision. 3 sec to cast, 6 sec recast.  1.6:1<P>*Demi-lich: To cast, 1 mana. Takes 48 hp, gives 31 mana. Illusion: (Dark Bone) Skeleton, gives Ultravision. 2 sec to cast, instant recast. 1.548:1<P>*Arch-lich: To cast, 1 mana. Takes 31 hp, gives 20. Illusion: Spectre, gives See Invis. 2 sec to cast, instant recast.  1.55:1<P>The "Cream of the Crop" spells:<P>Covetous Subversion -&gt; 3:1<P>Envenomed Bolt -&gt; 160:1<BR>Pyrocruor -&gt; 111:1<P>Voltaic Draugh -&gt; 3.0:1 to 3.2:1<BR>Sunstrike -&gt; 3.58:1<P>Demi-Lich -&gt; 1.548:1<BR>Lich -&gt; 1.6:1<P>-<BR>Now for the point of all this.<P>For the 900 mana it takes for me to give the wizard 100 to cast Voltaic Daugh I can cast Envenomed Bolt twice. (More likely 3 if you're sitting down meditating between recast on Subversion) for a total of 3366 damage, which dwarfs the Wizard's 2064 (L60).<P>All of the above is irrelevant.  "Why?" You ask?  Because most fights don't last 7 ticks.  So...<P>We're relegated to using terribly mana inefficient spells to fuel mana inefficient spells. That isn't fun.<P>Ahh, but wait! The above paragraph is irrelevant, too!  In 7 ticks (42 seconds) we can cast Covetous Subversion 3 times. ((3 cast + 8 recast) / 42). That's 300 mana.  Then the fight's over.  Either we win, or we're stuck summoning corpses.<P>The problem is that we are only useful for pets -- which are wiped out in seconds from powerful AE spells -- giving mana to people during downtime, and summoning corpses.<P>I won't even get into resist rates, except: I spend 900 mana so Mr. Wizard can cast a spell to have it be resisted.  With that 900 mana I could have cast the spell at least twice.  *shrug*<P>(This post will be mirrored at http://thedoh.dyndns.org/eqstats/nwratio.shtml by Jan 4.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'm afraid you missed the point.<P>You are telling the high level necro community that they have not tried hard enough to find their role in the high end game. I can assure you I try new spells and new strategies during each raid (about 3 raids / week) I participate to. But the point is that without lifetap sticking you lose all your other group abilities : mana dumping (because you need to lich yourself in order to overcome the bad transfer ratio) and life dumping (our best health transfer take 500 hp to give 500 hp over a short period of time, without lifetaps we are not going to do it often..)<P>I think it is quite insulting to people who have invested more than 100 days of their life to say that they are spoiled and not trying hard enough to play their class to it full potential. <P>It looks like you are joining the crowd of newbies who say that necro is the most easy class to level so that we should pay ( lol try to level a monk or a warrior with ubergear : fungi tunic and uber weapons for example ...)<P>Btw, try to do a who necro 55 60 all on various servers and compare with other classes, I think you will see a trend...<P>I aplogize for my mistakes, english is not my native tongue.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So true. I too have "soloed" my way through most of my EQ career. Some of my spells are a joke, such as an essense emerald for damage, or an emerald for mana. Unbelievably expensive.<P>An earlier post stated, oh boohoo, oh boohoo, another necromancer post. They whine too much, and arn't deserving of it. Perhaps that is the common perception, and that is part of the problem. We are constantly being perceived as overpowered, yet, perhaps we hold a mere illusion of power. Yes our dots are powerful, but due to the extremely powerful mobs being A. IMMUNE, or B. bugged, it's not exactly the best to cast dots. <BR>My pet is as easily killed by a mob as a level 60 warrior against a level 8 skeleton. <P>My lifetaps are resisted.<P>There are perhaps only 4 classes that do not do ANY damage to a monster in an extreme raid<BR>Enchanters-tash, speed/rune the tanks, clarity, enlightenment/insight, mez adds.<BR>Clerics-heal. They were well known as the king of healing.<BR>Shamen=buff. They were well known as the king of buffs.<BR>Necromancer-pumps his or her mana into another class.<P>Let me ask you people one question. Why is it that a high level necromancer cannot hit Maestro? <BR>I've yet to see ignite/chill bones stick, although I think ignite would have the greater chance, if it didn't have that damn useless skeleton illusion. I have never managed to land a lifetap. I MAY have landed a pyrocurer once, but due to that dot bug, I will never dot Maestro again. My pet they said could not be used because it caused lag, and did not have enough output. This mob is what..7 levels lower then me? He is but one example of mobs I cannot do anything against. <P>I did not begin to play a necromancer because I thought it would be a god class. I played a necromancer because I thought it would be fun to be the master of undead.

</FONT><HR>The reasons many people consider this "the death of necromancers" is simple.<P>When someone starts a character of a certain class, they have certain expectations about what that class will be about. I dont think anyone can deny that Necromancers are a VERY different class then they were a year and a half ago. Not just minor tweaks, the ability to be a "mana battery" didnt even exist when many necromancers started their characters, or even when they got lvl 50.<P>"The ability to turn his mana into hit points for tanks to use....Clerics are accustomed to this role"<BR>The above statement is very true, and clerics i am sure would be extreamly upset if you gave them lure-type nuke spells and took away their heals. Even if you made those new spells good enough that it's enough to make them useful on raids and a strong class, would it be understandable to you that people were upset and saying "this isnt what i signed up for when i hit create character?".<P>The problem is by no means solely the current state of necromancers, but how much they have changed since people hit that "Create Character" button.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sir Absor<P>Think of it this way. What does a cleric (the class that most people think is the most wanted on a raid) bring with him to the group? The ability to turn his mana into hit points for tanks to use. It's pretty much the same role that necromancers can play on a raid, turning hit points into mana for the casters to use.<P>To be able to transfer mana a necromancer must LICH.

</FONT><HR>Grave Robber: "To those who say "but passing mana to other casters is still VERY important". Thats like the scene in The Breakfast Club, where Claire basically says that if it wasnt for geeks there would be no popular people. Its very condecending to assume that we as Necros actually enjoy passing off all our mana, at a horrid ratio I might add, to you. And to suggest that we should have expected this sort of role reversal and we should suck it up is such a blind one sided statement. Stop a minute and imagine what it would be like if Clerics all of a sudden couldnt heal anymore? But instead they are expected to pass off their mana to the wizards. Or what if the melee classes were only allowed to use a single 1h slashing weapon with a delay no lower than 38 and a damage no higher than 5? The outcries would be legendary, even for this messageboard. Oh, but since its only Necros suggesting something be looked at, we will just flame them and tell them how to play their class..even though you never played a Necro before."<P>/applaud Grave Robber</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Now they say that the role for necro's post-50 is support class. <P>With that mentality, why not let Clerics tank post-50... a total role reversal for them as well? Give them dual-wield, quad-attack! <P>My 40th level necro is being relegated to a back shelf in favor of leveling up a new character (though I have yet to determine what to try!)<P>The blatant disregard for maintaining the 'role' of a necro throughout his life in Norrath makes me sick.  <P>Verant says 'Yeah.. you necro's are usefull if you do this support role and forego any of your normal playing style'.  <BR>Player says 'That's not what I started this class to do.

</FONT><HR>I can deal with duties that aren't particularly fun or glorious like being a mana battery.  The problem I see is that raid organizers don't want a mana battery that gives mana at such a poor rate of return.  Instead of inviting me along to give a cleric or wizard a third of a bar of mana, they invite another cleric or wizard who have a full bar of mana to use.<P>This leaves necros out in the cold in the later game, almost completely unwanted.  If the worst happens, it's really not that hard to pay a necromancer to go to the zone of the wipeout in order to summon 30 or 40 corpses because you can distribute the cost of bribing him to do the CR for everyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So... let's say you're planning a raid to kill ubermob X.  You're well aware of the fact that you have limited slots you can fill because the game simply cannot handle too many players in one spot.<P>Knowing this, do you bring a Necro to twitch the clerics at a 2.6:1 ratio, or do you just bring another cleric?  (Those who say "bring the necro" please consult someone who can help you in extracting your head from your ass...thx)<P>This is the heart of the problem, Absor.  There is NOTHING that a necro can do that adding another of the "required" classes can't do 2.6 time more efficiently.  Bring one to DMF, if that's even desired (how about fixing the nice bug where other players bumping into me interrupt my cleric's spells?) but beyond that what is the point?<P>Lest people think I'm siding with the morons who come here to cry about necros because necros can solo stuff that their newb warrior can't... The point I'm trying to make here is that something seriously needs to be done to give necros a useful--and perhaps even fun, god forbid--role (once again, 2.6:1 ratio != useful!) on the high level raids.<P>--Xy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I dont believe in flaming folks, or shooting down their ideas just for the sake of doing it, instead tryt to understand where they are coming from and hopefully offer suggestions to make things better.<P>If I'm understanding what Verant is saying here, Necros, Bards and the like fill an important role at the higher leves, that role being mana replacement to the casters just as clerics are for hitpoint replacement to the tanks.  I can go there, and will bite off on that (I'm not a necro, I may be clueless)  <P>It seems to me that the problem is the sense of doing something usefull for the group, when the cleric casts a heal, everyone sees the results immediately and recognizes that the cleric is doing their job.  If a mana-replacing type of class is doing their job no one knows other than the individual casters, most take time to thank for clarity etc but in a heated battle you might not.  <P>A simple solution might be to show the entire group everyones mana bar just as we see their hitpoint bar.  That way when the necro is filling that role, everyone will see and give them recognition.  (I am also a fan of showing the damage from nukes to the whole group, but that is a different issue)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Absor but your idea is flawed atbest.<P>"suggest that the only role for a necromancer during the big fight is to act as a mana battery for other classes"<P>In 15 Trak raids I have yet to do a single point of damage to him.  <P>Deflux - resisted<BR>Ignite/Chill bones - not allowed because of the stupid illusion effect changing the size of the mob and making the tanks miss<BR>DoT - I am sure we all remember the DoT bug..<BR>Pets - are pretty much worthless against anything with an AoE effect.  The resistance rates on Pets are sad and with AoE Fears, DoTs or Rains a Pet never does much damage.<P>The same result pretty much against VS, All 3 Kurnark dragons, the Queen in Chardok, the Reavers... <P>So I am limited to DMFing and giving mana<P>"The ability to turn his mana into hit points for tanks to use. It's pretty much the same role that necromancers can play on a raid, turning hit points into mana for the casters to use."<P>Ok lets compare the Clerics ability to first Buff the Tanks to have what an extra 700 HPs and then for less then 400 mana can heal ALL of his HPs.  That is a huge mana ration.  Lets look at the Mana transfer line.  I get at best give 1/3 the mana it cost to cast the spell...  It would take me 1200 mana to provide that single cleric with enough mana to do one complete heal!!!  If it is that important then why not just bring along a second Cleric or Wizard and get a full mana bar of usefullness...<P>"The real difference here seems to be that clerics are accustomed to this role, necromancers are not"<P>That is part of it but the simple fact remains that Clerics are effective in their role where as Necros are not.  Even if I was to play 'Manastone' with around 2500 mana points I can only transfer 900 to another caster...  The raid is better off just bringing that other caster and gaining 1600 more mana points.<P>Briljin D'Aerthe<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
