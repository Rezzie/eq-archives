</FONT><HR>to me, this souds ok, but then you can have a lvl 60 group with a lvl 1 and the lvl 60 would shut off their exp and then PL the newbie. and also, this sounds like it would fall under an experience change, and those are closed topics, nothing with experience will be changed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>aragin - No no, turning exp off would cause you to discard your share of the exp.  You would still receive exp from the battle, but it wouldn't apply to your total.  The level limits in groups would still apply, but the higher level person wouldn't gain any exp while the lower level person would be catching up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>there is one huge problem with this idea and it is powerleveling someone, you could have 5 lvl 50+ and a lvl 1 grouped going after HG's in rathe mtns, the 50+ ppl totally destroy the zone while the lvl 1 gets a bubble of exp per kill (red mobs) until he gets to the desired lvl. or if a friend is lvl 30 and everyone else is 50+ they could go into sol b and do every mob there and get their friend even with them....while i personally have 0 problem with powering someone up, its against verants Vision(tm) and will never happen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If someone is level 50 and they are grouped with someone who is level 1, I thought that the level 1 person could not recieve XP. There is no way that turning off the X.P you are receiving would help power level someone. The XP is just getting thrown away, so to say, instead of making you further distant in level from the ones you like to group with. All experience rules still apply. This is a better option than having to kill yourself to loose XP. Another thing to bring up before people start saying it. When you die and the experience toggle is turned off you still loose XP just as if you still had the XP toggle on. Thanks Absor for looking at this again, I know Abashi has said he would get this in game before but it has not happened.

</FONT><HR>Woohoo!  A response from Absor!  All right!<P>-Darkfriend-, if you turn exp off you will still receive your share.  This way, the level limits will still be in place (ie level 50+ chars couldn't group with a level 1 to powerlevel him.)  It's just that, if your exp is turned off, you throw your share away instead of applying it to your total needed to level (you don't get any exp for the kill.)<P>Saulter - I could keep dying while I wait for my friends to catch up to me.  But, honestly, I just don't like that idea.  I'd rather not gain then force myself to lose.  If it's an easy thing to implement (and I really hate hearing lines like that, but..  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )  I would love this alternative to taking a few deaths, personally.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There needs to be some kind of a comfirmation message in place at the end of each kill, something like "You forfeit experience". If there isn't, it will just start a new source of complaints about forgetting the status of the toggle and loosing experience.

</FONT><HR>Heh, it would be better if you just didn't group with the person but helped them powerlevel a little.  Even mele's can do this.  Dont assist until the mob is at half health, just sit there and taunt it.  Once it reaches half health turn on the damage and your buddy get the xp.<P>This way not only will you be able to hang out together but you'll actually help them to level faster.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey, discussing it helps work out all the kinks.  If it ends up being feasable to implement it, then great.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Actually, having it turn off when you log is probably for the best.  That way, complaints about forgetting to shut it off would be reduced significantly.<P>If a message is possible though, that'd be great.  There may be times when someone would want to turn exp off while waiting for someone to catch up, and then turn it back on when they've caught up with them, in the same gaming session.  The message would make it easier for people to remember that exp gain is off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What's the point of this?  If I'm lvl 40 and someone is lvl 1 and i'm killing stuff for him to get XP but my XP is off, he's going to get such a teeny weeny little bit of XP, it woudln't even be worth it.  And if Myshare of the XP is stil going to me but just not being applied, why would I want to NOT have experience given to me?  I see you might say you are just waiting for that other char to catch up, but really, if you go up a lvl and you don't want to, kill yourself.  Much easier than putting in a switch.<BR>Unless I'm missing something souds like something useless that you can already pretty much accomplish with some suicidal tendencies.<BR>--Kel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Allow the higher levels to still group with you while you catch up... without continuing to get ahead of you.<P>However, I think that there should be a small amount of that forfeited exp distributed amongst the rest fo the group... not much... maybe 10% of what was forfeited.<P>Since the point is catching up a little... and not powerlevelling(This is easy enough to accomplish without this) I think giving a bit of that exp back would help some.<P>I honestly think this would also help to get more effective and different types of groups formed.<P>Anway... kinda got off on a tangent there...

</FONT><HR>well, it sounds like its now become some useless command, as the last poster said, if i'm giving up my exp and it just disappears theres no real point to this cause then your putitng in alot of effort to get a friend caught up but you lose out on alot of exp. <BR>i thought that if you turn off the exp gaining it would take your bit of exp and split it with the other people in the group. then there would have to be code to prevent low lvl's getting alot of exp, which means this would take a while and it would probably become low priority.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>aragain - Actually, the point of the command is to allow people to maintain the same level range.  It definitely should not be set up so it can be abused to powerlevel people, but that's not the intent of the switch.  It's for people who commonly play together, who want to stay within the same level range so they can continue to play together.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Let me try to clarify (or understand) the reason for this no-exp switch idea.  As a member of a small and infrequently gathering guild, we had a problem.  Some of our members played a lot more than others.  So when we did meet our levels were so disparate that we had trouble finding combat things to do, and mostly spent our time playing hide and seek (try it, it's fun).<P>Those that couldn't play enough to keep up with the rest, didn't play enough do to real-world things that were not malleable.  So the only recourse for this problem was to ask the frequent players to stop playing their guild characters as often.  But they loved playing their guild characters, and not playing them meant having less fun with the game.<P>This toggle would help those people.  They could play like mad.  They could help strangers and not worry about accidentally gaining experience.  They could hunt up items for the group without gaining experience.  They could play the game without losing the ability to play with their guild (replace 'guild' with 'spouse', 'relatives' or 'friends' as needed).<P>Having a character commit suicide to lose levels wasn't something that would ever occur to us.  It's not a particularly in-character thing to do.<P>This toggle would probably only help a very small portion of the EverQuest population.  So it may not be something that we do.  I haven't brought this idea to anyone, and I may not be able to any time soon.  But it's on my list.<P>  Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Although I understand the reasoning behind an experience on/off toggle, in a fantasy world where everything you do has repercussions, it seems to be inconsistant.<P>It seems open to lots of game abuses.  The first that comes to mind, is enabling this before you level past the dragon raid levels, and then keeping experience off until you  have had your fill of fighting dragons and reaping the goodies in the dragon lairs.  (Whether there should be level limits is another issue).  <P>If you are waiting for your group to catch up there is plenty to do that you wont get experience from.  What this switch allows, among other things, is farming while you wait of experience giving but low risk npc's, instead of the lower loot greens.<P>Those are just two abuses I immediately see.  The large population of players will discover new ones.  Although the initial stated reason is social enough, there is plenty to do that doesn't give experience to make this unnecessary.<P>You won't get experience roaming the world helping players in trouble.  Help a lost, ailing, poisened, hungry, naked, confused player...I can guarentee you will get no experience points, though you may have an experience.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>-msgnomer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wow, cool to see this come back up. I caught alot of flack when I first posted the suggestion.<P>Absor, the idea isn't so you CAN play with your friends and help them do things, becuase you can always do that. The idea is so that you can continue to play the game as you normally do, only without advancing. This lets friends who've fallen behind play catchup without you retiring your character for a period of time while they do.<P>When I posted this idea, I was within a few bubs of my wife's char XP wise, and a few levels over my brother. We play at the same rate we always have, and I'm now 5 levels over my wife, and 9 over my brother. He plays less than we do, and takes the hybrid hit, as does my wife. I didn't play EQ last night becuase of this. Neither of them could play, and I had already used up all my available trade skill supplies and wasn't in a place to do anything else but hunt, thus gain XP and level. It would have been greay to log in, shut off XP, and play my heart out and meet new people.<P>Lately, we've gone into areas to hunt where I get NO xp from the greens to try and help this out. I'm still sucking up alot of thier experience unfortunately, but at least I'm not getting it and advancing. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to find places where this works out. The flag would do just that, let us hunt anywhere we normally would, and my XP share would just get tossed in the bit bucket. They'd level slower than if I wasn't there, but then they'd lose out on the pleasure of my company  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I don't think this is an option a small set of users would use. I think a large number of people here have said it's a stupid idea, but there's a large number of people here who say that about anything. Everyone I've spoken with about this idea has thought of times when they wished they had it. I think alot more people would use it than Verant realises.<P>I imagine it would take Rowyl more time to add the slash command to the client than it would the server guy to code the change that makes it ignore XP for you. This can't be that hard, please take it to the tuning meeting and discuss it.<P>Abashi said he'd do this, I assumed it was dead since he never responded further, nor answered any of my emails asking for an update. I tend to wonder if it ever made it beyond the boards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
