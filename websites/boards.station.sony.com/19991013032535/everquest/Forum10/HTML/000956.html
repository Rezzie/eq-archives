</FONT><HR>I agree, either that or lower some prices of items. I also understand they want to add to the lasting gameplay, but 700 plat fopr a ring?? almost 10000 plat for full set of plate armor?? Even as a druid as i am, armor and spells is expensive. 30 or more plat for a scroll with words on it??

</FONT><HR>I have to disagree. I haven't had any money issues really.  So, I couldn't buy everything at that level.  By the time I hit 19, I was able to afford all my spells.  Now that I am 39, I have 3000 plat in the bank, a load of cool items I have hunted for, have paid 1200 plat for the jewelry I wear, and have every single spell I can.  I have done this through adventuring.  Sure, at lower levels it is tough.  But once you hit 20, and start getting FS weapons (which it seems almost every creature 20+ can spawn with) money pretty much flows in.  Just like everything else, it just takes time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think this is a truly great game. But i also think it is very frustrating to make money and get items and spells and such. Maybe im abit young (im only lvl 5 Wizard) so im a newbie in the strongest sence. I've been slaying spiders, snakes, bats and rats for several days now and selling whatever i get from looting the corpses. But one thing puzzles me, since it is suppose to be a real world we are living in, you would think that when you start out with a character that must be 20+ years old, that he would have atleast SOME items of possesions and even some money in the bank to start out with.<BR>Its a hard game, and abit too hard for me. But i still love it. I just wish there were something to start out with other then the simple dagger and some food. Atleast when you get to lvl 5 or something, all that hard work slaying the annoying bats and rats you should get something, like an award from the towns you have helped  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> . I dont dare to think about how long i have left to play, until I get to lvl 20..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>verant cannot nerf the money system - it is too well balanced.  Most of the complaints I read come from younger players who think they shoudl have better armor or weapons.  When you NEED an item, you should have the money.  For example, warriors do not need banded mail until past level ten.  Start with none, move to patchwork, then leather and then banded.  Yes, lower levels actually use rusty weapons.  Mages cannot buy all their spells at once - they have to have something to work towards.  As you get more experienced and learn the game, you will find you have the money you need (if you play smartly).  <P>And stop looking at the platemail!  That's only for gods anyway.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Please don't increase the money supply.<P>When you're low level, it seems like you'll never be able to afford anything good.  As you go up the levels, the loot becomes more valuable. I think the current system works pretty well (except for the twinks).<P>None of my characters are rich, but they can afford the equipment they need to survive at their level.  There are some great places to make money in the game, but part of the fun is finding them on your own.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well aside from the hideous scandal that just rocked the land. let me tell you level 5 wizards something. I wasnt born at my level I worked. I spent level one hunting for anything and everything. I sold all that I found and at second or 3rd level had managed enough to buy a backpack. so I could carry more, and return to town less often. I did that a lot. I have never borrowed, have earned all that I have. And I laugh when I see those that twink and cheat their way up the ladder.

</FONT><HR>Well, i can see for some that making money in this game, is having patience. But guys like me have a life outside this game too. This game takes just too loong to get a reasonable amount of money to be fully satisfied with what you have done to get it. One guy mentioned that the complaints this game usually gets regarding the money is from younger players, and that may very well be. Im not a greedy person, but its very hard not to be in this game. If only i had the time this game requires, i would not be wishing these things.

</FONT><HR>This is a tad conspiracy theory, I'll admit, but another reason Verant will never change the money system is: real-world money... If my character got money easier, I would play less, no because the game would be worse, but because I wouldn't have to work so damned hard for every red cent. I could log on for two hours and log off with better equipment. As it stands it takes alot more than three hours to get enough money to buy better equipment than what you are using to hunt the monsters at the moment. This makes you play more, and thus feel that you are getting mor eout of the game. Which you are, so you keep playing.<P>Three pieces of advice for 1st-5th lvl players who want cash.<P>1)Buy Bags and Backpack, at least a couple. Then you can stay out slaying monsters way longer and more effectively.<P>2)Unless the item is very valuble, only pick up stackables, like bat wings. This way you can get alot more before you have to go trade them in.<P>3)Go after skeletons as soon as you hit 2nd or 3rd, and humanoids too (ie gnoll pups, orc pawns). They have much better loot in the long term. 20 Bat wings will get a gold piece and change, but a couple of rusty longswords will get almost four GP. They may also have weapons better than the one you are using, or more handy (staves over dagger for instance, or rusty broadswords over normal shortswords).

As an adult of say 20 as stated earlier why do we start with nada..in "that other game" you start with 100gp...why not say 1 silver here or 1 gold to buy more food or drink or what ever you feel is most important at the beginnning?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Uhm, lets see, the money system is practically perfect compared to UO.  Uhm, also, it FORCES you to gain levels at an early stage, come on people, it ISN'T UO.  You can't just LEARN to carve 30 bows without spending any money and get rich, and you CAN'T just ASK a person for a thousand gold.  ALSO, it helps to be poor, teaches you to be nice to newbies later on in life, and to VALUE what you have.  UO's economy is what RUINED the game in the first place, and its one item on a LIST of items that makes EQ a better game, both fundamentaly and realisticly speaking.  OH well. thats another story.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In game balance, money cannot be made easier for those people who play less.  All kinds of people play the game - from the addicted person with no life to a hard working parent of ten kids.  If the game is build to accomidate the later, the former player will be bored in a day.  The irregular gamer needs to find some fun other than buying banded mail.  Roleplay at low level, but don't complaint that you cannot aquire the same material as the regular gamer.  It is simply not plausible to build a game for both types and make them happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am a new player (lvl 8 paladin).  I have had the game for about a month and a half.  I think the money system is great except for one problem that worrys me.  I don't think the money is too sparce at low levels.  Money should be rare and for low levels it is rare.  From what I have heard higher levels get money much easier.  This is ok because the equiptment they need to survive is more expensive.  However since there is no damage done to items once someone has the item it will never disappear (unless lost on a lost body), but the money will be replentished with another monster.  I know the programming for adding damage to items would be extensive and it would also anger many players who worked hard to get what they have.  But then again if they have 3000 plat in the bank then they could use that in the world again.  Damage to items could give the trades ways of getting money and would reduce the stagnate money in banks.  It would also make items more valuable and would require players to upkeep their armor and such...  I mean how many people would fight dragons or such and not have a scape on their armor..  One other thing, I think it would be cool for trades to get a small amount of experience when they succeed at a trade.  This would help bring about player craftsmen and player merchants.  I think alot of the role players would agree that it is more interesting to talk to a person selling something than a merchant that is based on clicks...  I mean don't get me wrong they are necessary but people taking the place of NPC's brings alot out of a game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Around level 15-20 you begin to make money and after a while, you'll have more money than you need. <P>At level 30 I got hundreds of plat sitting in the bank. The problem is there isn't anything to buy. NPC's don't sell anything worth buying. PCs either don't sell things, can't sell things, or sell them for real life cash. Lots of stuff I'd like to buy, none of it for sale.<P>Biggest problem I see with not having money is when it comes to PvsP servers or if you lose your corpse and everything on it. Way too hard to start over from scratch. I think making corpse recovery easier is a better solution than making money easier to come by though.<P>There are also other problems with NPC vendors charging too much. Things like ranged artillery. Arrows and such should be cheaper. Things NPCs sell should be worth buying. Many things aren't. If it costs far more than its worth, no one is going to buy it so its just waisting space. Even with lots of money in the bank, much of what vendors sell is just not worth buying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>I have a suggestion for Verant: IGNORE anyone who wants item degeneration built into the game.  If you want the economy of Norrath to go into a real nosedive, if you want camping to be greatly increased, if you want selling on eBay to soar, then build degeneration into the game.  <P>Want prices on items to fall? Make the items impermanent.  I won't pay 50 plat for a blackened iron medallion that will fall apart after a certain period of time.  What will I use my money to buy then?  Training?  Nope, that happens automatically as I use a skill. I guess I will build up a pretty huge surplus by the time I reach 50th.  <P>Think camping is bad now?  Think zones like Unrest are laggy now?  Wait until item degeneration is built into the game and everyone has to return time after time to replace their bloodstained tunic or bronze armor.  Do you want people perpetually yanked about the world of Norrath in a constant quest for replacement items?  Wrong kind of Everquest concept.<P>People will get very very tired of returning to some zone to get another piece of gear.  Buying on eBay will be MUCH easier, even if the prices will drop.  People will be able to specialize in bronze armor selling on eBay by forever camping Unrest.  <P>Finally, just how much will I care if I lose my body on some dungeon crawl if my items will simply deteriorate over time?  Shrug.  Buy another kit on eBay and keep playing.<P>DON'T implement item degeneration.  BAD idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=000956&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=000956&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
