</FONT><HR>Best quote in this whole thread is this:<P>The problem is hp + mr inflation of mobs, against the very highest mobs the ONLY tactic is chealing tanks, everything else results in death.<P>I could not agree more.  For a game which prides itself on being flexible and having a dozen different ways to fight nearly any mob I have been developing several characters to probably max level 40 45 and then plan to retire from EQ.<P>From everything I've heard on these boards I fully expect all the fun and enjoyment I get from finding new ways to fight mobs will fade quickly when forced squads of several groups becomes required to do anything..<P>The rumors of 12 hours corpse retreivals has absolutely no appeal for me and planning a raid for hours to fight some stupid unbeatable mob is the ultimate let down to a year of developing several fun characters.<P>I've never been able to gasp why they went the mega magic resist plus fizzle plus OOM plus MOB hits for double 324's mentality.  <P>My best guess is they saw a few people abuse their uber gear and mega guild mentality to mock their mobs and decided that even these gods should have something they could not defeat.<P>Keep them playing?  Why?  They are DONE with your game.  Dare I say DOH.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aradune,<P>What is up with the people at Verant with regrad to ubermobs? Why are you considering flawed ideas to improve classes vs SoV ubermobs (% of damage spells woud be a far bigger mistake than Donal's BP with a 10 sec cast time). I'm going to say it simply - please try to comprehend it...<P>IT IS UBERMOB RESISTANCES THAT ARE SCREWED IN SOV UBERMOBS.<P>Explain to me why you can now have mobs with 2 billion hp yet you still exclude all the offensive casting classes from most SoV ubermobs? There can be no justification AT ALL! It is simply laziness that you haven;t bothered to do the testing required to determine how high mob hp needs to be to keep an encounter difficult whilst at the same time reducing mob resistances so casting classes can do damage. Utterly inexcusable laziness.<P>You can forget the Warrens and a post-SoV expansion - you've broken EQ's backbone with SOV. Until you address the exclusion of casting classes from enjoyment on high level raids EQ will forever be a game for melees and clerics unless you only ever want to reach lvl 50.<P>The majority of the class talks Absor has initiated, whilst they have the right intentions, are mostly redundant in that a lot of the arguments revolve around giving classes extra spells etc to help with ubermobs. Hello? That's like firing nails into your head to stop the pain from having just sawn off your arm (as one american recently did lol) it DOESN'T solve the underlying problem.<P>I double dare you to have one of the fools that put the same resistances on a million hp mob that were used on a 32k hp mob post here and try and justify why he/she even deserves a job.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion... especially not a rare drop on a formidable dragon many players will never encounter."<P>It's not the item, it's the damn spell.  My level 39 spell is most significant spell in high end encounters.  There's no other class that can really be consider secondary healer with this spell around.  No one comes close.<P>Instead of nerfing the breastplate and pissing a few thousand people off, how about changing the effect?  Make the bp a buff or different healing spell.

</FONT><HR>100% magic resistance is obviously necessary since turgurs is so immensily powerful. It can NOT land. If it can be landed, it will be landed, and after that the raid is a walk in the park.<P>CHeal can't be touched anymore, not really. Yes its the most important spell around, and the bard+c2 described by person X is still quite potent even without the BP. But here's something most people don't know (since they don't have healing BPs). They seem to have _0_ impact on hatelist. Kinda nice when nothing will come for you that has seen you heal 20k hps and hasn't been taunted or damaged by anyone.... Alas without the BP taunt becomes a significant problem since near chaining CH does start creating agro and these bad boys the BP was used against hit just way too hard for a cleric to survive for long.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This was my post on Absor's latest thread on this issue, but frankly, I think it bears being told here too, hoping at least one fo the two will be read by the hosts.<P>Absor said:<BR>"There is no way that I can think of to answer your concern. There is no effect that we could put on the breastplate that would make it just as nice as it was before. If it did, it would be just as broken. I think we have a pretty good sense of balance, but I have no idea how to convince you of that.<P>Alan"<P>Well, I can think of a new effect that would NOT overpower Clerics, nor be a hinderance to the game's balance, yet would still satisfy Clerics like myself...<P>How about an effect on the BP that gives it's wearer a SMALL mana regen (close to Clarity I level)? Make it stackable with Clarity II, but not necessarily with Clarity I.<P>I venture to guess few Clerics would be upset with this change, it removes the whole issue of CH from the BP completely. And at the levels at which players could hope to gain one of these BP's, the amount of mana regen they could hope to get from it would be far from overpowering, yet enough to make it worth wearing.<P>The idea even plays into the whole "Role Play" of a Cleric... rename the BP to the "Holy BP of XXX". The small Mana Regen could be viewed as a "gift from our gods". It's respectable, functional, useful, and at these levels, NOT overpowering.<P>Now, if I can come up with a reasonable alternate, surely you can too Alan.<P>Please, give it a chance in discussion on your end.<P>Thanks,<P>Rooke Bonemender<BR>53rd Dwarven Vicar<BR>Laughing Lions<BR>Test Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Delheru,<P>Turgur's landing on an ubermob would only be so significant because ubermobs are currently too susceptible to such spells. <P>Firstly they could flag certain melee-specialist ubermobs as turgur-immune (they can do it with stun and mez so I don't doubt they can do it with turgur), this would only exclude one spell line from the battle - not every frickin casters entire spellbook.<P>Secondly, more of the ubermobs need to be less melee-specialised. Some should be casting DD's and devastating AE's but have rather weak melee output. <P>It's all about how you tune the mob. Currently to Verant Ubermob = hp + hit hard + cast spells + magic resistance. What verant don;t realise is whilst this equation results in a challenging encounter, the encounter is no FUN - at least for a majority of classes. Worse still there are plenty of ways they could involve more classes in encounters, they are just too damn lazy to investigate them.<P>I'm not advocating casters should always be able to land spellss on every single ubermob - just that there should be a lot lot more where we can do damage. Equally there should be encounters where raid melee damage is negated (this is very easy to do).<P>Well back to farming FBSS's whilst I wait for Verant to let me use my mana in a more challenging situation. /rude</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the breastplate is a little to powerfull.  but one of the only things that has made it realy powerfull is , velious "uber" mobs. some cases its just impossible to kill them without this breastplate, realisticly. maybe if u packed 100 players in the zone and attacked them you'd win, if the zone didnt crash or all of them go ld. <P>what im saying is there wasnt realy a NEED for the breastplate it was a novilty item that saved loads of mana for clerics and was nice item to have. kunark mobs didnt REQUIRE people to be ressed in multiple times and be healed with the breastplate as velious does, using a realistic amount of poeple.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<P>I respectfully submit that I think you are missing the point.<P>I know you've hired people from your playerbase, and I know you have several serious players in your ranks.  I also know why Verant wiped test - which would infer that your employees aren't reporting everything they possibly can about the game back to you, probably because they have real jobs in other departments than Ester's.<P>I spend most of my time these days in the Plane of Growth, which I think is representative of the 'end-game' in Velious for many of us.  It's a challenging zone.  I see Bards trashing their faction for Breastplates, thifling focusers that are ridiculously overpowered (what do they have, a million HPs?) that drop nothing, and to what end?  To prove to us that a group consisting of an Enchanter, Mage, Cleric, Bard, and two Warriors really CAN do anything, while everyone is pre-game buffing or post-game cr?<P>I'm a Shaman, and I used to love my class, but can you possibly understand how disappointing it is to see that a 60 Warrior in PoG gear can reach the STR 'cap' with a simple level 30's STR buff?  What's the point of me achieving the higher levels when I know that the damage difference of who I am buffing is so negligible in the end?  I can't land a single spell on any Treant, so I just melee doing my meager 30pts a round in hopes I see some yellow text at the end.  Newsflash, this ain't fun.<P>When I look around at my feet, the corpses I see are those of hybrids.  If you're a hybrid, and you're reading this now, I can promise you, 100% that you'll even die more than you do today when you get to the Plane of Growth.  That's why Verant removed the exp penalty, and that's why they've just "adjusted" your skill caps on Test - so you won't die so much and give up.  Your spells still really won't work, and your damage will still pale in comparison to the others, but most of all you'll lack the Disciplines to keep you alive longer than a minute or more.  Add in a Nilipuss with hundreds of thousands of hit points and you can see why it just feels so *empty*.<P>My point is that all of this, including the Donal's BP debacle, is just a side effect of an ineffective testing procedure on the EQTeam, Brad.  <P>Get a sampling of real players, copy us to test, and have us playtest your new zones with GMs watching.  Schedule raids.  Let us get together on Sundays and playtest a zone.  I know you've done this sporadically in the past, and I know we'd do this for free - but organize it and see what we'd really do.<P>I never want to hear the excuse of "300,000 players discovered this or that" because it's simply insulting - we all know that 300,000 players don't have access to Trakanon, or this BP, or any of this stuff.  Sure, the number sounds good, but it's irrelevant.  I mean seriously, it doesn't take a real genius to figure out that a Warrior can go into a Discipline and a Cleric can CH him over and over again.  I saw this on the second day of Velious at the Geonid caves in The Wakening Lands.<P>We want EQ to be better too, and if you truly believe that we're so important, then get us involved in your testing procedure.  We can really make it better.<P>Best,<BR>vOzz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why not fix the Velious mobs to not be so ridiculously Magic Resistant so other classes can participate in fighting in those zones.  As is, it was obviously released to be a new puzzle for the uber-no-lifers to solve and they solved it.  <P>They have figured out how to kill your new WOOT challenging mobs but overwhelming them with Clerics and Melee damage instead of spells wow who ever would have thought of that?!  <P>Now that the newness has worn off and all the ubers are busily powerleveling their extra clerics warrior and rogues, (gee wonder why I didnt get my new Rogue to level 10 before he was already getting all sorts of Guild invites but my other newbie chrs Bard SK Necro SHM etc dont hear a thing hmm).<P>As it is there really isnt much of a post 50 game for the rest of us and the post 50 life Verant has designed doesnt hold much appeal for many of us who dont relish spending 100's of hours getting to 60 so we can Cleric Warrior a Dragon to death and not get XP because another group in the raid did more Dmg and and not get any loot anyway because 24 people rolled on it or it was someone of a certain class who needs it and then we spend 12 hours saving corpses.
