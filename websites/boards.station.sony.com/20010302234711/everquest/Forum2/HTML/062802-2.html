</FONT><HR>Well I see that Wizard ignorance about mages and druid DD is still alive and kicking, mage and druid dd is nowhere near what wizards have, the only times that mages have damage spells which even come close are at 34 and 49(if you don't count ice comet, which why you wouldn't?) they are both bolts, and both have significantly worse mana efficencies. Wizards have the same edge in dd that mages have in pets, warriors have in tanking, rogues have in damage dealing etc.. its the standard for the game get over it.<P>Wizards have WAY more utility then mages(go ahead look at the lists), and as for pets, I suppose thats everyone that hasen't played a pet class, you know I talked to a cleric 58/wizard 51 I know and he still thought that my pet could solo things that are black to it? OMG. And he is a very experienced player so I guess I can't be to critical. In short I have played a mage and a wizard to high levels you try it and then come back and whine away.<P>Having said all that I DO think that wizards deserve a boost, I think all the int casters nead a major boost. Just don't use ignorant arguments like mage and druid nukes are as good as yours, it just makes you look stupid.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For those who think wizards are ok and have god like DD, please go read the Wizard Talk threads where numerous times parsed logs ahev been posted that demonstrate how on a raid type situation or and experience group daily stuff damage contribution to the fight leaves wizards behind everyone else. Rogues take the first spot, monks and warriors close behind (at least 6-4 times the damage wizard does) and mage and necro pets go do at least 2-3 times the damage wizard contributes.<P>If everyone is so happily agreeing that wizard is a damage caster, then how come it is balanced that they can contribute miniscule amount of damage to the fights? Should not all the classes be roughly near the same level, with damage dealers being the ones that lead the pack? How come you think it is appropriate for a class that has no role in healing or buffing also be the least damaging class?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This set of problems has been plagueing wizards for what seems like forever.  We should have gotten our fixes just like everyone else.  It kills me when VI says that wizards are balenced.  Look at druids...they get access to every type of spell in the game  and yet they are "balenced"  This whole issue is BS Absor.  You guys should have fixed us long ago.  Want proof?  Look at ehe number of discussions that you had for each class.  Most classes had about 5 or 6 .Wizards?  Not even close-13, double that of most othere classes.  That should alone tell you that something is wrong.  We are not unique.  We do not help our groups othere than getting them killed.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>aloha from hawaii all<P>well here are my two cents, and really i have nothing new to add other than my agreement.  i feel no one here is "bashing" the other classes, like the druid or mage, just saying that in the larger picture we wizards are not what we are promoted to be and since we are singular in our design, to do damage, this must fixed.  if we are the unquestioned kings of dmg, then make us so.  as for making us to powerful as a solo machine, i am sure we can think of a way to fix this. perhaps a exp penality while solo, ie less exp per kill on any given mob than say if you were grped.  hehe wow, i hate that idea and i wrote it! bah! but you get the point, we must be fixed, that is clear, we are paying damn good money so i really think some effort should be made AND SOMEONE should let us know its in the works!  hehe finally i should say that i have noticed these problems since i began EQ and as such i have refused to play any other character other than my bard and rogue for i would hate to be a caster and see how bad it really is for me!!! hehe<P>Kalamaku, 53rd wiz on Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Short answer:<P>A single game environment cannot fairly incorporate a balanced PvP game with a balanced PvE game.  The reason is simple:  60 characters ganged up on a single NPC overwhelms the ability of any AI to respond in a 'fair' fashion--so some form of AI cheating MUST be incorporated.  The chosen form of cheating--outlandish hit points and outlandish melee damage--turns EQ into a game that would cause instant death if the same abilities were applied in PvP combat.<P>The chosen fixes are weak because they don't address the central issue:  mudflation in the high level game because there is no logical game design that states how much damage per second each class SHOULD be able to do.  Melees rule because of this and Wizards are pretty much useless, especially as compared with D&D wizards.  So a new spell that does %age damage but only to the RIGHT KIND of creature (boy that is explainable in a fantasy story:  Merlin, the prince of wizards, ran up to the dragon and cast a spell that withdrew 10% of a dragon's blood, but the dragon saved and only lost 5%.)<P>The game needs to be re-designed from the ground up based on the defined framework.  EVERY spell MUST matter in the PvE game.  None of this 'a-list' hogwash.  If it is a spell, it should affect gameplay in some specific and distinct fashion.  (Utility spells affect gameplay by providing the advertised utility...which is why Spirit of the Wolf works and the supposed upgrade, Scale of Wolf, sucks--Spirit of the Wolf is like color tv...scale of the wolf is like color tv with enhanced resolution:  you only notice if you look REALLY closely, and it makes the image muddy when you do.)<P>Shaman stat buffs and shaman/enchanter stat debuffs are really pretty much meaningless.  Shaman protect spell (ac 12-15?? v. the turtle skin 9-11) is almost meaningless in a game where a shaman by 24th level can easily have 510 ac without the buff.  Huh?  A 3% buff?  Huh?  It only really matters if your AC is close to the damage cliff--that inflection point in the damage curve where the damage you take goes WAY down because the monster rapidly becomes ineffective in hitting you.<P><BR>Is it fixable?  Not without imagination on Verant's part.  So far they have shown an unwillingness to admit there is a problem or to imagine a good fix.  There is one out there, but it MUST be imagined...it is going to come out of SOMEONE's cranium...not out of thin air.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ya I'm probably one of the most patient people in game.  Reading these messages about wizzys has me depressed as hell.  I have a good group of friends, my wife plays a bard so I have always had a good mana pool.  Close friends with a Mage and always had nuking competions which she won more often than not.  Have finally hit 51 and feel totally fustrated.  Friend warrior is annoyed that I have my enchanter up to 22.  Play your main he says.  Man I log on as my enchanter sitting at bird house in SK sometimes dont even have to yell LFG I get asked if I want in.  Warriors love me as I can speed them up, casters love me as they have less down time.  And the nukes are quite good, give him tp and I would be really happy.<P>So think enchanters almost broken, never been able to get in a group so easily.  They rock for soloing have soloed every level in my lunch break with either charm kiting which saves lots of mana or get my pet up.  Best of all if it all goes wrong you stun mobs, mez them and mem blur and go sit and get your mana and health back.  Add to that yell "trade breeze for a sow" you always get one.<P>My wizzy struggled to get groups, at level 12 had to beg someone to let me join them in BB.  After that when my wife started playing, we would go look for groups she would get invited and when a spot opened they would let me in.  At about 27 had enough friends that always wanted to explore with me that it was no problem.  <P>So I think my enchanter is going to have fun with a wife running a druid we will have lots of fun.  May take wizzy out so can go to raids till my chanter is high enough to go on guild raids.  <P>But its a bit sad.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, as for the post on us being able to solo....LOFL. I'm a 34 wiz and haven't been able to solo a damn thing in 15 lvls except for Griffs in NK when I can beg or bribe for a sow. I spent over an hour pleading for a group in 13 different zones....guess what...no one wants us. It's rather pathetic too. The really sad part is, that my friends that realize that wizards can actually do something, are all to high to group with yet. I don't even want to think about trying to get in on a big raid that isn't being run by my guild...good luck, unless you're the transportation. Not only that, but we exp too slow...I played for 3 days with my sister down in RM, she was playing a wood elf druid and I a high elf wiz....she dinged twice...I didn't even ding once. We both started at lvl 26, we killed the same things and neither of us hunted without the other....I've watched everyone of my friends blow past me in lvl....whether it's cause they could get groups when I couldn't or just because they plain got better exp off our kills...either way...we won't mention our items either...thank god I managed to get a Dagger of frost before they became no drop....Nice....god forbid Wizards could have an item that could be traded....or a class that ALL we do is cast magic....oh wait...our weapon isn't magic anymore....sorry, am I the only wizard who attempts to keep their weapon skills up too, just incase you need to tank the mob for the last 50 of it's hps? Has anyone actually looked at our epic quest weapon? That is one of the biggest jokes VI has played on us...besides calling us the master of anything (besides taking it up the ***)...I don't know about anyone else but I thought druids were supposed to be pretty good at everything, but not great at any one thing inparticular....sorry, I think they've got us beat in quite a few areas....TPs....they can solo better than anyone I know...they've got nukes or DoTs that are almost as good or better in some cases than what we can do...and they have several pieces of armor they can wear to give them really nice DoTs for no mana and no charges on it....*Looks around* we have an item that does that? Right click a DD and no chages? *shakes her head* we can't even finish our own quests at a reasonable level without help...try doing the Staff of the Wheel quest without high lvl help....**NEWS FLASH** those DW goblins that guard 2 of the pieces...can see through invis.....and they kill you faster than you can blink at lvl 30...especially with 3-4 of them around both pices....and that's another weapon of ours that basically worthless with the execption of the +10 to int...god forbid we could actually use it to attack if we needed to....10dmg, 100 dly....*rolls her eyes*...come on VI....get a clue of what is happening...why don't some of you actually try to play a wizard one day....do it on a regular server....see how well you do...bet you can't get a group and can't solo worth a ....the few things we can solo and actually get exp for are so over camped 90% of the time that it's not worth our time to do....*sighs and goes back to her fletching, one of the few things she can do that's actually in demand once in a while*<P>--<BR>Aurelt CeRosst<BR>Wizard of the 34th Casting<BR>Raiders of the Lost Tavern, Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I wish to respectfully ask Verant if it is their specific intent to limit those classes that can solo, such as Wizards and Necros.  Because frankly this is how it appears to be the case in reality.  While the other classes are receiving significant improvement, wizards are given promises, and necros are being threatened with nerfs, esspecially in the lower levels.  While I am sure that we all are aware of the designed intent of EQ as being a community of players, it seriously appears that soloers are not wanted and/or welcome.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>do any of you really have any clue how to play a wizard. i have never had trouble finding groups ever since i got conflag. Our snare has no tuant factor compared to druids and rangers and if played right we easily do half the damage in a group. try playing a mage sometime and you will see that they did make our spells way less resisted than any other classes dd. On our 50 plus spells they truely made us the masters of DD because all our good damage spells are fast to cast (3 seconds) and each one only takes 215 mana to cast. im sorry our class is nowhere close to broken like most of you claim. Could we use a couple improvements sure, but they are taking steps to improve us. I doubt that Giantbane or Dragonbane will make it to live servers in their current form, but they will make it in someway and wizard will then be the key to most successfull kunak dragon and velious raids. And to date i have never been turned away from a VS raid because of my unresistable DD spells. So quite your *****en and learn to enjoy your class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the new spells are neat, but it will be a long time before I am 60, much more time if these are drop spells.  As for who ever said *they won't let this go live because wizards could tear up Ice Giants*  I am 54 and can aleady tear up ice giants *shrug*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK.  So now wizards are all balanced at Level 1, and because of the two UNRESISTABLE 2000 point DDs at level SIXTY (60), yes level SIXTY, wizards are now balanced?<BR>WT.....<P>I know, you know...how long does it take to get to level 60?  Gee, when experience doesn't make any difference anymore because you have gotten to the highest level in the game, now you allow wizards to do 2000 points of unresistable damage to dragons and giants for 600 mana.  No it's not a 4:1 ratio, but hey unresistable!<P>Hopefully there is more to balancing wizards than giving us better spells at 60.  As you have said before, not everyone will make it to 60 with their characters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hehe I am 52 and I can already tear up Ice giants too. Now that Snare and Root stack, when I group with people to do giants, which is not often, I am able to do 70% or better of the damage. They die fast! But that is Perma. I do not do well in Kunark and forget about Velious. I had plenty of problems killing Cougars at level 47/48. Green creatures over there kill me.<P>Now is that suppose to happen? Heck no! I can see a group of greens killing me, but not one single creature. That just is not right.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062802&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062802&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
