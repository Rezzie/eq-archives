</FONT><HR>Thats a great story, was fun to read - you really do have a talent for writing, thanks for sharing it <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for name changes -:<P>If a character reaches 20+ Verant should not be changing their names, by that time they have started to build friends and a reputation. <P>How much work would it be for verant to keep a log of every character that is created and just check the names the day they are made, i agree names should be kept within the policy, but change names very early in a characters life instead of waiting 50+ levels to do anything.<P>That is the problem in my opinion and is too damaging for a player and should not even be considered.....<P>Would managirl of been so upset if a GM had spoken to her at lvl 5 and decided her name needed nerfing ? (i doubt it with just a few hours played). To wait until she has made many friends, gained a reputation and an online 'identity' is nothing but cruel - shame on Verant.....<P>Peoni Greenleaf &lt;Defiant&gt;<BR>Naturewalker of Tunare<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings Sundog-<P>I never said Managirl Beachbum violates the naming policy. My point in this whole matter is that you can read the policy to suit every need, you want to give yourself a silly name? You can read the policy to justify it. It's all subject to interpretation, just like our judicial system.<P>Keep in mind what the policy is attempting to accomplish, and that simply is to keep out stupid names, and I think everyone should just come to grips with the fact that Managirl Beachbum *IS* a stupid name. So is Swordboy Boatrider and the countless Raistlin/Vegita immitations that run rampant on all servers. Should those names be changed? You bet. Just so you know, I am fully aware my handle on here is "unoriginal" and severly violates the EQ naming policy. I think it goes without saying I have a very different name in EQ, one that I feel matches the atmosphere intended in EQ.<P>Like another poster stated already, the "originality" of a given name is always subject to scrutiny, but when someone busts out with a name like Managirl Beachbum, c'mon, you know your walking on glass.<P>Instead of trying to be rebels and think of ways to circumvent the naming system, how bout lets try to keep it legit?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To the author of the post...<P>Bravo. That was hysterically funny and if you have tendencies towards becoming a comedic writer, I'm sure you'll do well and wish you the best. If not, keep'em coming anyway, a lot of people seem to enjoy them, and I know I certainly do. Even if it is terribly depressing to me sometimes.. (I primarily play a Necro.. quack)<P>As for Managirl Beachbum, no, it's not offensive. That's not the part of the naming rule she violated. No phrases. Mana-girl, two words = phrase. I'm sure she was a great player, and I too have had a lot of cool people around since beta with silly names, but she shouldn't let it end her world so dramatically. The GM should change it to something more appropriate, but of course I'm sure they would if she petitioned and asked for a reasonable new name (that didn't violate the policy) of her choice. To quit the game over something like that that she should have seen coming is a bit silly. However, it is just a game, play it for whatever amusement it brings you.<P>If the GM really was just being an excessive jerk, yes, of course Verant (just like any professional company) should apologize and offer her a concession (perhaps a free month as is the usual type of comp).<P>-Ashtaroth<BR>Hopeless Necromantic.. quack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Darkwyrm, heh, I think you misread my post. I used "Gandalf" and "Drizz't" as examples specifically BECAUSE I see millions of them running around with impunity.<P>I do however agree completely with your point.  Why was SHE singled out when the woodwork is crawling with clones?   But more importantly, why was she singled out when the woodwork is also crawling with OFFENSIVE names that surely would be a priority to remove? (Note, I don't mean Gandalf and Drizz't when I say offensive...by offensive I mean names like "Ikickurnuts" and worse).<P><BR>Mithrandael, I don't consider Managirl Beachbum a stupid name, though I can understand that you or others might.  But then, I do appreciate the lighter side of fantasy (eg Piers Anthony, Lawrence Watt-Evans, some Pratchett, etc) as much as the more dramatic side.  [Not saying you don't by the way.]<P>Since it is hard to avoid Lighthearted names on NPCs, why should Players who are of like spirit be denied that privelege?<P>Regarding originality, well...even if you use a random jumble of letters to make up a name, odds are that someone will read some meaning into them if they try hard enough.<P>Also, even the best intentioned originality often results in unintentional duplication of an existing name from a fantasy, or non-fantasy source.<P>What do you have in mind when you suggest sticking to the naming policy?  I mean, in context of your posts?<P><BR>Ashtaroth-Inn, you are saying that Managirl violates naming policy because: "No phrases. Mana-girl, two words = phrase." <P>Well, on that basis, what about Lonewolf, Starcat,<BR> Blackdog, Blackwolfe, Dragonson, Foresthealer, Treeheart, Heartlorrd, heck even Sundog?<P>[Note: Sundog is my enchanter's name on Rathe, one word, taken straight out of Webster's dictionary.  Look it up if you want to see what it means or inspect me ingame  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  .]<P>My point though, is that, even in real life, even in mediaevel times, I'm sure you will find fantasy-sounding names that can be seen as two words, or actually taken from two words to form one.<P>Bottom line though, regardless of whether she violated naming policy, for whatever reason, according to CS policy (if I understand it correctly - I suppose I could be wrong here) the GM should have allowed her a little time to think up an alternative name, rather than just plonk any old nonsense name on her.<P>I suggest she petitions to at least get get her name changed to something she can find playable, as from the information provided I suspect either the GM didn't give her time, or else she was too upset and switched off (the "oh do whatever you want" syndrome).<P>I'm sure that the extenuating circumstances would allow a reasonable GM to allow a namechange, as it was a GM change in the first place rather than simply a character unhappy with their own choice of name.<P>Lastly ... "Quack"  LOL. Classic!

</FONT><HR>Ok the 1st part of the post was as cute as can be!<BR>About Managirl.....well GMs don't wander around looking to change names. They change naems that have been reported to them. So managirl probably did something that angered another player and they, in turn, reported her name to get back at her (because it WAS no offensive) Most people are not going to report a name if it not offensive even if they think it is less than fantasy. I have numerous characters and yes I have had names changed. It is not pleasent when it happens (even if you know the name may be boarderline) For them to quit EQ over it......I don't know I find it a bit childish. Get over it. I enjoy playing, after my name was changed on my 1st character I went back over the name policy a few times to choose a better name for my other ones. If I have a boardline name I try not to anger anyone. Sorry managirl lost her name, but it happens get over it, either leave or play. Don't make a big issue over it.<P>my 2cps</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About the whole "Who's world is it" argument, You can argue this either way, but let me ask one question. You say that if all the players left, then EQ would be nothing. How likely is it that all the players would even do that. In my opinion, as a person who would not do that simply because I enjoy playing, you might get a server or two of people to do it, but there is no possible way that you could get EVERYONE to leave. At least not until something better came out. I think that they know this as well, therefor it is their game and ours, but they have the power, we do not. Just my opinion, flame me or whatever, but just thought I would put my thoughts here.<BR>As for managirl, I don't see a problem with her name, it was not offensive at all. But at least they could have given her a chance to change it and let people know what was going on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Merlin, first of all, i believe i mentioned somewhere I don't condone, nor would I leave EQ just to prove a point like this. But I also said IF, meaning that supposing it did happen. As for a new game coming out... www.shadowbane.com My guild is in guild beta, that's atleast 300 people leaving everquest to go there. I can name a few other guilds I know who would leave as well. As far as i'm concerned, I don't want to wait for another game just to have fun. GM Services are the way they are, and they'll stay that way until someone with a blue name posts that there will be change. Personally, I don't think that'll ever happen. All in all, I'm happy with the GAME. The thing is when the game screws up, it's all of a sudden the players fault, because the game couldn't POSSIBLY have been at fault. (Hence the GM policy of guilty until proven again and again and again innocent, and then not necessarily). Oh well, i'm still hopefull, but it's not very idealistic anything will change =(.<BR>          Ach</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The name "managirl beachbum" does not CLEARLY violate any portion of the naming policy.  It is clearly NOT vulgar or offensive in ANY WAY, and so the GM behaved inappropriatelly by changing the name ON THE SPOT, when policy states they will inform the player that there might be a problem and that they might need to change it VIA E-MAIL.<P>"Managirl Beachbum" is not a title.  Compound descriptive words are ENCOURAGED by Verant as long as the words do not make a connective PHRASE.<BR>Both "Managirl" and "Beachbum" ARE compound descriptive words which do NOT make a sentence or a phrase.<P>Neither name is a title (by the definition of a title) OR a reference to a pop-culture NAME or TITLE (like oh, say, "Fires of Heaven").<P>The GM in question CLEARLY did NOT consult the rules, but acted in a very inappropriate, heavy-handed manner.  This is VERY POOR customer relations, and managirl deserves an apology and her name back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"ManaGirl" is NOT A PHRASE!!  It is a descriptive compound word, which Verant ENCOURAGES.<P>"EatMe DoughBoy" would be an example of two PHRASES comprising a SENTENCE which is what Verant doesn't want.  "Backoff Campsmine" "Killsteal Yourmob" .. this is what is meant by PHRASES.<P>Verant PROMOTES the use of descriptive compound words in that very POLICY, and both "managirl" and "beachbum" are DESCRIPTIVE COMPOUND WORDS that do NOT form a larger phrase when connected.  This is PRECISELY the kind of name that Verant is PROMOTING, like "Winterhawk Graymoor" or "Darksoul Dreadheart", etc.<P>Because the name was LIGHTHEARTED isn't a valid reason to take the name ON THE SPOT.  That violates the behavioral policy stated in the rules.  They can only do that when the name is vulgar or offensive, and there's no way managirl beachbum is vulgar or offensive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
