I finally got him to level 6, and I've begun my jeweling and such, in preparation for my enchant line at 8.  I absolutley LOVE the enchanter so far... I remember back with my Warrior, if the group got an add, with no chanter or bard there, the only way I could help was to aggro it, then turn back to the main target, taking a double beating.  It feels so much better to have 2 kobolds add on my group, only to be immeaditly locked down tightly, and enfeebled.  This post has dual purposes.<BR>        First, I'd like any general Enchanter tips I could get from people here.  It seems like a very diverse class, and I'd rather not be given websites that tell me how to play, since I'd like to manage on my own.  Just... General stuff :) That I *should* know.  <BR>     Second, I play on the Karana server.  I can *never* find a group in The Warrens.  If you paly there, and are around my level, I'd be more than happy to group up with you in The Warrens and Stonebrunt until the zones greened out.  :) Names Shiiro if you ever see me on, or my main, Biskinz.  Thanks in advance!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It's been a while for me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Do yourself a favor and make a hotkey for your mez spell.  People <I>will</I> still attack the target you just announced <I>not</I> to attack, but it helps to keep everyone informed with regards to what you're doing.  (Actually I'm bad about this myself...in big crowds or mobs of same-named mobs I tend to skip using the hotkey.  Still, it's a good idea to have one).<P>A good trick to know whether a warrior has taunted enough to get a mezed mob off of you: /assist the mob.  If you /assist your mezed mob and he still has you targeted, then the warrior needs to taunt more.  In cases where you don't have a class who can taunt, either memblur or root the mob before a mez break.  I like root in the later game because memblur becomes less reliable as you level, but it should be fine for your level.  <P>Stuns are your friends.  Eventually you'll want to keep 2 stuns loaded at all times (again, there's debate on this, but I don't go anywhere without my stuns loaded).  These stuns are what let you get off a mez while angry mobs are trying to eat you.  They buy you the time you need to lock things down.  Be aware that stuns also build a lot of aggro  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">  (This actually leads to a tactic I tend to call "brute force" enchanting.  If you've got a pile of same-named mobs and just can't pick out a mez target, run up and dump some stuns on them.  Usually the one the tanks are fighting will stay still, the others will come for you.  Take a few steps back, stun again, and mez.  Not an everyday tactic, and not recommended without a healer watching your health tho  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>When you start using mez on a regular basis, decide what method of timing you want to use.  I still calculate mez timers in my head, but that's just me.  If that's too much trouble for you, get a clock with a second hand or a stopwatch.  There are also some 3rd party programs that will automatically calculate your spell timers for you, but I don't have experience with them.<P>Regarding re-mezing a mezed mob.  Make sure you do this early; that is, if your mez lasts 48 seconds (for example), don't start casting at 47 seconds.  Always allow for cast time and (more importantly) possible resists.  Mobs are much easier to handle when they don't move at all.<P>Charm in a party can be a great help or turn you into a giant mana-sink for the healer.  If you do charm in a group, make sure that everyone knows what you're doing.  I have a macro that announces "Charming %T", casts the spell, then does a /pet who the leader...that way, if the charm sticks charmed_mob01 says "Vihanna is my leader".  It's not always picked up in the battle spam, but it is fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">  As I said, charm is always a risky propisition, but also an incredibly helpful tool (I can recall a couple times where healer and I were out of mana, one or more tanks were dead, and the only reason we made it out was my charmed pet tanking the mobs long enough for us to get out of Dodge).  Rooting whatever mob your pet is fighting also helps on a charm break...that way only the ex-pet rushes you, not both at the same time (this applies more to charm-soloing, but is good to know regardless)<P>It's generally not a good idea to let your mana drop too low for the sake of buffs.  Believe me, you will be in situations where half the party is crying for haste, the other half crying for Clarity, and they all want it <I>now</I>.  Eventually you'll find a mana level that you recognize as a "danger zone"; that is, if you drop below "x" amount of mana, you're going to have problems doing crowd control.  This is especially important if people start clamoring for buffs while you're got several mezed mobs drooling in front of you...just acknowledge their request and get to it when you can.  Enchanters are professional aggro magnets, and we have the tools to deal with it...as long as we have mana.  If you force yourself oom to buff that tank, you'll be hurting if that tank then breaks mez on the wrong mob, or forgets to taunt, or whatever.  Like most things, it's a matter of trust.  I've broken this rule as the sitation dictates (and if I trust the party I'm with), but I try real hard not to.  <P>That's all the general stuff that comes to mind at the moment.  There's literally pages I could write if I sat down and organized it, but then I always did have the tendency to ramble...<P><I>Vihanna Hecateis</I><BR><I>Order of Anqara</I><BR><I>Xegony</I><P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

When a PC is beating on a mob, they will slowly push it backwards.  Simply wait a few seconds, then hit F8 to target the nearest mob...usually you'll target one that isn't being beaten on.<P><I>Vihanna Hecateis</I><BR><I>Order of Anqara</I><BR><I>Xegony</I><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I've redone the whole thing several times as I've leveled, just because of all the new varieties of spells that become available.<P>I have my mind buffs on page 1, primary mez and stuns on 2.  I keep general and self-buffs on 3 (rune, shielding, the current AC buff, cha buff, etc).  4 is my page of haste and slow spells, along with a "zing" (stamina buff) that I like to keep handy, as it does see occasional use.  <P>Let's see (doing this from memory), 5 is faction spell and random useful things (like mana sieve and theft of thought) as well as 2 charms...my current everyday charm and a low-level charm that I use when screwing around in low-level zones (it's fun to go into Crushbone late at night when you're the only one there, charm Emperor Crush and send him on a rampage.  Well, I think it's fun anyway  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/tongue.gif">).  Page 6 I keep root and a selection of nukes (as well my current spell of our single DoT line)<P>I've got a couple pages of utility spells (pillage enchantment, bind affinity, see invis, invis, ultravision, gate, my pet spell, etc), then a page of spells I don't use everyday but that I break out as needed (such as fear, the lowest level mez (for charm soloing), various debuffs, and other such things.  After that is illusions, enchant metal spells, and the "create mana" line.  Everything beyond that is a jumble of spells I never use anymore.<P>If it helps any, the spell lineup I generally use day-to-day is as follows:<P>(1) Theft of Thought<BR>(2) Current Mez spell (I still use Entrance because the recast delay on Dazzle really annoys me.  I keep planning to switch, but never do  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> )<BR>(3) Color Flux<BR>(4) Color Shift<BR>(5) Tashania<BR>(6) Swap slot.  I swap buffs in and out of here, and use it for my slow spell whenever I don't have a shaman handy)<BR>(7) Allure<BR>(8) Immobilize.  I like this better than Root as it casts very fast, and does seem to stick a little better.  That may just be my perception though<P>If I need to put in another long-recast delay spell (such as Boon of the Garou) I'll lose the charm, since I can remem that pretty fast if I need it.  Before I started using ToT I'd keep a Memblur in the #1 slot (or, if in an area where there was a high potential for things hitting the fan, Mesmerization).  Other than that things haven't changed much.  <P>Regarding AoE mez: it's a <I>rare</I> day that I'll cast this thing.  I'm at the point where I can lock down half a dozen mobs with a single target mez pretty easily and in a short amount of time.  Naturally, that took quite a bit of practice before I got comfortable doing it, but it's certainly not impossible.  If I'm going into a situation where I'm pretty sure I could be facing more than 6 at a time, I'll load the AoE.  Otherwise, it collects dust in my spellbook.  This is one of the spells that chanters disagree on, but I find this approach works best for me.  <P>Anyway, I hope that helps.  One thing I dearly love to do is talk "shop" with enchanters  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><I>Vihanna Hecateis</I><BR><I>Order of Anqara</I><BR><I>Xegony</I><BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
