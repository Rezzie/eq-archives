</FONT><HR>I started within the first week EQ was retail.  My first char was an attempt to recreate my D&D fighter.  So I created a dwarven warrior, dumped all my str points into him, the rest to stamina, and went out into the world.<P>Butcherblock had hideously low rates of anything that dropped cloth armor, or even cash, and by the time I was level 7, I was hanging out at the crossroads without even a half suit of cloth.  Needless to say, I was pretty much a chewtoy for stuff at the crossroads, so I said, sc**w this, I'm starting an ogre warrior!<P>So I start a ogre warrior, maxxed strength, and I remember some fun, if stupid, stuff we did.  This was still within the first month of release, mind you.<P>Around level 10 or so, we all decided (my regular evening group of ogres) we'd go kill this spectre thing that was sitting on a hill.  It was tough, but so were we, and we outnumbered it. WHAM WHAM WHAM, we were in serious trouble, and we knew it quickly.  One guy died right there on the hill underneath the spectre's spot.  He had to run in, lead it away, /corpsing, die, do that several times until it was far enough the spec wouldn't reagro.<P>Shortly thereafter, that same guy (a SK) found the hole in the wall that leads to the big portal to the plane of fear.  At that time, fear hadn't opened, yet, but we didn't know that.<P>He and I stripped at the bank and ran there, and he cast invis vs. undead on us and we went in.  We made it all the way to the big portal room, but there was this Cindi woman there, and she'd kill us because we were ogres.  Clearly invis vs. undead wouldn't work on a living woman.  What to do?<P>Well, we hatched a plan.  We'd both run at the portal from different directions, and one of us would make it through!  We started running, she went after him, and I leaped -- boing!  The portal didn't let me through, but bounced me back out.  Then I died to one of Cindi's pets.<P><BR>So from that we learned spectres guarded portals.<P><BR>Four levels later, at level 14, we were in Oasis at the beach fighting alligators.  There was this island with a tower and spectres all over it.  OBVIOUSLY there must be another portal to another plane in there.  No one wanted to try, though.<P>One day this high level group (they had last names, for god's sake) came juggernauting down the beach.  One was an ogre who stopped for about 10 seconds and looked at our ogre party, said nothing, and ran on.<P>What a God he was!  He was head to toe in golden bronze plate armor!  OMG, I'll bet that group just came thundering out of that plane portal!  What adventures they must be having!  Some day I will go in there, and back in Feerott's, too!  My god, the excitement they must experience!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Haha, these are great =)  My turn.<P>My (now) fiance bought this new game, and convinced me to take a shot at it.  I created a Half-Elf Warrioress in Qeynos and promptly drowned in that little river that runs by the bank because I didn't know how to swim.  I almost cried, thinking that I'd have to get out of the water before I could do anything else.  Deleted that character.<P>Recreated the half-elf warrior, made it up to the UNGODLY level of 5, and went to Blackburrow, where I walked right into the hole in the tree.  No way I was ever going to get my body back.  Deleted that character.  Gave up the game, because it sucked. <P>My boyfriend still played though, and I watched him sometimes.  Once, he was standing at the West FP gates, and there was some guy there, doing a trick with a cup he was holding.  He'd jump up in the air, wave the cup around, then fall down, all without spilling the cup!  (later found out this was a monk with a Stein of Mog, practicing Instill Doubt and Feign Death).  I asked, in wonder, what that guy was.  My boyfriend told me about monks, and that was the COOLEST thing I'd ever seen, so I started a monk.<P>Leveled her to about 20ish, then started my shammy, who is now 50+.<P>Kungfoo, if you still play on Tribunal, YOU are the reason I play Everquest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Died quicker than Kato Kaelin's acting career.

</FONT><HR>Either with my very first char.  A human rogue.  I was told by a friend that when I hit 6, I should go and level in BB.  So I get on the boat and get off on the first Island.  I explored and found squat, diddly squat.  I /ooc ed only to find out I had goofed.  So I got on the next boat and went to the next place.  I went in, followed the road to kaladim, never found any really tough monsters.  I decided this was too easy so I would go back to Ecommons.  I got on the boat and was told that I there would be an island before we zoned.  So I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I quickly got bored and decided to see if I could sit on the front of the boat, being a figurehead.  So, I try a couple times.  I jump to far and fall in.  I panicked and swam to the nearest island.  I found a boat of some sort, but I didn't know how to captian it, so I wandered around the island, thinking it was the first or second sister island.  I was suprised to be attacked by several goblins, who were throwing things at me.  I ran around the island once, and hid in the boat.  That's when I /ooced and someone told me how to captain.  I went through the water for about 10 min. but not getting anywhere it seemed.  I soon got to the first island.  I got on, and was waiting for the boat, when out of nowhere I was backstabbed and killed by a pirate.  So I went back for my corpse, and same thing happened.  I went back and instead I was killed by a sister of errolisi.  I went back again and was killed by another pirate.  I went back AGAIN and got my corpse and managed to get onto the boat.  I was waiting when suddenly I was killed by a seafury out of nowhere.  That really isn't a goof, but why I hate oot.  For stupid, I would say when I died as a necro erudite.  So I restarted in the dark.  I had no clue where I was, so I started walking... and fell in the pit and died.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Having turned in the book to the Order of Chaos guy (I was a Shadow Knight, so obviously I should join this 'Order of Chaos' guild), I met up with some friends around level 5 in EC.  Over the next few weeks, the paladin of the group wasted untold hundreds of Lay on Hands on me due to the fact that I was pk.  I also went LD every 5-10 minutes due to, as I later found out, a bad memory chip, which I'm sure amused the gang I hung out with to no end  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Around level 12 I hear about a GM-given quest which I can complete to revoke my pk status.  So, as bravely as anyone can be when addressing the gods, I petition asking for a quest to turn my name back to blue.  The quest given is to retrieve a Qeynos Kite Shield.  Dear god! I think, Qeynos is on the other side of the continent. <P>I kill a few dervs in n.ro to get some cash, stock up on food and water (5 each was plenty!), and begin my journey to Qeynos to find this 'Kite Shield' which I had never heard of (i guessed correctly that qeynos guards carried them, so i figured i'd off a guard and i'd be set)<P>Now remember, since I'm pk on a non-pvp server, I've never been able to be rebound from outside of west fp gate.<P>I eventually make it to south karanas, where a ULTRA HIGH (24) level necro that our gang knew had said to come and hang out, as i would be passing through there.  Him and another necro were killing treants, and I watched in reverent awe as the necros and their pets each took down the massive beasts with these amazing spells (which I guessed must have dealt thousands of points of damage).<P>They also gave me the gp, which if you've ever killed treants there, you know adds up mighty quick.  <P>Anyways, after watching until the wee hours of the morning, the necros are about to pack up, so I decide that I'll continue on to Qeynos.  I thank them for a most enjoyable show, prepare to head out, and see:<P>Xxxxxx auctions, 'Qeynos Kite Shield.'<P>OMG! I give the guy a tell (all I remember is that he's a paladin) and offer all that I have for the shield (about 50pp, if i remember right).  He agrees (of course he did, 50pp was a fortune back then), and I meet him at the hermit house, where he dies for reasons unknown. I wait patiently while he runs back from Qeynos, and eventually make the sale.<P>Now, I have the Qeynos Kite Shield, but the GM had said 'return with a Qeynos Kite Shield' so I of course must run back to east commonlands.<P>Not wanting to take any chances, I ooc asking if anyone wants to run w/ me back to freeport (str in numbers).  Lucky for me a ULTRA HIGH LEVEL (mid 20s) ranger wants to come with, so we head back.  Almost died in east karanas, but her and someone else who showed up saves me.  <P>I eventually make it back, and petition the next day that I have returned with a Qeynos Kite Shield!  Xave shows up and restores my non-pvp status with a bright display of color and magic.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> My first quest I ever completed (but don't tell anyone I bought the shield).<P><BR>And then I discover buffs.<P><BR>Nodda Duma<BR>55 Shadow Knight<BR>Cats In Hats<BR>Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My first char was a human Paladin.  I remember wandering into the spooky uncharted territory of Kith Forest trying to find some Halfling City called Rivervale.  I had bored of East Commons and the map that came with the game hinted at vast unexplored lands beyond Freeport.  Remember, there we no spoiler sites back then.  <P>So I get aggro'd by a Young Kodiak in Kith Forest and run into a nearby building shutting the door behind myself to escape.  For about one and a half seconds I was pretty smug, laughing at how I had outsmarted the bear and ran into a building where he couldn't reach me.<P>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well even though I play a 45 necro, on his Velious newbie day, arrived at the dock.  Decided to get a pet and buff up, so naturally turn CoB on to get mana back.

</FONT><HR>Well, what can I say. Being an Eruid Cleric was hard enough, finding the hole so many times and all. But my dumbest mistake had to be putting practice points in channeling at lvl 31. I always wondered why it was that I would be interuptted so often yet the casting mobs could be nailed on and still pull a spell off. Good Cazic I felt dumb.<P>Yuuno</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048977&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048977&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
