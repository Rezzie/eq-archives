</FONT><HR>OK You got a handfull of other online games coming out soon. lets say 7 or so. now they come out and you decided to quit everquest and go play one of the new online games. lets say eq has about 300,000 people playing. ok lets say 200,000 people leave. ok thats 200,000 devided by 7. thats rufly 28,000 people per game. now each of the new games with think that they have what it takes to kncok EQ off the trone so they will put up lets say 10 servers/shards whatever each. now thats 28,000 devided by 10 which comes out to be ruffly about 1800 people per server. now consitering that all 1800 wont be on at the samem time you will have about 400 on at a time. now being use to having 2000 other people on at a time. you will miss the social structure of EQ, but you wont know that it is the social structre you miss. you will start getting upset at minor things and start talking trash about the new game your playing and that EQ was better etc etc. and after a few bad run ins with problems you will come back to EQ. some will stay but with so little amount of people playing the companies will start cutting back on service and stuff and it will only get worse and worse. That is when you will feal the Grip of Darth Verant and you will come back. cause Everquest rules.<P>thats just my theory at least. yeah there are some holes in it but the basic jist of it is there. take care see you in game </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why that reasoning is incorrect:<P>Say someone made a Days of Our Lives online.  Oh maybe .5% of people who play EQ would leave to join that game.  The rest of the people who play would be brand new gamers who quite possibly never even heard of a MMOG before.  (Especially considering this one would be marketed toward the TV watchers as opposed to the gamers).<P>It will become like radio, with each game appealing to a different audience.  Right now (almost) the only station is Verant, but there's a giant potential customer base out there that hasn't even BEGUN to listen.  They will be drawn in, as new "radio stations" show up to play their tune.<P>~Inka</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, a large percent of those 80 won't make it, but that doesn't change the incorrectness of the original logic.<P>All internet capable people worldwide are potential customers of online gaming services.  If you consider that number of people, (in the millions), then consider how many online games could be supported by that number of people.  Its decent sized number.  So many that I feel saying "the other online games will fail" would be inaccurate.<P>However, I would agree that the numbers may drop a bit as far as how many people are subscribed to each game.  I would say 150k people per game, on the average.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All of the games coming out are RPGs much like EQ that WILL require hours upon hours of time investment (you will not see many people playing more than one).<P>Plain and simple, you ONLY have a maximum of a few million people who will dedicate this time to a game.  Right there the best any given company can hope for is maybe 100k subscribers per month.<P>EQ presently runs on about a thousand boxes (which probably cost somewhere around 5 million total to buy). Maintenance on said machines is roughly 100k a month.  Server bandwith is at least 500k a month.  support, live team, etc. is probably close to 1-2 million a month at least.<P>At costs somewhere in the neighborhood of 2-3 million dollars a month, and revenue of ~3 million dollars a month, a company can NOT compete without a product that does well from go.<P>With 3 (the ones that are actually going to hit the shelves, unlike say dawn or other garbage) BRAND NEW GAMES coming out, and an actual STANDARD to measure up to, how many do you think will be successful?<P>My guess is UO2 (already a big name game) will do well.  Anarchy online should have a fair showing.  <P>This is hardly anything of note.  So maybe EQ's player base will fall to around 200k or so over the next year. BFD.  For a game this old, that is still phenominal.  EQ2 will be out the door soon enough, and then I can guarantee who will be #1 again.<P><BR>Being able to connect to the internet means jack.<P>I can connect to the i-net with a friggin' ipaq, but I certainly can't run a modern game.<P>The other day I bought Alice.  Minimum sys req. on that is 400mhz processor and 64mb ram.<P>That eliminates over 1/2 the playerbase right there.<P>UO2, horizons, etc. Will likely need 800mhz or faster chips, 32mb video cards, etc. as a bare minimum.<P>Regular folks (those who only use their computers for stuff like web browsing) will NEVER be a significant target for online games. (except perhaps on consoles)<P>People seem to think that right now graphics are approaching the state where they are as good as they will ever get.<P>Even some of the new X-Box and PC games in development are a long shot from being as good looking as CG movies, and those CG movies are a long shot from looking like real life.<P>What does this mean?  <P>It means that developers will keep pushing the graphical envelope until the day when I am playing Tekken 27 and can't tell the difference between the fighters in game and the fighters I would see in a real fight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Consoles.<P>When you can play an MMOG off of your PS2, via WebTV or your cable provider, them you will see some real numbers.<P>Meanwhile, Star Wars will bring new players to the table.  Anarchy Online may hit a slightly new audience.  Dark Age of Camelot and Shadowbane will compete with each other to draw some fraction of the audience of the Big 3 (EQ, UO, AC).  I think all will survive until at least 2003.  I think the total market for all these games may be double what the Big 3 have now.  Given that the US economy doesn't go into a tailspin, we'll see 6 or 7 viable large scale MMOGs this time next year, plus smaller online RPG/FPS/RTS games.<P>After that, I'm not sure what happens.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some companies like World Fision (Atriarch) are learning that people don't have hours upon end to spend playing an online game so they are taking that into account and adding scripts (macros).  Your character can accomplish tasks while you're sleeping, working, spending time with family etc.  I think this will attract a few gamers and I think this is one game that will succeed.<P>I honestly don't think every game coming out will succeed though.  It just depends on how well they market their game first and then it will depend on how good a job they did in putting their game together.  I also don't think the games that do succeed will succeed on the same level and in that I mean some games will have a decent following that will allow a modest profit and others will rake in money (for a while anyway).<P>In looking in my little cracked crystalball I see players flocking to the games with the most hype upon release then gradually those numbers will level off as they learn which game fits their playstyle the most.<P>EQ won't die but I see EQ2 and UO2 going head to head simply because those two games carry a lot of weight in the online gaming world and people will expect a lot from them.  <P>But there's always room for a sleeper or two that might de-throne both the heavyweights so who knows...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>My picks:<P>DAoC upon release then Atriarch when it's released.<P>Morgian<BR>www.atriarch.com<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Yes, the vast majority of people want to avoid PvP in the current MMORPG's available.  However, couldn't that also be because they aren't really designed for PvP?  Let's face it just because PvP around the EQ engine is bad, that doesn't necessarily mean PvP on new games will be.

</FONT><HR>It wouldnt take that much to keep EQ on top a long time. FoH wakens the sleeper (after its fixed) and he goes and destroies the world. then you move some npc's around change the color of the sky. add a few graffics here and there. and wham the whole face of norath is diffent. sol b is now a n00b dungeon, befallen is a lvl 60 dungeon that leads to the Plane of power etc etc. sorry got off the topic there.<P>as for me EQ will be the last online game i will play. I invested close to 2years in this game at like an average of 8hours a day. I cant see myself doing that all over on some other game. if EQ 2 comes out thenI would probaly try that since I know abiouot the game already. but alot of people have played EQ for so long that they are used to it already. look at Diablo 2 I know alot of people that left. then got up to like lvl 80 and came back cause it was either borring or there was no social stucture or it was repeditive. the people that didnt go there from EQ are still playing it and having fun. but I honestly dont thing that EQ will be hit that hard by some of these new games unless they are extraordinary. most people are so use to everything about eq that these newgames will not beable to fill that void that eq left in them. or something like that</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Justs my opinion, yet anyone who is tired of the class system or customer service has a much better time with one of these other games.  There's alot more than 7 or 8 coming out, though there might only be 7 or 8 that attract a good number of players.<P>Anyway, EQ has ignored many issues way too long for many people to have any "brand loyalty" to them.  Time invested might be a factor that keeps people here, but I thought that games were meant to waste time and have fun.<P>If you are staying because of the time invested in your character, are you having fun playing the game, or is it that you just don't want to go through the tedious task of leveling up/developing your character.<P>That is supposed to be the entire appeal of a game, to create and level a character. I'm not trying to preach on the almighty way to play an RPG, but this is the philosophy I think many people will come to, and therefore quit EQ for either a new gaming experience, or a more fun gaming experience<P>My 2cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Well, lots of people are going to try out the new games no matter what.  But Verant needs to hook these people now, so there is a good chance they will come back.<P>I fear they don't have a clue on how to do that.  And the so-called "class balancing" is just going to make more people p-off'd and not want to return to EQ.  Not where have they said they are adding FUN to the game....<P>Thats just my opinion, I could be wrong.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>EQ has shown that a MMOG can be successful. <P>I think that many EQ players would welcome a new game simply because it would be something different. <P>The biggest challenge for a game like EQ is to hold people's interest. I think that people are begining to get tired of EQ, and are ready for a fresh start at a new game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058589-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058589-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058589&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058589&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
