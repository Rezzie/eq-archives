</FONT><HR>----<BR>As I've said, yes, there are technical reasons to prevent target illusion (formerly called copycat in this thread) from functioning without a change to faction. (...) But don't let that distract you. Just accept that there are technical reasons that faction is linked to body form, and that changing that would be a huge effort and might cause a bazzillion other problems.<BR>----<BR>Thanks for the honest and clear reply  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>----<BR>Well, there are also other ways to change someone's gender, if you're a GM… It probably was not the Gender Illusion spell that you witnessed, as that spell never worked.<BR>----<BR>It would be a great (and not unbalancing) addition to the fun aspect of the class.<BR>Would you try to convince the design team to take the idea into consideration ?<P>----<BR>For reasons mentioned by others here. Just as enchanters want to be unique for their ability to do illusions, other classes would like to keep the uniqueness of being able to transform into things that nobody else can.<BR>----<BR>Agreed. But keep in mind that enchanters are not disappointed because other classes gain new "appearances" (if you think that the "illusion" term isn't exact) they don't get themselves, but because others have gained since release *a lot* of new appearances, while enchanters only gained the meager Iksar illusion, thus they believe that the illusionist aspect of the class is beeing slowly stripped from them.<P><BR>----<BR>I want that too. I'm not saying that it won't happen. I'm just telling you that it's very unlikely you'll see a copycat spell, and I – personally – am against the idea of giving enchanters the forms of bear or spectre (though this will not keep me from mentioning it to the team).<BR>----<BR>If the Copycat spell is unfeasible, very well, but would it be possible to implement "illusion gender" and/or a couple of new illusions ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, thanks for taking the time to answer this post and for paying return visits.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>No, actually that code was created very specifically for the spell that it was used for. Honestly, a bit of coding magic was done to create it. And it was most certainly done to make the summoning spell, it wasn't some sort of holdover from some attempt at creating an illusion for enchanters. And, well, I don't think it was a bad decision. It's a great spell, and one that was warranted for magicians. If we had created a spell that allowed enchanters to turn into anything in the zone and had not created the Summoning spells, I imagine that some passionate magician might very well have written this post from his or her perspective…<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>That's the core of the problem. Magicians did not ask for the ability to summon a random mob as a pet. Enchanters have asked to get the ability to cast Illusion: target for a long time. <P>Everyone understands that your resources are limited and therefore you need to set priorities. <P>That is the very reason why enchanters get a feeling of bitterness.<P>You made the wrong choice in putting your programmers to work on a difficult change in code to allow for something that was not asked for.<P>To remove or to work around the faction adjustment from Illusion:target could not have been more difficult to implement than Summon:random pet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Now you have WAY over powered them.  /em sarcasm  Not like they were overpowered to begin with or anything like that. /em sarcasm off.  THERE IS NOTHING UNQUE ABOUT RANGERS!!!!  No unique armor no spells ("enchant weapon" spells should go to Enchanters, most a Ranger dont need) NO NOTHING that visually sets them apart.<P>Bards, and Druids get greenish looking armor.  Tolans Darkwood Armor is BROWN!<BR>Newbie 1 says:  HEY LOOK ITS A BLOOB OF DOG CRAP RUNNING AROUND!<BR>Newbie 2 says:  WOW YOUR RIGHT!<P>That is something we really need.  Most people don't look for Rangers in a grouping situation as it is.  The last thing they would want is a bloob of dog crap hanging around them.<P>The guy that started this post is 10000000% right.  YOU, VERENT, ARE MAJORYLY BLURING THE LINES BETWEEN CLASSES!!!!!!!  Enchanters were told they would be getting enchant weapon spells sense DAY 1!  Yes over 2 YEARS now!  AND YOU VERENT GAVE IT TO RANGERS!!!!  *** does a RANGER need an enchant weapon spell for?  It completly goes against the role-playing aura you are suposidly trying to create.  I to am disqusted by your lack of honesty on this matter.  There was a OVER A YEAR(!) before a expansion came out to address the no enchant weapon type spells (yes I know there self only "buffs" but there still enchant weapon type spells).<P>You guys have made great strides but you seem to be taking most of them with your heads up your dairyais.<P>P.S.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I am going to take some time here to pen down my thoughts not only on this current Enchanter issue, but on the Enchanter class generally.<P>I have been playing the Enchanter class since the game was released. In many ways I have watched as the class has developed from being seen as weak, almost to the point of being useless, to being recognised as one of the most powerful classes in the game. <P>I have also seen many of the eldest Enchanters question the Enchanters role in EQ as they have grown more experienced. This occurred most heavily when the level cap remained at 50. In the planes and on the two dragon raids available Enchanters were useless crack machines pumping out clarity. For a long time there was a despondency in the Enchanter class as we felt ignored and unlistened to as we explained how this was unfulfilling. With the increase in the level cap this has been alleviated to an extent. We can now mes effectively in the planes of the original release, and in some areas of Kunark, but in many ways enchanters still feel as if they have received the short end of the stick.<P>Before I go on I should explain where I am coming from. I see the Enchanter class as one which can perform miracles. They are the class which turns certain death into a victory. They are the class who are trusted to do their job even in the most trying of circumstances. Their true roles lie in crowd control, through the use of mes and charm, and in the area of buff and debuff. It is to these two areas I will discuss in just a moment.<P>I'd like to reflect for a moment on what the Enchanter was once able to do with their illusions. Once upon a time Enchanters were the best of scouts, able to vastly adjust their factions and reconnoitre. The design team decided that at high levels this was making dragon and plane raids too 'easy' to recover from and almost totally removed the ability. Nowadays there is a very limited use of collaboration at high levels to assist in scouting new areas, but by and large illusions have become pointless. Most of the statistic benefits from illusions are irrelevant to the class (unlike the shaman illusion), and generally they are just for looks. The only enchanter illusion really beneficial is more of a buff than an illusion in the guise of the new Boon of the Garou spell, but its long recast and short duration make the spell useless in all reality. <P>The design team fail to realise that an Enchanter only has 8 spell slots from a total of 211 possible spells. Whilst many of these are lower level, in most circumstances the Enchanter will have approximately 20 useful spells at any given time. Both the Wandering Mind spell, and Boon of Garou waste these slots horrendously. I will discuss this further in a moment.<P>Fundamentally the issue with illusions as I see it is this. There are two reasons why enchanters should have self-only long duration illusions at higher levels. Firstly, because they are illusionists. They are the one class who should be able to alter their form better than any other class. It is NOT an appropriate response to say "but you can already change to all the races". The issue at hand is that NO other class should be capable of turning themselves into something that an illusionist cannot if they are truly the master of illusions. If the illusions are with no statistical benefit then I do not see the problem. I understand the position that other classes deserve to have unique abilities to increase their enjoyment. And I do believe that this is a very valid point. The thing which grinds on the Enchanters nerves is that Enchanters have been told time and time again there is insufficient memory to add illusions. For a long time I argued for a goblin form illusion, a froglok form illusion or something which other classes do not have and was told there was no memory. Not a month after being told this a LARGE number of items received upgraded models. The point is that Verant's position on this issue changes in the wind as they come up with a new reason to deny requests to give the enchanters high level illusion spells.  The claim that new illusions would provide faction to allow running anywhere they wanted is simply ignorant.  The change to the faction of the spirit wolf illusion displays quite clearly that any faction (or none) can be associated with an illusion.<P>The issue of higher level illusions is no different to that of higher level summons for mages: the class feels incomplete without something to show their mastery of the craft. At this time Verant is failing to meet this perception from a large portion of the Enchanter community. It is this reason why their is so much unhappiness.<P>Leaving illusions aside for a moment I would like to reflect on other matters about the class at this time. Firstly Verant have to decide what the point of the Enchanter class is. We know for certain they are not considered a PvP class any longer since they removed the ability to charm or fear players on PvP servers, severely altered the mana sieve spell, and made high mr on players so easy to achieve that Enchanters in most situations may as well not bother casting at all. Verant have never made any substantial restitution to the destruction of the Enchanter PvP characters, and this commentary wouldn't be complete without mentioning this fact even if they are a smaller portion of the overall community of Enchanters.<P>Leaving PvP aside though there are still some common issues with the PvM Enchanter which we are most familiar with:<P>Firstly, the lack of a truly powerful MR debuff. Even though the Enchanter has an unresistable debuff of MR, the addition of unresistable debuffs to other classes which remove MORE than the enchanters was a blow. Especially considering that ALL enchanter spells are magic based. The level 57 spell Tashanian should reduce MR by 60, currently it is only slight better than the level 49 spell. This would be a great improvement in at least helping enchanters land spells on higher level monsters.<P>Secondly, the imposition of requiring only high level mes spells against high level mobs and players. The mana costs on these spells are obscene for the shortness of their duration. Whilst it is acknowledged that being able to take a monster of level 55 or higher out of action for a lengthy period is a powerful ability it also makes the Enchanter incredibly hampered. Most especially in Velious in zones where many mobs cannot even BE mesd. Now in this circumstance what is the Enchanters roles? They can cast clarity spells. hastes and Runes. There is no point casting slows as shamans quite deservedly excel in this area, and there is little point to their debuff as the unresistable high level shaman ones are also more powerful. Their group magic resistance is nice but easy to share around. So tell me - what is the role of the Enchanter in 55+ areas of Velious?<P>We have zero offensive capability in all truth, our charm spells don't work with any serious duration if at all, we cant mes. All we can do is every now and then right click on our epic weapon, and give the casters their mana drugs. <P>Our new Velious spells are pathetic. Three spells who have the sole purpose of increasing base mana with a pathetically low tag-on of mana regeneration is simply a joke. What enchanters needed were spells to make them viable in high level encounters and they received nothing in this regard. <P>Enchanter equipment is also way off the scale of practicality. Enchanters need only three things: Mana, HP, and AC. Whilst there rages a debate on the usefulness of charisma there have been numerous player tests to show that fundamentally charisma doesn't really make any difference once its over 150 (some say 120). Like the Agility cap of 75 Charisma isn't that important. Enchanters get hit. Our equipment should seriously help us to have a higher AC and overall Hitpoints than any other pure caster class, but it doesn't.<P>This COULD have been helped with our Velious spells but instead we received 3 spells which will never be cast unless the enchanter is bored with too much time on their hands (which probably will occur since for al intensive purposes they have zero combat role in many high end Velious zones), and an illusion which is pretty much a waste of a slot.<P>Lastly, and I bring you back to the issue of the long recast spells - if Enchanters are going to be reduced to buffers at high levels (because shamans totally destroy the enchanter when it comes to debuffing) then they need to be improved. It is all good and well to say but you can haste really well! But to be perfectly frank I would be very disappointed if the sole purpose of my class was to cast haste every 30 mins on the group. If that is what we are - high end buffers - if that is what the class is going to be reduced to, then our spells need to be modified at high levels to reflect this. <P>NO Enchanter spell (with the exception of the fixed duration charms) should have a recast time of more than 30 seconds. If they ARE going to be longer then these spells must be of such power that they last SIGNIFICANTLY longer, or provide SIGNIFICANTLY more benefit in the given buff or debuff. Enchanters need to be able to hot swap their buffs whilst maintaining their basic required spells of a mes, charm, stun, and tash (for what use it is). <P>Enchanters should receive more powerful spells besides simply haste buffs. They should receive the highest AC buffs (preferably in a group form), or alternatively receive a variety of group or targeted illusions which provide different benefits. A group innate cold, poison, or fire (etc) resistance illusions, or an illusion which provides group water breathing or levitation. This would provide enchanters with the ability to choose different illusion buffs of USEFUL consequence at higher levels. The memory to do it IS there and it IS available and it WOULD make the game more enjoyable not only for the class, but for players who would receive the benefit of a class which has a more significant role and purpose within the game.<P>The Enchanter class IS powerful. No one denies that. However the class is also going stale at higher levels because in many circumstances the class suddenly changes from an action packed crowd controlling crack dealing charming UNIQUE class, to a mana/haste/rune battery. There ARE alternatives to fix it, even if it means a need by the design team to reassess what the Enchanter class is really all about.<P>Baelish<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor and his copycat illusion issue....that's a silly objection to having the spell.  As someone already pointed out...just remove the faction aspect from that particular spell.  Too difficult to do so?  How so?  As it stands now if you charm a NPC and tell him to "guard here" then go off and leave him...he will get attacked by the same mob types that would attack you.  Hence HIS facton has changed now that he's a pet.  Example, you charm Orc1 and put him on guard duty, Orc2 walks by, sees him, attacks Orc1 because he's a High Elf pet.  Is Orc1 no longer an Orc...or no longer appear as an Orc?  Of course not...his FACTION has changed as a result of the enchanters spell.  So how is this SO different from a copycat illusion.  IE:  You cast Copycat illusion on Orc1 from a distance, now you appear an Orc, Orc2 walks by and attacks you.  That's how the spell should and could work...simple.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Baelish:<P>Wow great post.  I think you pretty much captured the frustration that most enchanters feel but lack the ability to express (at least as eloquently).<P>It's even more frustrating for myself since I have no desire to play a different class.  One thing i always loved about the enchanter class was the variety of ways you could play it.  You could use different grouped tactics and a number of soloing ones as well.  The variety has become increasing more restrictive as the levels progress post 50.  In fact it's becomeing so formulaic (sp?) as to rob the game of entertainment.  I still enjoy the game and the class but would really welcome some of that pre-50 diversity the class enjoyed.  Sadly there's no going back, having started several different classes i always end up getting bored with them and going back to my enchanter.  I guess i can only hope that Verant will take some of the suggestions that Baelish made and put them to good use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, causght the bulk of this thread on casters realm, and with a quick scan I see I haven't missed anything else relevant. I'm no master of debate, and likely I'm here a little late to make a difference or get an answer, but I've defended this issue amongst a few friends so I feel obliged to ask a few questions that haven't come up.<P>Backround:<BR>I play an enchanter. The leveling aspect is slow for me, reason being I should have played a necro instead of trying to solo a chanter (silly stubborn me, hehe). I selected my class after carefully reviewing the prima play guide and it's info regarding the classes. I was warned even that early that I would be playing a grouping class, and I didn't care cause I wanted to have fun with illusions. That was primary, and this is meant to illustrate that in at least one instance the other powers you've given enchanters are cast aside for the neat factor of illusions. BTW, odd fact, the guide says Illusion:Gender is a lvl 51 chanter spell (shrug, didn't know it wasn't til now). And I am aware of the disclaimer. Pardon my long wind, the point being I started a chanter ONLY cause they had the illusions.<P>Issue<BR>Illusion: Target<BR>Why not?<BR>You guys make the world, understood. I'd like to see it happen, yes, I know you said it wouldn't, yes. But why? I'm no coding/balance expert. But I can deduce a bit, given info.<P>Global memory? Illusions drop when you zone. It'd be local, no moss snakes in VP, etc. Presuming I have a correct understanding of the definition of the term, this is a non-problem within this issue. If not, for the sake of curiosity, what is the definition? And if there is a problem with Illusion:Target and global memory is there a compromise possible for what exists in that memory that we do not have illusions for?<P>Lag? What sane defense is there for this after Illusion:Spectre and Summon:Monster? Unless those spells have already put lag at it's limit, in which case I'll spare you the 'It's not fair' treatment as others have expressed themselves doubtless as well as I could. Overpopulation does more for lag, and that's a situation that's being remedied by server splits. Is this an up and coming solution for this aspect, should it exist?<P>Unfair travelability? Yank the faction bonus, leave us the same faction we had in trueform. Seems like a pretty simple compromise. My hunch would be this would be a reduction in the illusion code, and would thereby not allow for near total code portability as with racial illusions, but then again is development time really a valid excuse? If so, give us a date and keep moving it, don't care, just give us a promise. The PvP people have a fair gripe about the potential of this to be disruptive, what if our name was displayed regardless of form? Shouldn't even require code unless we target something with no name anyway, back to the development argument. A mob level limit might also help some circumstances, i.e. a Cazic Thule in every raid party. If you can't mezz or charm it, you can't take it's form. You could further penalize it by making it a KoS taunt on the target, but this would make the spell near useless for fun.<P>Unfair to other classes? I'd say they got their treats lately, gripes are gonna happen regardless, as evidenced by my post and this thread. It comes from people seeking change, for good or ill it's the CS solution chosen by Verant. It's up to you as a company to choose or change that. We're doing it like we've been told, and the more irksome people are the price you pay for hearing the helpful bits.<P>Bottom line, this spell would be intended for fun. Other aspects, abuses, and exploits could be researched and eliminated, you won't hear complaints from the majority. Try this. Declare intent when releasing the spell. Warn people that it's intended for fun, and tell them to expect no use of it outside RP. Tell them it's gonna get nerfed if it has an exploit.<P>It's the same story whenever you grant a request to a class/race/whatever. Others will chafe, citing their unheeded gripes. Understood. But why waste conference time with the coders/balancers/execs on who's ahead in the tit for tat department and who deserves an answer. If you really said a thing was one way and it wasn't, or if someone else got something before we did, does that really entitle us to anything? I think the time would be better spent solving problems. Lastly, what can we do to propogate this process? Other than beg and debate, that is?<P>I thank you for your time and patience, and hope to hear from you. I pray this issue isn't dead yet.<P>Kiriskhon, Enchanter of Brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It was quite a surprise that finally someone from the staff answered to the Illusion discussion which has been going on here for quite a long time without anybody noticing but, Absor, you should have read more than the one post you responded to and you would have realized that your answers in quite a few cases are not valid (I've posted the things I'm going to say here already a couple of times on the boards here):<P>1) Illusion: copycat.  I think that the faction excuse is a pretty lame one as your code decides which faction is awarded to the caster after he/she casts an illusion. So if your code leaves in the original faction there's no problem. Or if the code puts in kos to all faction (like there is for wolves, snakes and such), again, no problem and even more limited use. The only argument against that solution would be that it is illogical why other goblins should attack you under illusion goblin, but that's easy to be explained: because it's a fun spell without a use which would unbalance the game (and you could even argue that they have excellent noses and you just "don't smell right")<P>2) Illusion: copycat has been suggested with level limits. If you're worried high-level copycat spells could be exploited (I don't see how without faction) then put in at least a very low level one. I don't see anyone gaining much by turning into a snake or spiderling.<P>3)You're arguments concerning the difference between "illusion" (enchanter) and "turning into" (everyone else) is nice but it doesn't get to the point. Fact is that enchanters don't get SOW and we don't get it under a new name ("it's an illusion and it just LOOKS like they had SOW on") but other classes get illusions with new terminology. If a class is not supposed to get something you argue that this is not "what the class is about" and if you decide to give a class something you give it a name which makes it fit more. You're playing semantics, not us... (I understand that enchanters can't "turn" into bears but as it is we can't "illusion" bears either, so where's your point?)<P>4) To the poster you answered to (sorry, forgot the name) you said that illusion: spectre has to be reserved for necros because it has a coolness factor and should remain unique. But when that poster argued that by enabling mages to let monsters fight other monsters (with their new summoning ability) you took away a huge coolness factor from the enchanter class (enchanters were the only ones who could - with quite some risk in most cases - let a sand giant fight another) Now mages can do the same without any risk at all (their pet won't suddenly turn upon them) and now tell me you're not taking away something from us... What I really don't like about your style of arguments is that you always turn them around the way you need them. It's that for the necro class but it's something else for the enchanter class...<P>5) Your argument (to argue for the weapon proc spells hybrid classes received recently) that enchanters (and shamans) are the only classes to be able to create magical items is also not true. Enchanters *cannot* create magical items. What we can do is enchant a bar of metal and ask some other classes (shamans, priests) to add their share so you can make something if you happen to be a High Elf or Human and specialised in smithing. If you're a Gnome or Erudite you can't do a thing with your enchanted metal bar.<P><BR>I started my enchanter because it used to be a cool class. I know that Verant is reluctant to give enchanters anything because we are a very powerful class (crowd control, mana regen) but the fact that you're needed for a raid doesn't mean that your character is fun to play. Although in my opinion enchanters pay quite a high price for their powers (crowd control when failing gets you killed quickly, soloing is harder than for other classes) I'd gladly give away some of that power if I could retain some "coolness", "uniqueness" for my class. But it seems that the Gods of Norrath have no liking for people who are not about killing their creations all day long so they refuse to add a few fun spells. I used to be able to entertain people by charming some greeny and make it hail me as "Master" and "Splendid One" but that won't be much now that every mage is running around with another monster who does their every bidding.<P>What really makes me sad is that I've been supporting so many good ideas on the boards for fun elements in the game (which would need no work-intensive balancing and therefore would add quickly new content which would last for much longer than the new monsters and stronger enemies you are constantly trying to create). Don't you see that adding more hack'n'slay content will only last so long?<P>That is also the core problem of trade skills. When you revamped *some* of the skills lately you were adding powerful items and consequently had to restrict the influx of these items. So it's now very hard to make these things and you have to travel far and invest a lot of money. Why don't you add useless (or at least items of very little use) but make components more readily available? Or all the things that merchants sell? Why isn't everything a merchant could sell to a newbie craftable with easily attainable components? Or food. Why isn't it possible to cook a couple of foods from stuff you get from a single zone? (without having to hunt in three different zones or having to buy half the ingredients at the shops) Why isn't there a snack I can prepare while on the go without me having to bring half the cooking merchant's supplies with me?<P>Well, the trade skill rant is somewhat off topic here, so I guess I'll leave it at that. But concluding I have to say that arguing that the coolness of the necro and shaman class has to be kept up at any price and at the same time taking away every bit of coolness and uniqueness of enchanters is what I usually call hypocrisy...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Boon of the Garou is a major buff and therefore has to be restricted both through limited duration and long recast time (you couldn't keep it running on three friends during a social meeting). While I thank you for a nice spell like that it is not that we're now not happy after we got what we asked for. It's that Verant doesn't *listen*: we wanted illusions and not power. The reason why the original poster complained about Garou was that it can't be used for fun and social occasions and that is a fact. That problem could be easily solved, though, give us another version of the same spell without buffs but longer duration. *That* was what we were asking for...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That was NOT my intent.  But, strange as it seems, I HAD checked into the credits of the original release of EQ and HAD already compared it to the credits listed in the release of Velious. And, frankly, what I saw, SCARED ME.<P>For the Original Everquest the following are listed as programmers:  Steve Clover (lead), John Buckley, Kevin McPherson, and Roger Uzun.<P>For Velious there is no lead but the 4 listed are: Steve Clover, Roy Eltham, Todd Schmidt, and Roger Uzun.<P>So, what I recognized in that list was that one half of the programmers were different.  Perhaps I was wrong to conclude that Roy and Todd had moved on to work on Star Wars, but 2 out of 4 programmers ARE different.<P>And without listing names (but I will if you really want me to)  there were 10 "additional Programmers" listed for the original EQ.<BR>In the Game Credits of Velious, there were only 3, and NONE of those 3 were involved in the Original EQ.<P>So, out of the original 14 programmers listed in the Original Everquest release, only 2 are still listed as programmers for the release of Velious.<BR>Simple subtraction tells me that 12 of the programmers who worked on the Original Everquest were no longer working on Velious.  I concluded (perhaps in error) that they were picked to work on Star Wars.<P>Again, I didn't mean that as an insult.  But it IS a fact that 12 out of 14 have left.  And my experience tells me that THAT is a HUGE Brain Drain, and a possible reason that some things that were once doable are now the stuff of dreamers, like Enchanters.<BR> But, I meant no disrespect, and I am certainly thankful that you are at least trying to make some sense of the insanity that is facing your customers.

I had to bust my butt to raise my Iksar faction because even in Iksar form I was still kos to other Iksars. I've found myself to be kos in many places no matter what form I'm in. In Dark Elf form I still must be very carefull in Neriak because I'm still kos to some Dark Elfs. As for new illusions and such I don't believe we will get them I think that has been proven already. I remember I started an Enchanter because I read in the players book that we could enchant armor and items and I thought it was so cool, but it was all a lie. In a few more months it won't make to much difference, the way things are going everyone will have everyone elses spells and we'll all be the same, or at least that's how it seems we are going to end up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, I want to say that I'm pleased you answered my post as soon as you came back to the boards.<P>&gt; Illusion gender, I don't know why that couldn't be done. I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of the things that determines how NPCs react to you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or she might very easily be able to travel anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that we want. I'd never heard the idea of Illusion Pet. It's interesting, though I wonder how odd you'd look? <P>The ability to mimic every living creature doesnt mean automatically that I can travel everywhere. Faction is a complex mecanism of: religion, race, class and deeds. By hunting inside a dungeon, I will become very quickly KOS to the locals. I won't wander without risk everywhere very long. When I first came to upper Guk I wasnt KOS, only dubious. I have visited all the place before beginning to fight there. I became KOS after a few fights, but benevolence was enough to change that. Now i'm KOS even with benevolence. The whole scenario seems ok to me. I dont see any real balancing issue here. Upper guk has no major troubles, right ?<BR>It the same thing in Najena with my elem illusion. I have heard too, that dwarves following Brell can walk inside The Hole with impunity. There are already some cases where some players can wander in dangerous places without risking anything. Rogues can go in nearly every place of the game without risk (but slowly  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) !<P>&gt;&gt;"Even today it's something I simply dont believe. It was blatantly not the true reason,<BR>but you didnt want to tell us the real one."<P>&gt; And by this you are implying, I gather, that the 'real' reason is something nefarious,<BR>such as Verant hates enchanters or something like that. That is, of course, pretty silly.<BR>For every Verant employee that plays one class, there are as many that play another. We<BR>don't favor any class. From a business standpoint that would be silly, and from a gamer<BR>standpoint it would be worse than silly.<P>huh ? Sorry ? <BR>Please dont put words in my mouth. I've never said that you hate my class. Please take the<BR>time to reread my post. The real reason (in my opinion) was given one line later. Quoting<BR>myself:<P>&lt;&lt;A lich/spectre form for necros as the supreme spell of their spellbook should have no rival or else you would lose the really cool and unique aspect of this power. Even if it's only an illusion for enchanters, with no bonuses at all, the fact that another class have it would take a part of the "coolness factor" &gt;&gt;<P>You (VI) told us the reason we couldnt have spectre illusion was due to the high number of polygons for the spectre model, causing lag. I said I do not believe that, since it seems very strange to me. They are many spectres in Oasis and noone complains (well, not about the lag.). My opinion is that spectre illusion was not given to enchanters for another reason than a technical one, despite the fact VI said otherwise at this time. This 'true' reason being given just above. I'm not interested in proving anything against you here. I'm only interested in saying it was a little disturbing to us waiting so long for illusions (err...appearance) and seeing them given to other classes, when in the same times reasons I cant really agree with were given to us.<P>&gt;&gt; A lich/spectre form for necros as the supreme spell of their spellbook should have no rival or else youwould lose the really cool and unique aspect of this power. Even if it's only an illusion for enchanters, with no bonuses at all, the fact that another class have it would take a part of the "coolness factor". (please remember this argument when you'll come to the last section of my post)"<P>&gt;Ok, I'll remember.<P>I wanted to point here a situation where something was not given to another class to not dilute a wow factor. By suddenly giving more illusions (or appearance if you prefer) to mages than enchanters previously had, you are doing exactly the contrary. That is the main reason why I feel "betrayed". Even if the word is too passionate, these are my feelings.<P>&gt; Again, my personal opinion would have it so that only druids and shamans were to get nature-type transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique factor with them, and not giving it to enchanters. Again, that's my personal feeling on it. I'll see if I can get an official response for you on the reasons why. But don't discount the whole uniqueness thing, it's important.<P>You proved my point: "the whole uniqueness thing is important".<BR>I hope my point of view is clearer now. I dont want to complain for the sake of complaining. I really feel sad about the way things have turned out on the appearance topic. People choose to play enchanters for appearance. You take away some of this aspect by diluting the uniqueness between classes. <P>My personal opinion on the ideal EQ would have been : druids/chamans getting the animal changeform spells, necros the undead ones, and enchanters all the remaining humanoid-type ones (not giant ones): gnolls, froglocks, orcs, sarnaks, etc... There are indeed in the game high level NPC enchanters who can turn into exotic humanoid forms. Not players ?<P>&gt;Calling anything we do a 'betrayal' is too strong. And I also think you're using the word 'illusion' for far too many things. Mages have a summon, not an illusion. Sure, in essence it's not that different. But it's not the same thing. Keep in mind, the pet isn't going anyplace without it's master, so the fact that it might be the same as, and thus aligned with, other monsters in the area isn't as big of a gameplay problem. An enchanter with the ability to turn into something in the zone would be a lot more free to do as he or she pleases, bypassing dangers that might not have been intended to be bypassed.<P>It's not a gameplay issue ! It's a roleplay issue for me. I dont feel threatened by mages sending wandering pets inside remote and hostile places. I feel however that it was an enchanter main domain to be able to change forms. Mages here are not really summoning new creatures. The creatures have the same stats as their former pets. In my opinion, a good spell for mages would have been a summoning spell for creatures that have a summoned look : demons, elems, golems, etc... Not the local tiger or Sarnak. <P>&gt; Hang on there. What you're saying now is that we've ruined it because we created it. If. we had given the exact same ability to, say, clerics - not that we would, then we would. have ruined any illusion like that that we might have given to enchanters. So, by the. same logic, if we had just given it to enchanters, it would have been ruined as well. The. 'wow' would be gone shortly because enchanters were turning into things, so we would have. ruined it for enchanters too, just by giving them the spell.<P>&gt; I'm not trying to suggest that your feelings aren't genuine. I'm just trying to keep this in perspective.<P>A lot of classes have received more and more  opportunities to alter their appearance, through the possibility to turn into an animal (druid, shaman) or undead (necro) form, ot through the summoning of those new summoned pets. At the point the game was released, it was however the almost unique domain of the enchanter, and that was one of the most compelling reason to choose the class. Now the uniqueness of this ability is gone, and in fact, mages can now achieve a much broader and varied range of "appearance", through the summoning ability.<P>Another debatable point is the possibility to summon creatures like cyclops or griffins. A cyclop pet is something that shouldn't be possible. Those are creatures that should inspire awe, and respect. An encounter with a giant, should, in my opinion, not be trivialized or cheapened in this way, just by allowing a random texture to be placed on a Jabober...<BR>Let me take an example in real life : the difference between a wolf and a dog. A wolf inspire fear because they are wild creatures that can never be pets (IRL).<P>&gt; I agree, that spreading abilities out to too many classes dulls the class lines, and that's a bad thing in a class-based roleplaying game.<P>Thanks Alan.<P>&gt; No, actually that code was created very specifically for the spell that it was used for.<BR>&gt; Honestly, a bit of coding magic was done to create it. And it was most certainly done to make the summoning spell, it wasn't some sort of holdover from some attempt at creating an illusion for enchanters. <P>I'm convinced of that too. I'm indeed disapointed to see these efforts put into a changeform spell done for the class that was not asking for it, instead of the one that have suggested it to you !!!! (and was waiting for it since 2 years)<P>&gt;  Well, I disagree. I still think enchanters are the best class for surprises. I won't get into any attempt to convince you that the real magic feeling for playing an enchanter is the way you play it, beyond telling you that a summoned pet is just that, a summoned pet. They aren't very entertaining on their own?<P>That's 2 point of view. Both are valid I suppose, although I like mine better  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;  There is no policy about not upgrading enchanters. I think you are doing yourself a disservice by believing that there is. I also think that you are putting too much importance on what a magician pet looks like.<P>Balancing a game is a VERY difficult task and you are performing globally very well on the subject. As Abashi has said once: the 14 classes are more or less on the same line. Everything is fluctuating, so some of them are sometimes a little above, and some a little under the others. What I mean by no upgrade policy is that enchanters are in my opinion more on the top of the curve and then, of course, receiving less goodies. <P>&gt; I'll ask a few questions about illusions and see what comes up.<P>Thank you very much. I'm pleased you heard our concerns. <P>Silh, a less disillusioned enchantress.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will start my post stating that i have not read ALL of the responses to this issue, but for the most part what I am seeing in the ones that I did read are 2 things:<P>1)  Everyone is referencing the enchanters post lvl 50.  You know when you start a character there are 50 levels before which are equally important.<P>2)  More and more this post is leaning towards unhappiness with the class as a whole, not the specific issue that was started on.<P>I started playing my enchanter on Sep. 2nd 2000.  I'm currently working on my last bubble of 29.  Now I'm use to playing a rogue, and actually, I love both classes.  The enchanter class is still surprising me of its abilities.  First i started out using crowd control at very low levels, everyone thought I was crazy cause I was doing this (those with chars that are ubber).  Then i tried to solo, I couldn't. (At that time because I was not use to the enchanters abilities)  Well the fact is this.  I have grouped very very little sincle level 8.  Maybe about 10% of my time, if that.  Here is the truth....I can solo any mob that is yellow to me, and probably one that is low red if I tried.  So I really dislike people complaining about not being able to solo and the class is weak.<P>The class is excellent!<P>here's what I see as the big problem, and to note, I haven't really thought about it until i read the original posters message.<P>The Enchanter is as the name implies an Illusionist.  The master of illusions, able to fool anyone.  There have been valid points that if one class to do a transformation, then the enchanter class should be able to to. Well, yes I agree with this....to a point.<P>However, transformations...well...no...I don't see it.  Maybe at the highest level obtainable but still, not really.  The enchanter can illusion because they are an illusinist...why can shamans, druids illusion/transform?  Because they are actually turning into their transformation when they are casting...well, why can you cast a permanent effect of this.<P>The wow factor of an enchanter is defintely dulling these past few months with the realization that so many other classes are starting to get a hold of our unique abilities, another class being able to Mez a mob? Why should this be allowable?  Necros get it, perhaps it should be vs. undead only.  Bards being able to illusion?  Maybe this is warranted but well, no.  How does a song make you look like something else?  I can live with the wolf form and bear form because they are kind of valid, they are in that grey area.<P>I'm just rambling on here, the point I'm trying to make is this....<P>Enchanters are a unique class with very specific abilities and coolness factors.  Those abilities and coolness factors are being muted in the following ways:<P>-by other classes inheriting them<BR>-that they are not extended into new things as the enchanter grows in power<BR>-I'm sure there are many other things I cannot think of at the moment.<P>Until this all boils over and a decision is made, which I hope is a good decision that will make the most people happy,  I will continue to enjoy playing my enchanter.<P>Happy Holidays everyone and god bless.<P>Nirran Perfection - Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not that anyone cares, but this is actually Luna not Miyke, hi anyone from Brell! =)<P>The claim that giving illusion anything would have too serious a faction impact does not match my experiences with the game as an enchanter, and as an experienced coder.<P>If turning into an undead froglok for example, will make undead frogloks not agro on us, then why is it that these same undead frogloks will  agro on *charmed* undead frogloks. This seems to be sufficient evidence that an illusion nearestmob is possible.<P>I probably won't be checking this thread again, I can be contacted at truffle@iname.com.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another thing I didn't mention, anyone notice that mobs do not agro on feared characters? This is because those characters have the NPC flag set, and mobs by default don't agro on NPCs, though they can agro on other NPCs. If they are already agro on an NPC they will stay agro.<P>Why is that relevant? Because Alan is suggesting essentially that undead frogloks don't agron on undead frogloks because of race faction. That's not true, they don't agro on undead frogloks because they are NPCs, until they are charmed, at which point they become pets.<P>That's why I suspect an enchanter with illusion undead froglok would still be agro'd on. I believe there are some technical issues, but I don't believe the issue is that enchanters with monster illusions could wander freely throughout all dungeons.<P>Luna</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alright..<P>I'm not here to knock the mages new spell because as we are (or should be) the master of illusions.  They are the masters or summoning.  So to say that they should not get that spell is like saying that we should not get a pet (not that the one we got is great).<P>Illusionists have the ability of illusion.  The stronger the illusionist the stronger and more realistic his illusions appear.  Therefore I don't see a reason for not being able to take the form of a mob at say.. Umm level 51 or 55 even.  At this point most of the mobs in most areas wouldn't agro you if you were KOS.  Simply because of level difference.  Being able to scout ahead and look into an enimies camp should be an ability.  Illusions are our toy.  And even though I dont think that druids should not be able to take nature forms, I do feel that we should, as well for undead.<P>Simply put the enchanter is the master of illusion.  Now if we had gotten the Bear illusion first the fact that it was a bear would of thrown it to the druids probably at that same time that we got it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Some flaws and things that I would like for them to have the ability to do, but I DO have the option to NOT play the class.  <P>Class envy is getting kinda old and childish.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <BR>BTW, necros do have weaknesses.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>Howlin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why not simply make the mob illusons (Monster summoning type) so they do not change faction/stats/anything? Simply for the "wow" factor. Enchanters deserve to have something like this much more then mages IMO.<P>I also think a group Illuson monster spell of that sort would be really great. Each groupmember would be given a random monster from the zone so say in oasis someone might get a sand giant while another would get a crocodile. Would really "fun."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P> You made referance to not being able to give a mimic mob illusion to Enchanters due to exploitability of being safe in a zone but isnt that the exact purpose of our illusions? Like the "Stein of Moggok" quest, you have to be illusion inkie, greenie or fatty butt scratcher to perform this quest. This is not to mention all the Enchanter quests in Neriak that I now have to go through the city invis due to REALLY BAD faction from killing Orcs but if I had not killed these Orcs I could roam Neriak with no danger at all. This is not a call to nerf the line but yet a valid point to dimenish yours.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
