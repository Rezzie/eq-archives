</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056073.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056804.html<P>Author Topic: Magician Talk: <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-07-2001 10:41 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They can solo for their entire career fairly well. Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome. There is some concern about the use of pets in higher level groups. Pathing in places can make them more of a danger than a help. And any creature with an AoE fear spell will exclude the use of magician pets. I'm not sure that these issues constitute any sort of imbalance, though. Fixing them, however, would most certainly eliminate any concern that magicians might have about having something to do in raids against the boss mob, or against the high hit point Velious monsters. Having powerful pets gives them the ability to contribute to the combat, regardless of the magic resistance of the monster, or the magicians available mana.<BR>So, most of what is listed below are essentially minor. The issue of a change to the way rain spells work crosses several classes, though, and is the only real sweeping concern here. The change to the way link death and logging back in works hit magicians pretty hard. The tedium and expense of summoning new items when you go link dead is harsh.<P>No Rent Items: We all know what happened when we changed the way players log back into the servers after disconnect, and how that affected magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items). The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. This would be a perfect solution (and one that I’ve heard the players suggest a few times).<P>Rain Spells: Can we remove the pets from the equation? Just this would probably make them useful without making them too useful. I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would probably overpower these spells by a large margin. We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high.<P>New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons: With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of the Sword of Runes) we also mentioned that we would be adding new proc’ing summoned weapons for them. Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few situational weapons.<P>Pathing: Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.<BR>Notes: Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst. <P>Pets and AoE fear: Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated about letting them make other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be expected by the players that immunity to fear would make more sense for necromancer pets than mage pets. But, as always, gameplay has to come before appearances.<P>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire: The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet. Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone check? If it is, should it be? Perhaps another careful examination of these pets is in order…<P>Spell Drops: Could someone look into the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) and Blizzard, just to see if they are dropping off the right level monsters? There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire. Is that really where it should drop?<P>Pet Names: How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets named by that name. It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of characters, and it would make people with pets much happier. Not to mention it would help diversify the landscape a bit. Or perhaps some other way to allow for more interesting names than the list they are randomly chosen from now.<P>Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool looks)?<P>Rage of Zomm: How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm?<P>DoTs: Why did we give magicians DoT's with Velious? It does seem a bit odd.<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: The claim is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well. We should up its ability to taunt. I don’t see a reason that it can’t be a super taunter. With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn’t seem to overpower it. Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much maybe we should give it a few more hit points. Also (or maybe instead), perhaps making it more of an escape spell would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<P>Higher level pet healing spell: By giving them a better healing pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, we can force them to decide if they want to heal or summon a new one in a tight spot. The last one they get is at 20th level, I think. It’s a good spell line that seems worthy of continuation.<P>Improved Invisibility: Why don’t magicians get this spell?<P>Phantom Armor: Two concerns here. The first is that it uses 4 components! That’s an awful lot of components to carry around. It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much. The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems to me that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also give additional regen…<P>Aegis of Ro: The players think that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all. I've also been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed drop off a dragon in Dreadlands. Perhaps a slight increase in the drop rate on this spell would be good. (Note: Obviously we've fixed this one since I wrote this. This spell never was dropping, but is now.}<P>Pet Fear Immunity spell: One idea that came in during the necromancer thread spurred me to suggest this. Area of affect fear spells make pets unwanted in some places. How about we give magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short while? (another note: See, the dev team DOES read these threads…)<P>Robe of Conjuration: Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield. How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<P>Pet Health Bars: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.<P>Ok, keep in mind that this list was written a while ago. Obviously some of these items have already been added. And some of them really are not class balance issues (I wrote this up before the idea of starting the class balance threads even existed). So, please, let's only talk about these ideas (if you don't like them or think I've written them incorrectly) and new ones. But please keep in mind, if you know you've stated it before and it is not on this list, that's probably because I purposefully did not add it to the list…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Anti-summoned line.  Since we are THE elementalists dmg should be upped by 50%.  This is a spell that we are going to use very rarely, but fits into our area of expertise, so we should rock with it.<P>I really hope you look into the equipment for high level mages, compared to the other classes, we have little to look forward.  And please, please, please for the love of God no more reclaim energy.<P>Pet damage post 50 really needs improvement, as does DD. 50+ fire pets are a joke, and should be based on the pre-50 fire pets, or turned into better nukers who don't melee.  More conj based DD would be nice; as it is now I'm probably going to reset my specialization from Conj to evoc.<P>Ring of Flight should include at least j-boot speed.<P>Multiple charges should be added to the Rod of Modulation, or a second variation should drop.<P>If you can, please explain again why mages don't get root.  And don't say because our (green to the mob) pet spends 30% of his time casting it (and being resisted).<P>I'd like to see more mage equip with DD spells (unlimited charges) drop, the mage equivalent to some of the melee breastplates and helms.  I'd also like to see more 1hb items for casters in general, and mages in particular.<P>Explain again why ME and MY PET cannot be invisible at the same time.  The only place I can see this being abused is in PvP, so just flag it there.<P>/pet be still command to prevent CONSTANT aggro is not just nice, but really necessary if we are to be welcome in groups on raids.  Adding the spell Elemental Conversion (reagent: already summoned pet) to turn us into elementals would make us useful on uber encounters.  This would be a relatively easy fix to some of the many, MANY problems this class faces post-50.<P>This class is my favorite, but it is dying.  You have the chance to save it.  I hope you choose to do so.<P>Thuriniel Zomm,<BR>Angry Mage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, how can you say that you cannot find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class?  In relation to what?<P>The plain sad and simple fact is that ALL damage casting classes (Wizzies, Necros, Mages) have been nerfed so much post 50  that very few even get invites to large endgame raids.  <P><BR>The quantitive data is clear and has been documented in many excellent posts and I will not bother to go into that here. <P>1.  We deal little  damage on raids in relation to tank classes because of magic resistant endgame mobs.  <P>2.  Any damage that we do deal has not increased in proportion to the massive amounts dealt by tanks post  55.<P>Case in point : PoA.  I was up there last weekend,  in my group 2 wizzies and 2 mages... we got one exp kill for the group in 13 hours of play time.  We we consistantly outdamaged by a group with 3 tanks in it.  <P>Endgame mobs should be altered to make some of them resistant in degree to melee damage. You have magic resisistant mobs, now alter for melee damage resistance.  This would make the endgame more interesting as  strategies would have to be created in order to deal with some of them.<P>It would also re-empower my Mage to the purpose for  which I created her two years ago -- to deal damage, not to Coth, evac, SC or anything else that you have invented as a mitigation to the fact that we are no longer needed on endgame raids.  <P>The endgame has been sadly reduced to a world of tanks, clerics in their back pockets, and a handful of support members from other classes.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/bonk<P>Umm, its actually not that hard to find imbalances.<P>I have posted once per thread, never on the same topic.  So far, I have covered summonings, pets, and pre-50 to post-50 progression.<P>Now on to the oft-forgotten side of balance: items.<P>Every focus item for magicians casts reciam energy.  Several people complain about this, but I think it makes sense, as well as makes it convenient to summon the best pet you can for mimimalized mana cost(I have noticed that I get more mana back when I use the foci than when I cast it, no clue why though)<P>But, This makes putting reclaim energy on our PoG bracers a joke.  Even if we are not currently holding them, we have our foci, and it is not that troublesome to keep one in your inventory for reclaiming purposes.<P>Both our VP robe and our PoG legs cast Burnout III.<P>This suggests two things:<P>1: You intend the loot in PoG to be so far superior to that in VP that you put robe-quality effects on pants<P>and<P>2: You have no creativity.<P>Burnout III is ALREADY OBSOLETE by the time the effect works (from what I have heard).<P>Furthermore, the buff costs little mana to the mage in the first place, so I know no one who would use BO III on the robe or pants rather than casting BO IV themselves.<P>The Robe of Conjuration casts our level 49 flame shield with a long (its 10 secs, right?)casting time.<P>This means, that, even though the average fight lasts about 35 seconds, and the effect only lasts for 2 mins, we have to have the tank stand there rather than pull, rather than us med.<P>A level 55 mage meditates that 120 mana for the DS in the amount of extra time the robe takes over simply casting it: hence, it is a waste of everyone elses time, but equal to the time we would devote to it anyway.<P>Suggestions:  Make it the level 56 DS (155 mana)<BR>This is balanced, seeing as other robe effects from similar robes are Cpnjure Corpse (57 nec, 700 mana) and Enticement of flame<P>Wait....no, its not balanced, but it is a ton closer.<P>Shissar Staffs (drop from Venril Sathir)<P>Cleric Staff:<BR>Shissar Apothic Staff ( 26 DMG 52 DLY 0.8 WT, +9 STA, +18 WIS, +10 SV POISON, EFF: GREATER HEALING) <P>Wizard Staff:<BR>Shissar Elementalists Staff ( 7 DMG 50 DLY 5.6 WT, +60 MANA, +12 INT, EFF: FLAMES OF RO) <P>Enchanter Staff:<BR>Shissar Nullifier Staff ( 11 DMG 24 DLY 10 WT, 4 AC, +50 MANA, +10 INT, EFF: TASHANIA) <P>All those are awesome staffs.  Very well balanced for Risk Vs. Reward.<P>Now look at OUR staff:<P>Shissar Guardian Staff ( 8 DMG 20 DLY 8.2 WT, EFF: PHANTOM PLATE) <P>NO stats, (damage and delay irrellivant, but same as a fighting baton(only 2h) for those that care)<P>Effect: Phantom Plate<BR>Is it just me, or does this staff have nothing to do with anything?<P>The effect is decent, but it lasts for a long time, and only costs us 200 mana.  Hence, this staff does next to nothing.<P>Also, note that the Apothic Staff is the clerics......ummmmm, which class's hate armor is called Apothic???? <P>Oh, thats right, ours.<P>The Wizard staff, the Elementalists staff, bears OUR LEVEL 51-54 TITLE<P>The names of those, along with items such as the "bandaid" dagger, and monk/rogue items which allow them to summon throwing daggers, EVEN OUR LEVEL 55 Pouch of Quellious (summons 60 rather nice shurikens).<P>Throughout the world, there are VERY few magician items worth getting.<P>Most of them are all/all or for casters in general.<P>The main exception IMO, are the boots of Bladecalling.  They are INCREDIBLE, but then again, no one in their right mind would take a magician on a Velketor's raid in the first place.<P>The Bard legs/boots I can take, enough classes get summon food/drink that its irrellivant to me, but they want it upgraded to cornucopia and everfount? NO WAY.  Either let them actually forage, leave it, or, if you are feeling nice, make it abundant drink.  The stacks are ours alone.<P>What I find odd is that everyone is suddenly able to summon almost EVERYTHING we can summon ourselves, and yet, we cannot use any of the items that allow them to do so.<P>with the possible exception of those gloves that let us summon swords of runes, (and those also drop from Velketor) we dont have ANY item summonings on our items, rather, we have reclaim energy.<P>Whereas each tank class now has two complete sets of armor with spell effects, INT casters get effects only on selective pieces, and, more often than not, the effects are LESS usefull.<P>Also, on an aesthetic note:<BR>Kill the 7 sec recast time on flare.  It is excessive, not to mention that the spell's only use is to....ummm.....well....I never found one.(Burst of flame and burn are both evo, so its not to train evocation.....)<P>VI has no problem giving our unique abilities to EVERY OTHER CLASS IN THE GAME, and yet, we are not allowed to get Voice Graft.<P>Wow.  I am impressed with the expanse of the hypocrisy.<P>Restore our dignity!<BR>-Solefarin Arazmodan<BR>High-Priest of the Laughing Priesthood<BR>Magician of the 37th Conjuration<BR>(a.k.a.

</FONT><HR>Yeah, mage gear is pretty lacking compared to all the other classes. Magicians have no item that makes everyone else say wow( cept maybe the epic) while all the other classes do. The VS staff is not even worthwhile to get. All the mages in my guild have said that if the VS staff drops, that they do not want it cause it would count as god loot( which would take them out of consideration for future god loot items). Given that the item does not even save the components for the buff( only the mana) why even use it?<BR>  As of right now, I have no desire to get to Velious. Why should I go if there is nothing for me there? On the other hand, I am very anxious to take my bard there to get the new armor which is really good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is no real vision for our class (it has changed alot since game inception).  Pre-50 we are  (or at least were when I was pre-50) unequaled in damage output.  Post 50 we gain next to nothing in damage and our pets are for the most part the same as the 49 pets.  So now in the end game we have been pushed into mediocrity with only CoH saving the class.  The epic pet is nice but only a hand full exist as the Earth staff from Innoruuk is probably the rarest item in game.  Why do we get LOS outdoor bolts and Druids get a DD?  Who or what is responsible for the total lack of imagination for our class.  Take a look at our Plain of Sky drops, one has charges of Burnout III, while I have leggings from the Plain of Growth that have this same spell as an effect and are noticeably easier to obtain (risk/reward??).  As pointed out above, our staff from VS is a joke as is our robe from VP.  Velious sets a new level of risk/reward and the older zones such as VP and Sky need to be updated to reflect this.  I have posted my thoughts on what we need so I won't waste my/your time with them again.  I feel rather strong about switching the LOS bolts with the druids and if they are not switched, they should be increased in strength to compansate for there limited use.  The 59 Bolt should be around 1200 dmg IMO if it remains a Magician spell.<P>Kobadshaw<BR>59 Magician (played since Mar, 99)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Our Phantom armor spell line is self-only.  It SHOULD stack with ALL buffs.  As it is now, the cleric AC buff line will overwrite it. THe cleric AC buff is 1-2+ more AC, but ours also has a 1-3 HP regen effect. Their spell only cost mana, ours cost mana AND 3-4 spell stones.  That also needs to be changed.  No other class has to use multi-stones per cast.  <P>Also, if someone had cast a higher AC buff, and I get the message "spell does not take effect".  Then it should NOT use up spell stones.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Excellant post Solefarin.  The "fun" aspect of the game is no longer there for high level magicians.  Crappy gear, lack of utility, and life expectancy of high level mobs being under three seconds.  My guild probably doesn't know this, but I've been up against Trakanon 7 or 8 times...I've done ZERO damage.  I don't even go up against VS simply because I don't want to contribute to lag-magicians aren't needed to kill him either.  The last Fear raid...I was the only person to die...twice I might add.  Both times I didn't even aggro the mob..it came right up to me and smacked me down hard (explain that).  Curently I am leveling a cleric (28-6 days played) and a warrior (21-three days played)...putting old Malf away until I see some dramatic changes in the class.  Simply put the game is no longer fun to play as a magician. 100 days played down the crapper is the way I see it.<P>Every time I see someone from Verant say magicians are balanced...I lose that much more faith in their ability to do anything right.  I honestly believe no one from Verant even plays a magician...if they do then I'd like to see a response from him/her and their thoughts on the post 50 magician.  Abashi provided great support for necros for the longest time; necros were the most powerful pre-Kunark.  Is this class envy??..your damn right it is.  Post-Kunark I wish I started a cleric or warrior, even a rogue would have been nice.  Magicians are a waste of time and that monthly fee.<P>Disgruntled Gnome Magician<BR>Level 57 dust collector<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quote from Verant: <P>"It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class." <P>Read on.<P>"They can solo for their entire career fairly well."<P>Proves that they do not know what they are talking about.  Post 50, soloing is pretty much useless due to the Kunark/Velious mob HPs.  You can kill a blue monster but get keep a book around while you med.  Other 'soloing' classes have not been as affected as much as us.<P>"Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group,"<P>This is not true.  Due to poor pathing, our pets are a liability in dungeons/raids.  In addition, our 50+ pets have been downgraded in comparaison to the 50+ mobs and other 50+ class skills/spells.  Why would a group include a mage when their are so many other classes that can do everything better then us?<P>" and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome."<P>I have to shake my head at this one.  Our Malo line of spells is always behind the Shamans and any 50+ group will accept a Shaman over a Mage in these cases as they offer so much more to a group (including a pet). "even more" make me shake my head in disgust.<P>"There is some concern about the use of pets in higher level groups."<P>See previous messages.<P><BR>I have given up on my mage - she is 54 and has nothing to look forward too.  CotH is nice but i dont want to be included in groups/raids for that one purpose alone.<P>What makes me mad is that Verant is positioning themselves as the 'all knowing' mage while it is obvious that they do not have a clue - they Beleive they are balanced and that is the end of it.<P>Dont expect any significant improvements to magicians out of all this as you will be let down.<P>Jolie d'Luclin<P>(start a dorf, they are so much fun)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The "just play an X" respondents ought to learn that.  You really only get one shot at EQ.  Powerlevelling is not playing, after all; you can fast-forward over the game, but you miss a lot.  Just more work.  Don't particularly care for melee types in general (in any game; just a quirk).  Enchanter is maybe different enough to bother, but there's too many enchanter twinks already.<P>   Rather than twink, I'll most likely just hang up my tophat if there's no attraction at the higher levels.

But for what it's worth:<P>[Sun Jan 14 14:09:48 2001] Mrylokar says, 'Give me a chance to explain the "Dot"s?'<BR>[Sun Jan 14 14:09:55 2001] Kaltarex says, 'yeh the dot lines are pretty fun '<BR>[Sun Jan 14 14:09:55 2001] Jigger says, 'yea, is there a specific reason why mages didnt get improved invis?'<BR>[Sun Jan 14 14:09:57 2001] Oblisk says, 'Sure Myrlokar, please do '<BR>[Sun Jan 14 14:10:03 2001] Satira says, 'hey man... all i ask for is root..

Apparently the initial plan was for those spells to have some extra components offsetting the DoT disadvantages, instead of the ones we have now.  It also explains why there's such a large initial damage component and short duration.   <P>   I'd be curious if Absor could (in his copious free time) talk to whoever the designers of these things are and find out why the DoTs were "pre-nerfed" before release.  Perhaps they were considered too powerful as described here, and suffered the usual over-correction to make them the less-than-useful things they are now.  Or perhaps the coders found out you can't very well root someone, then knock them back, without insta-breaking the root  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Maybe restoring the spells to the original design concept would make the DoTs desirable again.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. <P>You said hard to find anything wrongwith magi overall balance??? K then just explain a few things to me so i can understand. ONE. at lvl 49 i can do 810DD against ice giants in everfrost that have roughly 5,000HP. at higherlvls say 54lvl magi, im trying to kill mobs in skyfire with 15,000HP.... Now the "balance problem" my pet goes up in hp like 2 percent... my spells at 54 are scars of sigal casting twice costs 300mana for 900dmg if max each cast. 100dmg MORE than my lvl 49 spell OR less than 2 percent increase... so mobs went up 300percent and i got a 2 percent increase in power?? balance huh? TWO tanks whining our pets are too strong so u dont give us stronger pets... now the "balance problem" VERRANT told magi,necro,druid that we are a solo class. the exception to the grp mentality of this game... now if thats the case it means a magi must be able to SOLO *DUH* and if a GRP class like a tank can kill our pet how do u think we can possibly SOLO???? tanks dont like dueling our pets /shrug DONT duel us... wizzys who are NOT supposed to solo NOW solo from 50 to 60 very easy... DRUIDS can kill four blue exp mobs at same time useing full mana... a 54 magi with full mana trying to solo in skyfire is taking her life in her hands... im NOT bashing other classes what i want is simple.. i want to be able to solo from 50 to 60 which only leaves a few options which are  1. give our pets MORE hp  2. raise our spells dmg * from 1 to 50 we are only slightly less powerfull in dd than a wizzy* after 50lvl a DRUID does MORE dmg than us PLUS has dots so dont try telling me that allowing magi to solo is gonna inbalance anything. 3. remove the 50percent exp penalty IF pet does over half dmg VERRANT gave magi JOKE dmg spells from 50 to 60 * less than 2 percent power increase is a joke when mobs go up 300percent and hit for insane dmg*. On another note regarding pets... shm get a str debuff so ice giants go from quad hitting in 100dmg per hit to around 30dmg per hit allowing the shm pet to easily live while shm SOLO icegiants.... magi can die if resists happen to spells cause pet hp so low they die ultra fast... im NOT wanting to be some uber goddess JUST would like to solo as VERRANT told me and all magi we were/are a solo class. u never see people shouting around lvl 50 for a magi over a tank... so there is no balance issue raising our pets hp so we can truly solo. A final thought i would LOVE it if u would just make the 57 to 60 pets upgrades of the 49lvl pets which are truly usefull. All that i have said is easily verifyable. im truly hoping you "balance" the magi which for some reason u claim has NO balance issue. I would assume IF we were a grping class u would be right...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few notes to the newer mages here. The effect reclaim energy on the focus items was by design. GZ told us that effect: reclaim energy would be the way we know that an item is a focus item. Now the new guys on the team appearnly think that reclaim energy is a powerful effect and put it on our PoG armor... after all, reclaim energy is just as good to us as shrink is to an ogre warrior? or summon pouch of quilwhatchamacallet that monks get on thier PoG armor?  And we need an item with that effect, right? after all, no mage carries around several items with that effect on it already? Oh wait, we do... we carry around focus items with that effect.<P><BR>""Burnout III is ALREADY OBSOLETE by the time the effect works (from what I have heard).""<P>That is false. Burnout 4 doesnt exsist as far as I know. I have talked to about 10 level 54+ mages and none have seen it or know anyone that has. Burnout 3 costs 150 mana, there is no point in putting the effect in an item, casting it hardly moves the mana bar...<P><BR>""This means, that, even though the average fight lasts about 35 seconds, and the effect only lasts for 2 mins, we have to have the tank stand there rather than pull, rather than us med.""<P>The effect lasts for 5 mins, but yeah... it is useless. 125 mana is nothing, and most mages will already have the group shields at that time they get this. A usefull effect for it would be CoH, not the 33 pt shield.<P><BR>""The effect is decent, but it lasts for a long time, and only costs us 200 mana. Hence, this staff does next to nothing.""<P>Chances are, if you have this staff you have Phantom Armor, so wouldnt want to use the effect because you have a better version of the spell to put on yourself, and the mana cost is nothing because you cast it once every hour and a half or so, it isnt like a damage spell or healing spell.<P>There was a trend going on in Kunark that looks like it was for the most part carried into Velious. The person or people working on the mage class either hate the class or just dont want to be doing it so arent putting any thought into it, they are making an obviously weak item so no one with argue over the balance of the items and or spells. And while doing this, other classes are takeing all of the mages spells that make them unique. The Kunark armors that cast spells for melees should not be in the game. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey all.  Just thinking of a fic for magician's prooblem of NO DEFENSE AT ALL.  Right now, if we're traveling our only hope of surviving getting jumped by a green is if we have a pet up, which really only increases the MOBs that will attack you.  Here's my solution: a few new spell lines.  They'd be conj-based buffs(might have to make them self-only).  Barrier of winds: Big AC bonus, automatic parry first four attacks made(then buff dies).  Barrier of Stone: Damage Absorbtion.  Barrier of Ice: Some damage absorption(not at much as Earth, thoug).  Monster that breaks it takes some damage.  Fire Barrier: AC bonus and damage sheild.  Also, I think it'd be cool if we could get a quest that lets us get an upgraded pet for that level, based on our deity.  Servant of &lt;God&gt; or something.  Better Earth pets for worshippers of Tunre, Fire Pets for Solusek Ro and Water and Air for Karana(I think this is okay because currently there is no other reason for a mage, or any other caster, to worship Karana, since there's no caster-wearable equipment for that god).  Wouldn't be an easy quest(a little harder than the ones for the focus items).  Well, that's my bit.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So, here it is at last, Magician Talk.<P>Absor, a couple of things to open with  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> The fact you open with a line like "It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class" then go on and discuss in detail about twenty known Magician problems I feel is somewhat ironic.<P>I would hope these twenty items are all being seriously addressed and considered.<P>My take:<P>No Rent Items: The fix you mentioned would be ideal. Please do this.<P>Rain Spells: What we've been asking for all along. Stop our pets stealing a wave and they become useful.<P>New Weapons: /shrug. I know a lot of people are looking forward to them, but I can't see you making them as strong as the SoRs, not to mention that pets proc once in a blue moon now. For myself, I don't care, I'm over the SoR thing now.<P>Pathing: One of the single most aggravating things in EQ. More pathing nodes are required, and possibly a better pathfinding AI / algorithm. This affects EVERYONE not just Mages.<P>Pets and Fear: Great! However, rumour has it that this spell is being tested on Test (heh) but is level 59. /shrug - do a /who all 59 60 mag sometime on a server sometime and tell me this would be of great benefit. Needs to be somewhere between 51 and 55, and not drop off Phara Dar.<P>Voceration: Fire: Hehehe. I still don't have this pet and I won't unless something is done about it, Ive seen it in action and it sucks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Spell Drops: Some spells (CoH and Voc: Water come to mind) are just insanely difficult to find. Being thrown a bone here would be good.<P>Pet Names: Would be fun.<P>Pet Graphics: See Names.<P>Rage of Zomm: See Graphics.<P>Dyzil's: this spell is a misnomer. It doesn't.<P>Higher Pet Heal: A pet CH that costs 25% more mana than summoning a new pet would be good. We have the ability to do this already by chain casting pets, with the drawback of having to B3 and DS the new one again, but the tactic is so insanely risky it makes quad kiting look like a walk in the commons.<P>If implemented, this would be one of the big additions to the game for 50+ Magi.<P>Phantom Armour: This is a self-only buff, if I have it on its because I choose to have it on, I don't want it overwritten. Also the inventory drain is huge.<P>Improved Invis: Its because you hate us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Aegis of Ro: /shrug.<P>Robe of Conjuration: Please do this. I will probably never see one though.<P>Pet health bars: Slapping F1 twice isnt that hard for me to be able to check pet health. I'm not holding out for a pet status box as I dont think youll do it - perhaps allowing others to target a pet by Fx-Fx where Fx = pet owner's usual select key?<P>To wrap it up: pretty much what I expected. If ALL of these changes went ahead, Magicians wouldn't suddenly be gods, which is probably a good thing. <P>It won't correct the 50+ decline in Magician power, it would certainly help though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Fix mages thusly:<P>1) make all our nukes conjuration, we are conjurors NOT evokers like wizards. teh resists on soem of our spells should be changed, how the hell can you resist a Shock of Blades smacking into you? Dozens of huge shards of crystal from the elemental plane of Earth. Dodge it yes or have thick armour to help, it should have some kind of melee based resist, making it ideal on caster mobs, and far more sensible<P>2) Give us more Elemental spelsl, we are Elemntalists! Why no Cold, Posion (acid?) spelsl based on air and water?<P>3) Give us Air and Petrification stuns, and root! Stuns rule people, trust me on this. They are also totally in character. Damage is nice but stopping runners/gaters or having a life saver when travelling is IMPERATIVE to our class. We can't just rely on pets for these thinsg, out pets have them why don't we?<P>4) Monster SUmmonings. make these fast cast spells making pets that do NOT have elemental pet abilities or that can be affected by our elemental pet spells (burnout, Renew Elements), and that do not need a reagent. let them be hard hitting high hit point standard mobs, give them a chance to be special mobs, casters, rogues etc.<BR>So when on a CR, travelling or needing a pet fast we have this choice. As it is the Monster Summoning spells are a purely for fun.<P>5) DoTs, let them truly be the "wrath of the elements" MObs should be rooted, stunned and blinded by the initial hit. But still keep aggro low as the spells confuses hell out of them as they are overwhelmed.<P>6) Give us more items that are USEFUL! Hell fire in all of Kunark and Vleiosu how many GOOD items are their? A staff that casts a a SLOW los bolt, boots from An absolute Uber Mob and a crappy staff from another uber mob...<BR>I dont' mind other classes getting some of our summons but they should be RARE items. Since when can we get an item that gives us Haste? Utterly unfair to give our class specialities away.<P>7) Lower Call of the Hero to level 50, make a lvl 55 versiont hat can port peopel across zones.<P>8) Put ALL our pet spells on vendors. And make research work for rare lvl 50+ spells so we can get them by research or spell drop.<P>9) Fix research at lower levels so we only need the pets of the previous levels, OR make the drops of research items more frequent. Words of Convocation are incredibly rare.<P>10) Fix our 50+ pets, increase their skills and their base STATS! make the fire pets the same as before, and the "wizzy casting pets" should be seperate versions (and get rid of their ability to cast Cancel magic). They should have high str, dex etc where appropriate.<P>11) Reduce resists rates on the malise line, they are resisted 50%+!! How about making magician's versions of malaises lower fire/cold/magic by fare more than shamans but poison/disease by less, so we shamans and mages offer advantages with thse spells?<P>12) Give us a lvl 40 Greater Healing and lvl 50 COmplete healing spells for our pets. Say 150 mana and 300 mana?<P>13) Improve our Damage Shields, ours are supposed to be best, druids are almost as good by a few hps, increase duration or damage?? Personally I'd go for duration that would make us very useful in raids or areas where we can't take pets.<P>14) new command /pet heel  pet won't go more than 10' from you, teleporting of need be so it never goes ar from you and thus stopping out of control pets!<P>15) Increase the drop rates of our spells they are incredibly rare.<P>16) let us summon soem really GOOD items, they are no rent so folks will have choice between the mage being OOM or haivng a cool sword etc. Shield of Flames AC 10 FR 10 and gives Shield of Fire effect. Also wepons/items purely for pets.<P>17) Make the game more enjoyable, rather than a chore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mages need more "mage only" items and armor, with stats and clickable effects.<P>THe other classes have armor items that have usefull and everyday used effects, and a spell lvl of 34+.  Either in the way of buffs, or a clickable DD or DoT spell.<P>Most of all our items have "reclaim energy", a lvl 1 spell.  I would like to see new focus items, that have stats, (+int and +mana), 1hb, and have a low lvl 24+ DD spell.  Like Shock Of Spikes, lvl 24 DD and does (158 - 176) base damage, with a 8 second cast time.<P>Or the lvl 34 DD spell Blaze, fire based 276-295dmg spell, with a 10 sec cast time.<P>If you look at the fact, that you have to be 50+ to use the items.  ANd the the mobs you are fighting have 12K+ HPs.  Then the amount of damage these spells do, is hardly a drop in the bucket.  I still use Blaze when fighting blue mobs at lvl 50.  That 295 DD hardly moves the mobs health bar.<P>I would also like to summon an item, maybe boots, that have 2 charges of a SoW type effect.  Give it another name, and only last half the time that SoW lasts.  This would at least give us an item that others would want.  Make it a 51 lvl spell, but be targetable, like the Lev rings are.  That way we can sow our pets, and other party members.<P>And don't say that is cutting into the druid and shaman area.  You are giving our spells out to everyone now.  On items that summon food, water, bandags, throwing daggers, throwing sherikins, as well as one that cast our Damage shields.     <P>Its also not going to hurt the Shaman potions, as the items are no rent.<P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
