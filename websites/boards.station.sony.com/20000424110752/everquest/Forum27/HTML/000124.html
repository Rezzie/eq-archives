</FONT><HR>The Syndicate is a more than three year old Online Gaming guild located<BR>at http://www.erols.com/seanst/synd/iiiguild.html (click on the logo to<BR>load the pages after the movie plays).  We are more than 400 members<BR>strong and very organized, unified and professional.  Having been an<BR>integral part in the beta testing of most of the online games currently<BR>released or in development, we are now shifting a branch of our guild to<BR>Everquest.  With several hundred members planning on playing, we aim to<BR>be the largest and most successful guild in EQ as we have in all other<BR>games we have been involved in.<P>Syndicate members have been preparing for EQ since the very beginning of<BR>the beta.  Some of our members were among the very first beta testers<BR>into the world.  Since that time we have built momentum in our<BR>membership and are EXPLODING into the game as roleplayers and team<BR>oriented friends.<P>We exist, together as one team, on Tarew Marr server.  We have<BR>squads dedicated to each of the races offering opportunities for all<BR>members.  And we are currently open for recruiting of new members and<BR>are receiving many Everquest applications a day.  We respond to all<BR>applications received within 24 hours so if you dont get a reply it<BR>means your email address was incorrect or there was a communications<BR>problem.  We are looking for professional, mature players to join our<BR>ranks.<P>We are one of the largest, oldest and most successful online gaming<BR>guilds.  We pride ourselves on being mature, professional, dedicated and<BR>motivated.  Despite being a large guild we are a tight knit TEAM of<BR>friends.  We have a well organized heirarchy and every member is<BR>important to the guild from the oldest veteran to the newest member.<P>Our guild is run by Guildmaster Dragons who has run the guild since the<BR>beginning.  We are anti-cheat, anti-bug and what is termed "anti-pk". <BR>In each of the major games we participate in we muster more than 100<BR>players online at peaks times and 50+ at non-peak hours giving us a<BR>large 24 hour online presence.  Its nice to have dozens of members able<BR>to help you out at any given time.<P>Besides playing in online games, we also operate related sites to<BR>support them.  We have a "pagan magic" team well known in the UO world<BR>dedicated to promoting role playing, locating and getting fixed game<BR>bugs but most importantly to researching the secrets of the game making<BR>it more fun for all.  We also maintain a RPG gaming news site known as<BR>The DEN (Dragon's Eye News) currently being revamped to include an<BR>specific Everquest section.  In addition our members include game<BR>designers from many of the leading RPG companies as well as staff of<BR>several print and online gaming magazines.  <P>The Syndicate is already a major power in the EQ world and plans only to<BR>grow larger, stronger and more unified.  We are dedicated, professional<BR>gamers who are looking to have FUN!  We have a STRONG PvP section, a<BR>large merchant section and a fun loving monster hunting section.  We<BR>watch each others backs and hold a great many in game events, parties,<BR>games and quests.<P>Long Live The Syndicate!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hello LLTS...I had a character I played a while ago who was a member of The Syndicate in the early days of EQ. The character name was Whitehart and he was a Barbariab Shaman.<BR>I abandoned him a while ago because of the negative posts I have read concerning the nerfing of the Shaman and the fact that in higher levels he would not be a very good char to play.<BR>I have a new character that Verant hasn't screwed with TOO MUCH so far...a lvl 24 Druid. Although they have nerfed the solo aspects of tis character I am a group player for the most part so I would like to hear from a member of the Guild to get my Druid in in place of my ex shaman.<P>My email address is cheyenne_111@hotmail.com. Please let me know what I need to do to get back in.<P>Thank you for your help if anyone reads this and LLTS!<P>Shanaana Spiritcatcher<BR>Druid of the 24th Circle<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Guys you may overall be a legitimately fine group of people but the Syndicate members I've met thus far on Tarew Marr have been for the most part pricks. When your guild arived on this server they wer overall kill thieving training foul mouthed little children who very few people cared to associate with. I sincerely hope your next wave of members are of a higher age bracket. I also wish you luck in disproving the reputation your members already here have earned the Syndicate if it does not reflect the entire guild population.<P>Gazukab Muffinchomp<BR>42nd Troll Warrior<BR>Officer of The Festering Horde</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This was a great positive post.  That was until I read Gazakub's message.<P>Don't understand where your driving your point.  You say that the Syndicate members are pricks and childish, while at the same time your the making accusations on a non-threatening post.  I'm just trying to understand who is the child?  <P>Masaaka Diezauberer<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's rather obvious you didn't get my point Masaaka, if I were meaning to be insulting I would have said they were all pricks and children and even a few more adjectives. If you look up a bit you will find I said most, not all, were. I used to have a few friends in the Syndicate whom I would count among the best people I have met on this server but sadly they were among the minority and are no longer around.<P>On the contrary this post was made to enlighten members and leadership of the guild who are not currently playing as to the state of things at least so far as their current reputation goes. Having not seen a Synticate member in a long time now and the servers being as crowded as they are I cannot really say if they are still the same caliber of people as they used to be. I do sincerely hope they are not and if they are not I wish them nothing but well.<P>Gazukab Muffinchomp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>So far I have only had one run in with a member of The Syndicate and it was not a pleasant one.  I was running through WC one night when someone shouted "WEREWOLF." About that time the werewolf hit me. I turned around and starting killing and and shouted a couple times that I was in the process of killing it. Then one of the members of The Syndicate came up and KSED it right away from me. I will not call any names but suffice it to say, he is at the top of my no rez list that I have. <P>Level 40 Cleric on Tarew Marr<P>PS.

</FONT><HR>Just a quick comment. I have noticed that the things mentioned in previous posts are not limited to the guild The Syndicate. People outside that guild do the same things.

</FONT><HR>If i had just the one incident to go on I would have kept my mouth shut and never said a thing. But some new things have come to light. I know for a fact several members of the syndicate have jumped ship and more are planning to just because of the actions of one member.
