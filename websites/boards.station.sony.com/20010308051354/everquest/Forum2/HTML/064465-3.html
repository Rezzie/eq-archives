</FONT><HR>Guess it depends how you define an uberguild, whether or not verant has an employee working in one.<P>I know for fact none are in our guild. So, unless they are all working for AL/FoH/Da`Kor, i guess they are in one of the myriad of "also ran" guilds.<P>FoH doesnt cheat. they are just smart players. Occam's Razor ring a bell? MANY highend guilds come up with VERY similar tactics for the same encounters without EVER talking to each other about the specific thing. Great minds think alike eh?<P>Instead of being a whiney little kid, just contemplate how likely it would be that FoH REALLY DOES have insider info. They arent the ONLY guild to do these things..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It never ceases to amaze me that the people that scream, "Nobody REALLY cares", "Its just a GAME" the loudest, are always the ones who indeed do take this game too damned seriously.  If you honestly did not care you would never take the time to come to these boards and state your useless opinion.  If you honestly didn't care you wouldn't get so riled up that people are better than you in a game.  If you honestly didn't care, you wouldn't be clicking the refresh button every 10 seconds in your browser, waiting to make your next smartass remark to someone who beat you in a game.  You may have convinced yourself you 'don't care', but your actions here state the opposite.

</FONT><HR>Well.... I originally posted this on a different thread, but it feels so much more at home here....<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>/sigh<BR>a bit off topic (since I see a lot of guild bashing going on here)....<P>Caveat: I am not a member of an uberguild, though we are with a few exceptions a 50+ guild.<P>FoH are a guild like any other guild, and as such, they have their good players and their bad players (speaking of attitude - not ability). Hell - so does my guild.<P>I play on Veeshan, and while I don't know jack about the guild mechanics of FoH, I do run into them from time to time. I'm not saying they don't have jerks among them (we all do), but by and large, most of the FoH that I have met have been decent. In fact, when I was 50, Kesper (FoH) just *gave* me all of the level 49 spells I still needed when he saw me auction for them in NFP. What a nice guy!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Raistin, Brittney, and Garvok have never been anything short of nice to me when I have run across them, either.  Part of that is due to the sort of community spirit that wizards have (though Garvok is a cleric), but it is also because they are good peeps.<P>Most of these large guilds are people just like us who play the game, have fun, be silly, etc.... and just like any other population, some are arrogant, some are selfish, rude, and mean. Such is life, and there isn't ANY guild out there on ANY server that is ANY different - regardless of level or of "uberness".  It's true.... you have level 20 jerks, and you have level 60 jerks.  Eventually the level 20 jerks will be level 60 and new level 20 jerks will post derrogatory statements about them - and from the sound of it, a few of those are here in this thread.<P>I guess all I'm saying here is to dislike, like, respect, condemn, or criticize individuals rather than groups. People put too much empasis on a guild tag. I'm not going to respect (or condemn) a player just because the text over their head says "&lt;Fires of Heaven&gt;" or "&lt;Afterlife&gt;".  It's that individual's actions that speak more than the tag they wear.<P>In that vein, neither do I care particularly what the guild does. Though I respect their achievements (and hope soon to be able to tackle some of the same tasks), I am not particularly impressed when GM Bordael (or whoever Veeshan gets stuck with that month) broadcasts a system-wide message of the latest FoH victory. Boy, talk about breaking the precious "immersion of the environment"....and judging from zone banter after such a message, it *does* seem like a bit of favoritism to many people. Easy to see where rumours start.<P>Sorry to ramble - just don't quite understand or tolerate guild bashing. (or guild idolatry, either, for that matter.)<P>So don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that all FoH are great - they have their jerks and exploiters, too (but ALL guilds do, mine included).... but they are a group of INDIVIDUALS, and people like YOU - and most of them are decent folks.  <P>/rant off<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I understood, Aldarion - sorry that my post did not address your issues.  I was posting in response to what this thread has become, much as you just did.  <P>On the original topic....  VI employees with sensitive information playing the game is a tricky situation.  On one hand, it's good that they play the game they create.  It shows genuine interest in the game, and helps them find problems.  On the other, human nature can enter into the equation and really fudge things up.  It's sort of a classic "catch 22" type situation, imho.<P>/shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This doesn't have much to do with the vast list of PvE victories for FoH, though, since PvE and PvP are quite different at their very core. I, personally, don't give a damn about PvP, and agree with FoH's position that this is a PvE game. On the other hand, I plan to play DaoC and SB to give PvP a try in an RPG - it's just not what EverQuest is about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The threads already been hijacked, so why the hell not.<BR>Just my worthless 2cp<BR>I play on Bertoxx (ok you can stop laughing now) as a 53 wizard, I am not in the semi-uber guild on ther server Prophacy (I say semi uber guild becuase they are by far the most powerful and well orginized guild on ther server but we have about 7 other major guilds which in some ways rival them, and no clear-cut all powerful guild. <BR>The thing to keep in mind is I know a good number of the people in the guild including several meetings with the leader, I have yet to meet a person in the guild I don't like, they are uber in a manner of speaking but they are no diffrent from any other player  except for they take the crap. <BR>Consider this: your uber guild is the ruling body over the server. The members of the guild are in many ways the most powerful people on the server and have access and ability to go and do things most players never will. This causes resentment in the prolterate (working class in marx's terms) or the normal players so you get people I see on Bertoxx all the time saying how much Prophacy members are jerks and farmers. Which I am sure happens to an even greater extent on servers with just 1 major guild. These claims have no foundation and often the people who say them are full of crap. What this does however is effects the minds of the younger (level wise) players who have no basias of judgement but of course (as all humans do) will form one. And unless they know the person they are talking to is bitter and full of crap they will start thinking it. And unless they really meet members of the uber guild they will resent them in time (This has happend to friends of mine). <BR>The uber guilds are the powers of the game, they are the die hard players. GM's do watch often invis (One watched our ragefire raid the other day, forgot to be invulnrable and got killed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) and do observe. The reason they do is so they can watch what tese uber players do. So they can change the challanges accordinly and help make the game harder and more fun. I would hate to see them stop adding new zones and new challanges for the uber guilds to conquer. I love hearing about Afterlife's, FoH's, Prophacy's, etc conquests. I applaud the people that went to Velious and got well into dangerous and totally new territory. <BR>Also uber guilds are a great asset to the lower levels because as new items are added it is the uber guilds that are the first to get them and then they sell their old equipment (or are sometimes nice enough to give it) to lower level players. This allows people in non uber guilds to get items that drop in places they will never visit. <BR>Also as a personal note, GM's do play, they are in guilds, some in normal small guilds, others in uber guilds. I know a person on Bertoxx who is a hardcore player on the server and is a GM on another, also a  Verant employee. Im not sure on all of the Verant employees but she will not reveal any information that is Verant's eyes only to me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> but I would hope all GMs do the same. Also with a large number of encounters with uber beasts how much infrmation can a GM pass along that would be overly helpful to an uber guild? Its pretty ovbious what the weakness will be and what its stong points are. It is not hard to predict this sort of thing, and after one failed attempt you can change tactics and try again. This is not GM help people, this is gaming stragety and preperation. Prophacy is the only guild on Bertoxx to have gone into VP or Sleepers Tomb, there is other guilds with just as many lv 60 players with not much better armor. But no other guild on the server has beaten Trak. I know of 3 that came close on several attempts but it is all about stragety and preperation.<BR>I know how rambling this has been and if you read it I applaud you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<BR>Xilet 53 Wiz Bertoxx<P>A few things to ponder:<P>Also think about it this way "Go big or go home" if you dont want big encounters and tests of skill you should not play EQ or any game. I want to see them add new zones that are very hard and pose entirely new tests for uber guilds to conquer and to keep it interesting.<P>Guides/GMs got velious 10-14 days before the expansion was relesed to the common market.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If FoH had a GM working for them, or in their guild, don't you think he'd be trying to screw them a little less? I mean, every patch it's something else to stop FoH. You'd think he'd get as tired of the heal/die/CR/buff/heal/die relationship as anyone else eventually.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064465-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064465.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064465-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064465-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064465&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064465&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
