</FONT><HR>Okay, I agree with Bodi and Zadkiel, with an addition.<P>Right now, Iksar monks receive a very large AC bonus. This is appropriate for their scales. Verant SPECIFICALLY stated that to counterbalance this, humans would do more damage. The experience penalty was NOT to counterbalance this, the experience penalty was for the Regeneration, infravision, extra skills, etc.  The problem is, the balancing factor for the AC is broken. Human monks do not do more damage because their additional speed applies only to their unaltered fists, which nobody uses. As such, humans need a small damage upgrade over Iksar monks, that applies to all weapons and the epic. Iksars should NOT be nerfed. The simplest way to do this would be to provide a ATK bonus to human monks to match the iksar AC bonus. This would allow humans to slightly outdamage their scaled brothers, while still being far more vulnerable in combat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I feel that the monk only armor should have higher ac on it and i think that monks should also be able to do crits with their fist only say past a certain lvl, like 40 or give them triple attacks since monks are suppose to be the main damage dealers in the least amount of time and it seems like every warroir i've grouped with that is around the same lvl as me can easly do around the same damage or more vs me when you add in his crits and cripling blows. So with adding the crits on a monks fists could balance that out</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read the first page and the last page. <BR>Good Luck Absor if you intend to wade through all this. I hope you have an assistant.<P>That said, here is my 2 coppers on my pet monk peeve.<P>*** Monk weapons. <BR>Whats up with those things. My idea (and the old guide books and EQ manuals) was that monks were always the living weapon, the least dependent on the next uber stick to get by. What was the Vision(tm)? Nowadays, every other newby monk I see has a twinked super bo-stick beating on the orcs in East Commons. <P>Nothing wrong with that (twinking) but I am very dissapointed. Monk H2H should be scaled to with warriors etc. NOT VIA WEAPONS. The monk class has been the twink-du-jour until lately (when everybody is playing a hybrid now). <P>If you need to match the warrior damage-wise, just scale up the monk H2H and give him special extra damage bonus on his specials (the various kicks and what not moves). Why did you turn this class that was essentially twink proof to a class that is playable only with weapons that are obtainable at higher levels? <P>Scale up monk H2H and give the monk extra bonuses on skill based special moves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heres my suggestions for monks...<P>Special Moves - These need to have special effects added to them. Round Kick should hit every mob arround you within 1 foot, TigerClaw should have a chance to Blind, Eagle Strike should interrupt casting if it lands (give it a 0 second stun), Dragon Punch should have a small knockback effect (2-5 feet maybe?) and Flying Kick should be more like an upgrade to Eagle Strike giving it a 1-2 second stun to the mob.<P>Weight Limit - Hows about making the starting limit 20. This way we can actually TRAIN our 1hb/2hb skills up at lower levels without worring as much about going over the limit. You gave us a few sweet weapons but these are all mid-high levels (30+)<P>Fists - These need to have an avantage to them. Either give us critical hits when using fists or have some sort of internal proc that goes off and does a slight bit of damage to our target or have some sort of lifetap effect doing dmg and raising ones own (could be 1hp per level unresistable damage, thus level 1 would have a proc that does 1 damage while a level 60 would have one that does 60 damage. Not entirely balanced against mobs as it would be most useful arround the level 10-20 range but not exactly useless at higher levels).<P>Feign Death - Some use this as a way to evade. You can do one of two things, give us an EVADE type skill or restore this to its original effectiveness (clearing the hate list when you FD). You said you dont want FD pulling but about 90% of Kunark and Velious seem to be balanced against this technique. I hear there is a FD limit on the planes as well (5 FDs) before any mobs arent fooled anymore. All your basically asking us monks to do during downtime is /camp and relog in. You dont ask the cleric to camp and relog in to CH again or a Wizard to camp and relog in to cast a second nuke. Please reevaluate the effects all the nerfs on FD has had and consider restoring it to its original effectiveness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I have been looking foward to this thread all week.  Most of what I have to say has already been mentioned, but here it goes...<P>Raise the max damage on monks fist my 1 or 2 points, lower the delay by 1<P>Raise our H2H, 1HB, 2HB skill caps to 275.<P>Add some new graphics for monk armor, all of our armor pretty much looks the same (cured silk)<P>Add some quests for for decent low weith weapons for lower lvls (10-25)<P>Creat a disipline at lvl 30 called focus.  This disipline would add 15% haste effect and raise STR, STA, and AGI by lvl/2 (i.e.  lvl 30 would be +15...lvl 60 would be +30).  The haste from the disipline and STR bonous would raise our overall damage over time.<P>Thanks<BR>Zikanak Windfist<BR>iksar master of pain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Being that I represent the 'sexy' sector of the monk kingdom, I bring up an issue that, though seemingly tame, is of grave importance!<BR>Looks! We monks have looked the same since shiverback came out. Cured silk made it so that EVERY SINGLE monk level 1-60 looks dang near exactly the same. I see this awesome looking new armor for all my buddies comin out of PoG, what do I get? stuff that not only sucks statwise, but I can't even wear for fashion!<BR>Also, I agree with Bodi's points that Zad brought up. We've got a warrior in my guild that parses alot of mobs we kill and raids we go on to see who is doing the most damage, and the monks are always almost half the damage of the rogues, and about 1 or 2% less than the warriors (damage with warriors is fairly even, I blame the 1 or 2% on pulling and such). Our monks basically all have the epic, Celestial Fists (I don't but I don't count myself anyway), while our warriors do not. The rogues do, but that's because theirs is fairly easy to get en masse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Monks hands should be the preferential choice damage wise.<P>FD should ahve a gradual reduction in agro effect on the mobs. If your not going to give us the HP or AC of a tankt hen allow us to evade like a rogue.<P>Black Panther Skin Armour needs its weight adjusted.<P>Innate skills at 55 like double Flying kick would be practical and sensible.<P>A reduction int eh recycle time of FD at higher lvls like the SK would again only make sense as the monk becomes  amaster and then a gradmaster. It only makes sense that he would improve in these areas.<P>Damage should be closer to the Rgoue than the warrior.

</FONT><HR>Well it seems you have quite a consensus here (monks must do more damage) and a few recurring themes as well (mainly stop nerfing/start slightly improving feign and to a lesser extent general annoyance with the low weight limit and high item weights, although some counterarguments on that one)<P>Interesting suggestions on how to do this:<BR>1. Apply the level-based damage bonus (or a reduced version of it) to the offhand or offhand weapon. Doesn't help 2h damage though.<BR>2. Apply the 'natural haste' to weapons as well as unarmed attacks. I would guess this actually involves work, as it looks more like you get the unarmed delay from a lookup table than through a formula. Also, does not increase unarmed damage.<BR>3. Increase the special attack damage. Adding a minimum damage seems particularly popular. Although, you'ld actually need to increase special attack damage by a very large amount to produce a significant superiority to warrior damage.<BR>4. Move the 'hand based' special attacks and the 'kick based' special attacks on to seperate timers. Interesting...although adding dragon punch into the current damage of a monk probably wouldn't make enough difference. Would provide a very slight rebalancing towards human monks doing better damage if you designated tail rake as a 'kicking based' special attack.<P>Chaining attacks...<BR>I remember before Kunark came out, I was thinking that the two really good skills to add for monks would be a 'combination' skill (might have to call it 'combo' to fit on a button) that would execute 2-3 or the existing special attacks in sucsession, selected randomly, and a very low damage stun type attack (pressure point strike or nerve strike/pinch come to mind as likely names. While a 'throw' skill provides a natural explanation for stunning, we'ld just whine about it if it didn't come with a good throwing graphic.)<P>...of course, a delayed death touch (read DoT skill on its own timer with a very long reset time) would have been keen too. Hurm, if we really want to get fist of the northstarish you could give monks crits, but delay all the extra damage by a round or two. And instead of seeing 'Bruce scored a cricitcal hit for 30' you could add text like 'Bruce says 'your liver will explode in 3 seconds' ...and if that delayed extra damage killed the mob, it could explode and do some extra damage and break mez in the immediate area, and even damage your party on a PvP server...and um, yeah.<BR> (back to reality)<P>Stuns...<BR>Okay, so warriors get stunning kick, and so we can't have that. Rogues get 'double &lt;special attack name&gt;' so we can't have that, even though the value for &lt;special attack&gt; is different. But +1 hp/tick feigned is not an equivalent. Perhaps if you can't add stun, add a knockback component to flying kick at 55? Then again, we wouldn't want to shove anything through a wall because coding a solid environment for the mobs was too expensive.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like most of the Ideas here, but I may have missed the one I realy want..started scaning on 4th page  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1) love the idea of 17/26 at lvl 60 and scaling from 50 for fist's<P>2) like the off hand bonus 1/2 of main hand bonus..that would put our dmg up by 3 - 5% from where it is now.<P>3)At lvl 45 we should get Dubble "special". (ie. dubble FK, Dubble Tail rake ect.) it would be a trained skill have a cap of 150 - 200. this would up our dmg 3 - 5%<P>4) Add a min dmg to FK to be LvL of player. this would up our dmg by 3 - 5%<P>So a total of 9 - 15% increase in dmg.. which would put us back where were were pre RoK. Currently we do 1 - 3% more dmg then a warrior. and 20 - 25% less then a rogue in a group since they have free access to the back. or 5 - 10% less when they dont totaly have the back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are lots of fine posts suggesting enhancements that the community agrees on, as well as many horrible suggestions. Please ignore the latter. Most of the former can be found in Bodi's compilation.<P>Let me stress again some of the broken aspects of monk life:<P>1) The effect of our epic, Celestial Tranquility, will not stack at all with pure haste spells and is blocked by the ranger's Call of Earth. See details above. What we'd like, as with our Robe of the Whistling Fists, is to be able to use the pure haste of enchanter spells while still being able to use the AC/ATK boost of the CT song. Failing that, is there any way to make the AC/ATK boost permanent while changing the song to haste only? The AC/ATK boost is a big part of the desirability of our epic weapon.<P>2) No graphic for our epic gloves, Celestial Fists. We'd like a unique look to them, perhaps using some new Velious texture that would match our high-end armor. But just about anything is better than having no graphic.<P>3) No minimum damage on flying kick. It is embarrassing how often I can still kick for less than 10 points.<P>4) Feign death problems. Many details on the bugs were given above. Additionally, perhaps a shorter reuse time at higher levels might help. After all, shadowknights get a new FD spell that has a much shorter recast time than our skill.<P>5) Weight too high on black pantherskin armor. The tunic is 2.5 stone, the legs are 3.0. To make this armor more attractive and worthy considering the time spent making it, weights should be lowered on these pieces especially.<P>6) Ineffective disciplines. Thunderkick suffers from the same damage problems as flying kick. Since the discipline has a duration, why not make all flying kicks that land during that time be thunderkicks? Also, the level 57 discipline of 100 Fists could have its duration increased. Fifteen seconds of haste is hardly a compelling reason to tie up all your disciplines for 30 minutes. Ashenhand has a chance to kill a target outright, yet unlike the Rogue's ability to assassinate, killing the target will make the corpse poof. Silentfist, another duration-based discipline, could also allow all dragon punches within that time period to stun.<P>7) Balance between human and Iksar monks. In exchange for an experience penalty and bad faction, Iksar monks get a significant AC gain, increased regen, and serpent sight. Regen alone compensates for the experience penalty, as the Iksar monk has so much less downtime. Faction hardly plays a roll, as that can be fixed through normal killing (in Blackburrow, for instance). There needs to be additional compelling reasons to play a human monk for true balance between the two races.<P>8) Epic quest is too easy. This may not be a popular opinion, but it is true. The Robe of the Lost Circle is obtainable by killing the quest NPC's (please change this). Headbands and sashes can be traded instead of quested for. The Robe of the Whistling Fists can be multi-quested. Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns. In theory, you only need to camp two components - the pipes for the RotWF - the rest can be purchased or killed for. Our epic weapon should mean more than that.<P>Bottom line: monks want to do tons of damage and have a reasonable chance of staying alive while doing so. That's ultimately all we ask.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1)  I made a post here and a post on bugs/testing already about how when something else is meleeing a mob, you can't feign it off unless you leave its melee range (which is nearly impossible with something frenzying on you because you're low health).  The idea of feign death is to prevent death...which it doesn't at high level unless you're pulling...which isn't an intended use for feigning anyway.  I'd like to see that fixed.<P>2) always liked the idea of triple attack...don't expect it to happen but I can dream.<P>3) change thunderkick to a minimum of 200 damage.  If you think that'd make it too good...remember the level you get it at, and remember that it's a discipline that will only be good once a fight at most until you hit those 100,000 hp mobs, and then 200 damage won't even cover its regen per tick.  if, however, it did 200+ damage every time, it'd still be a worthless discipline =), but at least it wouldn't be embarassing and newbies who see you kick fire beetles for 200+ as you run by could gasp in awe and make you feel special.<P>4) a slight natural ac increase above what we have now as we level would be nice.  It's not too hard...basically the same as what you did with paladin's/shadowknights when you raised their hp's a bit, only this time with AC for monks.<P>5) speaking of HP's, we have pathetically low hp's, but if any of these other things happen, it's worth it.  if they don't, it'd be nice to see mend give more than 25% as one gains levels, or otherwise just raise monk hp's a little...or natural stamina a little.<P>6) a stun attack would be nice (silentfist doesn't count it's a joke).  losing 800 hp's to a level 30 caster mob because I can't interrupt is depressing (no 180 fr won't stop me from taking full damage to a hag's fire spell every time).<P>Lastly, any of these things would be nice.  I don't think any will happen, and that's why I went a little overboard in hopes that just one will be changed (first one is my biggest concern).<P>thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, here's some of the stuff I think on the monk class, just off the top of my head.<P>1) Give us an actual set of Planes armor we would actually look forward to. Every other melee and hybrid class has or had a new set of armor in kunark (and now velious) to look forward to. Monks had zip-squat-nada in kunark, and the Velious armors, are rather underwhelming. Virtually every single item spot it is quite easy to find a better item that is usually much easier to obtain, often at much lower level.<P>I can give a list if desired, but when people are still wearing Azure Sleeves or Gatorscale pants or a Froglok crown over, say, quest armor which requires killing L60+ stuff in the testing halls of the Temple of Veeshan, then I think there's something out of whack.<P>2) Balance us better against the rest of the melee classes. Right now, we only barely outdamage warriors, and not even that by much given some of the new velious weapons. (The willsapper, at 13/20 with a slow proc has a better ratio than pretty much any monk 1h weapon I know of, not to mention a more useful proc than anything aside from the Adamantite club.) To pay for this slight extra damage, we have 2/3 the HP at best, 150 less AC, a truly crippling weight limit, and a lesser set of disciplines. Rogues will always outdamage us assuming someone can actually take the front of the mob, which is most of the time, and have at least as good HP and AC.<P>We need to further differentiate ourselves here. Heck, even with one of the top weapons in the game, the Bo Staff of Trorsmang, out of VP, my damage per second just barely outpaces a warrior using a willsapper + 1 epic weapon. As a result, there's become a situation where there is not much compelling reason to bring a monk along. All the new mobs have anti-feign pulling logic so we can't do that, and we often don't out-damage a warrior or rogue enough to justify including one of us over one of them.<P>3) To go with the request for added dammage, we also need some method of aggro control. Feign Death does not count as this, as it does not modify our position on the hate list once we come back from it. Rogues and Rangers both have aggro control methods, and we're in much the same boat as "can dish it out but can't take it" types. Can we please have Feign in combat work for us like Evade does for rogues, with aggro reduction/mem blur capabilities? If you want to make sure it can't thus be used for feign pulling easier, only give it that sort of effect if the mob is currently in melee combat.<P>As a side thing to this, PLEASE have someone look into the well-known among the monk community bug with feign. As it stands now, a mob I can feign off successfully 9/10 times solo will often NEVER believe feign if I am grouped at the time. This happens with no falling down message, and often being at half health plus. It is much worse if your health is very bad, which of course is when you most want it to work. This bug did not exist pre-kunark, only post-kunark. <P>4) Do something about our disciplines. The vast majority are really rather useless, and are almost never used. I'll go through 'em one by one:<P>Inner Flame: This is actually one of the oft-used ones. However, a duration of 12 seconds greatly limits it's utility. Also, this discipline is nowhere near as good as the Warrior discipline, Defensive, though it is similar in nature. Would be VERY nice to get the duration on it upped, probably at the expense of some re-use duration, but then again, warriors get 3 min of defensive every 10 minutes...<P>Thunderous Kick. Never ever ever used. Completely and totally useless. Not much is more disheartening to use up your discipline load for the next however many minutes only to see "SoAndSo lands a THUNDEROUS Kick (24)" which happens the vast majority of the time. Make this discipline a duration-based discipline, for say 60 seconds. Then, during that period of 60 seconds, every flying kick landed will be Thunderous (and thus a crit). It still wouldn't be that impressive, but at least it would have a purpose. You want to make this discipline REALLY useful, give thunderous kicks the chance to stun.<P>Whirlwind: Actually one of the used one. Kinda short duration, kinda long recycle time, but no major complaints about this one. Still, due to the massive re-use timer, I use stone stance over this 90% of the time.<P>Void Dance: Why is this higher level than Whirlwind? There are actually far fewer applications for this discipline. When you can't afford a mob summoning you, or when you are running away is about it. Every other time, whirlwind is so much better. Duration is pretty durn short too, and the re-use time is rather long.<P>Inner Flame: Very often used discipline. I am still not sure, however, why the main effect of the discipline seems to make most of the hits you land be simply (4x&lt;base damage&gt; )+(damage bonus). For example, with my 40 damage staff, most of my hits with inner flame are for 178. 4x40 + damage bonus, ie 160 + 18. Some hits indeed go much higher, this is true. If you read the text of the discipline itself though, it sounds like what SHOULD be happening is every attack that lands gets 160pts added to the total. Recycle time is a little annoying, and duration is short, but this is a good one.<P>100 Blows: Fundamentally useless. The haste effect it gives seems pretty negligable, overall. Also, what possible advantage is there to using this discipline over inner flame? Using inner flame generates much more damage. Maybe if you were trying to get as many hits in with a tranquil staff to hope to interrupt a gate or something, but that's kinda rare.<P>Dragon Punch: Haven't used this one much. Seems a bit silly though, that we have to use a L59 discipline with a medium-length recycle time to even get a chance at a stun, when every L55+ warrior can stun with a 1pt kick. Again though, like the last discipline, there seems to be no major compelling reason to use this over inner flame.<P>Ashen Hand: Again, haven't used this one much, but I can't see that I ever will. From reports, it makes eagle strike do somewhere in the 400 pt range. Why would I use a 72 minute discipline to do an extra 300 pts over a flying kick, when I can add 1-2k damage over 12sec per inner flame, with luck, and do nearly 3 inner flames over the same recycle time? Also, the insta-kill portion only works on mobs that are basically green anyway, works rarely, and am told often poofs the mob.<P>What we would REALLY like is unbinding each discipline's re-use timer from the others. That would give us some actual incentive to use the more obscure disciplines. Failing that, we need some revamping of the disciplines to actually give a compelling reason to use them, and bring them more in line with some other ones.<P>5) Moderate the weight that is being put on some of the newer items, plus the monk-weapons. 10lbs for staves is way too much in most cases, even for higher level monks to really be able to use. All, or almost all, of the high level 1hbs are 3lbs or heavier. New leg items we can use are 2lbs, new tunics 5lbs, etc. It makes it so that in many cases, we can't even use good items we find, cause of the extra weight. Oh, and there's the laughable items, like Imbrued Granite Spaulders. Why exactly is a 20 lb item monk useable? We really need to have the weight of some of this stuff re-examined.<P>6) Make it so there's a compelling reason to play a Human monk. (I am sure I'll catch some flak here.) Right now, there's not a great deal of game-mechanic reason to choose a human over an Iksar as a monk. They get regen, 50+ more ac, infravision, etc. True, faction is a problem, and they do end up with 2 higher delay on bare fists than humans. However, that last penalty is completely null-and-voided by the fact that no high level monk ever uses their bare hands anyway, unless using Celestial Fists, which sets human and iksar alike to 9dam/16delay. I'm not saying to reduce Iksar, I am just saying there needs to be SOMETHING for humans to compensate. Maybe an extra +1 or +2 base damage bonus that an iksar doesn't get. That'd make it so Damage Monks would be humans, Tanking Monks would be Iksar, and both would have their own specialty based on what their racial advantages suited them for.<P>Anyway, that's kind of my random ramblings on the topic, sorry if it's disjointed, etc., but it is 1:30 am here. Heh. I'd be happy to clarify, etc. any of this.

</FONT><HR>I wanted to make a point I'm not sure you guys are thinking about at Verant.<P>You have to keep in mind balance when you're making weapons and armor.  This is especially true for melee classes who rely on equipment for much of their ability.  You could make all kinds of tweaks to the fundamental aspects of a class for balance, but if you make new weapons of high quality available to one class and not another, then you just shook that balance up again.<P>If you balance the classes now, you have to seriously consider the effects and balance of the weapons and armor you put in the game, and who can use them.  I know you have an enormous database of items, but there has to be SOME way to keep track of it.  Designers have to discuss what they're putting in the various zones.  It simply doesn't say much for balance when one zone is semi-hard with tons of good stuff when another zone of equal or greater difficulty has so few.  Look at Old Sebilis vs. Chardok for a good example.<P>Problems also arise when you add great items for one class but items that simply don't compare for another.  Look at the breastplates off Trakanon.  Without looking at the stats they give, compare the Blood Ember (shadowknight) with the Donal's.  A shadowknight's efficiency improves very little with a 75 hp, 14 ac, 17 magic resist buff, but a cleric receives a vast improvement with a free complete heal (even with the changes being made).<P>In short, weapons and armor are as big a part of balance as fundamentals about certain classes.  It would help if the designers both communicated more and also had a better knowledge of the current item database before they make new ones.<P><BR>In this light, I'd like to add my support for a little more variety in effects on weapons for monks, and a little more power on Velious weapons.  If there exist weapons for monks that the masses have not seen yet, fine.  <P>As it is, however, warriors are doing just about as much damage as a monk equipped with the epic Celestial Fists (effectively 9/16 weapons) with a Willsapper (13/20) and nice offhand weapon (Priceless Velium Short Sword, for one).  I'd suggest you do some tests of a warrior vs. monks vs. rogues with various weapon combinations available in Velious and see if they are still where they are supposed to be in relation to damage.  Monk have seen no weapons in Velious which are more powerful than rogues' and warriors' weapons yet, which is balanced for what our class is supposed to be (high damage output in exchange for low defense and hit points).<P>Monk weapons also lack the variety of effects that rogue and warrior ones have.  The 50% slow on Willsapper is a good example.  They also have weapons which have lifetap effects (Scimitar of Lifestealing, Blood Point), another nice addition for them.  Before it is brought up, the mend ability of monks does not balance this, as mend is a fundamental class ability and not related to the balance of weapons and armor.  If monks were balanced (with mend) in relation to the other melee classes before those weapons were put in the game, adding them throws that balance off.<P>I don't think an overall 15% increase in damage is the way to go.  Just make weapons available that allow us to do the amount of damage we should be doing in relation to our counterparts, and give us some of the good effects they have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Also the cloaks a monk can wear are very few. u can choice between whitewolf hide cloak, CoS, cloth, cured silk and dragon loot. all other cloaks are A) WAY too rare / expansive or B) too heavy. Same is for the shoulder piece.<P>Would be nice if Verrant would have a look into monk gear again and make a few changes AC wise on Crescent and some Cloaks need a weight reducement as well.<BR>im from germany so excuse my bad english, basically i want to say that the monk gear compared to all the other class specific gear in kunark really suxx. the crescent droprate could use a small upgrade and PLEASE fix the weight of treantfists. theese gloves are such a pain to get and weight a TON. make em weight 0.0 like the sashes / headband quests.<P>Kenshuj Sho`Ryuken</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Arlos and Daezon hit it dead on the nail when it comes to the end game for monks, it is the period where monks are the weakest in comparison to the other classes. My biggest gripes are FD just plan not working like it should and the fact that monks are left out on the high end weapons.<P>FD NEEDS to work like it was originally intended to. When someone like Velketor or Yelinak turns on me and start doing these quad 640-850 rounds, that's what FD is meant for, to escape death. Please look at the code and find out what happened.<P>Before SoV and maybe RoK the best 1h weapons in the game were monk only. Now that isn't true, why is that? You wonder why we're struggling when the offensive skill caps are nearly identical and the best one handed weapon found isn't for monks. Monks should ALWAYS get the best one handed and of course 2 handed weapons in the game at ALL times. This is because monks shall always do more toe to toe damage than the warriors AND rogues while rogues will always do the most from behind using Freebringer and double backstab. The monk epic weapon should actually be more damage. <P>The first priority should be fixing the FD skill, as it is now, all our monks having been dying left and right on the big raids because it is broken. And second priority is making sure itemary balance is held *this means you, Kendrick, stop feeding the rogues and throw the monks a few scraps* Unless a monk only weapon (that beats the rest and isn't super heavy) drops in Sleepers or PoM then the dev team must make some for the monks to be in line. I'm sorry but 13/20 is just too close to 9/16, its time to fix the monk weapon line up by adding more. And for the love of god PLEASE stop making blunts with MNK on it weigh a ton and in the same zone put 1.0 or 2.0wt on blunts with no MNK on it, trying to piss us off?<P>Denzalo, level 60 monk of Afterlife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To balance monks a little i would make it where there flying kick does same stun as bash.<BR>I would also add some hp to them, seems many times i have had to sit back and watch on raids due to low hp compared to tanks. We are master melee does make since to have low hp if we are.<BR>I would change one or a few of the disciplines like rogues where the disciline is automatic for the same skill. Like flying kick would not only stun but would do double dmg possible at 52, then at 56 increased dodge and block automatically. This is similiar to rogue style and being the way you designed them would make more sense.<P>If won't change kick or some related usable skill to a stun effect put more weapons in that allows us to stun. I would prefer kick since this is one of our main skills.<P>Also would like to see an extra attack or something thrown in for fist around 54. This would help us gain some of dmg back that warriors get with all there crits. It could even maybe go in like at 45 or so. But seeing as that would drastically have an effect change it for a discipline maybe and make them little more rounded for melee dmg like they were prior to post 50 levels.<P>54th Monk Crafist Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
