</FONT><HR>Just got my Rogue to 50 with 4 days, 10 hrs played.<BR>Started with a 54 Druid (son's) but about 30 I had to switch to my 53 Shaman. The Dammage shield was not as efficent as all the buffs and Shamans pet.<BR>Had already collected  Ravenscale and Ry'Gorr armor and Sentry Gauntlets. Used a Deep water Harpoon and SSOY for most of the time till I won a Locustlure dagger. The Harpoon will exaust you a lot because of the weight.<P>Figure it will take a Saturday to get a DE mask and Lock Pick to 200. Will only bring him out for CR and opening doors. He is a utility character just like my two lv 34 Druids (2 accounts). <BR>Big deal. I can't tell you how much time I save in the long run taking a few days to makie these mule type characters. It's like having more than one screwdriver. If you are only working with one screw one screwdriver is OK. However, verants vision requires many different screwdrivers till the end game, then only 3-4 are NEEDED.<P>One of my characters dies? So what, just log on a Druid and a 50 Cleric (the other one is only 34 right now) and Rez yourself.<BR>Who needs you? Not me.<P>Don't like it? Don't do it. And don't presume to tell me that I can't do it because your opinion is less than nothing to me.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-Spirit-Duke_Korin, I heard a story a long time ago from a guy who works where I buy my comics.  Same thing with the dragon tooth, only he said it made a level 50 pet.  NOT a pet CAST by a level 50, but the pet was level 50.<P>He said his guild had someone create a level 1 dwarven warrior and took him to rathe mountains.  Had a cleric around to keep the dwarf symbolled and healed and let the pet beat up hill giants.  Said they got the warrior to 50 in 36 hours.  Sounds doable, and why they took the tooth out.  I know HG's green out in the high 40's but maybe they were able to find something else in the zone to give xp.  I don't know that zone well.<P>I asked about skills and he says he was able to max them all out.  I'm guessing that would be hard to do, since you really couldn't go into melee until 20 or so without risk of dying, but I'm sure his archery went up while his pet did the work!<P>Lykos<P>p.s.  Do mobs really poof if they kill themselves on a damage shield with no direct damage done?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think one of the big reasons higher level players think 1-20 aren't difficult levels is because they're MUCH much easier going through them the second time around, just because you know how the game works in general.  I spent at least as much time as you did getting to level 10, but I played a second character from 1-17 in the time it took my first to get from 22-24... having an idea of what to expect, knowing when to run, that kind of thing, made things go a lot faster.<P>And what's so important about "fast" anyway?  My leveling has always gone in spurts when I really wanted a spell rank, and then it has slowed down while I just tried new areas and tactics and people to group with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bro, I had one Druid cast SLN, Regen, Sow and Storm Strength on my level 1 Barbarian Warrior and I hit 5 in under an hour.<BR>Just after SLN wore off (the last one to do so), I hit 6. I played him for about 90 minutes total.<BR>Equipment consisted of full leather armor pieces, except chest (Chitin Shell Armor), and a Two Handed Battle Axe (12/44).<BR>Just stand at the end of the path to Halas and hit one bear, spider and you'll have wandering mobs lining up to have a crack atchya. <BR>I had 0 stamina, but was able to take 15-20 mobs out, before it was done.<BR>Rinse and repeat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Powerleveling can have some side effects, like class skill left behind or not knowing how to group, but these can be improved fairly easily.<P>  In my opinion, the most important aspect of powerleveling is finding out if you'll enjoy that class when the powerleveling is finished.  <BR>  Take away all the nifty extra spells, teleports, and sows because when the work is done there's no second person around and you should enjoy the class you've chosen.  <BR>  Otherwise you just like getting powerleveled all the time more than you like your class -- which is nice but either you have two computers and it's tiring, or someone else is helping you and it's tiring for them.<P>  The difficult part is that you kind of don't know how a class will be like until after level 20 or so.<P>The following are my observations on what i've tried.<BR>- A bard to 27 and it's a very fun class but I found out I don't like getting easily mauled and only being able to sing and run.<BR>- A cleric to 31 but I got tons of begs, got tired of buffing others, always medding, hard to duel with, can't solo.<BR>- A druid and got so many begs for powerleveling, sows, buffs, tp (and i was anonymous!).  If you do actually superbuff any newbies, you'll never get rid of em cause they'll send tells when you log in.  I never want to play a druid.<BR>- An enchanter to 12.  Interesting class, can't really solo enough for me.  Could die fast if in melee.  I made it my tradeskill character.<BR>- A necromancer and can do some amazing things with those pets and kiting.  Being too dependent on a strong pet makes it tough without one.  Could die fast in melee.  Spectre pet is overrated for how long it takes to get to level 59 (I just hang out in Qeynos-Bertox shrine to see some). Their value at raids is controversial.<BR>- A warrior to 14.  Dual wield nice.  Tanking nice.  Healing is unbearably slow.  It was nice to powerlevel but after that "the magic's gone".  (Started a Gnome Warrior for Clockwork armor, but after seeing it I don't want to be one anymore)<BR>- Currently working on a Shadowknight.  So far it's the only class i've gotten to a semi-decent level and haven't had regrets or been disappointed from expectations.  In fact, their abilities seem better than expected with each new level.  I think i'll continue to enjoy playing one even when I don't feel like leveling.  (The tank-mage concept from Ultima Online has always been my favorite)<P>It's taken much trial and error to find all the things I don't want to be. Hopefully I will be happy with the class i've chosen.  There can be only one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057677-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057677.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057677&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057677&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
