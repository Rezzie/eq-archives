</FONT><HR>-------------<BR>I've also answered that the technical and logical application of any sort of copycat illusion is unfeasible. So, while I do understand how these things might be seen as slights to the enchanter class, I assure you no such slight was intended. <BR>--------------<P>This is confusing to me. Why is a 'major illusion' spell (one that would let us target a mob and then become that type of mob) unfeasible? It cannot be all that hard and saying it's all faction cannot be completely true. Because as a water/air elemental I am KOS in places that I am not normally... however a mage can summon up the same pet and the pet is NOT attacked. So there must be some sort of special code that allows you to avoid the faction.<P>If there is not a way to work around that then why not code it? You would never have to code another illusion again. I can't believe the factions are so tied to races so much so that this cannot be done.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor... encs have had illusion:spirit wolf and illusion:drybone since day one, and you dont hear druids and necros complaining!<P>About spectre... thats now a unique illusion for the lvl 60 nec, and its kinda nice that way..  but the bear global model is shared by drus (pets) and shams now... so give encs illusion:bear!  (I'll prolly get killed for that comment)<P>Illusion:gender would be great, since one of our guild encs gets called a girl every 5 minutes anyways.<P>Illusion: enc pet is a NO GO.  Abashi covered this, for the slow encs here.  That model is an invisible man with a sword and a shield.  If a player used it, the sword and shield would be replaced with held items.  If you removed the held items, you'd be completely invis to players -- and THAT destroys PVP.<P>Illusion: mimic would be cool if done right.  Make it change race and gender, maybe face if possible, with faction hits as normal for illusions.  Make it cast on human players only (no HGS).  Note that encs already have all races as illusions, so this is a quick way to change to someone you meet...  for FUN.<P>Just a few suggestions..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Being an Enchanter (lvl 40) who was rather miffed at the lack of illusion in my future, I've been following this thread with a great deal of interest.  And here are my observations/thoughts.<P>Absor, if you are still reading here, you've done a great job of trying to explain the game mechanics and logic behind the decisions concerning illusions/summonings/morphings lately.  Also, I completely agree with your statement about spectre and bear illusions.  Necros and Shaman, respectively, should have them and I as an Enchanter, don't want them.  I also do not want a "Copycat" illusion... that's just too simplistic really, and takes away from the, quite fun, Minor Illusion (heh.. I've freaked out newbies on more than one occaison  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>I also believe you when you said "my personal opinion will not prevent me from bringing this pattern to the attention of the design team".  And to help, here are some creatures that I think would make neat/fun illusions: a Clockwork Gnome, an Iron Guardian, a BlackBurrow Gnoll, a Forest Giant (outdoors, non-city only), a Stonegazer ****atrice (absolutely hilarious!!), a Burynai Cenobite, and a Tizmak Shaman.  I could probably think of a few more, but that's enough.  Frankly, the "bonuses" that are usually attached to illusions are, to me, just that - bonuses.  Even any new illusions had no bonuses, I would be very happy.<P>I also disagree with most people about the usefullness of Boon of the Garou.  I think it's a great spell and I can't wait to start using it.<P>The illusions to me are not the defining ability/function of the Enchanter.  It's simply a bonus, cool, fun thing we can do with our abilities to manipulate mind and matter.<P>And I await, no longer eagerly  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">, the results of your presentation of (the lack of) illusions to the design team.<P><BR>Varden Aquila<BR>40 Enchanter, Cazic Thule<BR>Alea iacta est!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have an idea or two. I hope I am not repeating something already said too much! Like many people I read often, yet don't post. Here's what my general views are:<P>I play a High Elf. What if casting Illusion: High Elf changed my gender? This way Enchanters would have a less subtle use for their Illusions that are of their own race.<P>I agree that "Illusion: Spectre" and "Illusion: Bear" should be available for Enchanters. How about something like "Illusion: Animal", where the enchanter takes the form and faction of a random animal in the zone.<P>It's a shame the coding people can't fix the bug where an illusioned enchanter appears their true size (a large Gnome or a tiny Ogre) to everyone who enters the zone after the illusion is cast. Otherwise we could see "Illusion: Puppy"!<P>In my opinion the existing spell Illusion: Spirit Wolf should either grant a small movement increase and be castable outdoors only, or remain as is yet castable indoors. Movement increase should be less than say Journeyman's boots, and not stackable of course with any movement spell or item. It just makes sense to me.<P>Well thats it.<P>N<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I have to tell you, your replies on this issue sound so much like the Abashi spin doctoring school of posting its not funny. We enchanters, two years after the release of your game, have no illusions above level 44. About the faftion changes that come about wit hillusions, thats part of being an enchanter. I am the only class that can walk around neriak, ooguk, grobb, and freeport without being KOS. The enchanter quests are DESIGNED to make us keep our faction so that we can enter the cities freely. Your fears that we may be granted special abilities form being a fire  beetle are unwarranted IMHO. If I want animal faction, I will simply turn into a wolf, and get the benefits of that faction. VI needs to quit stalling on this issue, and throw us a bone. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play an enchanter and i would personally like to see more illusions.  I noticed the pattern that we get illusions of all the other classes pets and then it stops with spectre and bear.  Personally i just want spectre for the coolness factor.  I play on a pvp team server and i'm the type of person who likes to scare the noobs cause i remember when i was a noob and the uber enc scared me.  What things are in the global file that could potentially be a new illusion?  And would whoever creates the new spells and such be willing to put another creature into the global file for a new illusion?  would really love to get illusion spectre so not only could i scare noob from being pked i could also scare them from getting exp loss hehe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i am so SICK of the ignorance that goes on at veriant. im tired of having enchanters Jerked around on a chain. we have every right to get 2 if not 3 new illusions per spell level. if you dont have enough room in the global file. make room. we can send friggin satalites to space but you cant make room in a global file? my advice is stop using an Apple or Mac and get a real computer. and no the XT in the corner does not count. i play on the rathe, Illusions is a part of what i do. i started this class ENTIRELY because of the werewolf illusion. at the time. if you wanted to be a werewolf you had to make an enchanter. that what i did. now im pissed to know that not only warriors &lt;through a breastplate apperantly&gt; but ANYONE can be a werewolf now. talk about using our uniqueness. if you continue to mess with classes and uniqueness you will be no better than ultima online. wich i was more than happy to quit soon after i bought it. with that being said i will Suggest illusions im sure most enchanters would Agree we deserve without argument.<P>Illusion: Wurm, Illusion: Sarnak, Illusion: Hill giant, Illusion: Ghost, Illusion: Bat, Illusion: beetle: Illusion: Golem, and sence the drovlogs are Werewolf Bretheren, Illusion: Drovlog. thats just for starters. if i thought for a second you would even consider Illusion Dragon, i'd ask for it. infact im gonna ask for Illusion: Dragon anyway. put the scroll on Veeshan but put it in the game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> make it zone aggro if you must.<BR>a group of poeple might enjoy killing an entire zone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>and sence you guys are so good at creating "new" creatures. why not do your jobs and Create new illusions.. Like Illusion Whirlwind, or Illusion Mist. how about Illusion Whisp. or Illusion Lightning, when i walk it looks like Lightning Strikes the ground etc.. you guys need creative people working there or this company is goin down fast. spend a buck and do the game right. TEXT only Muds and RPGS are doing just as well as you. the only thing you have going for you is EYE CANDY. so do it right please.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thanks again for continuing to read.<P>Poster: &gt;"If you look at these facts carefully, the pattern established in the original design should dictate that necros would have specter pets and that we should be able to look like that necro pet. Further, we should be able to look like the druid bear pet. Instead you have arbitrarily taken the illogical path of blurring the patterns that separate classes in the original design."<P>Absor: "Or, I could just as logically argue, as I have, that the original 'pattern' that you point out was an error. My personal thought is that those illusions should never have been given to enchanters."<P>This is all I wanted to hear. If you guys have realized and admited that you messed up, I can buy not giving us anymore of the other illusions. This should close the Undead/Animal discussion completely. Thanks for just being honest about it.<P>I truly feel that the break in consistency if what has everyone so ticked off. We'd grown to expect it and now know that it's no longer going to work like that.<P>So can we now get on with just some new illusions? If they're not coming, just tell us that too so we can stop reading these damned threads.<P>If the are coming, then obvious SoV/RoK would seem to fit. Only castable there to avoid the problem of those without the expansions etc etc. <P>As an example, SoV illusions require some of the Vellium magic that is innate in the air and all that RP rationalization junk.<P>Dworkyn the Bent</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about Illusion: Evil Eye? We already know the Evil Eye model is in the global file thanks to Eye of Zomm.  There's really know reason you couldn't give us Evil Eye. It would probably be level 39 or 44, grant levitate, ultravision and see invis. Maybe a little bit more save vs magic. It's just a suggestion.<P>Btw, about Illusion: Spirit Wolf. This spell used to be castable indoors, the problem was that it gave enchanters the ability to do things like drag a corpse from under Lady Vox's right toe without her caring.  Instead of adjusting the faction associated with the Spirit Wolf form, Verant took the easy way and just made the spell uncastable indoors.  I personally think that was the wrong way to do it.  They saw a way that players were abusing an illusion, and instead of changing how the NPC's reacted to the illusion, they just made the illusion uncastable indoors.  I personally would rather be able to cast Illusion: Spirit Wolf indoors and still be KoS to those darn undead froggies and such than to not be able to cast it indoors at all.<P>How about some simple illusions? Is there any reason why we cannot have Illusion: Bat? or Illusion: Fire Beetle? or Illusion: Fish? there has to be some other things in that global file we could imitate.  Illusion: Bat would grant levitate, and be lower level than the spell Levitate, Illusion: Fire Beetle could give us Infravision, and Illusion: Fish could grant enduring breath, but not NPC's as hostile towards us a Illusion: Water Elemental.<P>While I'm thinking about it, why doesn't Illusion: Fire Elemental make us immune to damage from lava?  Illusion: Air Elemental gives us leveitate and therefore we are immune to falling damage, Illusion: Water Elemental gives us Enduring Breath and therefore makes us immune to drowning.  I'm not asking to be immune to all fire based attack spells, just to be immune to the damage from environmental sources, like those pools of lava in Solusek and Lavastorm.<P>There's plenty of ideas for new illusions out there, just please give us one or two. I would be quiet happy with Illusion: Evil Eye, and/or Illusion: Sex. I don't care about Spectre or bear illusions, leave those to the necro's and druids. I would rather have something new and unique to us than to just get a copy of another class's spell.  Illusion: Drake would be great (not sure if it's in the global file though). So would Illusion: Lion or Illusion: Fairy or Illusion: Brownie or Illusion: Snake or Illusion: Rat or Illusion: Orc or Illusion: Gnoll or Illusion: Froglok or Illusion: Goblin or Illusion: Lizard man.  There has got to be something in that global file for us.  <P>Maybe if i keep Saying Illusion: Evil Eye over and over again somebody at Verant will grant my wish. Evil eye, Evil eye, Evil eye, Evil eye. I want Illusion: Evil eye dangit!<P>/sigh<BR>:em crosses his fingers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yeah its as funny as all the dead druids at the guards' feet in wolf form you can see when running through FV.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Enchanter class is normally very quiet, I think, but Verant has gone too far to NOT improve the class.  They went out of their way for druids and mages, and have gone out of their way to ignore enchanter class.<P>Here are some points and complaints from me:<P>- 150 mana buff for 450 cast cost is stupid.  I will NEVER mem that spell - EVER.  Why?  Because just hearing the name pisses me off.  I dont ever want to be asked to cast that buff on someone; therefore, I'll never mem it as long as the spell remains as it is.<P>- Someone early on in this thread said that enchanters should be complaining about the high MR of mobs in Velious.  I'll enlighten you why you dont hear much about that:  we're USED to it.  Nothing new.<P>- What do enchanters do well?  Well... they mez well (though Kunark mez spells have an extremely high mana cost) and they give good mana regen and haste buffs.  Shaman have always been able to slow better than the enchanter (no complaints there, at all) - but please tell me WTH Verant was thinking when they made the Ranger epic weapon's slow proc DISPELL the enchanter's level 56 forlorn deeds!  That is a slap in the face.<P>- However you want to look at it, in various ways Enchanters were basically told it wasnt possible to give them illusion spectre.  Now Necros have it.  I feel that I was lied to, and I am angry about it.  <P>- Illusions are important to the enchanter because they are FUN.  Games SHOULD be fun - but basically the enchanter is not that fun to play without illusions.  **Nothing fun about mezmerizing a mob to me... nothing fun about buffing the heck out of people so they can get up and kill things while I sit down and med.**  Simply put, illusions made the class fun.<P>Do I sound disgruntled?  I'm pushing 180 days of played time with my enchanter.  Go figure.<P>Aelianna the Tactician<BR>Phantasmist of the Tribunal Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about a compromise?<P>Personally I think enchanters are fine.  Illusions are a minor part of the class, although a fun one.<P>Reasons for no new illusions:<BR>1.  Game Balance - No mimic illusion because an enchanter could walk anywhere unharmed (I know I know..not anywhere...but it's still a problem).<P>2.  Technical - Illusions need to be a in the global file and that can only be so large.<P>3.  Class Diversity - You dont want to give enchanters the same illusions as other classes because they should be diverse.<P>Here's an idea that shouldn't break any of those rules, yet still gives enchanters what they want.<P>Right now there is illusion: treeform and the druid treeform spell.  What it does is transform the caster into a tree.  Now this spell does not work in all zones.  Trees arent in the global file, therefore the spell only works in zones with trees.  The spell grabs the nearest tree and turns you into it.<P>So what I thought was how about some new illusions that don't work in all zones.  For example, Illusion: Griffon.  Only works in the Karanas, the commons, eastern wastes, and sky.  When you cast it in another zone it gives the same message as treeform, something like 'you cant seem to change here' or whatever.  Instead of making a spell that mimics any mob in the zone, make a few spells that mimic a certain mob IF the model is in the zone.<P>Obviously Illusion: froglok or something along that line is going to be unbalancing, but other mobs that dont really have a faction associated with them shouldnt be affected.<P>Would Illusion: beetle (turns you into a beetle or fire beetle if in the zone) be unbalancing?<P><BR>I dunno...I hope that made sense.  If that's still not feasible then thats fine, just thought i'd throw something out to maybe end this thread and appease both sides.<P>Amuin V`Izhul<BR>53rd season Heretic of Innoruuk<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think Absor got confused. Enchanters are unique because they can do so many illusions. To say that if they gave enchanters illusion bear form would take away the uniqueness from Shaman would be insane. Shaman are not unique from their illusion, they are unique from being the uber-buffer and slowing class. They would lose no uniqueness from enchanters having bear form. Instead, Enchanters lose THEIR uniqueness for NOT HAVING this illusion that another totally unrelated class has.<P>Simply put, any illusion available to any class, should be available to enchanters. There should be no reason why a Necromancer can make himself look like a spectre, or a shaman a bear, and yet an enchanter somehow has no idea how to do it.<P>It is simply wrong. Enchanters are the benders of vision and form. They are able to make themselves look as anything, and control anything.<P>To see a lowly Necro change his form into an illusion and not the enchanter is pure madness.<P>The only people losing any uniqueness here is the Enchanter by simply not being able to turn into the forms *all other classes get*.<P>'Nuff said.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here here. Druids, Shamans, and Necros all gain their uniqueness (is there such a word) from things other than an ability to illusion. It in no way attacks this unique nature of each for the enchanter to be able to illusion the same.  It actually detracts from the unique nature of the enchanter if she is unable to do it.<P>Dont even say that enchanter illusions can be compared at all to magicians pets. Very poor argument. Two unrelated issues except for the fact that it proves possible for the enchanter to take on illusions of the critters in the zone.<P>I for one am illusioned almost 100% of the time. Sometimes for the stat benifits but mostly for the fun of being able to do it. I see no additional illusions as useless as I have a blast using them all.  I could care less whether I get a faction change or benifit from using them.<P>So come on Verant...

I dont think enchanters really care that necros can be spectres and they cant, nor do they care that shaman can be bears while they cant.  The only reason these were brought up at all is for the way enchanters were told it was _not_ possible to have the spectre illusion, due to limitations on memory, then it was given to someone else.  The other reason...well....its kinda annoying to ask for a new illusion, when you are a class called an "illusionist", and not be heard....while other classes, which arent illusionists at all, _are_ given new forms.  THAT is why people feel betrayed.  Do you get it?<P>The point is....leave necros the only class to have spectre.  Leave shaman the only class that has bear.  But give enchanters a new illusion please...a "hey, im a level 60 enchanter, look at this cool illusion i get!" spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have noticed that nearly everyone who has stated the above is in thier low 40's and below. I play a 54 enchantress (refuse to call it an illusionist as we are not. They are parlor tricks.) and have played a bit over a year and a half.  Starting at 50 it gets harder and harder, and more mana expensive to crowd control. Over 55 its almost not possible. I die on the average of four times a day because I run out of mana. Heck, I even put that silly gift of magic thing on to get the +1 per tick of mana. At 55+ the creatures you will be fighting are by and large, NOT MEZZABLE. I have a charisma of 196 and the failure rate is a joke. <P>Yes, I am disappointed in the "high end enchanter" .. disappointed that we can not do the job we were created for effectively. Heck, I saw a bard mez a creature I spent AN ENTIRE MANABAR trying to mez.  At 193int, I get SEVEN.. count them SEVEN tries of "Glamor of Kintaz". Then I get flattend and ressed.  Keep in mind this is with: Brilliance, C2, Gift of Magic and a bard singing manasong. <P>I am Disillusioned and Disenchanted<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Crafting of magic items to the apparently dissenfranchised masses who somehow belived it was in their character description not ours. Now Illusions for other classes and not ours. Enchanters are not a salvage yard of parts to hand out to other classes to make them feel better. The only thing you havent' done is give a good mez spell to the underpowered Rangers BTW it will help if they get lower resist rates, after all it would be a shame not to share the wealth. Oh hehe and by the way your new spell "Bane of the Garu" could you make that cost twice as much with a 3min durration and 10 min recast time in the next update.

Healers, heal, buffers, buff, illusionists ILLUSIONATE! <BR>now. with that being said. just so the entire populus of enchanters doesnt have to hold your hand. for new illusions we want something BIG and scairy like WUrms or Hill giants, we want Small stuff, like Wisps or snakes, we want Unusual stuff like Gollums or Goo,s we want Popular races such as Sarnaks, Frogloks, brownies . and we DONT want to have to Jump through hoops for them like we did with Illusion Iksar, that made me even more ticked off at veriant. id actually like Item Illusions, Like Illusion Staff, or Sword, and look like a Floating Broadsword. that way i could Follow somone around and it would look like they have a kick ass sword. speaking of wich. im going to bring something up i HOPE enchanters would aggree with me. we are Enchanters. sence we enchant a sword and shield to protect us. do you honestly think we are going to use a rusty saber and a crappy wooden shield to protect us at level 49+ no.. chances are we are going to be finding a double edged Mithril Dirk and a Spiked Shield of Laodacia or whatever. hell why cant you make our pets worth while. a level 49+ enchanter is NOT going to animate a piece of crap. we would rather our pets hit harder or had more hp. speed is not an issue .  i sat ther and watched a mage pet hit for 58 while at best mine hit for 52.. a Souless pair of daggers with a speed buff should be able to take damage or at least dish it out. its just an idea. but ILLUSIONS ILLUSIONS ILLUSIONS! we would like Effect Illusions. get creative would you. imagine an GLowing ball of Electricity. or like i said before. a Whirlwind, or gas cloud. you do it for weapons why not illusions.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>aaerie..<P>saying that the things you fight at 54+ are "by and large NOT mezzable" is a very large over-exaggeration.  In the original continents, everything without a giant flag is mezzable (save that buggy-arse zone known as the hole).  In kunark, there are very few things you have to use GoK/rapture on....pretty much limited to juggs and some shrooms in sebilis.  If you are spending the majority of your time doing those two things, well.....you arent in the best area for xp/loot (nice risk vs reward here verant).  Basically, you do these areas for two reasons...to kill the shroom king for the living fungus stuff, or killing the trash juggs/shrooms for spells.   <P>Now Vellious otoh....well vellious sucks ass for an enchanter.  The majority of things you fight here really are immune to mez, and many are just immune to mez in _any_ form (I.E. they have the giant flag).  But alot are just immune to any type of crowd control spell (root, snare, mez, ST, lullaby or whatever the hell bards cast) because they are immune to magic based spells.  The life of the vellious enchanter is buff buff buff buff, and hope at some point something shows up that is 53 or less and not immune to magic so you can charm it without using dictate =).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, A few little ideas I wanted to put up where people will actually see them..<P>Perhaps this would be unbalancing or something if people judge you by looks but some sort of illusion clothing, so I could look like i'm wearing plate armor, or leather.<P>Also I was thinking I would like to see enchanters get some sort of shrink/growth.. perhaps this is part of a shamans uniqueness, but at least being able to shrink/growth on self only would be nice, we already get gnome form if we absolutely need to be small but this would just be sort of a fun thing to have.. (Not too long ago a group member that wasn't shrunk kept saying she wanted to dress me up in barbie doll clothes, lol)<P>Also maybe an illusion lizardman (the ones in cazic) at higher levels, by the time you get the illusion most probably wont attack you just from level diff anyway.. oh well they look cool =)<P>Don't remember where I saw it, but illusion fish would be interesting, they seem to be almost everywhere theres water (you'd have to be in water to be a fish), have no faction concerns, are small (perhaps take up less space in this mystery global file if they arent already there). would get bonus to swim or just max swimming perhaps, and water breathing..<P>Well, just some ideas.. hope i didn't just copy others, I don't feel like reading all 7 pages (and 9 on the past topic of this??) but I wanted to get more ideas out about illusions to add. I agree that we enchanters should get more illusions past 44, not one every level but at least SOME, i'm level 23 now and I'm very anxious to get my first non-player race illusions after so much waiting (don't count minor or tree, they can't move).. (another side note why is the illusion: iksar quest so hard? I hear people say I shouldnt try to do it till 30-35, when I went to FV again at 20 everything was still red/ready to attack me and nobody killing there was less than level 30.. why not just give the spell to us at 30 then sheesh) As one final comment that has probably been said before, do they expect us to believe that there's no way to get more into the mystery global data file? now it's just all full, there will never be anything new that's global added to it, that Everquest has reached a dead end and now it's all down hill from here? I hope thats not true, because it's a great game that I don't want to see die, I'd rather see continual upgrades to this than any new Everquest 2 that only super-new computers can use..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Maybe this is just somthing a little too simple in the way of a possible salution... but Druids get Pack Sow Pack Regen and Share Wolfform.... the only spell I see so far for enchanters to do anything with other party membersis this.... Boon of the Garou.... now.... I would like to say my take on Enchanters is not masters of Illusions.... that would be an Illusionist.... Enchaters are what thier name says... ENCHANTERS... the ENCHANT things... wether people... animals... Gold... silver....monsters... whatever!!!! I know I ALWAYS feel better with an enchanter in my party.... if things go wrong... normally they make the diffrence.... keeping the " EXTRA " mobs stuned and doscile while the party takes them down one by one.... so I honestly do not feel that enchaters lose out on illusions.... but... back to what I was saying.... Why no give enchanters a line of spells like the Druids pack spells.... where they can turn another... or an ENTIRE party into somthing... and NOT just one spell.... just think... and ENTIRE party of Elementals.... or Werewolves.... maybe the illusions can add bonuses to casting them.... I think this can be done with no extra " World " space needed... seeing as everthing the enchanter would be casting on the party.... can be taken straight from what already exsists.... maybe it's just me.... but it seems like an idea doesn't it??????? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok time to throw my two cents into the mess... <P>I think illusions should be powerful and should be fun. They should make us able to go anywhere even places where we should be KOS.<P>To me that is part of the value of an enchanter as an illusionist. <P>Yes there should be risks to this. There already are to those of us who made are enchanter's to RP so we have religion. (Though we are few we do exist.) Some creatures see through illusions like some see through invisibility (at least when you have religion). <P>Even without religion there are inherent risks just going in a place you are unwelcomed. A lone enchanter in a KOS city can be rather dangerous. Verant seems to want to deny that but then they always think every thing is too easy. I honestly believe they think everyone belongs to a guild or that everyone will cheat if they can. (Not that the 2 are related.)<P>Getting back on track. I don't care what transformations druids have. They can have tree, rock, pool of water, wolf forms till the cows come home, bears, and any other fish or fowl, flora or fauna you care to name. Druids are druids and that is the sort of thing they do. Necros can have all the undead under the sun and moon. Rogues can have all their little disguises. Mages should be summoning golems at higher level if you ask me and not the sundry creatures of the field. Mages should stick to elemental things and not be pulling living creatures out of their hat. <P>An Illusionist should be able to convince his or her enemy that they are friends. Illusionists should be able to look like the King's best friend, his wife, or his favorite chair. Illusionists should be able to look like the King himself and make the guards lose all sense of balance and start hacking on each other. <P>I have yet to see a compelling reason why illusionist can't be everything.<P>PS: Did anyone remind Verant that some illusions and transformations can't be performed everywhere? How many times have you tried to cast minor illusion only to get a message it wont work here? That seems to be the solution to Verant's arguement: they would be too powerful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>YIKES!!!<BR>We are nearing the 600 mark.<P>Well, I cannot say that i have read all 600 posts, and maybe this has been said, so I will apologize in advance if it has been.<P>As chanters, are we solely illsionists, or shape shifters?  If we are soley illusionists, why do we get the benifits of certain races when we use their illusion?  I can understand the night vision transfering over, because as illusionists, we affect light.  But why, then, do we get the ability to regen as trolls or iksar?  To me, that is shapeshifting, not an illusion.  <P>Also, lets look at the very beginning of when someone dons the mantle of a caster class.  There are so many different types of magic to focus on, that they only take one to specialize in.  A necro choses to study death and will focus on it.  A chanter will focus on enchanting things, including himself to look different.  A mage will focus on the elements, and a wizzy on battle spells.  4 distinct different types of magic that would take different types of people to cast and use (4 different schools of thought).  Then you add the hybrids (more on that later).  Where would a necro have the time to study to learn an illusion?  He is focusing on death magic, which is something different.  Is he changing his form?  Well, we can change form, too (iksar and troll).  If shapeshifters are what we REALLY are, because it is our MAIN school of thought, we should be able ot master ALL the other shapes and forms that every one else can, especially the hybrids.  Hybrids are parts of this and parts of that ... if we be shapeshifters, and they are taking a part from us, we should be able to do everything they can when it comes to shapeshifting.  <BR>  <BR>I really think that there needs to be a distinction to what we REALLY are: illusionists or shapeshifters.  Once we have that distinction, we can fine tune everything from there.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mientrixx<BR>Station Member   posted 12-17-2000 02:47 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Absor and everyone else...<BR>I think somewhere in here the point was lost. I dont think enchanters really care that necros can be spectres and they cant, nor do they care that shaman can be bears while they cant. The only reason these were brought up at all is for the way enchanters were told it was _not_ possible to have the spectre illusion, due to limitations on memory, then it was given to someone else. The other reason...well....its kinda annoying to ask for a new illusion, when you are a class called an "illusionist", and not be heard....while other classes, which arent illusionists at all, _are_ given new forms. THAT is why people feel betrayed. Do you get it?<P>The point is....leave necros the only class to have spectre. Leave shaman the only class that has bear. But give enchanters a new illusion please...a "hey, im a level 60 enchanter, look at this cool illusion i get!" spell.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Mientrixx probably hit the nail on the head the best, but I'd like to expand a little more on it.<P>The fact that Enchanters don't get any post 44 illsuions isn't the real problem, it's one of the symptoms of a larger problem.<P>Since I've played the game, back in May of '99, there has been a slow, but steady, stream of requests for improvements to the caster classes.  A number of these requests were cosmetic and "fun" changes.<P>People asked for a way for casters to get away from the "robe look".  We were told that the resources weren't available to allow that, and they didn't want casters to look like the melee classes.<P>Enchanters asked for post 44 illusions.  Again, we were told that the resources weren't available.<P>When there was an uproar, when the Enchanter's Insideous Robe was cloned into the Robe of Ishiva, we were told, to some effect, that was an accident and it wouldn't happen again.  Months later, the Magician's Robe of the Elements, and recently the Necormancer's Blighted Robe, fell into the cloning vat.  Now, the only class specific, unique looking caster items, that are still unique (as far as I know) are the Necormancer's Shadowbound Robe and Flayed Skin Armor.<P>When people complained about the scarcety and general unimpressive quality of caster items in Kunark, Gordon told us, if I may paraphrase, that you can only do so much with Intellegnce and Mana.<P>When RoK was released, the Dev team found the resources to put Spectres in the global file, and give Necormancers a new pet.  When SoV was released, resources became available to allow the bear to be put in the global file, giving Shaman a new pet, and Druids a new form.  Also, "Six new types of visible armor for each playable race." (As a side note, I wonder how many of those 6 sets of armor can be worn by casters.)<P>Returning to the illusion issue, to illustrate the problem shared with the rest of the issues.  When Enchanters asked why these newly found/made available resources couldn't be used to add some more illusions, we were told that the polygon count was to high, the illusions would harm class distinction, faction issues would be overbalancing, etc., etc.<P>Now, like the other issues, players offered suggestions.  Some of the suggestions are good, some are bad, and almost all of them, like in times before, are met with stone dead silence.<P>This is what's frustrating.  This is what leads to accusations of lying.  The preception here is that the people of Verant have deemed that these issues do not warrant attention or address, yet feel they need to be polite and not tell us we're out of line and to go get bent.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
