</FONT><HR>Clickable effects are tricky to manage.<P>If the breastplate is meant to be a way to reduce downtime without unbalancing major encounters, why not just give it a clickable celestial healing.  Two or three clicks and folks will be healed right up, but there will be no stacking bonus to having multiple breastplates at an epic encounter.  <P>It could even be Celestial Healing 2, and give more hit points but take longer to finish healing the target, but this leads back to the possibity of a cleric and a tank clearing entire zones for experience.  Of course, I have been in groups in Guk where a paladin's clickable valor was our primary source of healing.  Any time there is clickable healing or damage it will decrease a groups downtime.<P>The solution with having the breastplate give a buff-and-complete heal feels very kludgy. <P>Although I suppose it does give a group the option of having their main tank fight without ANY buffs, having the clerics click their new heals onto him, and having someone else chain casting dispel magic on the tank to make it possible for the next BP heal to take effect.  <P>Would it still be an unbalanced item if a cleric and warrior were to go to Sol B with the warrior unbuffed and the cleric casting a dispel between breastplate clicks?  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think we should assume that verant has some sense and will make the buff undispelable (like i believe divines/harmshields are).  An even better solution would be to make it not take a buff slot at all.  I hate the idea of wasting a buff slot in such a manner.  <P>If it didnt take up a slot, it would be undispellable (ie.

</FONT><HR>Just a thought,<P><BR>   The Donal's Breastplate honestly was overpowered. Very slight changes could be made to the effect to tone it down but keep its usefulness intact. I would suggest ONLY changing the fact that its effect is a instant complete heal. What I mean by this is 1-full hitpoints  almost instantly. This is the part that made the effect so "overpowered".<P>   Why not keep the complete heal effect, but make it a HoT (Heal over time). Almost like a super regen. Basically it would be a upgrade from the current Cleric spell "Celestial Elixer". Which would complete heal the target over a time period of maybe 30 seconds, and have a casting time of 15-20 seconds or so. As a buff, even if used in battle it takes 15-20 seconds to cast...but then 30 seconds to complete heal the person. Therefore it cannot be overlayed, and any large target can easily kill the tank if ONLY this effect is used to heal the tank. I do believe this is simular to the PoG cleric BP as well.<P>These types of changes would make the bp VERY useful to the clerics and their groups and still not "overpower" them to the point of 1 group killing any mob in Norath. Just a thought or idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am sorry to say that I cannot believe some of the posts I have read so far.  It is with heart felt sympathy that I plead with some of the posters.  Grow the F*** up.  It is a game!!!  A GAME!!!  Write that down a few times and repeat it a few times too, maybe it will sink in.  They messed up by putting this item in game and they know it so they are going to fix it.  Like it or not it is going to happen.<BR>I agree with them changing it!  I am beginning to think that some of you just want items, items are nice but they do not make the game.  Christ people look around, in game, there is more then hack, slash, cast, nuke, and heal.  Hey Verant, why don't you make a "special" server for the freakin whinners.  Make all the mobs have no magic resists, 10 hp and they don't attack.  Reduce the aggie range to zero, so they don't get jumped.  Give a 300% exp bonus for killing bats in Qeynos Hills, with no level cap.  Finally, have it so that every mob killed drops the best equipment available.  Maybe then these little snot nose brats can feel like they did something worth while.  <BR>"If you don't die every now and then your not adventuring"<BR>If you think that Varent is being unfair go play Diablo 2 or something else that you can use cheats and such.

</FONT><HR>Absor/Aradune,<P>It's arguable whether or not Donal's should have been nerfed.  What I simply ask is that you give clerics something in return.  This is 3 major cleric nerfs in the last year, and not one positive change to clerics since I started mine in June 1999.  If you think of one, I am sure I can explain that it isn't.  Are clerics useful? I suppose.  Are clerics fun to play at high levels? Arguably not.  Those who do not play clerics (points at verant) simply cannot understand what it is like.  Those who say that there is much more to being a cleric than healing is just plain wrong.  I didn't get to where I am today in EQ nuking mobs or summoning hammers. <P>So I challenge verant to do this.  Give us SOMETHING.  Playing a cleric is a challenge of its own, and nerfing MoK and Donal'sx2 simply makes the high level cleric a more rare spawn than ever.  <P>I hope to discuss this topic with you more in Baltimore, specifically the items listed in Absor's recent class postings.<P>Deven Lionstar<BR>High Priest<BR>The Harmonium, Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<P>While I essentially agree with the tenets that you MUST fix things that are broken so badly they destroy game balance, I think you can find better ways to do so.  I realize it isn't an easy thing to do... but, as with many other "nerfs", the corrections have been overcorrections... heavy handed "whacks with the nerf stick" that leave nothing but a bad taste in everyone's mouth.<P>My suggestion in this case is simple... as has been suggested earlier in this post... change the right-click effect.  Instead of Complete Healing, let it cast Divine Light.  The recast time would need to be reconsidered, as would the cast time, but this would solve your essential problem.<P>As has been pointed out in many other threads, complete heal is a spell that is, in and of itself, almost overpowering.  It has created the "inequities" that druids and shamans have whined piteously about.  Though I feel the spell SHOULD be in the game (and the game is balanced accordingly), having it be a right-click effect is unreasonable.<P>Bottom line, the item (Donal's Breastplate) is broken.  Nerfing the effect is likely to be VERY badly received... while altering the effect is much more palatable.  If you give the clerics who wear this a healing spell they can actually use and learn tactics to use, you retain the item as useful.  The current nerf effectively destroys the item in question (between the 30 second cast time and the delay on recast on person in question).<P>Certainly balancing a game the size of Everquest is a challenge... I don't discount that at all.  Please, however, don't make rash decisions in doing so... there are better solutions.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Heya Brad...<P>How about just putting Mark of Karn as the Breastplate effect and complete the greatest nerfed item ever!<P>Seriously though.  I've seen more of the high end game than most people so I think I know what Im talking about. While we've been in Sleeper's Tomb this past week with Abashi, Kendrick, and God know whe else watching us - we KNEW that this was coming down the pipe.  They acted like they had never seen the item in use before.  Whats worse, is talk of retuning the zone, AND nerfing the Donals BP based on what was happening there.  We even had to PROVE to the GMs/Admins that we could kill a sentry WITHOUT using BPs.  Guess what?  We did it no problem.  The difference? I have to med a few extra minutes.  HOW is that unbalancing?  At best the ONLY thing Donals does is decrease my downtime.  Thats it.  Only in EXTREME circumstances do we ever switch to using the BP to heal with. (And btw there are far more than 5 such encounters).  When we have 8-10 healers go OOM, and the MOB is still at 50% what the hell are we supposed to do?  Are you saying we now need 20 clerics to do this?  Thats simply ludicrous.  So I guess you can add that Donals cut down on some lag as well, since we didnt need 3:1 cleric to warrior ratio to endure a 15 min fight.<P>MOBS that are WAY out of line - Tormax, Derakor the Vindicator, Statue of Rallos Zek, Avatar of War, Dain Frostreaver, Yelinak, Klandicar, Velkator, Tunare, VT dragons (havent fought, so im assuming).  Im sure there are some that I missed.  Its hard enough trying to find 10 GOOD clerics thats are 55+ on the server, its gonna be a real treat trying to find 20.  You will have to retool a TON of gameplay.  Besides, these mobs should have NEVER been tuned with Donals in mind.  That item is a rare luxury item not the DE FACTO STANDARD for clerics.<P>In XPing situations I agree, the BP is nonstop heal machine that requires no mana and no downtime, with low risk.  In THAT regard its highly unbalanced.  Yes, there are people who probably use these for twinking.  But with such a limited number I still fail to see how it is MASSIVELY disruptive to the game.  There cant be more than 100-150 of these across ALL servers combined.  Make them NO DROP, and you eliminate the twinking aspect.  I find it hard to believe that the people with Donals are sitting around XPing all day and twinking either.  These are the people that are most likely doing large events where the BP applications are limited at best.  Stop them from dropping off Trak if thats an issue.  I just really hate to see this item that provides someone an earned advantage become even MORE useless. What now separates the wheat from the shaft?  You can get a far superior unlimited heal BP free in POG.<P>If you really cant live with yourselves with this item in the game then here are some suggestions.<P>1.  Remove it completely and change the name when you nerf it.  This is no longer a Donals BP, it is something now twice removed and is an embarrasment to the Donal's line and name =).<P>2.  Change it to a 20 sec cast with a 20 sec refresh.  40 seconds between heals on the stuff we are fighting is an eternity.  We are STILL going to be OOOM at 50% mob life.  Quad-hitting 1050 damage mobs with a million HPs are IN THE GAME.<P>3.  Seriously, if you are going to put a timer on it, test it.  The Invigorate BPs will now be able to heal more HPs per min on a single target than Donals - so will the POG BP.  I will be able to RUN across several zones before its useable again?<P>4.  Why not just change the effect, and put a level restriction on it.  How about componentless Aegolism at 58.  THAT is useful.  <P>5.  PLEASE put a new cleric BP deep inside some dungeon (NOT POG) that will replace Donals forever and free people from this cursed item.<P>I expect the kiddies to flame, so give it your best shot.<P>Nino McHammer<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, having discussed this with all those I personally know, and those in the samll guild I am in.

Having never seen it, used it, been with someone who has used it, been in a group where it has been used, removing it does not impact us at all.<P>Go into any old world zone and shout out if anyone has seen one and listen to the *crickets*.<P>I do not know of a zone you can go into do the "one cleric , one warrior" take down the mob in 30 seconds that could also be done without the BP.<P>I have seen places where it could never happen. Where not only would the warrior be dead, but he would be piled on top of the where cleric had been casting gate.<P>Can 2 players take down Old world mobs? of course, else why the level cap on the Naggy/Vox?<P>Can a warrior/Cleric with BP take down Trak solo? Dunno, better question would be can they as a duo, get to trak to take him down?<P>It seems strange that all the talk about balance issues revolve around the top 1% of active players, and none around the middle 90%.<P>On a server with 2400 acive players, if with have 4 BP that is .0166666666666 %.

</FONT><HR>I have a question for all those screaming about this.<P>You sit here saying "Hey, no two man team could every kill a boss mob, the warrior would be dead in under 30 seconds".<P>Why is -everything- about the boss mob?<P>Don't you realize that this would be the ULTIMATE powerlevel item from 51 to 60?  Virtually riskless exp all the way to 60.  You keep talking about worthwhile mobs - is exp alone not worthwhile?  Funny, you'll have a hard time convincing me of that, considering how many pure exp groups I see post 50.<P>So, because an uberguild gets one Donal's BP, every lower level melee class in the guild is now entitled to level 60?<P>Oh, and as to another mob jumping in... so what?  Unlike OTHER situations without the BP, if something unexpected happens - guess what, the cleric is ALWAYS FM when that unexpected thing happens.  Not much unexpected that they can't handle with an FM cleric, is there?  If they have a clue, I mean.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What is needed here is logic, not a quick reaction that may prove as unsatisfactory as the first one.<P>Logic:<P>Is the BP overpowered for it's ability to reduce downtime? No, a drop from Trakanon is rare enough, let anyone who can get it have a decent reduction in downtime. It's not even that decent because I can cast my own CH on the tank and a couple Sup Heals for any other characters that need it in less than 30 seconds, and with clarity/bard song I regen the mana quickly enough it's not really missed. Not a big deal.<P>So, the overpowering is the ability to chain cast in combat to keep a fighter alive, as Absor stated.<P>We don't need to weaken the BP, we simply need to prevent its use in chain casting.<P>Absor's proposed solution does this, but costs a buff. Suppose the BP overwrites Aegis (450 mana) or Bulwark (350 mana). The benefits of this spell are lost for 7.5 minutes. Without this spell, the warrior will take more damage than he would with this spell. That means that for 7.5 minutes, our tank takes extra damage and we have to cast our own CH more often to keep him alive. <P>Result: We burn one extra CH because of this extra damage. That means we might as well have just cast our own CH in the first place, then cast one less throughout the fight. In other words, it makes the BP useless. Worse than useless because now we have to recast Bulwark or Aegis (whichever Verant decided to overwrite), thus wasting 350 or 450 mana. CH costs 400 mana to cast, so if I know I have to recast a buff for about the same cost of a CH, I might as well cast CH in the first place and keep the buff. Otherwise we will have less mana because we use the BP.  I guess I'll dust off my chest plate of constant and put it back on.<P>No, logically, this solution does not work.<P>Other solutions that might be viable:<P>1. Up the casting time to 45 seconds? How many cleric/warrior combos out there that are high enough level to get this BP are fighting blue (or higher) mobs that can't kill the warrior in 45 seconds? Answer: None, or very nearly none. We won't like the extra 15 seconds, but it's better than the mini-buff idea.<P>2. Make the BP buff equivalent to the buff it overwrites. If you overwrite Aegis with a tiny worthless buff, we won't use the BP. If you make the BP cast a 7.5-minute Aegis that overwrites the existing Aegis, it may be workable. This may be difficult, because some users of this BP are casting weaker buffs than others are.<P>3. Fix the silly code to implement recast times on items. I write software and I still can't figure out why you have an item that casts a real spell (available to spell casters) but does so in a different way that removes a standard feature of spell caster casting... <P>4. Simply increase the aggro effect of using the BP. If clerics learn that using the BP in a battle will aggro the mob onto the cleric, who will then subsequently die because the tank can't taunt it off fast enough, you will have regulated the BP back to a downtime reducer. I would be 10x happier with this solution than with the proposed 7.5-minute mini-buff.<P>5. Change the heal to a Sup Heal, make it cast in 10 seconds, and then up the stats/saves on it to justify the fact that it drops from Trakanon. This will also turn it into a downtime reducer.<P>I haven't had the time to read all 11 pages on this thread (it's not my job; I hope Absor or his assistants are able to read them all) so there may be more workable solutions out there.<P>Simply put, the proposed solution repairs the damage to the game at the cost of making this item worthless. If you're going to destroy the validity of the item, simply take it out of the game or remake it into something we can use (see point #5 above).<P>Please consider my suggestions, particularly number 4 or 5. Either of these suggestions will meet your needs in reducing the power of the item with a very simple code fix. Easy to program, easy to implement, and leaves us with a BP we will possibly use.<P>Please, I hope you read this far. I hope this logic appeals to you.<P>Thank you for your time.<P>Morodullin<BR>Logical Priest o Brell<P>(repost)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with this change.  In battles that last as long as SoV battles can, it is obvious that the Donal's BP is unbalanced.  Unbalanced items should be removed (from everyone) or changed.<P>IMO, Verant should be VERY careful with ANY right-clickable item.  I am not even sure they should exist.  Right-clickable low level buffs are more or less worthless.  Right-clickable offensive spells or healing are very abusable unless they are VERY low level as they completely upset the concept of mana use controlling how tough an encounter is.  <P>The Shaman Bracer is a good example of an item that should not exist as it makes Shamen better Nukers (long-term) than Wizards (at a given level range), which should NEVER be the case.  If any class should have had such an item, it should have been Wizards (and no, I don't play either class).<P>So even though Verant made a mistake, it would be a much bigger mistake not to fix the problem now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Brad Mcquaid<P>As for al this time i was one of those who had hoped that things would change in this game. But so far this has alays proven untrue, You calim to want changes in strategy but i have not seen any evidence in this. You claim to want to change the way creatures would kill PCs , not in a short time but i still have not seen any change in this.<P>Look we understand you are nerfing the BP after watching Furor and CO. farm the front mobs of SLeepers, and many know that this BP is over powered. But you always seem to blame us players for this which in this case at least is just wrong.<P>Do you KNOW WHY WE players had to come up with such tactics? It is simple, this is the ONLY WAY to beat such mobs. Listen brad, you ahev made the creatures to be killed by only 1 way and thats using the  BP. When you figure that only a certain number of players can come to a raid then You know efficiency by the players is the only way we can hope to beat these mobs. Cmon verant, you do not play the high lvl game the way the players do, we cannot bring your envisioned 100 plus ppl to kill the mobs in Sleepers, at ebst we can bring 20-30. When we do not have such things then we rely on the BP. And fact is, you desugners are the ones who made us do such things. Listen, your aised he HP bar of the mobs so the fights last much much longer, raised the damage dealth by the mobs so only 1 tank is a viable one, increased the Resistance so no caster can affect the mob , increased hitpoitns on the mob also has the effect of totally diminishing the ability of casters who can nuke the mobs ( given the 6lvl limit ) to hurt the mobs.<P>So that leaves that 1 cleric , 1 warrior situation.<P>You have promoted this thur your design. And now you blame us for exploiting this situation?<P>This is just an incredible fubar.<P>Mcquaid, if youa re set on thism then do this first, NERF the mobs that you designed to be fought by the Bp FIRST and then nerf the BP. If you can go thru all the velious zones and nerf 50% of the mobs of the whole velious landscape   then go ahead  nerf the BP. But i am not one to sit here and expect you to do so because i KNOW you are just trying to pull one on the achievements of Furor and co. And thats the sad thing about this nerf.<P>do not come along and bull**** us and try justify this when you know you are just hurting the 99%players to be spiteful to 1% of the player base. Becasue that is exactly what this nerf looks like.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You want the balance in such a way that YOUR class is the best. Until that happens, you obviously wont be happy.

Its easy to blame this on the BP but thats not the real problem. <P>So let me repeat, Think extremly hard aboout this. Give it a few weeks and see how thing develope. If you do decide to make this change you MUST retune all the mobs that were designed with it in mind BEFORE this nerf. Tormax, Lord Yel, Dain, Tunare, Velk, Vindicator and all his friends, all the dragons in VT(quad hitting for 850), all the boss mobs in sleepers.

</FONT><HR>Aradune quoted<P>"honestly and bluntly, the short-term happiness or disappointment is secondary in our decision making process. We fix and adjust and balance, especially after changes like this, to ensure the overall health of the game, because we fundamentally believe that our focus on the game's overall health and balance is what brings long term happiness to our playerbase."<P>While this is an honorable approach, it simply won't work. Short term happiness is something that is going to make you go much further with this game. I've seen so many people quit after playing 1+ year because of some oversight that negated their "short term happiness". All these changes you specify are negative. Maybe not in the long term of the game, but definitely in a customer service aspect. I constantly see changes being made to "change/enhance" i e nerf a class or skill, because the players outsmarted the people who developed it. The history of the game has been one screw up after another. I'm about through. Many I know are considering leaving as well. Continue to overlook the true desires of your customers, and you will be left with nothing.<P>The Donal's BP issue is just one of MANY that is going to come back and bite you in the ass. If you guys have so much time on your hands to be posting here, "testing" or so you say, developing, thinking of new ideas etc. Why don't you take some of that precious time and actually solve some REAL PROBLEMS!<P>Why not focus on changing mob pathing in zones &lt;Dain poofs if you pull him the right way in icewell keep&gt;. Why not address the issues of casters that have arisen in Velious? &lt;they basically do 1% of damage dealt on 250K mobs&gt;. Why not work on a new network plan so people can actually stay connected in a zone with 60+ people in the same space?<P>In my opinion, you guys are nitpicking over the wrong issues, rather than the issues that will actually increase overall game fun. Isn't that why we're all here?<P>The more things I see taken away from me, the more I consider quitting. I'm not alone in this thinking. How long will it be before you drive everyone to the breaking point? Take my advice and start solving some real problems rather than taking away earned items/effects. I think things will work out much better. <P>If donal's BP's dropped off fire beetles, I would be 100% behind you. But I waited months and months to get my hands on that item, finally ending with luck. The day it was changed was a sad one, but I still wear it with pride knowing it took 25-30+ people to help me get it. Now I will hang my head in shame over the memory of a wonderful item.

</FONT><HR>Something else occured to me after reading through the posts....<P>Our position is that 5 or so mobs need to be adjusted post-nerf.  Others disagree and claim that much more of Velious 'requires' the BP.<P>Let's say we're wrong and there are many more mobs that are simply too tough without the BP.  Think on that a minute -- that just overwhelmingly strengthens the argument that the BP needs to be changed.<P>The more Velious content that requires the use of this item, a rare drop off of Trakanon, the more it would be true that the majority of our playerbase could never enjoy Velious.  We can't have one rare drop off of Trakanon be a gating factor for our player base to enjoy Velious (whether it's fewer mobs as we believe, or more as others may believe).<P>So, we'll change the BP, and adjust mobs as necessary.  NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion... especially not a rare drop on a formidable dragon many players will never encounter.<P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;I have a question for all those screaming about this.<BR>You sit here saying "Hey, no two man team could every kill a boss mob, the warrior would be dead in under 30 seconds".<P>Why is -everything- about the boss mob?<P>Don't you realize that this would be the ULTIMATE powerlevel item from 51 to 60? Virtually riskless exp all the way to 60. You keep talking about worthwhile mobs - is exp alone not worthwhile? Funny, you'll have a hard time convincing me of that, considering how many pure exp groups I see post 50.<P>So, because an uberguild gets one Donal's BP, every lower level melee class in the guild is now entitled to level 60?<P>Oh, and as to another mob jumping in... so what? Unlike OTHER situations without the BP, if something unexpected happens - guess what, the cleric is ALWAYS FM when that unexpected thing happens. Not much unexpected that they can't handle with an FM cleric, is there? If they have a clue, I mean.&gt;&gt;<P>This post is a joke right?  A cleric and war are going to survive with more then one mob without a chanter around?  Espically if they are blue?  <P>Also on the part of being a pleveling tool, you're crazy.  After they put in the bonus for groups who would fight a mob with just 2 people when they can get more exp with 6?<P>Actually I completly give up.  Make your changes.  Nerf all you want.  This was the only reason I played my cleric.  THE ONLY reason.  VI please make the change, I really need a reason to cancel my three accounts.  After the manastone, MoK, and all the nitpicking nerfs, now this.  <P>Sorry games are supposed to be fun, it shouldn't cause stress like this every morning when I come to this damn sight.<P>58 cleric<BR>51 wizard<BR>51 necro<BR>48 warrior<BR>49 druid<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you're not hung up about loot and are just farming XP stone spiders is an endless supply of completely riskless pulls for any warrior cleric duo mid-high 50s. The xp there is the equivalent of what one can get in any other spot in the game. For no risk, I wouldn't turn my nose up at it so quickly. You don't need a BP to do it - but the argument against the BP would be the exact same argument against the arragement I have described.<P>Aradune, address Complete Heal once and for all. You can't avoid it, it will come back and bite you sooner or later. I'm kind of sick of casting this one spell repeatedly every time I play because it doesnt make sense to cast anything else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Neat.  You design a bunch of uber encounters in Velious that are melee/cleric pony shows and then nerf the item that makes these encounters possible.  <P>Hey, maybe you should nerf the lure robe.  Afterall, I was able to be completely resisted on every lure (fire based) I cast at Yelinak last night (I cast at least 20 times, and yes, I was well within melee range).  Meanwhile, good ol' yelinak is sucking the mana out of the air, dispelling clarity, and completely halting regen of mana.  I find this rather amusing since you can't stick a damn spell on him in the first place -- NOT EVEN LURES!!  I literally did more damage to him meleeing with my wizard than I did with spells.  <P>You guys tuned the SoV game to be a tank-cleric haven, so you might as well leave the tank-cleric toys as they are.  Otherwise we might as well pack our bags and leave SoV for good.  Thank God I have a monk I can play for these encounters.  At least he'll get to do some damage before getting annhilated.<P>If you are gonna nerf the BP, you better damn well nerf the mobs at the same time. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Think on that a minute -- that just overwhelmingly strengthens the argument that the BP needs to be changed."<P>Absor said, "It makes a huge difference. It's called mana. The breastplate is not limited by anything right now but it's 30 second cast time. The cleric is limited by his mana pool."<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Wouldn't this also imply that Complete Healing needs to be changed?<P>This breastplate is not overpowered. It's Complete Healing that's overpowered. Why should a level 39 spell be the most powerful spell in the game? 39th spells are passed out like candy as procs on weapons.  Why should a single class be *required* to kill these many mobs that are undefeatable without Complete Healing?<P>So Absor, you're saying it's impossible for a cleric to get back 400 mana in 30 seconds? I don't think any rational argument can be made to justify the complete healing spell. EverQuest will be eternally imbalanced as long as this spell exists. The fact that it was made into a right-clickable effect on an item demonstrates that VI has absolutely no idea just how imbalancing this spell is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I see level 56 monks soloing blues without a cleric or any other help in Karnors.

Yes, they increased the group exp bonus but not so much that it's MORE than the split the guy takes from the group!  For adding the third guy to get the first two more exp, it would mean you'd have to pull -almost- (the almost is because of the bonus) 50% more mobs in the same time.  And with the two man team using the BP, you -can't- pull any faster without doing multi-pulls, becaues there is ZERO downtime!<P>"Actually I completly give up. Make your changes. Nerf all you want.

</FONT><HR>The problem is that when the mobs and zones were designed this item was in mind. Even though they might not stated it, I can promise that every zone desinger had this item in mind when designing thier zone. Its not that we cant do it without donals bp, its the fact of still doing it with an enjoyable level of play. Like Nino said, this will mainly effect downtime. We might have to pick up a few more clerics, causing more lag and less fun but we will continue to destroy what mobs we want to. <P>We know the nerf will go in no matter what we say. You guys decision is already made mainly based on some of your dev guys knee jerk reaction. Personaly I think vel is just fine. There needs to be some minor changes with casters but other then that its pretty well done, all except getting to pom. I dont think its a good idea messing with the stability of the game after zones were designed with ceratin items and skills in mind. Remember in EQ there are steping stones guilds must take before they move to bigger mobs. You dont go kill lord yel without ever killing lord nagafen. So items you aquire off the stepping stones should be needed in order to preserve eq stability. <P>Just remember what the most experinced players in the game are telling you. We will move on as we have grown acustom to mass nerfs, but dont forget the players who suffer in the long run. <P>Elderan Lotuswood<BR>elderanlotuswood@yahoo.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052944&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052944&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
