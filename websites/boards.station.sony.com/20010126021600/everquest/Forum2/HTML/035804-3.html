&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>So to sum things up...you(Verant) made an error with the proc on FD when it finally went live(weeks after you said all epics were working correctly) and fixed it on the very next patch.  The "fix" gave FD an unresistable 155dd +1.5second stun.  As I stated before, the damage makes no difference(even if it were 500 the total damage we add to a fight is still minor) it's the stun we were concerned about for the most part.  The patch following the "fix" stated that you had upgraded several of the epic weapons.  I get lost here trying to figure out how making our proc check for magic save and being resisted along the lines of 50%, can be viewed as an upgrade.  Now we are told that FD is being tested with lure line resist rates on test server and it's the only change you are considering.  <P>So, that's a total of 3 changes on the epic proc and never once were the concerns we brought forth about the proc itself addressed.  The proc is simply not epic.  This weapon should have a long term stun, 6 to 10 seconds in my opinon.  One of the things a paladin does very well is keep mobs from casting via stun and bash.  There are at least 3 other weaons out there that I can think of that have a stun effect and one of them(Staff of Tranquility) is vastly superior in it's effect.  The other 2 also have longer stun times to my knowledge.<P>What we would like is for someone to seriously look into why, of all the epic weapons found, ours has the weakest proc/ability.  I understand that by comparision one of them has to be the weakest but FD currently isn't even playing in the same ball park with the other epics.<P>Hate to seem like a disgruntuled player but I feel like paladins are truly getting the short end of the sword on this.  I love your game and have been playing since release.  I will not quit the game over this one issue but it has certainly made the game, to some degree, less enjoyable for me.  I see clerics running around rezzing ppl for max xp every few seconds; rangers making themselves faster and mobs slower; enchanters giving everyone incredible speed buffs, even the casters and we swing away and every couple minutes get to see "your target has resisted the holy shock".  Please give our concerns some consideration.<P>Zargoon <BR>RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, now that I think about it, I'm really at a loss as to why everyone is surprised.  Paladins suck at fighting... They suck at defense.  They suck at magic.  Why are you all surprised about getting a sucky Epic weapon?  It kinda fits right along with the rest of our skills.  In this case, Verant did something -right-.  They gave us an epic weapon that goes perfectly with our skills.  Our skills suck, so so does our epic weapon.  The entire hybrid class really needs re-evaluation.<P>Oh yes, and I do apologize for the whiny nature of that opinion.  I realize we've heard enough whining, but I haven't gotten to do it yet, and it really, really felt good.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well since that's the 'final' answer that leaves me having to decide if it's worth being a paladin anymore, nerf nerf nerf.  highest exp penalty, lowest usefulness.  Even our epic gets nerfed to the point of futility and resistability.  If I decide to retire my paladin I'll also be retiring my account and recommending that my friends join me on a more player friendly game.  If our epic had been demonstratebly better than the other class epics I could live with the nerf, I don't mind not being the most powerful class in the game, but when we already had the weakest proc of the epics (not to mention totally lame effects on our deepwater gear) and we get nerfed down to the point where fairly common weapons are essentially the equal of what we can quest for there is no longer a point to playing.  I don't have my FD, nor even my FA, seems vox doesn't like to drop her book.  Wasn't even sure if I'd ever have them, but the desire to have it, to do the quest for an epic weapon was a driving force.  Now that weapon falls well short of the mark of epic, actually I propose that the pally FD be changed to the official title of medicore instead of epic, what's the point in suffering 2nd class citizen status? none, so I shall sleep on it, but don't be surprised verant if myself and my 30-40 friends cancel our subscriptions and go to a competitor.  I've been a loyal player for nearly a year now, but this final nerf and insult I think is the end of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Food for thought... a rogue with his epic will do about 2.5 times more damage than a paladin with FD (source: Copeland's weapon analyzer).

</FONT><HR>Folks, I think some of us are getting a BIT too hostile here, considering this is supposed to be a constructive criticism forum (at least I assume thats what Andorion had in mind when he posted it originally). Granted, we're getting practically no feedback from Verant here, but at least Absor has told us what the situation is (Not like he's the only person making that decision either, so don't snap at the man). Informing Verant that you've told 50 of your friends not to buy Verant games or threatening to quit playing just because of this one weapon isn't gonna impress them or make them go change it immediately. Just try to remain a bit more polite, I think that might make them a bit more willing to hear us out. <P>The level of detail toggles for weapons/zones/magic is a step in the right direction, albeit a bit excessive when all they really need to do is make FD and all other epic weapons particles on all the time, but I digress...<P>I'm just hoping Verant can look at one simple fact and understand just how sad it is...<P>FACT: The Fiery Defender's proc is substandard to the proc of a staff dropped off of a mob in Karnor's Castle. <P>Not a quested staff, not a staff that requires the slaying of multiple dragons, dealing with the politics that are inherent in dragon looting, not a staff that requires a trip into multiple planes and various other raids.

</FONT><HR>Truly Verant the FD is a joke, several weapons that drop in VP are much better (zweilander, sword of rile ect).  It's become something more like the soulfire when you hit lvl 50 or so, you just use it because it's cool and sacrifice the extra damage from a better weapon.  Why can't you just listen to what we are asking for? We don't want an ice comet proc at all, we want something that will help define our class because the FD itself isn't doing it!  You seem to think everything about the paladin class can be fixed by adding a proc, (ie Divine Might and one of the velious spells, FA, FD ect).  How about adding some good ones? Divine might is good and stays fairly true to the class but on the avengers how does some fire effect connect with being a holy warrior?  I'm sure it's impossible but an idea for a cool effect, one that only worked on evil creatures.  Similar to the undead line except something like banish evil.  From the RP point of view it's perfect and paladins technically shouldn't be killing good mobs anyway (the pally that helped kill inte to get the sword made me sick).  Just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the Lure, but we would prefer the Unresistable effect like the Celestial Fists.<P>However, with this being the last change to the Fiery Defender we will have to suck it up once again and add it to the long list of crimes against Paladins by Verant.<P>You think I'm being melodramatic?  Try playing a class for 20 months and constantly having to struggle with Verant's vision of what your character should be versus the vision of what most of the Paladin players feel they ought to be.  I don't think our wishes are out of line.  We are asking for balance and fairness.<P>After a year of gameplay, most of us realize this hybrid penalty is hogwash.  But will Verant remove it?  No.<P>After a year of gameplay, we now see that our rewards and items are severely lacking compared to other melee classes.  Do we get payback when the Epic(s) come to Norrath?  Hell no.  Sure we get a Fiery Avenger before everyone else -- but swords in Kunark were already eclipsing our damage by that point.<P>I am sick, sick, sick of Verant at this stage.  If it weren't for my friends in game, my time spent developing a character and personality in game, and the overall addiction to this game I would be long gone.<P>Verant's development team has no idea what they are doing with the Paladin class.  I doubt ANYONE at VI has played a Paladin longer than a few weeks.<P>This non-reaction to our pleas only angers the mob more.  I hope people realize that it will NEVER get better for Paladins.  <P>With one foot out the door...<P>D.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please answer and tell us why our proc was made worse. You at VI think the paladin is overpowered? If so you need someone who really plays on as a character to atleast have a say in the design of the weapon cause right now its lacking big time.

</FONT><HR>Verant,  not only is our effect not even CLOSE to epic,  but you have once again proven your total lack of listening  to the public by making it a 2 hander.  Most people who play paladins, and evidently you verant (look at the box covers) view a Paladin as a holy knight, with a sword in one hand, and a sheild in another.  The paladin community almost as a whole WANTS a 1 handed epic weapon, give it bare minimum stats if you must, but show the community that you are listening and care what we have to say, and make our weapon 1hs, or give us a quest to convert it to 1hs.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not gonna hang the messenger, thanks for a reply Absor. But i ask you take another message to verant.<P>I'm not gonna quit the game. After over 220 days /played im still hooked on this friggin game. Even though verant likes to screw paladins; im a paladin at heart and thats the only class that will ever be my primary.<P>I am however pissed off at what has transpired with this sword. When verant said they would not nerf any epic weapon, and then again in the last patch message that they were only making positive changes; well they flat out undeniably LIED.<P>I expect, nay demand someone higher up giving us an answer on this weapon.<P>Verant sees the impossible case where the dot could do infinite damage to any mob. And like usual they rush to beat the sword with the nerf stick before looking at it fully. They even had the gaul to say that it could do 1million damage. You realized that no npc has over 32000 life right? You realized that ever uber mob was resisting this proc outright right? You realized that any uber mob would kill a paladin before they could even process the effect so it could be resisted right? Would changing the duration to something reasonable angered us...nope.<P>The sword was obviously designed by one person and then later changed by another. The origional proc was obviously intended to be a 155 a tic dot. The duration was most likely a legitimate bug, infinite duration seems wrong. But the process being a dot is not a bug. <P>I would like both the person who origionally designed this weapon, and the one who changed it brought to this thread.<P>Please explain why this effect was unbalancing and why it had to be nerfed to restore balance. We know an infinite duration was a bug and needed to be changed to a fixed duration, but any other change to the effect needs to be explained. Explain why the effect was again nerfed while maintaining the pretence that no negative changes would become of the epic weapons. Reasonably explain to us how the effect could be considered epic in its last 2 incarnations.<P>Give us a reasonable explanation of why this effect was changed and we will drop the issue; this is all we are asking for...convince us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  I am sorry Verant, but I must concur with the findings that there had to be an incredible amount of incompentence in the development of this weapon with regards to how it stacks up with other epic weapons.  Im not saying this to be mean, but after the FA was first introduced, did nobody read how many of us were screaming foul at the fact that it was a 2h weapon as opposed to a 1h?  Did nobody realize that a paladin is a Defensive tank as opposed to a warrior being offensive?  This fact has unimaginably limited our use in certiain battles such as VS and some other higher level dragons and VP mobs.  NOW, you give us a pseudo-offensive weapon that has a proc that does LESS damage than Ghoulbane... (hmmm camp one Frog for about 6 to 12 hours for a 162 proc. vs undead, or do a MASSIVE epic quest for a weapon that does 150..?)  Yes the stun is nice, but how reliable is a proc. vs. a spell in a combat situation when that is our ONLY contribution to a battle ... (VS again).  We cant stun a dragon with our spells.<BR>  I know that this is going to fall on deaf ears, but I sure as heck hope that Scars has a MASSIVE bone thrown to us paladins with regards to 1h weapons.  As it stands now, I think I'd like to use a shield from VP and a 1h like maybe sword of the morning instead of just wasting mine and a lot of other peoples time with the FD.  <BR>  I love the idea of a proc that gives a rune effect such as the PGT or Slayer Axe and has a better damage/delay ratio.  Please Verant, listen to what we are asking for.  Thats all were asking.<P>Dragos Nightblade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035804-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035804.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035804-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035804-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035804-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035804-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=035804&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=035804&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
