</FONT><HR>I was trading with a guy named Jumlace about a week ago on the Rodcet Nife server.  I gave him a Wurmslayer for 5300 platinum and told him to have at least one inventory slot free.  We traded and, apparently ignoring me, he dropped it at the bank in Firiona Vie in the middle of a group of players.  I saw it so I picked it up because it was the only thing i had that was worth anything anyway and me and a friend got ported to WC.<P>I traveled to EC and sat down in the tunnel for a while because I wanted to watch a movie so I just let the game run.  About a 1/2 hour or so later, GM Zrinic summons me to a small room with no entrances in Qeynos Catacombs and me and Jumlace meet up.  I was told to give him his money back or the Wurmslayer or be suspended.  So having no choice I gave him the money back and that was that.   Afterward I talked to the GM a bit and told him I didn't think what he was doing was right.  He took this as "threatening a GM", said i would be suspended for 7-10 days, and expelled me from the game immediately.  <P>I tried getting back in but at the login screen was confronted with a message saying "You have been suspended temporarily....".  So I wrote a e-mail to the supervisor and went about my merry way.<P>Today I get a response from the supervisor Henderson that said what I did was fraud under the EQ policy and she BANNED ME!   That EQ policy she is referring to is the Play Nice policy, which shouldn't exist in the first place.  There is no way I can or should be banned after playing the game for 20+ months over something as redundant as a Wurmslayer.    What happened to warnings?   What happened to nice GMs that you could almost hang out with?   GONE.<P>I am awaiting a second response on this matter before I take some form of action, as this is totally unexcusable behavior from a company that I respected at one time (hell I was even a Guide for a short term).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You should have picked it up and said excuse me you dropped this... what ever happend to just plain being nice?  <P>I am not saying that a ban was the right thing for him to do but suspentions do get revised by a counsel/comitee. If they consider the act harsh enough they can upgrade the suspention to a banning. As for not agreeing to what was decided by the GM... That was your own fault even if you gave the money back. (Take someones wallet in real life then challenge the officer's decision after he says, you can go when you give it back, by saying that wasn't fair why couldn't I keep it. And see if you get a ticket.)<P>There are rules in life that you have to follow whether they be in real life situations or artificial ones.<P>Dark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Maybe you work/worked at Verant, and that's ok by me, but, although the CS has never been acceptable, it continues to diminish every month.  Now there is no tolerance for anything the players do.

</FONT><HR>You're complaining? Your slime, suck it up.  You tried to steal someones wurmy, and you admit that.  Stealing=Bad.  Bad people=Ban.  And you tell a gm that making you give back stolen property is WRONG? Hell, i woulda whacked you once with a gm sword, then booted you.  And don't you know when to stop? After talking to a gm and getting in trouble, you go over his head and talk to the supervisor? Shoulda quit while you were ahead.  And you know what, i'd love to see complete logs...be wonderful if you posted them...I love stupid people..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You admit to scamming the guy, then say the guy has no right to wanting the money or wurmslayer back.  I hope they do not lift your ban, then when confronted by the GM you tell him he does not know who he is dealing with.  He is dealing with someone that gets his kicks by scamming people.  I am going to write to the gm asking that they keep you banned.  You have no right to be allowed to come back.  Have a nice life loser, maybe now you will think twice before ripping someone off.

Deas my jailkeeper (i was thrown out of wizard best of the best for telling everyone to rush into the arena =) (in ooc and i added a j/k to the end)) but anyway GM deas he was cool.

</FONT><HR>Verant.<P>Once again you make policies in attempt to cover up the shortcomings of your game. The GM should have the ability to rip the sword or the money from the offender and give it to the offended, or the trade allowing the item to drop should be considered a bug and fixed. No matter how dubious this act was, I believe this whole incident could have been avoided through better coding.<P>Niil of Bertoxxulous - 45 druid<BR>Member of the Norrath Nobles<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the original poster completely.  I don't understand how the rest of you cretins can't.<P>Say, I was watching a child while cooking.  The door rang and I told him sternly to stay away from the stove while I answered the door.  The kid touches the stove and burns his hand.  Now, is it right for the parents of the child to sue me for this?<P>By telling the buyer to make sure to have an open inventory slot makes him a nice guy.  But, by picking up the Wurmslayer that the buyer dropped doesn't make him a horrible, untrustworthy person.  It just makes the other guy a complete idiot.  And, as I observed from the log, Jumlace is quite the little genius.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Logix, not a very clever comparison.<BR>Actually you could get sued, because you missed your control duty over the child. (Best thing to make sure a kid does something is to say it is not allowd to do it)<P>HOWEVER by that argument you say, any fraud is legal, because there is no other way that people learn. Stupid. <BR>But the other posts in this thread make me hope that EQ is not full of antisocials. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
