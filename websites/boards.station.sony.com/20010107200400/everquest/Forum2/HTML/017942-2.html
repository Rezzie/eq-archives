Many more are perplexed by your indifference and complete denial that their is a problem. You guys act like programmers who refuse to admit a bug until you see it with your own eyes but won't get out of your chair to look at tester data.<P>You continue to show arrogant indifference and total lack of concern for the actual experience of your customers, the ones you think are always wrong. This issue would take one night to confirm. Talk to people!!!!! Ask around!!!! Go to www.solusekro.org and read the raid folder and the nag folder!!! People are at each others throats becuase of the lack of supply to go with this demand!!!!<P>Designate a European Time Zone Server!!! Solusek Ro could serve this need just fine. But give the other time zones and especially the Pacific time zone a break please—i.e. another server to move to.<P>Norag<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was around when the "Sol Ro Split" was offered originally.  It was short notice and only 200 people could move. There was not guarantee, as if they had no idea how to handle it, so many were apprehensive to give themselves over to incompetence.  Subsequently, Verant has determined how to handle moves and could do so with no problem.  I agree with the prospect of moving whole guilds.  After all, why did you join or create a guild other than to be with your friends and commrades?  The European contingent, while as welcome as everyone else, is a large portion on this server.  Give Sol Ro over to them.  I find it amazing that a company could create something so wonderful, yet manage it so poorly and give little consideration to customer service. The messages I have read here, don't sound like they are coming from 12 year old children, but rather real gamers who would love to be able to play the game as it was originally intended.  I guess Verant bit off a bit more than they could chew, or didn't expect such a huge response to their product.<P>Either way, if a move could be handled so that guilds, friends, and/or families could stay together, I would be all for it.  If it would just be another screw up, like the first one...I'm not sure I'm willing to put my account in Verant's hands for that.<P>By the way...does anyone know if Verant or Sony or anyone with any authority reads these boards?  I guess money is money to them, and until they realize a substantial decrease in accounts receivables, they won't give a damn.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As I sat here trying to figure out what I wanted Verant or Sony to know one question popped into my mind "Do they even care how we feel?"<P>I have been on Sol Ro since April of last year.  I thought things were bad then when I started.  Hell try and start a new character now. You can't start up anywhere.  All the newbie zones are packed full with people and don't be in your 30's or 40's you can't hunt anywhere to get any exp without being on some waiting list.  Ohhh and if you don't know where the waiting lists are kept you are soo out of luck because no one will help you to find them to get your name or guild on it.<P>So Verant tell me how are we to find enjoyment out of a game that is more congested then the planet earth?<P>I don't see what it would hurt if you were to create 5 new servers and take the 10 highest populated servers and divide 2 into each new zone.  Don't do any of this ohh only 200 people can leave the server and then screw it up.  Take at least 500 - 600 from each one.  Now I am not a computer genius but it seems that what we all are asking is soo elementary. Give us a new server to call home please.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rolluk:<P>What don't you understand?  NOBODY here has said that anybody out there doesn't need a split except YOU.  We all agree that Mith Marr needs the split that they are getting.  I even say that Tunare needs the split too.  The problem is that Solusek ALSO needs a split.<P>YOU are the only one attacking someone's right to a split and you aren't paying attention to what we are saying.  We did NOT get a split.  We got a bone thrown that said "this bone will expire in 120 minutes and counting".  That bone wasn't even thrown so that anyone could get it, just those people who happened to have logged on that night as it wasn't even announced anywhere.<P>To Mr. Wrinn:<P>This topic is staying on the front page and probably will for a few days.  The only reason that it MIGHT come down will be because you close it with some "Solusek already had a complete split and will not be eligible for another until 2002, this is a closed topic and you will be banned for ever bringing it up again." nonsense.<P>We desperately need to get some people off this server.  People are quitting.  Not just your occasional person that has decided that it is time to move on with their lives, the people who truly love the game and want to continue but the high level overcrowding caused by risk/reward in some zones.  Some of these zones (Sebilis) have rediculous exp/risk AND rediculous loot/risk ratios.  People hunt here because YOU made the zones TOO tempting not to hunt there.  They also hunt in the planes.  A LOT.  PnP has turned into "I'm going to use PnP to Plan NOT nice" because they don't think that they have a choice.<P>Fix all your zones for risk/reward on loot AND exp.  Fix your Plane of Sky quests so that they are worth a damn and people want to go there.  Make Skyfire a zone worth running around in (maybe make all level 58-60 spells drop here and have a couple of named dragons that are tough, but not Trak tough that drop caster gear).  Fix the pathing in many of the higher level zones (I think someone has mentioned Howling Stones and the Hole) so that going in deeper isn't a death sentence and a 4 hour CR event.  Stop trying to make it so that the high levels will play around in level 12-18 zones (lesser Fay), you're never going to succeed until you make the loot reward better for the risk involved.<P>You have made a lot of good changes recently, but you really need to think about some of the REALLY stupid ones (MoK, low delay 2-handers, KoS spawns in cities that the guards won't protect you from... if that wasn't a way of saying "you're not welcome in our game" I don't know what is).  High level characters have very few GOOD places to hunt, but even with that, the BAD ones are heavily camped over the weekends.  Go into Solusek Ro and tell me what the zone pops are for zones designed for 46+ characters (no, SolB isn't a 46+ zone, it's a 35-45 zone).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That was literally around 30-50 45+ characters.  Those were all unguilded before the BoC problem.  A large number of those people QUIT when it was clear they couldn't get off of Solusek Ro.<P>Was Verant's intention to have people make it to 55 only to quit the game?

If there were just a couple people posting that they wanted a /movelog, I could agree with how that would be considered just a couple people whining.

</FONT><HR>We hit 3k on sunday and the log-in server refused any additional connections to the Sol Ro server after the 3k point. Gordon, explain why that happen, if Verant feels that putting population caps on servers is not in your vision thingy. Anyway, at 3k the server burped and crashed for several hours. This ALWAYS happens on weekends when Europe players and US players are mingling. 2800 to 3000 is typical for weekends. The server averages 2000 on a 24 hour period.<P>Not to mention that over 50% of the playing populace (Dont fricking count 7 mules per account as populace) is over 40th level and there is almost no space to play in the high level areas.<P>AND for those who say, uhhhh Sol Ro got its turn. Umm, that was when they we're experimenting with the /movelog crap. They only allowed 200 people and the /movelog window was only up for an hour at a very unpeek time. AND they screwed up and half the people that wanted to /movelog didn't!<P>No, they need to do an open /movelog for as many people as nessisary, and have the window open for 48 hours. That will allow established guilds the opportunity to deside if they want to move, with enough time to move all their members.
