</FONT><HR>I have been playing for about 1 week, I have never gone around begging for stuff from other players.  I have never asked another player to cast spell on me, but if they do I say thanks and move on.  This morning I went on to the Desert Ro and was hit upon by a level 3 paladin who inspected my stuff and then asked for a handout(!)  He then asked me to help him fight and asked for money and so on.  I politely told him that I was using all my stuff, (that I worked very hard to make as a tailor, or to kill other things to get enough cash to buy on my own.)  He was very persistant until I told him that the monsters here were very tough for his level, and he should go to East Freeport.  Is this normal for other newbies?  If so, I would like to apologize for being in that category.  Sorry for the rant, the whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Relentlis begges are so annoying. When I come across one, I gime him the benefit of the doubt that he doen's know better and suggest to him that beggers aren't like much and that his is better off killing stuff and selling the loot. That usually works. Some may be lvl 1 or 2 and may not actually know the best way to level. I be nice incase I run into someone who is just ignorant. I he were to persist, I would probably get a little more "kurt" with him. If they STILL wouldn't stop, I would probably have to continue the conversation in "ooc" mode, while using his name so everyone could see he was an annoying begger. Then others would start getting on his case as well. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ya know what? There are a lot of jerks out there and when you start to take it personally it's going to become not fun. You have *no* obligation other than the politeness of one player to another, one person to another. Giving them money/items/armor gives them the mistaken concept that it's a good idea to beg for stuff instead of working for it. <P>I know there are beggars that constantly hang out at the popular sell spots in the hopes that some overloaded player will give them the holy exalted stuph, the phat lewt that they are yet unable to attain themselves. <P>These players are held in comtempt by me. Just politely say no and go about your business. Remember that harassing is against the rules and if they continually bother you, you can /report A_rude_beggar00 and /petition that this rude beggar is harassing me and I also /reported so you can see the exact behavior. Granted, this is an extreme measure and should only be used in a worst case scenario.<P>Most times these players are NOT newbies but are alternate characters of higher levelled players who just don't want to do the work.<P>My apologies for my long windedness, these types of players just get me riled.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Just don't let them drag you down.

She was having a hard time making level 2.  2 days later, I saw her again - she was still level 1.  I decided to give her the greatest gift I know - knowledge.<P>I explained the dynamics of the zone - what she could safely hunt and where, and a few other useful tips (/loc, EQAtlas, AllaKhazam).  Within 20 minutes, she was level 2.<P>Since she was truly trying to learn and being very courteous, I rewarded her with a Bronze Long Sword I'd looted off a fallen guard (I didn't kill him - I just looted him).  This allowed her to grab some cloth armour and all her level 1 spells.<P>The next time I saw her she was level 4.  I gave her some quick tips on pet control, and now she's a higher level than me.  I ran into her in WC last week - she gave me 100pp and a Bracer of Erollisi for my previous efforts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Some newbies deserve your help.

</FONT><HR>I think that there are a significant number or real newbies that see "beg" as a skill, hear the lamers or other newbies begging for stuff, and just don't know any better.  Maybe not even the majority, but certainly a significant number.<P>So I start off by assuming that beggars just don't know any better.  I tell them the best way to get started is to hunt.  If they get rude or persistent, or ask for specific items, then its /ignore "heck" for them.  If they seem responsive, I give them whatever other hints or verbal help they seem to need - tempered of course by the amount of time I have available.  More if I'm medding, less if I'm on my way to a waiting group.  If they are curtious and/or trying to role play, they will get a shield buff (and a stern warning that they are NOT now invulnerable - I made that mistake as a newbie when I got my first buff)<P>In Erudin this weekend, I ran into two seperate players that were begging (one Sat, one Sun.  Note that anyone with a real clue wouldn't choose Erudin for the begging scam, so the percentages here are not the norm).  It turns out, both were Asheron's Call players just starting out in Everquest.  Odd that they picked the same weekend, same starting city, both wizards.  Is there something about AC that leads to these choices?<P>I had plenty of time, as I was waiting for the diseased shark to spawn and looking for a kind paladin to give me a hand with my quest.  One wizard ended up on the boat to Qeynos to richer hunting grounds and some instructions from me on how to mem and cast spells.  The other ended up camping to start a new character with an easier class/starting city after discussing the choices with me for a bit.  (If you ever hear AC players dis-ing EQ, ask what class/city they started in.  I'd probably have given up on EQ if I started out as a wizard in Erudin as my first character)<P>So be curtious.  Lets not give newbies the impression that all the experienced players are a bunch of rude, uncaring, creeps.<P>nikkon<BR>Any Erudite Paladins on Xev out there willing to give me a hand?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Recently, I have been playing in Butcher Block again. There has been a rash of lower level begging, some of whom turned out to be above level 5 even!! One such beggar became the talk of the zone with a fair number of defenders. This was quite bemusing to me. After voicing my opinion and listening to the others, I concluded that these defenders were probably played by youngsters. Hopefully, they will either learn better or wash out of the game. But, I really will not play in newbie areas much in the future, even when there are higher level npc's/mobs to kill, simply because the beggars make it too unpleasant to be there. I think this is to bad for the lower levels, since we upper levels are a valuable resource for the lowers if they but think to take advantage of our knowlege. <P>/rant off<P>Myli Delcorazon &lt;Elders Council&gt;<BR>Level 47.6 Wood Elf Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL You too, Kenreba?  I've decided the main use of the Beg skill is to teach newbies that begging is bad.  I will always remember the moment when my hero, Bandl McMarrin, said "I really hate beggars like you!" and slashed me to pieces so fast I had to wait until I respawned to read what he had said.  Not that I had ever asked anyone for anything (except food and drink when I made it to Snowflake and level 2 without dying, but couldn't find my way back and thought I would starve to death), but that pretty much clinched it for me -- if even the NPC's kill you for begging, it must not be an acceptable activity in the game.<P>Anyway, to answer Nikkon's question: once when I was really bored, I researched some of the differences between AC and EQ.  I discovered on their message boards a consensus that pure melees were "gimped" (sorta like how people used to feel about rangers in EQ).  The most popular "template" at the time was something called "og mage" which has nukes, teleports, and damage absorption spells, but runs very slowly (sound familiar?) -- except in AC, that combo means complete self-sufficiency and easy soloing from beginning to end (running speed is not terribly important in their combat system I guess).<P>Also, because of how the loot drops and death penalties work in AC, they tend to be a bit obsessed with starting stats (whereas in EQ it's almost irrelevant, with a few exceptions like an int caster putting points in wis, or vice-versa, or anyone but an enchanter or bard putting points in charisma).  So, in retrospect it doesn't surprise me at all that Erudite Wizard would be their starting character of choice.<P>Tudan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think I have a beggar magnet on all my characters because I'll be in the middle of somethiing and all of a sudden get a tell from someone I don't know asking if I can spare some money for their spells or armor or whatever.  I have become Very very annoyed with this bhavior and am sorry to say that now anyone that begs gets an attitude from me.  I realise that not all new people know better adn try to keep the attitude in check, but I discover time after time that I didn't quite manage it.  Oh well.  I fought hard for the stuff I had with Garathion, I would have fought hard with my other 2 characters but my friends took pitty upon my stupidity (accidentaly deleted him while trying to log in) and hvave twinked them both.  I never asked for a thing.  As a matter of fact I'm sure that some of you remember when I came here asking for money making tips to get my spells faster.  That was the first thing I thought of when I got tired of the same old kills for not  much money.  And with the suggestions that I got from you guys, and a  Dark Elf Necro looking for a favor I finally got those spells.  Anyway I don't mean to rant here it's just htat even the word beggar brings out of me.<P>Jamellk lvl 3 SHD DE Tholuxe Paells (Kinda wish he wasn't twinked so I could earn it, but I do like not haveing to worry about dying too much when fighting those MOBs for my lvl.)<P>Jallek lvl 1 Enc Eru (Same as above)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, first, on a serious note: <P>One thing that contributes to newbie begging is poverty in newbies.  I once met a high level guy (he was well equiped, and had a last name) who was camping the spawn for a newbie quest for the money.(although he'd probably get better money from simply killing stuff).  It's a good quest, and one i do a lot to earn money.  However, because some high level guy decided to take away my source of revenue, i was stuck poor.  I guess the moral of the story is, leave the newbie-money earning quests to the newbies.  The last thing we need is more poor newbies.  <P>On a lighter note, i was once selling some stuff in gfaydark when i was level 25.  Suddenly a guy gives me a tell.  My hopes skyrocket, as i hope it's a tell regarding my items for sale.  However, as i read the tell, i realize that it's only another begging newbie.  Suddenly, i realize that he's standing nearby.  So, i do a /whotarget and find out that he's only one level lower than me!! and it's not like he was naked either, he was wearing decent armor.  (i didn't inspect) It was too funny for me to get angry at him.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am also one of those beggar magnets.  It doesn't matter whether I'm playing my L51 char or a brand spanking new char.  I have had people ask me for stuff when I was L1 and they were L4!  (mind you my L1 was not even twinked to indicate I might have something to give)  I generally have no trouble dealing with people who beg stuff or cash.  If they ask nicely, I nicely tell them no.  If they ask rudely, I just ignore them completely.  If something about the exchange leaves me thinking they are genuinely clueless how to get started, I give them some tips and maybe some buffs.<P>This brings me to what bugs me even MORE than these types of beggars... SPELL BEGGARS.  SOW, Skin, Clarity, Ports, Heals... etc etc...  These people annoy the living "heck" out of me.  The one's that really get me are those that you "drive-by" buff with maybe a skin and a sow and two seconds later they have the nerve to send a tell asking for STR and regen.  I'm not talking about the people hunting near you in a zone asking for a sow here and there.  I'm also not talking about the people offering to pay for a buff of some kind (I generally refuse their payment and gladly buff them).  I'm talking about those people who seem to feel that just because you are a druid or an enchanter or a cleric, you are in the gmae for the sole purpose of buffing, porting or rezzing "the rest of the people".  Ugh. Thanks I needed to vent that.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I hate is when you are in the middle of a battle and someone asks me for sow.  I had a guy last night harrass the heck out of me and call me names because I wouldnt sow him.  I told him I was the only healer of our group and that didn't do any good.  I finally put him on ignore.  In frustration, I mentioned to my guild don't anyone give this guy a sow ever! and by the time the subject was done this guy won't get a rez, tp, sow, nothing from my guild.  He is "blacklisted"  I thought it was hilarious and great.  Someone even said I bet your group wouldnt mind if you took the time out to beat the crap out of him.  It was great!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok i'm glad i'm doing something right then  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>i just got the game a few days ago and started playing it two days ago. i havn't asked for any handouts or money and guess what?? I've had two people just stop by me and either cast spells on me or give me items out of the blue. When i replied that i have no money to give to t hem in return (i only had one gold in my bank  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) they told me it was a gift... so i'm thinking if you're good , work hard, and not annoying people will help you since you look like crap and a newbie anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Larviss you hit the nail on the head. I have never asked for a sow or any other buff,  I have never begged money,food, or equipement (begged food from my group though).<P>I have a level 10 Nec on Rodcent Nife- He is my main...I have been given the following items: 1 cloak of midnight mist, 2 dragoon dirks (gave one to a friend because they are lore), 1 dagger of dropping, 1 runed totem staff, +4 int necklass (dropped by a high level Mage that was camping some guy in Neriak 3rd Gate..I was only person there, so it was for me!), 2 potions of invisibilty to the undead, 10 +2 int rings (anyone want one? there sitting in the bank), and probably between 75 and 100 platt. <P>I also notice that in remote zones people drop their silver and copper! I find money all the time in LavaStorm.<P>I have been begged once, it was iteresting to say the least.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
