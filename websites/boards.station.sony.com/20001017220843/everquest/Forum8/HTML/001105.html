Sure I can wear it if I can get a nice smart HIGH Elf to make it for me.

</FONT><HR>     Wood elf with a gripe, here.<P>I am exited about the new crafted items, but i have a wee problem with the wood elves' ability to contribute.  Archery has been more of a pulling technique than a valid form of combat. I am a bit disappointed that the wood elves will only be able to craft bows and arrows. is there any chance that a real weapon will be craftable by wood elvish smiths/tailors?  or will we have to rely on the hand-me-downs of the races that are considered more "civilized"?  We are a proud people, and i feel a twinge of shame at the thought of never being able to join battle wielding a weapon crafted in my native forest by my fey brethren.<P>C'mon, kids; a spear? staves? perhaps even the odd sword (obsidian, as is fitting)?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Some corrections and clarifications to the above statements.  Common sense will tell everyone that Forges are for smithing.  All races are going to be able to smith something, though it might only be on the lines of Mithril arrow components, or Hafling farming utensils.  Each race also will have a trade skill which they will specialize in.  Erudites and halflings were indicated to be tailoring, wood elves fletching, and trolls baking (dont get upset yet, they mentioned making the Troll baking akin to Alchemy: Any one want a Naggie sandwich?).  On a second note, the wood elves were also hinted at Mithril Reinforced Leather.  This could be a HUGE boon, or a HUGE disapointment.  We will have to wait and see though.<BR>I'll toss the disclaimer in right away as well:  These have been ideas Yak disclosed, none are live as of yet, and are all subject to change.  Unfortunately my ISP is being slow and though I would like to have included quotes and links for everyone to see for themselves, I wont be able to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Anybody can make the new FS armor and items, thats something added for ya. As to cultural armor. Forges/modernization are not exactly a WoodElves domain. In fact if any race should be anti forge from a role play persective, it is wood elves. The ones at home with nature. <P>Also, there are other trade skills and changes comming where you will get special little things in that others will not. Thats the way it works.<P>Everybody got something added, something that you never ever had before, or expected to have. Everybody got a wonderful new gift. They even made a great exception that people who couldn't make cultural armors can still use it. Thats just fantastic in every way.<P>Even if you could make cultural armor as a woodelf, what would it really matter, this stuff is astoundingly difficult to make and has worse stats than class based quest armor. Its more a pass time and hobby than anything else.<P>Please, stop with the complaints. This is only one trade skill and more are on the way. This is what it sounds like to me, 'Billy got cake and pie, while I only got cake. I don't care if my pie is comming, I want Billy's pie now. No, I don't want Billy to get any of my pie when it gets here.'<P>Common people, the new tradeskills are nothing but additions and nothing but great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It is not a matter of who got more goodies than who; I would just like to see a weapon that is decidedly wood elvish.  <P>Anyway, got an idea for a tailored item with a solid literary precedent:   <BR> How about a reinforced, or even a patchwork cloak, that had an activatable camouflage?  <BR>Not terribly useful to wood elves (as we all have some ability to become invisible), but very much in keeping with the concept of wood elf society.<BR>Not a shabby export, either.<P>Another thought, weapons made from obsidian by master potters.  perhaps not as potent as a forged mithril weapon, but imbued nonetheless.<P>still grasping at straws for a wood elf quest item----<BR>&gt;; )<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Only one, and there will be some sorta faction control on it...<P>Edu's where gonna get silk, Halflings 'Travel gear' (Think about it.  That could _rock_), and Woodies where cited as Tailors, IIRC.  Fletchers, as well.  And, Mithral studded could be nice...<P>Think about it.  Tailoring will be getting some kick-*ss of an upgrade, given all of it's potential.  What other skills is there such a massive supply of mobs which could drop raw materials for it?  Planar mobs could drop materials for near-planar equipment, after all!  And, the components they drop can be NO DROP, requiring a Tailor to 'skin' the animal in order for her to make it (skin == loot, for those of you who are a bit slow).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Tailoring is crap and always will be crap, unless your a caster or druid. Archery is useless,  and Gordon and Brad have said millions of times that it always will be, so why the hell do I want to make mithril arrowheads or other nonsense. Armor always has been and always will be what is important.  <P>And can ANYONE comes up with a realy reason other then Yak 'I said so' for why High Elf's get Mithril armor and Wood Elfs get junk? Why in the world would High Elfs be more 'smithlike' then Wood Elfs? Is it because they have more armor-wearing fighters? Oh, they don't. Paladins and Clerics, Warriors and Bards, equal number of plate wearers (though Bards use their armor more then Clerics), and then there are the chain Rogues and Rangers. So theres 4 melee Wood Elfs to 2 melee High Elfs. So, does it make any sense at all that High Elfs would be the ones making armor? Not a bit, the Wood Elfs are the ones doing most of the fighting, they would be making the armor if anything. The High Elfs will be tailoring some new robes for their enchanters.<P>Yes, the armor is astonishingly difficult. And if it was possible I would be working my butt off to some day make it. But I can't. Who can? Oh, the High Elf enchanter with as much use for it as I have for a robe!<P>This is not 'he got cake and pie, and I just got cake'. This is he got a little cookie (the little FS which is basicly completely dwarfed by the already dirt cheap Quest armor) and big huge pie (cultural armor) and I got a cookie, and was told that if I wait another month I might get a big fat dumptruck full of dung! (being, of course, some 14 AC leather tunic that, or another version of the 10 slot backpack, or maybe some arrowhead that is less effective and more costly then just throwing the money at the mobs).<P>http://www.gucomics.com/default.asp?date=9/29/2000</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The imbued emerald gives whatever it is used in cha plus 4, wis plus 2, agil plus 4. <P>basically you substitute a morning dew (foraged there, A LOT at high skill) for the water, a mithril sheet for the metal,  and throw in an imbued emerald with the spear, dagger, morningstar and a couple other recipes. All don't work though.<P>Oh and also in the cultural forge Mithril boning:<BR>Small brick of mithril (bought in felwithe)<BR>file<BR>morning dew<P>Tried this in a sewing kit with a high quality cat pelt, and a wristband pattern as per a reinforced bracer. Did not combine, lost the stuff. <P>SO it appears that we get some weapons, the morningstar which is about like a wraithbone hammer, a dagger that is charisma 2 wis 2 agil 4 (imbued emerald again )  and can go in range slot.. some enchanters actually did pick tunare so they are happy about this (one on my server level 55. )<P>I tried screwing around with some of the mithril and morning dew to try and make arrows or shafts. Nice thing about cultural forge is when things dont combine they don't poof. It says they dont combine in this forge, try another, then you refresh the forge and all your stuff is there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Whats your point? So the High Elf Casters can make themselves some nice chain whatever. Will they even use it? Will they give up some +4 int Sleeves for +0 int chain sleeves? Few will, most won't.<P>And who said anything about some books that completely unrealated authors wrote. Half of those books didn't have different High Elfs or Wood Elfs, they have one or the other and just call them Elves usually. But none of that matters one it. EQ is not made by Tolkien, or Brooks or anyone else, and their books don't matter. All that matters is that the majority of the people that would use the cultural armors are not that people that can make them. That is backwards.<P>The weapons don't impress me either. SSoYs are dirt cheap now, and unless the new weapons are at leats better then SSoYs they have no use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok to get things straight here, besides the fact that I can't spell, but WHO GIVES  A FLYING !#@$! ABOUT FLETCHING!!!! What are wood elfs normally played as!! I'd say rangers rouges and druids. Rangers have class specific armor quests and lots of armor and nifty stuff, although I do think they need the most work out of any class. Rouges get some cool stuff like poison and back stab hide sneak etc etc. Rouges also get class specific quests as well. Now what do druids have? a great line of spells and a great ability to solo. Is this what verant whats? a great ability to solo with a good line of group spells in the end. Now WTF are all the druid quests? <BR>Oh there are some in Rathe mountains.. please cut the !@#!@ with that one, who is there right mind would trade a +5 int shoe for a pos 6/22 scimitar? what high lvl druid that would be able to get the item would actually use a 6/22 scimitar ? I could be wrong on the actual quest items but I know they could include the Giant shoelaces(+5 int shoes) lion skin back pack(%75 weight reduction), both of these items are nice rare drops, both of these items are worth ALOT more than a silvrey war axe(6/22) Where are all the druids class quests? the druid are? druid only armor? oh I'm sorry they are in the plane of sky DUH! stupid me. druid only armor? hmmm zarhan cornet (5 AC +20 mana(I think) +3 str Dru clr shm) braded ivy chords(4AC +5 wis) Brownchitin protector(12 AC +9sta/dex/agi ie the mother load and only druid only non plane peices of armor that I have seen short of 50+ kunark and plane sky's and even this itme is droped off a 45 mob in Sol B) Where are they !!! I want to know? there are some in Karran(sp?) Island a 3/17 staff<BR>(cool graphic it's prolly the FA equivelant) still druids don't melee past 35 this is when I stoped. Monks get cured silk, ALL Casters get to go to sulusk ro and do their quests. Bards get lambet, clerics get their armor(forget name) all from Solusk ro, paladins and SK's too, Warriors get crafted from SK, Shaman get something forgot the name but it's based out of lake rathe and starts with an I, Rangers go to Kithicor forest, Rouges get Raven scale not sure where it's quest based or if it's a quest. Did I miss any classess? oh oops druid, oh wait thats what I am here complaning about. sure druids can TP from one place to another but non of it is for them selfs, and what cool druid quests I have found are broken and are for newbie's.  <P>Here and now I chalange Verant to fix quests for druids. I am a lvl 41 druid and I LOVE to do quest spend time getting cool gear, and some times I am ready to stop playing a druid just so I can do quests and have cool gear, thus the reason for my twinked warrior. I take back one quest for druids, the Paw of opolla, I bleive it's 8 AC +9int/agi -5 cha -5 sv poison something around there. I camped ONE component for this quest for 20+ hours for ONE component and it never droped, 10 of those hours where straight I got to kill every spawn. I started this quest almost a 3/4 of a year ago and I still have yet to get the gold ring. Man I hate mitty. I still say cuse words about her. I'll give you a list of quests I know of that yield druid items that are at least mid lvl quests. <P>Solvedi scimitar (6/22)<BR>Staff of observers(12/35 +5int/wis decent but not worth it by the time you can solo borxx)<BR>Wee harvester (10/45 +1str/sta/wis effect summon food)<BR>broken quest from surefall galde about the ambasidor<BR>paw of opolla(pain in you know what given the time to camp) <BR>I could have swear the there was a sap sheen staff that was 2hd blunt and you hadd to trade in a 9AC +9sta/str bleh oh please <P>so this is long enough!! bottom line NO FRIGGIN FLETCHING SKILLS FOR FOOD ELFS!!!! MAKE IT A RANGER SPECIFIC TRADE SKILL!!!!! give wood elfs something that we can enjoy, I have been playing EQ for almost a year and 4 months started my druid may 4th and I'm lvl 41 and have a game play time of 65+ days. all that time is spent questing or there for attempting to. Please verant make the druid more part of the game that you say you want it to be. More druid quests, more druid only items and some thing a druid can use via quest/trade skill/camp that is half decent and doesn't require 50+ hours to get. I'm not asking for better spells or better items or more mana or more AC etc. etc. I'm just asking for more fun for druids. We are(and I say this with 100% accuracy as I have shown) that druids have no quest or class specific armor. an equivelant to what is out there already and that is worth the quest to do it. Not 3 dragon scales and a diamond for a +2 wis +9 sta -4agi main weapon only item. thats all I ask for. and no it's not there I've looked</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Mairana,<BR>I think you should have posted this as a new topic.  But, although its a little off the subject line, I will still share some info with you.  I enjoy questing alot (everQUEST).  I feel your pain with the lack of druid quests (wizards are in the same boat as you are, so dont feel to lonely.  Perhaps our traveling ability is considered too powerful to be allowed any descent quests?).<BR>Back to the subject at hand.  Right now most of the Wood Elf Items are not in the game.  Smithed components you might be interested in are the Mithril Bonings which are being made.  Also the weapons do not seem to be terrible (better than a cracked staff atleast).  People are focusing on the fletching aspect, but Yak did mention more.  Check this post out:<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001042.html<BR>As far as the quests go, druid quests just seem to suck, but I do have a possible solution to your Paw of Opalla quest:<BR>Fungus Mutant in Guk!  Easiest way to get the Gold Ring.  I can almost guarantee that in 4 hours or so you will get one of the weeds needed for the Gold ring, maybe more.<BR>Good Luck</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>already have camped him 4 hours for the gold ring, no go. <P>hehe I was thinking that maybe this should have been a new thread but I just started out as a gripe about fletching beign a wood elf trade. How are the wizards quest armor? I assum you guys get it. Druids don't, druids don't get any kind of none plane/plane lvl gear that is class specific. all casters have damask and raw silk, I think damask is caster only. It's part no-druid quests, and part no druid class armor. You know no place to make a our mark in Everquest, and say, hey thats a druids. <P>Thanks I'm gonna go check out that post now.<BR>bye<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For lack of any other place to reply:<BR>Acumen Mask:  Good item, but shadow patch is pretty rare off the shadow men and the Glowing mask is used for the enchanter quest too, so you have to fight with them for it.<BR>Runescale Cloak:  Again good item.  The first 2 of the runes are easy to get.  The rune of fire drops off a very rare Croc in lava storm.  The past 2 times ive seen him he was sitting in a puddle of lava...but I had an eager ogre meat shield who didnt mind going in to pull him out.<BR>Staff of Temperorate Flux:  What a joke.  Fire and Cold +5?  Hrmmm, I'll keep my staff of the wheel.<BR>Tishan's Kilt:  This is such a joke I have never even botheres.  Str and Sta +4, HP +20?  Not for any caster I can think of.  BTW - you can wear this one too.<BR>Weeping Wand:  AC and 3 Int.  Not bad but the time I could do this quest I had my Staff of the Wheel.<BR>Kinda funny if you ask me.  They give us [wizards] 3 quest weapons, and only 2 pieces of armor that are worth a damn.<BR>I degress.  Hopefully they will add some content, most likely not.  Oh well.  If you like quests play a paladin or Necro.  VI seems to think that they really need good items to make them popular.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001105&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001105&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
