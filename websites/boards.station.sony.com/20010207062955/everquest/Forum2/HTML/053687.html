</FONT><HR>Just because im really upset now Im suggesting this. Remove all the classes from the game except Rogues, Warriors, and Clerics. Thats what is happening now anyways. Try as I may to be different and play a Hybrid, everytime i level the class, be it SK/Pal/Ranger to 30, i end up restarting. I always hope the next class will be better and of more use to groups and guilds at higher levels. As it stands now, all my friends have given up their original classes that they started because the like the class idea, to start up One of the Holly trinity of classes. Is that what verant Wants??? If so, dont mock us any longer, and Please remove all classes but those 3 from the character selection screan. So next time I restart, i wont make the mistake of playing a class i want to play, and finding out that at higher levels I become useless and not needed. But now i have learned my lesson. I hope you have room for another twink warrior on your server, because that is what youre going to get (that is what you want isnt it?) BAH!!!!!!<P>SELLING ALL ON ME&gt; SK GEAR!!! Infront of Jade Tiger! Anyone got any crafted and cobalt for sale? Oh yea! and a wurmslayer and Yak would be nice too.

</FONT><HR>Whaaa Whaaa Whaaa.<P>Stop crying.  Not all classes are created equal.  Each class has its strengths and weaknesses.  Have you not figured that out yet?  It is a challene to play some of the other classes, that is the point!<P>Besides, the statement that you made it not true at all.  Name me the big raid party who does not want a wizard or magician in the group to deal the big damage.  What group at some point does not need a ranger for tracking or a druid for transporting.  See other classes do have purposes, you just have to be creative (aka smart) enough to figure them out and take advantage of them.<P>God people stop crying!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And why do people always equate a legitimate concerns with whining??? Im not whining. Im trying to make a point here. Plus, like i said. I want to eventually play a character to 60. I enjoy all classes up to a certain point (the point being when they start becoming useless). On epic raids. Yea! we all need that traker to find trakanon. He's really HARD TO SPOT. He might be hiding behind that small rock. And BTW a rogue does way more damage than a Wizard and Mage combined. So dont come with that. And, again, im not talking about raiding the orc camps in EC. Just most raids over level 50 (40 even). Even at low level those classes are not NEEDED. But at high levels, they are not WANTED.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Enchanters are in fourth place, due to buffs (less useful in Velious).<P>Yes, rogues are a support class.  Yes, all classes have their strengths and weaknesses.  But a group with just those three classes can be regarded as complete, sufficient, and more efficient than a group including other classes.  <P>The scaling of Velious mobs is such that inclusion of other classes is almost a waste.  Wizards?  Blow all mana on one or two fights, then have to med for the next five.  Mages?  Pets are nice but often unused in the Planes, otherwise see wizards. Monks?  Outdamaged by rogues.  Hybrids?  Outdamage by warriors.  Shaman?  People are suspicious of dots on big mobs, and enchanters can slow almost as well.  Necros and druids...not that group friendly.  <P>A group looking for max efficiency will have those three (or four) classes.  Period.

I sit on my rump alot in between kills when i do solo friend.<BR>   But anyway, i agree with the original poster, the high level game is becoming all 3 or 4 classes. Hmm, ask lord_bhaal what class he is...hmm bingo!!..one of those three. See my point? The only ones who will disagree with you are those three or 4 classes(mainly clerics).

Magician is now even needed for call of the hero.. velious is actually set up PURPOSEFULLY evidently so that class is semi needed.<P>Really only 2 classes could be totally eliminated, ranger and paladin. Many of the rest have enough overlap that you want as many around as possible. Groups will always need evacs and summon corpse.<P>So yeah, if rangers and paladins were all playing warriors instead people could get a lot more done. <P>However, I kind of enjoy the game more BECAUSE you are often grouping with rangers or paladins rather than a warrior super tank. Some critters like ixblit where you NEED a couple 55 plus warriors or ideally more are a lot more fun since you DON'T ever have enough warriors that high. I mean if everytime people I knew or my guild went to kill ixblat or something and we had like 10 heavy hitter super tank warriors instead of having just one or two and lots of rangers, pallys and sks, it would make that big ixblat elemental thing trivial. What fun would that be?<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Woot, jobs for 4 enchanters (epic's only please), 6 wizards (only for ports in/out), maybe 6 druids (only for ports in/out, ok a little light healing for cleric back up) and a couple shamans (if you can find them). A couple of mages would be nice (only for CoH). All to support the 50 other; cleric, warriors and rouges. Sub out some pallys, monks and SK's for either the rouges or warriors, so a few friends can come along. Thats it.<P>I'm sorry but this will not be changing any time soon.

</FONT><HR>First off, I think that this "Holy Trinity" idea is just because you havn't found out how to properly play any class other than those three.  Probably because those are the simplest to play.  For example, a druid is a valuable asset in any group because he can fill the shoes (not entirely, but enough to make the group work) of most clases that are missing, save Bard, Tank, and Shaman.  <P>Secondly, the reason no one is begging your particular class to go on a planes raid with them is probably because they already have enough of your said class in the groups already.  I have never heard of anyone going on a planes raid with just Rogues, Warriors, and Clerics, and some wizards to transport them.<P>Apperently the player base is so starved for attention that they complain when the don't have people begging them on tells to be in a certain group or to cast a certain spell.<P>Mian Elerion<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are difference between wants and need. You dont need sow. you dont need clarity. Yes, if you have hybrids or druid in your group indstead of cleric or warrior, you will need evac. But wouldnt you rather kill the mob instead of running away from it?<P>And if you would get thrashed with a 2war 2rogue 2cleric group. Quit the game, or go do some chat spam in east commons. Of course we are talking more or less ideal situations. If you have a cleric with 85 wisdom that does nothing but nuke, I would rather take the druid with 200 wis that knows how to play the game. But that is just human error.<P>The fact remains, that if a computer were to play the game perfectly with no strategic errors. It would be able to take out epic mobs with a combination of war, cler, rogue more efficiently than with anyother class combination (or so is my belief).<P>Of course if you are level 30 you would be more than happy playing any class you are playing. But it still remains that as days go by more over 50 players are quitting their Hybrid to go play a warrior rogue cleric because their guild wont let them on their trak or VS raid. More so in velious.<P>If things stay as they are, in a few months, all post level 50 player base will consist of these three classes (and some enchanters hehe, and a few wizards/druids for ports. mainly secondary characters from players in the guild)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Balanced is not equal.  Repeat it with me.  Balanced is *NOT* equal.<P>There will *ALWAYS* be more efficient classes.  Period.  You can not avoid this with a class based system.  Even in your "Holy Trinity", those three classes are not equal.  You would do much better with 1 warrior 1 cleric and 4 rogues than with 1 warrior 1 rogue and 4 clerics.<P>Classes are balanced.  They are not equal.<P>Example 1:<P>Cleric is OOM.  Enchanter is nearly dead.  A small horde of critters left.  With a Warrior/Rogue, everyone dies.  With a Paladin/Ranger, everyone lives.<P>Example 2:<P>Cleric is near full mana.  Enchanter frenzies a couple high level mobs on it.  With a Warrior/Rogue, Enchanter dies.  Depending on how many mobs are around, everyone dies.  With a Paladin/Shadow Knight, Enchanter lives, everyone lives.<P><BR>Neither one of these situations are uncommon.  I've been on both sides of both situations.  I absolutely hate entering groups without at least one hybrid/druid/shaman...as one of the above comes up way to regularly to completely toss them out.  Similar examples can be made for *any* class.<P>Too many people on this board are way too concerned with efficiency.  What are the two most common complaints in the Cleric/Warrior world?  They are *BORING*.  Yet you want to reduce everyone to them because you just don't understand the difference between Inefficient and Unuseful.

</FONT><HR>Exanple 1:<P>Cleric is OOM. Enchanter is nearly dead. A small horde of critters left. With a Warrior/Rogue, everyone dies. With a Paladin/Ranger, everyone lives.<P>Bad example. You are assuming the mob is down to the same Health with the Pal/ranger hitting on is as with the war/rogue. no way. At level 50, the ranger or paladin  would be dead about 20times as fast as the warrior (higher defence/ac/hp). Paladin's heals would do nothing (maybe LoH once then die). Cleric would be OOM way faster in your exaple trying to keep two classes with poor defence alive. Now, if your exaple was based on a level 10 group in EC doing orcs, well, i cant argue with that. The warrior wouldnt even have dual wield yet.<P>Example 2:<P>Cleric is near full mana. Enchanter frenzies a couple high level mobs on it. With a Warrior/Rogue, Enchanter dies. Depending on how many mobs are around, everyone dies. With a Paladin/Shadow Knight, Enchanter lives, everyone lives.<P>Youre exaples are very bad. You are basing succes by "if they live when something goes bad". I could very well argue a single druid would be better in all those situations because he just hits SOC and then Gates. And guess what? He live. who cares. or a monk that FD... etc. He still wont be able to hand the amount of kills or the higher level of mobs that the rog/war/clr group could.<P>----<BR>But this is now totaly off my original topic of too many high level players quitting their Hybrids to start the rog/war/clr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053687-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053687-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053687&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053687&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
