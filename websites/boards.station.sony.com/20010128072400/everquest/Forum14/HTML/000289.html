</FONT><HR>Ok where to start.......<P>After reading all of the posts on Shamans, I am seriously thinking of deleting my character.  When i first bought the game it took me a long time to figure out what i wanted to do. This being a social game and all, I wanted to be somone who everyone wanted to group with.  I figured a Shaman would be a good choice, considering what Verant told me about the class; <P>EQ manual:   "Her primary focus is HEALING, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well."<P>This sounded like the class for me.  One that could heal other people, but also some other stuff.  But Healing would be main thing.  Very interesting considering from 30-52 we do not get one direct heal spell, yet we get countless buffs.  Verant has even admitted that stat buffs are not very important.  "King of buffs" should go to the clerics.  They get the buffs that do matter, such as HP and AC.  <BR>    And as long as we are on the subject of shamans, why is it that the spells that defined the shaman start going to other classes??!!  Magicians mala line is practically the same as our Malo, Enchanters can slow things just like a shaman,  hell, what does a shaman do on high lvl raids??  All of the classes that have our abilities can do so much more.<P>  this feels really good to vent my anger...<P>  The proc on our FA is canceled by many necro dots.<P>  Our pet is a joke...A Shadow Knights pet can't kill it.<P>Real sorry this is running long, but Verant needs to give the Shaman class something that defines it.  I don't think I am alone on this, so please, my fellow shamans, voice your opinion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't understand why Verant is taking so long to make a decision here.  It seems so obvious.  At lower levels, shamen are similar to druids in their ability to kite.  Once you hit mid levels, druids start to excel in this area while shamen slowly fall out of the picture.  Since both the druid and shamen are backup healers, why not make one of the two a stronger backup healer.  I don't think anyone would complain if shamen could heal better than druids, but druids would continue to kite better than shamen.  Lets drop the level that shamen get Superior Healing to 44, and add Complete Heal in the mid to late 50s.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree that the manual's focus on shaman as healer is off target.  However the manual is off on a LOT of things.  If you want to be prime healer, and are not happy being anything else, then shaman is not the class for you.  But I love being a shaman.  At lvl 44, within the past three weeks I have been focused exclusively on each of the following roles in different groups:  healer, buffer, dotter, blaster, puller, tank (yes tank) and debuffer.  I did them all very well, thank you, and against mobs that were blue or harder, wasn't helping out youngins on green stuff.  (In fact when I was tanking it was myself and a lvl 41 enchanter and 45 druid, on kobolds in Solusek B.)  I revel in having that kind of versatility.  Clerics can heal, but they cannot heal and tank at the same time, not in their 40s.  <P>If anyone has a link to where Verant is quoted as saying buffs are useless I would really like to read it.  I know that they have stated that they try not to let twinking have too much of an effect, which implies that the benefits gained by stats on armor (or spells) will not make the difference between life and death.  However, there is quite a difference between 3 agi and 7 dex on a bracer, and an extra 30 or 40 of each from higher end shaman buffs.  Having tested myself by trying tanking and pulling, I know that one of the main reasons I can do it is not that I can take a tremendous beating, because I can't, but because between stamina and agility (and Togor's helps too), I can reduce the number of hits I take and how badly they hurt.  <P>I would really say that the defining characteristic of a shaman is that we can fill any roll in a pinch.  We don't have to worry about being refused a group because they already have a shaman.  Yea, our pets are pretty weak, but we ourselves are stronger.  No, we don't heal as well as a cleric once we hit our 40s, but our ability to reduce the need to heal in the first place can take up much of the slack.  We at least have cannibalize and regen to boost our mana when we're without an enchanter...clerics have no such luck.  <P>I would love to see us get better heals, because I do see it as a weakness later on.  But I also see a lot of strengths that help make up for that weakness, and can't imagine abandoning the shaman class just because of that one drawback.  I don't see myself as a second rate cleric, I see myself as a Shaman.<P>-Heyokah Verdandi Snowblood of Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Are you kidding me? Shaman rock! I play a 32nd level druid and the only class I would consider changing to would be shaman. My two best friends both play 45-50th level shaman and they kick ass. They have all the utility and healing spells I do, about the only things they don't do better than a druid are snare and of course Teleport. They both still solo whenever they want too. <P>If you want to complain about a class, why don't you play a high level rogue. I know two 40+ rogues and they both say it sucks - warriors do more damage than they do, and obviously do more damage as well... and rogues simply cannot solo if their life depended on it. (OK well maybe maybe the weakest of greens?)<P>Shaman rock. As for healing, there is only one class who can heal better and that's Clerics. Would you really want to trade your shaman for a cleric? I wouldn't!! <P>Just a counter opinion, FWIW. <P>Wyldra Zonerider <BR>32nd halfling druidess of Vallon Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi ,<BR>  Well as for pre level 51 shaman yeah life is good, versatility is awesome. But if your friend is 50 he is at a high point. Post 50 is where the real problems begin. <P>   I still play my shaman. If you think its fun, make the best of it. But if you want a guaranteed spot in a group in the higher end game be a cleric.<P>   If you keep your shaman you will have lots of fun, you will still have friends, you will do ok. :-) Everyone is trying to get the point to Verant so don't be too discouraged. <P>Take care,<BR> Barbarian Shaman<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Howdy there, i play a 51 Iksar Shaman on Tunare.  personally i think the Shaman is Perfect other than one problem, Shamans should have Group Buffs which we do not.  only thing wrong with a shaman.  our slows are MUCH better than a Chanters (which i think is stupid that Chanters slows will Overide ours even though our is better)! Here is the Bonus of being a Shaman, and this is stuff you can take credit for in the group!!!<P>This is all at a 51 point of veiw.  <P>1. Our slows drop there speed by 75%, easily dropping there dmg by 80% (less swings also drops the amount of times they have a chance of double, triple and quad attacking is where the extra 5% came from)!<P>2. Our Cripple line of spells Drop there:<BR>AC = Makes Tanks do more dmg per swing<BR>Str = Makes tanks make more AC saves adding to the reduced amount of dmg mobs do<BR>agi = makes Mobs Dodge less in turn making tanks do more dmg<P>3. Our str spells Make Tanks do overall dmg<BR>4. Our Dex spells make the Tanks not miss as much<BR>5. if no chanter in the group our Alacricity Spell makes Tanks swing more in turn added to the Str and Dex buff Do twice as much dmg as they normally would.<BR>6. our HP buff makes tanks last longer. (If grouped with a cleric makes tanks last longer before they have to use CH which saves them Mana in the long run).<BR>7 our Sta buff gives more HP's, makes them not loose sta as fast and also raises the chances of anyone not being stunned, in turn adding to the amount of Dmg everyone does in the group wher ethey would have normally been stunned.<BR>8. our ac buff, adds ac, saves on overall dmg done to tanks.<BR>9. agi buff makes tanks make more dodges and misses saving in the overall dmg done to tanks and also adds to ac. plus stacks with the cleric ac buff nicely.<BR>10. Chloro saves on the clerics heals, our heals, i have seen many times where i slowed mobs, and had tanks buffed and Chloro'd and never had to heal.  <BR>11. our resistance buffs saves on dmg of course from casting mobs.  <P>Now a word on our pet, my pet beat a Necro pet, i buffed him first and slow necro pet, my little wolfy pet wooped the Necro's pets ass!!!  and the Rules was we are allowed to cast any debuffs on the others pet.  to see the overal ability of our pets with class.  Shaman's totally Kicked the Necro's pets but thanks to our buffs.  and when this took place the Necro had his highest end pet, i had my worst pet.  <P>Flaws of a Shaman in my Opinion.  Lack of Group Buffs.  I see our job not as main healer, that is not what we are for at all, are job in a group is to Buff the group and to Debuff the Mobs.  we turn three tanks into the dmg of 6, and we take any mobs that are not totally MR and drop the overall dmg they do by atleast 90% through our buffs to our Team and from our slows to them.  <P>Try this group sometime, "Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter, Warrior, Monk or Rogue, and Ranger for snares". Keep the tanks buffed, and the Mobs Slowed.  Garrantee you will have Non Stop pulls and Non Stop Exp.  And you can take credit for 90% of the Heals by Prevention.  and you can also take Credit for Doing the Dmg of of three tanks, cause your Buffs double the dmg of each one of those tanks.  Try it and come back and tell me if i am wrong.  <P>one more thing, we can do something a druid cannot, my ac is 904, my wis is 213.  i Slow, DoT mobs then meelee and let pet Attack from back.  never loose over 2 bubbles life, and can solo 3 mobs in a row.  How many Druids or Clerics you know can do that.  We as Shaman Roxurs, we just need some more group buffs he he.  make our group life a little easier to do since thats our main job in EQ life, buff group members and Slow Mobs, Frail when you have the mana.<P>Fomori 51 Shaman and of the Heyokah<BR>*Jaded Flame of Athanasia*<BR>Tunare<P>P.S.  Only problem with grouping is people are starting to figure out our real job and how much we actually do and are starting to be to many shamans he he.  My guild always says i Rock over and Over.  is a Great Feeling.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000289&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000289&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
