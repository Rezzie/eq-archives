</FONT><HR>There's no real way that I can think of to disable twinking in the game other than to make all quest items no-drop or to try to enforce an anti-twink policy, and I'd prefer the guides and GMs spent their time helping players who needed it rather than enforcing something that doesn't adversely effect game play for most of us.<P>I dislike twinking -- I've had higher level characters pass down minor items to me (rings, etc.) for helping them with some minor task or combat, which works for me because it makes sense within the game, but I've turned down outright twinks from other well-meaning players. People handing down rubicite or lambent to low level characters is just pathetic -- I've been known to power level one or two bumps to the next spell group, but the idea of power leveling to 50 in as fast a time as possible is like reading the last chapter of a novel, first -- you're missing the point. The "wealthy parents" analogy sort of works for me, but ... personally, I think it would be embarrassing to run around with equipment that I hadn't earned in some regard.<P>But what to do with the equipment and cash of a high level character you no longer intend to play? If I had a high level character that I didn't want to play anymore, instead of twinking a low level friend or alt, I think I'd have a death-bed event for my guild or friends where I read my will and passed out my equipment and cash, maybe giving a few items to a trusted executor to pass down to a "younger relative" as an inheritance. Makes more sense in the game world, and works for alts that aren't the same class. You could also bequeath armor and items to guild members or friends, or donate them to the guild for quest events.<P>Personally, the most enjoyment I think would be possible to get out of EQ would be from player-, guild-, or GM-led events (sadly, too few of these last on Povar). The machinations of the game make the built-in quests a little weaker than they could be (anyone who's seen a dozen or more people crowding around the same area in a dungeon knows what I mean), so in this respect EQ is the perfect backdrop for PC-led events. The idea of passing on loot from a stale character this way could make for a really unique event ... almost makes me wish I had a high level character I didn't want to play anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, I think that the KS'ing thing is because of one comment I made that got twisted and taken out of context.  But you're right, there is nothing inherently tied to KS'ing and twinking.  The point I originallly made was that if you have a new player who starts a level one character and he has to fight in the same areas as a bunch of twinked characters, then he is at a huge disadvantage.  If they WANT to KS from the level one then they will easily be able to because they have far superior armor and weapons.  If they want to harass and duel him to death they will be able to.  The level one character that is playing the game as it was designed can not compete in a hostile environment with twinked characters.  Hence, the point that twinked characters unbalance the gameplay.  It's a power thing, and if you are denying that this stuff goes on EQ then you're just plain ignorant.   I was not commenting at all about the propensity to ks, or saying that twinkers were ks'ers.  A couple of people who didn't bother to read my post said that.   If the EQ world was a warm and fuzzy place where no one ks'ed, harrassed, farmed, or powerleveled their way over people then this wouldn't be an issue would it??

</FONT><HR>I run a 22 druid, a 20 warrior, a 15 necro and a "(new) 5 wizard.  The warrior was my first, and he was not twinked.  I'll admit that 20 isn't high at all, but I have managed to collect some pretty good mid level items like assorted crafted, a Runic carver (got a sweet deal from a level 52 who was emptying her bank account) as well as other stuff.  At this point, I realized that I don't like playing warriors too much (sorry guys, just being honest) so I started a necro.  My necro I twinked mildly, mostly with bone chips and a few survival items.  I explored kiting for awhile and decided that necro kiting was fun, but I wanted some real kiting action.  So I made my druid.  Now, this time, instead of twinking her with items, I decided to do a different "twink"  Basically, I skipped the first 13 levels, not fighting monsters with her until she was level 14.  At this time, fresh with sow, bind and stinging swarm, I started playing her in earnest.  Now, at 22, I'm having the time of my life.  Now I'm not going to say that twinking is neccesary, but you know what, everything that I twinked my characters with I earned or bought with MY OWN in game money, that I earned with MY OWN 2 hands using MY OWN time sitting in my little cave on my computer.  I have to date given Sony around 180 dollars in real world money so I can keep playing this game.  I feel I have the right to make the early levels (read: hell levels, nothing like getting beat on by a rat) go by easier or just skip them completely.  Now just about every newbie out there is going to complain that twinking is unfair...  Let them play for over a year, and have somebody tell them that it's unfair to use the money and items that they've saved up for that year to build a new character.  Bet they won't be too happy...  <P>** on a final note, Verant has taken several steps to prevent uber-twinks from dominating the low level arena... it's called damage caps and skill caps...  Yah, you may see a level 4 bard running around in full lambent and swinging a Yek, but you know what... He's still going to get stomped by an orc centurion or a gang of large rats = P<P>my 2 cp, if you don't like it, sorry, go play the game instead of complaining then</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;"... I earned the right to twink because..."<P>No one has ever earned the right to twink. You are putting this game out of perspective. YOU have not earned anything. Your high level char has earned something. Your newbie "twink" has earned squat. I'm affraid that unless you RP you probably won't understand where I'm coming from. So more power to the k00l d00ds! LOL.&gt;&gt;<P>That is a fairly silly statement, "earned the right to twink". I'm level 30, i have some nice stuff from a friend who has more money then he reall knows what to do with, so he bought my mage a few +int items, am I a twink? Probably, do I care? No. Did i get some stuff myself? sure, i just spent 4 hours Hunting the Anchent Croc for the clerics Gator Legs, did we get them no, it spawned 2 time in that time and we got gator sleaves both times. Are we farming? No we are hunting the croc with 5 30th level people for an item, it's boring as all hell too. What's my point? It's easy, If i decided to make a wizard, i'll give Him or Her whatever I want to , because I (I, ME, The Player) Don't want to hunt the Croc for sleaves, I'd rather explore... Does it hurt my Role Playing, Uhhh hmm it can, depends if i'm roleplaying or running around killing things because that's what i want to do. Some day's i'll roleplay some i won't. Is it a rule for me to role play? nope, in fact they even have a tag for me to let people know when i'm rolplaying. Am I role playing properly? Yes, because i say i am, now weather Yogi thinks i am or not, probably not, I dont' get to involved with my char with emotes or bowing or speaking to diffrent then i do in RL, some times i even hold conversations with friends about the real world in the game, in regular say because we are not grouped or in the smae guild... shoot me... My 16th level warrior in leather armor doesn't get played, he might if i come across some equipment for him with my mage though... heres the greatest part... it's my equipment until i drop/sell/give/or destroy it... i could sell it, but i don't need the plat, i don't do to much selling anyways, because i'm usualy busy killing or going from here to there... so i'll give it to my friends druid, and pick it up with another charicter later... because it is mine, as are my 3 characters.<P>Weas<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It doesn't matter how much money you've paid to play the game.  It's all still owned by Verant, and paying for the game doesn't give you the "right" to do squat. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sigh.. no one will ever win this. Each side does have valid points.<P><BR>Why did I start playing EQ? To discovered new and different places... to find cool items that I've never seen before.<P>With twinks, I've seen a ton of items before I could ever get them.. no more excitement for finding them.. there're nothing special. It's still nice to get better items, but finding something I've never seen it was I liked.<P>On another note, it's not just twinking that is the problem.. the real problem is overcrowding and the aging of the servers. EQ was awesome before everyone maxed out and created new characters on the same server. Remember back when SOWing was almost nonexistant and a lvl14 player was pretty high? It didn't last long but that was when I loved the game and have slowly lost interest over time. Pretty soon it'll be gone completely. Kunark would help, but verant won't sell it even when I tried to order it on the first day.<P>Am I jealous? Maybe, but I don't want the fancy equipment I see people with.. or rather, I don't want it until I can go get it myself. I don't think that would be jealousy. Ego problem? perhaps, but then I don't want to be better than everyone.. I just want my little sparkle of joy of finding something that most people around my level don't have. Is that so wrong? It's impossible with people twinking as much as they do though. (my highest level char is 24 but I've played a lot of chars)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

With the old brother helping out the younger.<P>I have never spent more than 2 hrs camping a item. I have also never kept a spawn that a group of my monks lvl could be killing instead of just him.So to those who say twinks suck plz understand that in genral the people who have twinked have EARNT the right to do it .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

And dropping on the floor can be used to twink too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And you do earn the right to twink. I spent MY time getting this item, and I would like to give to my lower level character. I don't give away items to guild mates and strangers (well i have given away a few items to strangers) Why? I'm not that KIND type of person. I will sow and buff you if I'm on my druid, I won't give people items. <P>And drop the "its wrong in RP sense" because its perfectly right. I decided that I'll give my GOOD friend some nice equipment to show how much I care for him.<P>Also accusing twinks of KSing and camping all your spawns is just... stupid. I have twinked and have NEVER ksed anyone. Camping all the spawns? Most of the time those are farmers, but some people DO camp for the items? So what? Your jealous that YOU didn't get there in time to be able to get the item, so he's there getting the item (earning it by sitting on his ass waiting) to give it to his lower level. Thats not wrong actually.<P>It doesn't hurt the economy THAT much either. Minor twinks help the economy. My paladin uses a mino axe. By buying that I stopped flooding of this item which is good for a couple of levels.<P>Yes it does hurt gameplay, because they are stronger and have the ability to KS easier. That doesn't mean they are gonna do it. And in FFA places (orc wall in highpass hold) if you can't get any kills because they have a twink in their group, its a sign YOUR group is too weak and you need more nukers. <P>"If they want to harass and duel him to death they will be able to"<P>Yeah, but if they duel them, that DOESN'T mean you have to accept. You can type /decline you know? A higher level is able to repeatly KS, duel and harass the lower level. They are just jerks. not twinks. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's me again...<P>Part of the anti-twink crowd..<P>Let me tell you why I have this attitude.  My first experience with a farmer was with my 33 druid.  I went to perma to camp for a mammoth hide cloak.  I log on early in the day because not that many people on and I've got a better chance of getting the spawn.  So I get to perma and no one is in the dungeon.  I clear a path to the alchemist and a 50 something mage shows up and takes the spawn from me.  Tells me he's been here all day and he just went LD.  I ask what a mage wants with a mammoth hide cloak.  He openly tells me that he's camping "****" for his guild.  And there wasn't really anything I could do about it.  No GM's on to settle the dispute and there was no real reason for me to stay knowing I could not kill the alchemist faster than a 50+ mage.  So I left...with a bad taste in my mouth about how some people play this game.<P>Now I know not everyone who twinks is a farmer, or an e-bayer.  But how do I tell who is and who isn't?  There's no way to seperate the farmers from the people who think they have legitamately twinked their other characters. <P>Experiences like mine above happen hundreds of times a day on all the servers.  And it's just wrong.  I don't care how you look at it.  <P>The 37 Warrior who camped the PGT ledge to twink all his younger guildmates should be banned.  It's a mentality of "I've got an older brother who is bigger and stronger than you so he has the right to do whatever he wants to take your fun away"  BS.....plain and simple.  The kind of person who does this does not play the game for his own enjoyment.  He's the kind of person who is out to win a "virtual" popularity contest.  He's like the guy in High School who, once he graduates , still hangs around the school for a year or two.  All the lower classmen look up to him and think he's cool when he's actually a loser who needs to feel the adulation of those around him.  He can't do it legitamately, so he buys them beer, dope, whatever.  I'm off on a rant here and I hope my point comes across as I intend it to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It's obvious you don't RP. So like I said: More power to the k00l d00ds! LOL."<P>yogi, you do realize that with this simple statement, you lumped everyone who does not fit your definition of roleplaying to be a "k00l d00d".  I rp.  My character likes to adventure and hunt, as well as party.  that is the role he playes.  am I a "k00l d00d"?  I remember is a previous thread on this topic, you said you were tired of people using rp to validate twinking.  Please, stay constint.<P>Someone in a previous post hit the whole topic smack on the head.  People were saying twinking was "cheating" because it gave the twink an unfair advantage over the non twink.  his reply was something along the lines of:  no, it does not give you an "unfair" advantage, because your not competing against him.  If you use yogi's argument that the twink did not earn it, why does this bother you?  its not a race between you and the twink to see who can level the fastest, its about having fun playing the game.  <P>As for the economy issue, there would probable just be that many more of that item in the market, and the price would probable be the same, or a bit lower, which would simply bump the price of these 25 and under weapons down even farher.  the going price of a yak on fennin ro is 2/3kish.  now honestly, how many non twinks are there that can afford that?  remember, were talking about the weapon that was the best non planer 1hs prior to kunark.  if your not a twink, are you going to get your hands on one of these untill your around your 40s? a lucky few maybe, but in general no.  so why does it bother you that they have it?  or are we competing against eachother again? (note: red servers, probable, but, twinking is by far the lesser of the 2 evils when it comes to the way pvp is set up with the ballance versus equality).<P>And one more thing, please stop using the extreemly rare circumstances where a high lvl is camping an item of level way below him as an argument.  most all twinkers buy the items, because they dont want to spend the time camping an item with no gain to their main, its tedious and boreing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>OK I'm going to keep this simple...<P>I have a 45 necro.  I have a twinked warrior I got to level 15 in 1 day /played time.  The interesting thing here is that I bought nothing for my warrior... my necro doesn't have very good equipment or good luck at lottos so I don't have much money to spend on twinkage  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Anyways, I quested for all his crafted, stumbled upon his axe of the iron black (EXCELLENT twink item due to low delay, you only need to worry about replacing it at lev 20) and camped for the rest of his stuff (except for bronze... keeping it after finding it off random mobs isn't quite camping).  My point is simply that my warrior is a fun break from the evercamp world of 45+.  The only exception to this would be the occasional raid that I'm usually not invited to go on due to the fact that most of my friends haven't even reached level 35 so we're unable to organize much of anything.<P>Aside from my twink, I spend most of my time sitting in a little room, waiting on a 30 minute spawn, trying not to look too ugly in my orobe, lamenting about how my most valuable item is a batskull earring and I have terrible luck with lottos, and generally being boring as hell.  The only motivation to keep playing my necro would be to eventually reach lev 60 and visit veeshan's peak... or to camp items for twinkage.  <P>If twinking *were* to be banned, this game would have gotten old a year ago (I do NOT wish to go through the same camps, take forever to get the same levels and generally do the same thing all over again) and I would have quit by now in favor of a game like AC.<P>On a side note, I don't know if you've noticed, but sitting in a small room waiting on a spawn isn't all that exciting, and sadly enough it's the only way to get good items outside of camping rathe mountains into the ground for a month or so. <P>This is becoming a bit of a rant and I'm beginning to lose my train of thought (sleep deprivation does that to me... thanks to my warrior  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) so I'll just end it here before I contradict myself or something...<P>Before I go, a list of points...<BR>-High levels get boring fast unless you're going on a raid.. which I never get into.<BR>-Twinkage is fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>-Please don't pick out some little sentance in my argument and go off on hours on end about how I'm destroying the server and experience of others.<BR>-I've found it easier to RP as a twink than as a non-twink.<BR>-The Rock was the best movie ever.<BR>-My main has the equipment of a level 35-ish person because of general overcrowdedness, bad luck and the fact that item distribution isn't based on need like it should be.

</FONT><HR>So why exactly did I *struggle* to become 43rd level?<P>My main goal in EQ has always been to get nice loot. After a year of EQ, I can do that... and then you say I can't use my loot for any new characters I want to create nor give to my lower level friends?<P>That is selfish and childish for anyone to limit me on this.<P>EQ is not an easy game, it is VERY time consuming. It took me a YEAR to build up what I have now, and no one has the right to tell me that I can not do as I please with this gear.<P>Twinking is at times, nothing more then appearance. Most items do not function well at lower levels, but they are an enhancment. Spells do not proc, and weapons have damage caps. Twinking is not the end all be all, but for people like me, who have had NO GEAR for a year, its a blessing to finally have the ability to start with a slight edge. Armor and stat items are the biggest advantage for twinks, and rightfully so.<P>I am NEVER gong to play up another character from nothing. That was pure frustration and simply no fun at all. It wasn't a challenge, it was TIME, and only TIME. Time I will never again have for anything as trivial as this game.<P>If you don't like the fact that I am now giving away my loot and cash to lower levels, that is your problem not mine. I give away items to my other characters, friends, and sometimes total strangers.<P>I EARNED this stuff, you did not. So don't tell me what I can and can not do with it.<P>Krenk Feen<BR>43rd lvl Troll Shaman<BR>TZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I love it.  Typical attitude of a pro-twinker.  I got it, it's mine, and I'll do what I want with it.  And who has the childish or selfish viewpoint.  (-;<P>You say the basic game is "no fun at all...I will never again have time for anything as trivial as this game."  So the only thing that is fun is having kewl stuff and good lewt huh?  Wow, something tells me that you are one of many people who fit into the category of "just don't get it".  You hate the basic gameplay of killing monsters and building up a character, and your  "goal has always been to get nice loot."  Sounds like a lot of hassle to stand on top of a mountain and shout "look at me.  look at my kewl stuff".<P>People keep sticking with this "I built the character up and I'm going to do what I want with him.  Screw you."   Sorry folks, that ain't the way a MMORPG works.  You could have spent 800 hours earnings stuff for your character.  It don't matter.  You still have to log on and play in a world with other players and fit into Verant's vision of the game.   There is this huge sense of entitlement I'm getting from these posts, which is great in the sense of being involved in the game, but very misplaced if you think you have a "right" to do anything in this game. You don't.  Verant gives you a right when they keep the electricity to their servers running every day.<P>I agree with the poster who said it's like a high school clique and the twinkers are the people who had a big chip on their shoulder.  It's like when you were a Freshman and you never want to go through that again so you wait and then pick on the new Freshmen, making their lives miserable.  But hey, at least it's not you, and you've got a RIGHT to have your fun.   You put in your time.  You paid your dues.

</FONT><HR>Okay, I have a question to the anti-twinks out there.<P>What do we do with the equipment we are replacing? The main argument seems to be that our lower level characters didn't 'earn' the equipment, so what should we do?<P>If we give it to our lower level characters (ours or a guildmate) then they won't have 'earned' the items.<P>If we give them to someone else. Just someone who happens to be in the zone when we upgrade, then again, they didn't 'earn' the items.<P>If we sell them to a player, then we are accused of farming off the items. And the person buying the items did 'earn' them either.<P>If we sell them to a (so called) merchant, we find that the hours we spent camping the item are worth maybe 20 plat.<P>If we keep them, eventually our entire bank accounts would be too full.<P>So we should just destroy them? If we dropped them on the ground, someone might come along and pick them up before they rotted. Again, not 'earning' the items.<P>How is that more noble or better for the game than giving or selling the item to someone who wants or needs it?<P>BTW, I am twinked. I stated exactly how I'm twinked on a different thread about a week ago, but I'll reiterate it here:<P>Kunzar Ku'juch. (8/22, Effect of Engulfing Darkness, Warrior only) Given to me by my guild in return for pulling 5 corpses to the zone line in CoM the night before, and dying 3 times total during it. I was 26th level.<P>Shimmering Partisan. (17/39, +10 STR, +20 DEX, +10 vs Fire and Cold, Warrior only) Given to me by the only Warrior in my guild who is higher than I am after he got his Wurmslayer. I offered it back to him when they changed it to 1H Slash and he said no. I was level 31.<P>Cobalt Gauntlets. (AC:25, Effect of Reckless Strength, Warrior only) Given to me by my guild after a guild raid on Karnor's. They acquired 2 sets of Gauntlets and the higher level Warrior on my guild got the first pair. I was level 30.<P>Mountain Death Belt. (AC:8, +25 HPs, 5 Charges of Skin like Rock, Small races only) Given to me by a Shaman friend to whom I had given an Ebon War Spear to a few levels ealier. I was level 28.<P>Skull Shaped Barbute. (AC: 13, +10 vs Magic, +35 HPs) Bought AND paid for at the bazaar in East Commons with my own hard earned plat.<P>Full Crafted minus the Helm and Gauntlets now. Given to me over the course of 18 levels by my guild. I have since handed down pieces to lower level Warriors in my guild. <P>Now you say I did not earn this items. If you mean by going and defeating the spawns myself, you are correct. However, I believe I have earned these items, and so does my guild. Otherwise they would never have given them to me. I may not have been there when these particular items dropped, but I have been there when my guild went delving into Kedge Keep for the Mermaid's Hair for our Rangers to get their Raincallers. And I have been to the City of Mist. And Nagafen's Lair. I have been on a Fire Giant Raid (at level 32. And I won the roll for the Mithril Arms and deferred to another person who WAS NOT a guild member because they had been on many more raids than I had). I have raided into Kithicor Forest at night (at level 25), Trakanon's Teeth (at level 32), and camped the King Room in Permafrost, killing the Ice Giant Diplomat (at 31). I also have a key to Sebilis, and will be joining my guild there on their next run (at level 33, unless I level before then).<P>Lumping all of the 'twinks' in a group as a whole and calling them cheaters is both insulting and ignorant. <P>You want me to stop twinking the lower level characters in my guild with the items I'm replacing? Give me a viable option and reason to. You want RP? I'll give you RP. My character guides the lower level groups and helps them out. I have gone in and watched over them in numerous dungeons. Helping out only when it was obvious they would die without it. Answering their questions about combat tactics. Showing them the spawns. In other words TEACHING them. And when one of them shows promise, or does something out of the ordinary and very heroic, I show them my pride and give them a reward equal to what I think they have done. Sometimes that means I have to go without a piece of armor, or a weapon until I can replace it. Sometimes that means I have to get something for them, from the spawn or the bazaar, whichever is quickest for me. <P>When it comes right down to it, I could care less if someone twinks or doesn't twink. That is their decision. But you telling me that what I am doing is wrong, or is cheating, that pisses me right off. How dare you judge me. Who are you to judge what I do? Am I breaking the rules? No (And your calling it cheating does infer that I am. Regardless of how you would LIKE it to be, twinking IS NOT against the rules) Am I hurting someone else? No. I am not killing them, attacking them, KSing them, harrasing them, or in any way doing anything to THEM. I am doing something for myself and for others. So leave me be. <P>Kneebiter Wordsmith, Gnome Warrior of the Disciples of Honor, E'ci Server.

</FONT><HR>Amusing to see the same old argument.<P>Here's the fundamental issues, as I see them:<BR>(1) Some players  believe the enjoyment comes from the struggle to go from L1 with no gear, earning their way, until they hit L50. They enjoy the challenge, and view this as the way the game "should be played.<BR>(2) Some players get their enjoyment out of loading their characters up with the best possible gear and then doing whatever from there. They see nothing wrong with this and think it fits within the way the game "should be played".<BR>(3) There are some players who, while getting items for themselves, their secondary characters, or friends/guildmates, exhibit poor social behavior (kill-stealing, rare spawn hogging, etc). Most people will agree that these folks make the game less enjoyable for everyone but themselves.<P>Now, the folks who believe in (1) tend to lump all the (2) folks in with (3) since neither are playing the game the way they feel it should be played.<P>The (2) folks think that the (1) folks are just jealous of their gear/levels/whatever, missing out on the fact that they really just have a fundamentally different view in how the game "should be played".<P>Unfortunately, there's no way to separate the groups (Twink servers vs non-twinks vs roleplay servers vs whatever  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  About the best we _can_ do is to try to eliminate the (3) folks so at worst, we get the (1) and the (2) factions thinking the others are doing something wrong, but not actively ruining each other's game.<P>I've been in EQ since April of 1999.  It's a much different world now than it was then, when banded armor was rare and desired, when a rusty weapon wasn't left rotting on corpses  because everyone needed every last copper.<P>Group (2) didn't really exist last April. I may not agree with how they choose to find their enjoyment, but they've as much right to it as I have the right to play the game the way I see fit.<P>Overcrowding does make it worse, forcing the two groups into more frequent contact. Kunark helped some, but I still long for the days when you could go to a dungeon, and find that there was only one other group in there, and you truly had the experience of risky exploration, rather than entering and hearing "/shout Camp Check".<P>For those of you who never experienced those days, you missed something very special. <P>of course, I'm just a troll warrior, these are just my opinions, I could be wrong  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

And the person buying the items did 'earn' them either.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>I get a little suspicious when I see a below level 20 person auctioning off items such as a sharkjaw cutlass, SMR, and other items in that multi-k plat range.  No way did that CHARACTER earn those items.  He may very well have a high level character who got those items legitamately, however there is no way to know for sure.  He could possibly have a high level character who does nothing but farm..and you people honestly tell me that you don't know ANYONE who ever farms items.  I've had camps stolen along with thousands of other players.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Give me a viable option and reason to. You want RP? I'll give you RP. My character guides the lower level groups and helps them out. I have gone in and watched over them in numerous dungeons. Helping out only when it was obvious they would die without it. Answering their questions about combat tactics. Showing them the spawns. In other words TEACHING them. &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>See my response from an earlier thread :<P>The 37 Warrior who camped the PGT ledge to twink all his younger guildmates should be banned. It's a mentality of "I've got an older brother who is bigger and stronger than you so he has the right to do whatever he wants to take your fun away" BS.....plain and simple. The kind of person who does this does not play the game for his own enjoyment. He's the kind of person who is out to win a "virtual" popularity contest. He's like the guy in High School who, once he graduates , still hangs around the school for a year or two. All the lower classmen look up to him and think he's cool when he's actually a loser who needs to feel the adulation of those around him. He can't receive adulation or accolades from his peers so he builds his own ego by doing stuff for the underclassmen such as buying them beer, dope, whatever. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Someone brought up MUDS as an example of where "twinking" was considered "cheating".  Having run a MUD for 4 years I can tell you why there are very distinct differences between EQ Twinking, and MUD Cheating.<P>First, and most obvious, is size.  My MUD had anywhere from 70 (off-peak) to the maximum of 200 during peak.  We had anywhere from 5 to 10 "GMs" on at one time.  And since only a very small percentage of people were ever really a problem, we had ample coverage.  EverQuest, is a different ballgame altogether.  On Mith Marr, it's 600 too 2600 players, probably 5 to 10 Guides and/or GMs.  It would be VERY difficult to monitor 2600 people with only 10 people.<P>Second, MUDs are highly impacted by small changes. In other words, SoandsoA gets this uber equipment, and passes it to SoandsoB.  SoandsoB goes around killing other characters to loot.  He has a huge impact on game play because he alone can affect such a small population to a great extent.  On EverQuest, if someone "twinks" a character, he's a very very small face in a massive crowd.  And because of certain implementation details, the only REAL advantage he has is appearance.  He "looks" better than the other players.<P>Third, most people that twink other characters are not doing so just to play barbie doll.  They usually have a desire to play that character.  Mules are a different story.  Mules, in fact, are the #1 reason why "twinking" was not allowed on my MUD.  They stored the limited drop equipment so no-one else could get it and overpower them.  Not all MUDs had limited drop equipment, most were probably like EQ.  Mules have very little impact on the game...  The equipment they have will still be dropped, if the equipment has been removed from the game, then there isn't enough of it on any Mule (or mules) to have a huge impact on the game.<P>Fourth, and probably most obvious, is the business aspect.  I've worked my way through 54 levels.  I started with a newbie robe, a newbie dagger, and my free food just like everyone else.  My desire not to repeat that is understandable to most that have worked through 54 levels.  This is what keeps me coming back.  I can start new characters and have them enjoy the blessings of the work I put into my main... the fruit of his labor, so to speak.<P>I don't "overtwink", probably because it's pretty useless to put in that much effort with all of the level based tuning the EverQuest staff has done.  A level 5 warrior with an executioner's axe isn't going to deal very much more damage that a level 5 warrior with a fine-steel two-handed sword.  So, I didn't bother equipping my warrior with such things.  I couldn't solo things that the non-twinks couldn't, no advantage there either.<P>My caster twinks, well, they have a slight edge in that they probably have a bit more mana than a comparably leveled caster.  But, I'll tell you it's hardly noticeable, except for the downtime I have waiting to get full mana.  The intelligence bonuses at low-levels is neglegible.<P>What I do oppose, however, is an uber-guild getting a newly created character in their guild up to 50 inside of 2 weeks.  But, banning twinking isn't going to stop this.  The equipment isn't what makes the character, it's more often who he has to help him, or what other out of game advantages he has (i.e. a level 54 druid on a separate account to power-level his characters on another account).  If you had a level 54 druid to babysit you, you could go to your mid 40's completely naked, save for a rusty weapon.<P>Bottom line, it isn't hurting a game of this scale.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Twinking can help others get their equipment easyer.  For example I camp a FBSS and give it to a twink.  You lok at that and that and complain that it makes it harder for you to get one. But if you look at the long term effect it helps someone else get their FBSS faster. Once my charecter is at the level were he could join a group and get a FBSS he won't go to lguk which gives another melee type a better chance of getting a FBSS.  Or I do go to lguk becasue its good experience and I join the frenzied group.  When a FBSS does drop I don't roll on it which gives any other melee type in the group a better chance of getting a FBSS. So maybe when you are low level and see these people with high level gear you complain, but later when you are the right lwevel to get this equipment yourself you won't have as much competition to get the equipment you need.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?<BR>I believe that some people have a misconception of twinking. When approached one way twinking is a bad thing, yet when approached in another way it becomes a good thing. Heavy controvery has already plagued this topic. I am here to piece together what twinking is all about and show you some of the views as well as my own idears about this hot topic.<P>WHY I CHOSE TO DO THIS PIECE?<BR>I remember way back when I first started EQ. I was one of the lucky ones. I made friends who taught me the trade skill of auctioning quite early. With my new found skill I quickly began to aquire my wealth exponentially, which soon gave birth to a low lvl warrior with full Crafted and a set of Yekshas. The problem was, soon after, other players around me began tossing vulgar language at me and calling me a twink. Truth was I wasn't and that led me to find out more about these so called twinks and why they are so hated by the people of Norrath.<P>WHAT IS A TWINK?<BR>A twink is a character with equipment which is or is highly unlikely to be aquired by that character throught its short life or lvl.<P>HOW TO AQUIRE TWINK STATUS?<BR>1. The most honorable way to achive the title of twink is to become a merchant: buy, sell, and trade your way to great wealth.<BR>2. Another way is to pull high lvl equipment from your higher lvl character. (Which is perfectly ok.)<BR>3. Then we begin to move over to the gray area, when high lvl characters helping out a newbie by giving him a high lvl item.<BR>4. Moving on we have the people who beg, beg, and beg some more for items they obviously haven't earned.<BR>5. Last and most despicable are those who would defy the words and morals of EQ and buy items on Ebay with real world dollars.<P>WHAT IS THE MISCONCEPTION?<BR>A recent survey I projected throughout my server showed that the reason most lower lvl players complain when they see twinks is that they generally believe that those players didn't earn their items. The problem is they haven't played the game long enough to know that items can be earned and transfered. Instead they base their thoughts on instinct, which would usually lead them to conclude that all twinks were "given" their items from some high lvl player for free, that they begged for them and some how got exactly what they asked for, or that they bought them from Ebay, all of which is on the lower end of my list. The survey also charted that the majority of twinks and high lvl players who have twinked characters transfered items from their higher lvls that were more suited for their twinks and were nolonger useful to their present character.<P>WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION?<BR>It is true that there are some despicable twinks in EQ, but the majority of them, no matter what is said, have in some way earned their items, and any way to "earn" your items "in game" is viable, decent, and righteous. The problem that remains is that some people have infused the concept of twinking as "bad," for such a long time and early in their EQ life that they can nolonger or cannot easily become candidates of change.<P>Evalence Schezar<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I've paid Verant $100+ to susbcribe to their servers during this time....and if I acquire higher level gear and desire to pass it off to my lower level character then so be it.<P>I started a warrior alt. I completed all the crafted quests, traded some loot I picked up for a Mithril Two handed sword, went to Perma and got him a silvery war axe, then also hit Highpass and picked up a PGT for him...not to mention countless other smaller items so that he would have a nice set of gear to carry him in to the 40s. So I could focus on playing and having fun and not have to worry about gear... What I did is *NONE* of any other players business, nor should they care what type of gear my 15th level warrior has...it effects them NOT AT ALL...and neither should Verant for that matter. So step off!<P>Basically if the motto is "if you got it use it". And if Verant is going to introduce punitive efforts to stop any form of twinking is the day that I walk away from this game. Its a gross infringement on the player. And this isnt some inky text based MUD running off some College systeme admins UNIX box at home, so cut out the relation that twinking is cheating. Thats bull.<P>Verant if you stop twinking its going to be another slap in the face to the people who have been playing this game for so long, and another example of catering to the petty among your user base.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sigh, more of the same righteous arguments from the twinkers.<P>Jedi, you said:<BR>"I have played this game for a year now. I worked my butt off to get my ranger to 45th level. I've paid Verant $100+ to susbcribe to their servers during this time....and if I acquire higher level gear and desire to pass it off to my lower level character then so be it."<P>You don't seem to get it.  You are playing in a massively multiplayer environment.  You pay the same amount every month as the other 270,000 people playing the game.  It's not a single player RPG and you don't have the right to do anything just because you paid your money and you "desire" to do so.  The only right you have is to play the game as Verant deems is in the best interest of the other players and the Vision.  If they take steps to eliminate twinking you're free to leave.  It's their game, NOT yours.  You pay a monthly fee to play it.  Period.<P>You also say: <BR>"so cut out the relation that twinking is cheating. Thats bull."<P>Well, in some instances twinking most certainly would be defined as cheating.  It depends what you're talking about.  The game is NOT designed for you to pass equipment from one player to another on the same account.  In order to so you either have to find or create a mule to hold your stuff, or do a safe drop while you log in and log out.  At BEST, that's using an exploit and taking advantage of the game mechanics to get around transferring items between players on the same account.  If they wanted you to be able to pass items between characters don't you think they would have designed it that way???<P>You also said:<P>"What I did is *NONE* of any other players business, nor should they care what type of gear my 15th level warrior has"<P>WRONG.  What you do in the game is the business of every single player in the game.  Everything you do, whether you think it does or not, affects the world we all play in.  Again, it's not a single player game.  We all fight, sell, chat, and quest in the SAME world.  You have an impact, however minimal, on the entire game from the economy to the availability of items, to the general atmosphere.  Add up 270,000 people playing the game and I can assure you that everything people does has a HUGE impact on the game, from twinking to Ebaying.<P>I also don't know how you think that you have some overbearing right to give stuff earned from one character to another because you "don't want to go through all that stuff again".  It's called playing the game.  The game is designed from the ground up so that a character will progress from level 1 to level 60 in a certain amount of time.  Along the way that character will encounter monsters they can fight appropriate to their level.  They will build up skills.  They will build up their stats.  They will acquire weapons and armor appropriate to the monsters they are fighting.  Twinking low level characters with level 30+ gear throws the whole game design equation out of whack and for the life of me I don't see why people can't grasp this simple fact.  THE GAME WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR LEVEL 1 CHARACTERS TO BE RUNNING AROUND IN PLATE ARMOR. <P>For those of you who think that you're running around in your own little world and have no effect on the rest of us, GET A CLUE. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

When My main char (druid) was low lvl with **** gear I saw the twinks and thought (wish I had that ****) I never said "Hey wtf you cheat!!!!!! blah bitty blah blah. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;THE GAME WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR LEVEL 1 CHARACTERS TO BE RUNNING AROUND IN PLATE ARMOR. &gt;&gt;<P>Sorry KidF, you're wrong.  The game was designed for level 1 characters to be running around in plate armor, carrying huge 35 dmg, 40 dly weapons.  No you say?  Well look at this. <P>Let's make a newbie character here.  Twink him with said items.  Now drop him out in the newbie area at level 1.  On a level 40 warrior, the items he's wearing would be formidable.  The guards tremble in fear at seeing him.  He runs out in blazing glory to strike an orc pawn that's walking by.  He swings at the orc pawn and hits... for 8 dmg..  The Orc Pawn turns, sees this magnificent example of walking metal, and rips him a new one, hits him for 6 dmg.  The ubertwink warrior grunts in dismay as his health bar drops down 1 1/2 bubs. He swings again, missing wildly, practically burying his weapon in a tree nearby.  Again, the orc rocks him, doing 4 damage.  The warrior watches as another bubble of health slips away.  The warrior realizes at this point that there is no chance for him to make it to the guards and stands ready to fight to the death.  He gets one more hit for 8 dmg before the orc drops him.  Orc 1, ubertwink 0.<P>Can't happen you say?  Make a newbie, twink him(OH THE HORROR) and try it yourself.  I've twinked several of my characters, and as every twink will agree with me, this happens.  It happens because Verant designed the low levels to be capped at damage, at skills and at attack and AC.  Yah, you can throw uberarmor on a newbie, but guess what...  he's just a shiny newbie now, with an AC of still less than 100.  Give him a sweet 35 dmg, 40 dly weapon?  He still couldn't hit the broad side of the barn, and won't be able to and do some decent damage until he is level 20.  Give him a weapon that procs Ice Comet (oy, that would be a scary weapon) and he won't ever see it happen until level 45ish or so.  So in answer to your flame KidF, yes the game is designed to handle level 1 characters in Plate Armor.  It handles them very well in fact.  That's why I laugh when I see the newbie in full crafted wielding a yek or a worn crescent axe get dropped by large rats.<P>Gartan of Bertoxx<P>oh yah, go ahead and flame, I get a kick out of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Why is it that if someone disagrees with you we're jealous???"<P>Thats the lamest thing I've heard so far. If anyone disagreed with me, that they're jealous? Complete bull****. FACE IT! YOU KNOW YOU GET JEALOUS FROM TWINKS! <P>"You don't seem to get it. You are playing in a massively multiplayer environment. You pay the same amount every month as the other 270,000 people playing the game. It's not a single player RPG and you don't have the right to do anything just because you paid your money and you "desire" to do so. The only right you have is to play the game as Verant deems is in the best interest of the other players and the Vision. If they take steps to eliminate twinking you're free to leave. It's their game, NOT yours. You pay a monthly fee to play it. Period."<P>Actually it makes sense that if WE bought it its OURS. If its not then Verant would have no customers. We paid all this money, WE deserve something back from money, if not its like giving 2 dollars to the ice cream man asking to get something, and not getting anything in return. Verant knows that, thats why we are able to TWINK! By twinking we are able to play this fun game over, but this time its not so hard. If you don't get your ice cream back, you'd tell all your friends and they'd tell thiers and so on and so on. No one would but ice cream from them.<P>"If they take steps to eliminate twinking you're free to leave."<P>You act so calm, yet a few days after you logged onto Everquest if they made a patch, you'd sit there looking for a group for HOURS.<P>"Well, in some instances twinking most certainly would be defined as cheating. It depends what you're talking about. The game is NOT designed for you to pass equipment from one player to another on the same account. In order to so you either have to find or create a mule to hold your stuff, or do a safe drop while you log in and log out. At BEST, that's using an exploit and taking advantage of the game mechanics to get around transferring items between players on the same account. If they wanted you to be able to pass items between characters don't you think they would have designed it that way???"<P>Face it, sure Verant didn't want it that way. IT ACTUALLY HELPED VERANT. If twinking was bannable or destroyed, VERANT WOULD LOSE CUSTOMERS! LOTS OF THEM! Twinking gave Everquest replay value. Most people 40+ who have worked their butts off dont want to start the game ALL over again with their newbie tunic.<P>"WRONG. What you do in the game is the business of every single player in the game. Everything you do, whether you think it does or not, affects the world we all play in. Again, it's not a single player game. We all fight, sell, chat, and quest in the SAME world. You have an impact, however minimal, on the entire game from the economy to the availability of items, to the general atmosphere. Add up 270,000 people playing the game and I can assure you that everything people does has a HUGE impact on the game, from twinking to Ebaying."<P>yes, and twinking is a POSITIVE impact. It HELPS you, and if you are hurt by them, then get yer ass off a PVP server. Twinking only helps you, by twinking we can tank better, hit harder, have more mana for heals and such. This only helps you, yet you ask for nerfs (which will have an EVEN BIGGER impact. Huge, nuclear blast huge)<P>"We all fight, sell, chat, and quest in the SAME world."<P>Actually, most other players dont effect me because they are on different servers.<P>"I also don't know how you think that you have some overbearing right to give stuff earned from one character to another because you "don't want to go through all that stuff again". It's called playing the game. The game is designed from the ground up so that a character will progress from level 1 to level 60 in a certain amount of time."<P>Actually we EARNED it. WE PLAYED IT. WE WANT A REWARD FOR ENDING THE GAME! We don't want to go through the game again, you gotta problem with that? <P>"THE GAME WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR LEVEL 1 CHARACTERS TO BE RUNNING AROUND IN PLATE ARMOR. "<P>If it wasn't designed like that, then why CAN we? Don't you think they would've put level restrictions?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Gartan. Since I've started playing this game it's been one frustration after another in "gaining" the equipment necessary for my "first" character (non-twinked). When after, a long time had past I had finally arrived at a point where I could start even thinking about "twinking" another character (almost a year). To tell you the truth, twinking was the furthest thing from my mind as I pain-stakingly "progressed" through my levels (by the way my first character that I played for a really long time was a Shaman. We all know that Healers don't make squat) actually I was more concerned about where I was going to get the money for my next set of spells! If that weren't bad enough, I had to find out the hard way that I had built in the stats the wrong way for making a Barbarian Shaman character. I said all that to say this..stop slamming ppl for making twinks because what this has been to all of us who know better than to believe that twinking is such a taboo thing to do is that, our first few characters were our mistakes..the characters we "twink" that you hate so much, are the end product of many trials and failures in the attempts to create the "perfect" character not the perfect twink..we still have to climb the same ladder as you do even with all that glorified garb..final point is..you'll be doing it one day too..and no one will bad you for it that has done it themselves because we understand why your doing it..get the point now</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
