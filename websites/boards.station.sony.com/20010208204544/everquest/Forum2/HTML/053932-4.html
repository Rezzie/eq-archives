It was obvious you couldn't dispute the facts in my prior posts and now you just want me to stop spreading logic in the thread.<P>I'm only one of many whom you have been unable to respond with valid arguments.  Despite your "agree to disagree" you are unable to convince anyone that "time" or "non-ownership" is what is being sold.

</FONT><HR>By bidding an auction, a player have showed a clear intention of violating EULA.  So, when it comes to banning, those who bought/sold/bid are on the same boat.  Consider, without buyers, there wouldn't be sellers, and withtout sellers, there wouldn't buyers.<P>Verant cannot bid on auctions and then ban people.  It is illegal to do so without court consent.  Only law enforcement agents with court consent can perform such actions.  <P>It is true that Verant can ban those are in question.  However, there must be over 60k of people they will have to go through.  Amount those people, many owns multi accounts, they have friends, relatives, and family members who play game.  If Verant banned all of them, the chain reaction from the banning will lead to massive number of account cancellation.  Verant could lose over half of it is player base for good.  This is the reason they don't want to do that. If you all take look the auctions, even though Verant said it is "illegal" to sell the items, and they will not support those got cheated.  You can still see lots of people bidding on the items.  More importantly, you see a lot of accounts are being auctioned on ebay.  People are stripping their best characters and selling the items.  This means what?  This means people are start to quit.  To many the whole reason they still play is because they know their characters/items worth something at the end when they want to quit.  Now, this ebay issue just speeded up the quiting.  <P>Just watch for the next 2 mmorpgs hit the market.  One year from today, Verant should feel lucky if they can rank number 5.  Ebay didn't win, Verant didn't lose.  This is nothing more than another way to make more players angery at the end.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You guys who think you will succesfully sue Verant are a bunch of morons. Ebay owns the auction site and has a right to deny certain auctions. If McDonald's as a sign on their front door that says "No Shoes No Shirt Noo Service" are you going to sue them because you like to run around without shoes? Of course not! The only way you could sue them is if they denied your business on the basis of sex, religion, race, or if you are disabled. <P>Learn the frickin law you morons.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not sure if they have legal recourse if you try and do that or not other than disturbing the peace.<P>How bout this scenario:  You go to the library looking for a rare book.  The book is checked out by someone else already.  You convince the librarian to let you contact that person.  You then offer that person $50 to check it back in and let you check it out.

Thins were going well, until his auction's page disappeared from eBay just as the auction was about to close.<P>Jardeen got an e-mail from eBay informing him that his auction had been shut down at the request of Adobe. When he pursued the matter with the San Jose-based software developer, he got an e-mail saying, "You are not an authorized reseller of Adobe products or otherwise licensed to reproduce or distribute Adobe products" - and therefore he couldn't sell the software.<P>...<P>But for other would-be software sellers online, it's a sticky issue.  If they try to unload software they own, will they wind up getting more e-mail from lawyers than from buyers?"<P>Good article.<P>texture<BR>DE druid<P>.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Baldaren<BR>There were around 3000-4000 closed auctions each week on ebay and lasted for almost 2 years. There are 4 weeks a month, 12 months a year. So each year there are 4x12=48 months.  So, each year there were around 12k-16k of auctions.  Around 15% of those auctions had no bider. So, 15k-.15*15=12750 auctions that go biders. Let's say there are 1 seller and average 2 biders for each auction. That would be 2*12750=25500 biders. Amount those biders, there are around 30% or so who are repeat biders. 25500-25500*.3=17850 uniqu biders. There are far less uniqu sellers who are responsible for starting those auctions.  Let's say all those auctions are started by 1000 people(this is a very low but just to make a point).  Now 17850+1000=18850 people a year involved in Ebay auctions.  Add another 6 months that would be 18850+17850/2+500=28275 people who bought/sold/bid on ebay for EQ items/account. Amount those people, lots of them have at least 2 accounts. So, that will add up to at least 32k of accounts. If Verant wanted to ban all those who bought/sold/bid on ebay for eq items/accounts.  They will have some where around 32k players get effected.  Chain reaction for such banning will be very large.  Once player is banned, there is a good chance that the company will lose that player for good. When I'm talking about 60 of players involved in this ebay thing is a low number.  Why you don't see many compain?  Well, because they don't want to get banned.  Take look those who just started to play with no high lvl characters.  Think about how in the world did they got so much pp to spent?  It is almost a standard practice for a new players to start with one of those MMORPG.  They started a new character, buy some money and items from ebay for their new characters. People think they have earned money in real life, when cannot they spend their money the way they see fit?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Alistair,<BR>You cannot sell rights to something you don't own. Simple as that. It's not a matter of CAN VI do this, it's a matter of SHOULD they do this. It is as simple as that. CAN they ban/block sales of e-auctioned items, yes, and more power to them. SHOULD they do it? I don't know."<P>Please actually READ what someone posts before commmenting on what they posted.<P>I didn't say you could sell rights to something you don't own, unless you are talking about the sublease example and I was only pointing out that unauthorized subleases are often legal depending on the circumstances.  Someone else may have, but I didn't.<P>And yes, clearly, Verant CAN block them AT THIS TIME because they are doing it.  Should they?  Of course.  If I were Verant I would because it would only serve to preserve the integrety of the game.  AGAIN, I think this is a good move on Verant's part and I'm not arguing what is right or wrong here.  I'm interested in this specifically as to weather it is LEGAL for them to block an auction or weather it is ILLEGAL for someone to make an auction or for ebay to allow it.  Sure, it may SEEM obvious that this activity is illegal because we think it's wrong, but the law just simply doesn't work that way.  People are making too many assumptions about the law based on thier own feelings about this issue.  You have to look at it objectively, and not as someone who wants the e-bay farmers in their favorite game to go away.  Besides, this isn't a VOTE, its a discussion.<P>Again, a copyright attorney in another thread said he reviewed the Copyright Act of 1976 and said he could find no violation in e-baying in-game items.  Anyone here want to take a stab at it?  And for the record, he wasn't saying e-baying items is right, just as I am not.  He was just pointing out that despite what Verant claims, there really doesn't seem to be any law covering this at least in the realm of copyright law.<P>"Suppose I live in a small town in Northern Alaska. It's so small that we don't have a movie theater. I dogsled to Fairbanks and rent Gladiator. When I return home, I charge my fellow Alaskans 3 dollars to watch the film, just to reimburse me for my time. I have put copyrighted material to commercial use."<P>This really doesn't apply to this issue.  People keep using analogies that involve CLEAR violation of copyright that don't compare to the e-bay issue.  "When I return home, I charge my fellow Alaskans 3 dollars to watch the film..."  That is  a violation of copyright law because you are EXHIBITING someone elses intellectual property for profit.  That's not happening here UNLESS (as Scirocco pointed out) you post a screenshot in your auction because that artwork is copyrighted and you are displaying the copyrighted material as a part of your sale.  If you, on the other hand, rented your rented copy to your friends, you would be within the confines of the law.  It is legal for the video store to rent the video to you and it is also legal, unless your rental agreement with the video store prohibits it, for you to rent it to your friends.  Further to that point, video stores don't buy exhibition licences and they certainly don't pay royalties for their rentals.  They buy the videos and they rent them, thus putting copyrighted material to commercial use, and it is entirely legal.  As a motion picture producer, I can assure you that the industry would be all over charging royalties from video stores.  The distribs get right of first sale and thats it.<P>Another example is airlines who hand out magazines and newspapers during the flight (not the in-house mags).  They are putting copyrighted material to commercial use, and it is entirely legal.  I'm sure if we all thought about it long enough we could come up with more examples like this.  Just because you are making money from someone's copyrighted material, doesn't necessarily mean you are in violation of the law.  Its the MANNER in which that profit is made that matters.<P>This issue had not a thing to do with intellecual property.  It is a contract issue as it relates to the EULA.  Interesting post about the guy e-baying Adobe.  He could probably sue.  Had he opened the shrinkwrap he would have agreed to Adobe's licence, but since he didn't, is entirely possible his rights are being violated.  Most likely that is a case just like the one we are discussing.  At frist glance, it seems entirely right and proper for Adobe to block his auction, but is it really legal for them to do it?  If the guy never agreed to the Adobe EULA by opening and loading the software, is he bound by it?  I can't imagine he would be because that would essentially mean that EULAs are automatically LAW and THAT would be a much much greater wrong than anything we are discussing here.  I'm thinking there must be something (i.e. a whole other area of law) in the "licenced reseller" part that may make it illegal that I don't know about because I'm not a lawyer so this may not be the best example--any insight on that?<P>But that brings me to a question.  I agree to follow the EULA when I enter the game.  Joe Blow agrees to follow the EULA when he enters the game.  One of us auctions an item on e-bay and the other buys it.  Sure, Verant can come down on us because we have broken our agreement with them, but can they do anything to e-bay?  E-bay never agreed to the EULA so why should they be bound to it?  Truthfully, I'm really asking because that is what this really comes down to.  Please don't answer the question because you think it's right or wrong (I can tell you now I personally think it is wrong) or what(based on what you think is right or wrong) you BELIEVE the law to be, answer the question based on what the LAW ACTUALLY SAYS.  I don't know the answer but we may all be surprised.<P>Again, read Scirocco's posts in this thread.<P>Al</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Unless there is somebody who willing file a lawsuit againest Verant, or Verant file lawsuit againest all those who sold/bought/bid on ebay for EQ items/account, We can never find this out.

Saying nothing and only except isn't going to help our consumer rights at all.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm... <P>Ok I'm done with analogies.  Now I'm not a lawyer but I consider myself intelligent and I tend to be good a research and interpretation.<P>So here we go....<P>These are quotes pulled from the given section of the US copyright laws...<P>http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/index.html<P>From section 109...<BR>") Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord. "<P>---Seems to me they are saying you can resell your copy.  Not a reproduction but the copy itself.<P>There's the part just after this that states you MAY NOT do this for "commercial advantage".  HOWEVER, this does not apply to... <BR>"(i) a computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or <BR>(ii) a computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games and may be designed for other purposes"<P>Someone with more legal knowledge than I can interpret whether or not EQ falls under the video game exception above.<P><BR>The section on "fair use" is kind of hazy to me...<BR>"In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include - <P>(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; <BR>(2) the nature of the copyrighted work; <BR>(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and <BR>(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

</FONT><HR>As much as copyright is brought up, the copyright issue relates to Ebay's policy not to allow auctions of copyrighted material without the owner's permission.<P>The points you bring up are:<P>"Seems to me they are saying you can resell your copy. Not a reproduction but the copy itself."<P>Yes.  If you own it.  In EQ, you do not.  You are leased access to it.  (Refer to contract law.)<P>"HOWEVER, this does not apply to... <BR>"(i) a computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or "<P>EQ meets this spirit of this if not the exact wording.  Probably would not be used it court due to the ambiguity of "computer progam" even though the item is embodied on the far end of the connection in a Verant server.<P>Fair use.<P>I cannot begin to repeat the large amount of interpretation of fair use in case law (not in the US Code itself).  Ebaying in game items, to my knowledge would not fall under any of the fair use actions permitted under this clause.<P>1) Very commercial.  Not for nonprofit.<BR>2) The nature of the copyrighted work is identical to the auction's use of it.<BR>3) I would say that each item is, as a whole, infringed.<BR>4) The effect on the market would be that individuals are selling something that VI could if they wanted to.  The actuale sale of that item by Verant is not necessary to show an impact on Verant from that sale.  (Been a few months since I've been in a law library so I'd have to find time to get you citations.)<P>texture<BR>DE druid<P>.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
