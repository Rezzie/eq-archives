&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've started playing EQ only a week ago (or, about 30 hours) and experimented with a monk, a shaman and a necromancer -- all of them Iksar (far more original than the other classes). Now, all three are at lvl 6 and 7, and it is about time to decide which of these characters I am going to play. I don't have the available time resources to really play more than on character, considering it took me almost 5 hours to get from 6 to 7!).<P>I have ruled out the necromancer because it is a far too popular class and the whole concept doesn't really appeal to me (same reasons why I did not play a necro in D2). That leaves the shaman and the monk. Due to my inexperience with the game, I haven't really looked for groups (hate to be a bother) and just tried to read boards and forunms, and experimented a bit. The Shaman seems very useful to groups, and other players in general (heals, buffs). The monk however is more fun ... I love the movements, and I like the speed at which the monk can kill blues, with almost no downtime. It also is a "cheap" character (as in: does not need spells, reagents, etc) which avoids frustration.<P>I do have some concerns, though - and that's the reason why I post here.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  So here goes ...<P>1) How well can a monk solo? I know just about no one in EQ (all my RL friends play UO, D2, etc), and I really dislike to act like a clueless idiot. Also, due to job I can't always play for many hours solid, or even promise I'll be around every day at the same day. I've learned that necromancers are the best solo class, however, this isn't an option. How well do monks solo compared to shamans?<P>2) Someone cast SoW on me, and I cannot deny that this was great and would have avoided many death if I had this constantly. How important is it for a monk once he is out of the one-digest levels? I see its usefulness if the monk is "pulling" for a group, but what about solo-ing?<P>3) Traveling ... monks can't even bind themselves and will have to look for a friendly spellcaster. How important is this? I already found it very frustrating when I died in the Lake of Ill Omen area and spawned in the FoB. In other words, how often do monks die? How about travel? (I haven't seen anything but the areas surrounding Cabilis, so don't know much about the actual size of EQ, in terms of "time required to get from A to B.) Keep in mind that as Iksar, I am KoS just about everywhere.)<P>4) Equipment ... how important is it? Apparently I will not be able to "twink" my characters, simply because there are no other characters ... no guildmates, etc. either. Besides, I started on the new, no-move server, so there really isn't much twinking going on for the time being. Is soloing impossible without superior equipment? Chances I'll get all the neat stuff I've read about are very slim ... but still, I like earning my equipment, and would hate to just "get" it from someone.<P>5) I live in Europe, so at times I have quite a bit of lag (I know, everyone does). How much does this affect the monk-style? And is it worse for shamans? Which suffers more from lag?<P>6) Lastly ... considering that this character would be the one I'd be playing for months to come, would you recommend a monk over a shaman? I trust your objective judgement, though all of you are monks! *g*<P>Thanks for your feedback in advance! If you have other input and insights, it is very much appreciated.<P>Thanks!<BR>-C.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll try to help ya a bit... <P>&gt;&gt;1) How well can a monk solo? How well do monks solo compared to shamans?<P>All casters can solo much better than pure fighters. Just remember that as you get higher in levels, it will be more and more important to group rather than solo.<P>&gt;&gt;2) How important is [sow] for a monk once he is out of the one-digest levels? I see its usefulness if the monk is "pulling" for a group, but what about solo-ing?<P>SoW is used by fighters when they want to escape a bad fight, usually. This won't be a problem for the monks, since they can just play dead and foll the monsters he was fighting. <P>&gt;&gt;3) Traveling ... monks can't even bind themselves and will have to look for a friendly spellcaster. How important is this? I already found it very frustrating when I died in the Lake of Ill Omen area and spawned in the FoB. In other words, how often do monks die? How about travel? <P>People die all the time (well *I* do  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">). It's usually easy to get bound in large cities. It's also very frustrating to not be able to do it yourself when you want to be bound in a remote place at odd hours  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Travel is going to be much faster with a shaman, but then again, it's not that hard to find a SoW for long walks.<P>&gt;&gt;4) Equipment ... how important is it? Is soloing impossible without superior equipment? <P>Equipment is important, but less for a monk than any other fighting class. Monks can basically fight naked, and are only able to carry LIGHT equipment (the heavier they are, the worse they fight)<P>&gt;&gt;5) I live in Europe, so at times I have quite a bit of lag (I know, everyone does). How much does this affect the monk-style? And is it worse for shamans? Which suffers more from lag?<P>Casters will suffer from the lag more than fighters will.<P>&gt;&gt;6) Lastly ... considering that this character would be the one I'd be playing for months to come, would you recommend a monk over a shaman? I trust your objective judgement, though all of you are monks! *g*<P>The best one is... the one ya pick yourself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>I personally find fighters more entertaining, because you're always on the move, fighting, pulling, and generally having fun. Fighters are also a bit frustrating, because it's hard to get anything done without casters. But casters are soooo boring  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> (nah, just kidding)<P>Mildaene, White Rose of Kelethin,<BR>lv 40 SCOUT of Kelethin,<BR>The Tribunal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Mildaene was mostly right, so I'll just key in on a couple things.<P>Monks can solo up to 50+, but it's not as efficient as grouping.  At level 17 you get a skill called feign death, and at level 18 you get one called instill doubt.<P>If you learn how to use these, you will be on your way to effective soloing.  And your most important skill, feign death, will be key to surviving where most would not.  I dare say that, as a monk myself, our class doesn't die much until later levels on large raids when we're pulling...but when we're pulling at later levels, we'll get a ressurection (raids don't happen without a cleric) if we die anyway, so it's of little consequence.<P>But to answer your question, Shamen solo better by far.<P>Monks are a fun class though, and there's much more to playing a monk than people think.<P>Binding is important, and can be a pain at times because casters aren't always willing to help out.  Once you learn how to survive, you shouldn't die much as a monk (I've got streaks of 10 levels without dying once...with a non-powerleveled, non-twinked monk), but it will happen.  So make sure that you do get bound (again, this doesn't apply to large raids).<P>Monks are easy to twink now.  Before kunark, there weren't any uber-monk weapons that you could be twinked with.  Now there are and it's depressing, but I'll live with it.  The stuff that monks need is very expensive though.  The weapons are the most pricey ones out there, but if you can't afford em, don't worry.  I had to go 1-50 before there were even rumors about monk 1hb weapons coming out.  It wasn't too hard.<P>As for my class recommendation?  I love monks.  I don't really play mine anymore because I've basically become bored with the game and have been trying to find something that I enjoy, but it's hard to do so anymore.  My advice to you, is go with whoever makes you have the most fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the Monk is the best, yet the harest and most time consuming. I assure you at lvl 60 the monk can hit 4 times and deal 75 hp a swing. Thats without kicking. I think the monk is great for soloing and Ive never seen a lvl 60 monk die except to another monk. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Monks are fun to watch. I am also sure they are fun to play. Ill get right ot the point. Unless you like doing alot of quests, you wont like a monk. Monk armor is very expensive, and since you can't weigh more than 14 lbs, it is difficult ot carry loot or money that, so you will prolly not be able to make large amounts in a short time. Therefore most of your armor you will have to do the quest yourself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ? :angry: ? I dont know. Second, monks dont really die all that often w/ feign death, so you wont really lose tons of xp from 8-17, because they are low level, but at 17 you will feel you re losing much time from ying and regaining the xp. They aren't bad at soloing, casters require alot of skill to solo. i.e. when to cast what spell when _____ happens. Also, Mellee can get boring, I have a 25 War, I am bored to sh*t. I sold all his stuff and made a wizzy. No excitement of new spells every 4 levels, and you dont get disciplines till much higher level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to disagree that casters are more effected by lag than melee are.  I don't get lagged often, but when I do I can't hit anything at all if it's moving.  I couldn't even kill a giant rat if I wanted to.  And if it's running away - forget it!  CHasing it so close that you run into it, but still getting the "You are too far" message, going further up in FRONT of the mob and getting the "you can't see enemy from here" message.<P>Impossible!<P>V  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I'll just put out any rumors that monks are an uber class, and as for quad punching for 75, that's with really good buffs (like avatar), and you will never ever punch all 4 times for 75 a pop.<P>Monks are good at soloing.  And they used to be fairly difficult to level simply because they weren't twinkable.  Now they're very twinkable and can be powerleveled easily (iksars have a huge exp penalty though, and humans have a small one).<P>Monks do die.  We do a lot of high level pulling...but we will almost always get an exp ress at high levels, especially on large raids.  In duels monks aren't the best either, but we will always put up a good show.<P>Yes we're fun to watch, yes, we're fun to play.  But monks are an acquired taste and a little arrogant in our belief that it takes a certain kind of person to be a good monk (good in deeds and in skill)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway, just play what will make you have fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lots of monks replying here.  NIce to see.  Howerver,  most failed to mention the solo-ability of the shaman.  Not picking on over the other here, I have on of each.<P>Here goes.  Monk=Damage machine.  However you are a fighter=downtime regaining health without a healer.  Mending and bind wounds does help tremendouly over a warriors bind wound.  The fact remains you will shine with a healer.  Hopefully a SHAMAN!<P>Shaman = Healer = Buffer = Debuffer = DoT/DD Caster = FIGHTER (not necessarily but way better than other healers/pure casters.<BR>How can you not love being able to BIND!!! and SOW!!!  EQ is huge.  Hi I am John Doe.  My turn ons are candle lit dinners and LONG walks in the park.  Fit your discription.  Point A to Point B can sometimes mean 15+ mins just running to point B.  Trust me you will love SOW.  "Hello my druid friend!  Can you spare a SOW please, for corpse retrieval?"  Get used to saying this if you pick any character other than - Pure Caster (bind) or Druid/Shaman (Bind + SOW).<P><BR>I am not saying Shaman = Better than monk.  I love both of my characters.  The above have stated the plus side to monks.  Thought I would give you my opinions on Shaman in EQ gaming.  My advice Play both.  Hey I do it! Throw a necro into the mix for me as well.  I have a Pally, Bard and also a Wizzie all retired.  (Exp penalty SUX for hybrids!  VERANT please remove exp penalty.)  Draw back to this is not leveling quite as fast as normal with friends you WILL make in the game.  But you want a soloer mainly.<P>If not both play the Shaman!  More versatility.  You will find out that binding yourself and SOW will help soloing tremendously, IMHO.<P>Either way Good Day to you and Happy Hunting!!! Good luck w/ both or either of your choices,  They will both treat you well, now and in future gaming.<P>Avalanche Mountainstryder  Shaman<BR>Rixari Sphinx              Monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>yeah, heh...I've sorta forgotten how crappy it was trying to run around before I had jboots...but I also remember when you could get a SoW for 1gp and a bind for the same, and how I was addicted to running fast from the moment I first had the spell cast on me (level 15  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> with my first char).  It's expensive these days, so being able to cast it yourself is a definite plus  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>I have never really leveled a shaman, but I do know that they complement monks extremely well, and can solo far better than a monk.<P>But like I said.

</FONT><HR>I play a monk, and I love it.<P>Monks soloing ability is better than most other melee classes because of Feign Death, and Mend.  If a high level warrior gets beaten up he'll have a good half hour downtime, a monks at most is about 10 minutes.<P>Casters can always solo better.  Shamans have a large variety of DoTs, DDs,etc.  These combined with Roots and Healing mean that they can take out way bigger monsters.<P>Lag... I'm a European player and it doesn't affect me very often.  If you get a lot of packet loss and high ping then your life as a melee character will be hell.  If the monster runs then zone, cos you just can't hit it if you've got a high ping.<P>Binding.  From 1 - 17 this will be an issue but you won't be travelling too far so be patient.  After you get feign death you become a lot more survivable, in fact you probably become the most survivable class in the game.<P>Monks are damage machines, but only at higher levels.  You can solo blues until very high levels but through the lower levels you'll feel very inadequite.  This gets better though.  Remember that that twinked warrior won't get a new sword for a while, whereas your fists just keep getting better and better.<P>Monks equipment.  This never used to be a big deal, and we are still very effective even when naked.  However with Kunark we were introduced to very powerful monk weapons.  At high levels these weapons are needed to remain competitive with other classes.  However they are very expensive.<BR>You can still do well without them.  The rule for monks is that we don't need a lot of equipment but the stuff we do need isn't cheap.<P>Hmm... what else.  You'll make friends with people in game.  This means that SoWs and Binds are fairly easy to get once you know people.  Also you'll usually find kind casters to bind you in most major cities.  SoW is nice but you can live without it.<P>Shamans are a good class but monks ooze style.  As for which class you should play, which one do you like the best?<P>Mord<P>PS:<BR>Had a shaman once, kept getting him killed because he couldn't melee.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Iksar monk is one of the best soloing characters available in my opinion.<P>People have pretty much covered your questions here, but i wanted to emphasize that the Iksar monk penalty is NOT very big.  It is the same penalty (40%) as all non-evil hybrids and bards.<P>Regeneration, infravision and forage are all very much worth the penalty if you are interested in soloing.  Did I mention you'll regen as many hit points while you're feigned as those foolish humans do while sitting?  Also, Kunark is a lot better place to progress as a soloing character.<P>And of course, it's the home of the super monk dungeon, Dalnir  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>They are both great classes.  I myself am a Monk of the 32nd Circle.<P>If you decide to play a Monk, I would really suggest getting a Shaman friend you can almost always play with, as we stated above.<P>As a 30 Monk paired with a 30 Shaman, I was able to make non-stop pulls out the front gate of the Sarnak Fortress in Lake of Ill Omen.  For at least 20 pulls in a row, the shaman was UNDER 50% mana.  Not to mention, if you become great at your class, you will be loved for fast, but safe pulls.<P>draugath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As I stated above being able to bind yourself will save you a lot of down time.  YES it is easy to find a bind in most cities.  What I am talking about is having to run back to corpse from those cities rather than at zone or a few feet away from camp in a safe spot.  Think of having to run to Unrest from Wizzie spires in Kelethin or from Dorf city.  Maybe running to Karanas from High Hold.  Those are not 2 min runs.  If you are a fighter or hybrid,  "Anyone around here w/ a spare SoW for corpse retrieval?"  I can remember all the times I saved a friend from death because I was bound so close and memmed heal real fast and went back to work  NAKED!!!  None of this, "On my way" BS.<P>NOTE:  Shaman is not a melee class. We can step in and do some damage YES.  But if you are jumping in when the mob you are soloing isn't at half Hp you are doing something wrong.  Lower levels are nice for shamans.  I can solo yellows fairly well.  Pull w/ Dot.  Root Stick another Dot and blast his a$$ w/ spirit DD.  Half Hp and still rooted?  Med! Root comes off?  Jump in there and pound his a$$ dead!!!<BR>At 19 you get three very good DoT all disease and one AoE.  This working and stacking w/ your lower level offense spells.  Anyone notice this sounds like a Necro user?  <P>Trust me you can't go wrong.  Do you die.  Oh yeah but the down time is so much nicer!!!  Plus extra money on side from donations for SoW and Bind is a BONUS!  (Note I said donation not payment)  <P>Either way good luck in your choice.  I am sure you have made it by now.  <P><BR>Avalanche Mountainwalker  Shaman<BR>Rixari Sphinx  Monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000133&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000133&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
