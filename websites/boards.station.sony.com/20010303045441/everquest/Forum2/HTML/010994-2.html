</FONT><HR>Well I just saw a interview on some Radar site, about scars.<P>It was of Brad and J. Butler. <P>Butler seems to be the producer of scars. So ask yourself Sunmoon, how much testing of the current game can Butler give, if he is producing a product due out in a few momnths.<P>Thats right none.<P>Live team my butt. They have one pool of people. They have to follow the money. Scars has to be a hit or else. Hence, with all the people currently playing and paying, why would they waste time and resoiurces fixing their current game?<P>Thats right the are not. They got one guy running around fixing cosmetics. To even think they are addressing class balance issues, as we speak, is well silly.<P>Granted, all you are asking for would take about 1 man day to fix. But they wont take time to test out our ideas. Course I play an SK, not a ranger. <BR>But I think the whole issue should be Hybrids post 50 and not just Rangers, that need to be looked at. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad.. I agree that my post sounded harsh and was not well thought out when I made it. As you know, I have continually been mature and polite up to this point. We have talked about these changes for som long and when it reached a crescendo, Jeff talked to me. Then... nothing...<P>Yes, Jeff talked to me on the phone.. but that was a full month ago. Meanwhile, much discussion took place over that time about the warrior and monks, but the Rangers seemed to be forgotten again.<P>Talk to Jeff, he has at least three emails in his box from me in that time and none of them even got a trite, "Still working on it..." response.<P>This is why I finally gave up. LAck of communication on your part. I have tried, time and time again to work with your team on this and I'm jsut tired of doign it. I am sorry if it seems I have given up on making the Ranger more viable in the end-game.<P>As you may know, in another post, I finally gave up the battle with Verant over the Ranger. When and if you can dedicate some resources to this, then I will happily collaborate with you and your tuning team with the experience of thousands of Rangers at my backing.<P>Until then, I will post no more on the issues and I truly wish you success in Velious.<P>Sunmoon Glademaster</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually, I think the Ranger class in general is special in that we have someone that nearly (not all, but nearly) every other Ranger looks to as our "Class Spokesperson."  I don't know of any other class that has this type of a person.<P>As for being shocked, Brad, after constant ignorance to our issues by the powers to be, wouldn't you finally throw your hands up in disgust?  In the least, hold a carrot out to us letting us know (via Sunmoon) that things ARE in the works.  Many of us feel that we're at the end of a short rope.  We have tried to have faith but that only goes so far.  Getting ripped to shreds on a nightly basis, being turned down by groups because we are experience hogs or because we just aren't useful in the group, being turned away from really gets us down after a while.  Sure, my friends let me in groups anyday.  I've now held a sucessful raid or two so I'm a desired group mate.  Not every Ranger has this luxary and if that's what it takes to make us attractive as group members, then Rangers are in big trouble.<P>Sure, Jeff did talk to Sunmoon and when that happened, we were uplifted for quite some time.  But now, nothing has been communicated recently giving us even a glimmer of hope.  How much longer will this continue?  You should feel lucky that one person is more-or-less identified as a class spokesperson.  At least then you know that communicating with that one person ensures that more of the masses (of that class) will get responses.  Sunmoon's notoriety spans servers.  What other person do you know of that brings their class together like Sunmoon has?<P>Maybe, you should create a new "guide like" position, one for each class.  Then, hold a giant election across all servers to vote for a class spokesperson.  At least then you would get reasonable REAL input about what the players feel are deficiencies in their class.  Set aside 30 minutes per week per class and have a talk with that class spokesperson to get input as to how the players are feeling and about real problems that the PLAYERS feel are occuring.  Maybe that's the answer to this whole customer service nightmare that you've created.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"We as a team are very busy working on Velious"<P>First of all that really upsets me. I paid for Kunark and pay every month so you can fix what I am paying for, not so you can make velious and charge me another 20 dollars.  When will the cycle end?

Im sure hes told not to do more, so I dont blame him, but we need more information.<P><BR>Brad: You need to tell your customers what you are working on more often.<P>If FA style quests are being worked on TELL US.<BR>That will end all "Is there an SK version of FA posts"<P>If FA is being upgraded to be commensurate with these new weapons. TELL US<BR>That will stop all the, "why is FA worse than 20 Kunark weapons" posts<P><BR>If Chardok is being looked into becuase no one ever goes there.

</FONT><HR>OMFG did brad say they are upgrading sky quest items?<P>LOL of course that is not what he meant.<P>He means they are implementing quests for other classes that require 50 people to complete over the span of months to obtain an item that is moderately better than something you can get in a few hours with 6 people killing frogloks.<P>Fixing dungeons?  INCONCEIVABLE?!  you mean chardok might be playable at some point in the future?!  wow that is great.  though i do think it is amusing to hear about a Sorceror of Di'Zok warped to the zone.  I do not find it amusing to have a Knight of Sathir and 2 decayed prisoners warp on me at the zone while i solo in karnors.  /petition just to get a laugh at what the GM would say...a gm tells you "Monsters in high level dungeons sometimes have very large agro ranges".  <BR>&lt;sarcasm&gt;Also of note, pathing in Mistmoore Castle and the Plane of Hate is a bit buggy, i'd have the live team jot that down on their to do list&lt;/sarcasm&gt;.<P>That would be so sweet if verant would actually invest some time and effort into the product WE ARE CURRENTLY PAYING FOR!!<P>CAN YOU NOT DO MORE THAN ONE THING AT A TIME?  <P>Let's PRIORITIZE things!<P>i'd say <BR>1. class balance (affects ALL players)<BR>2. fixing zones that are broken (Chardok)(affects many players)<BR>3. implementing quests that less than 1% of the player base can realistically even aspire to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ravenwolf,<P>Just pointing out a few things about your post that lack all the facts.<P>"1) Base AC from your armor"<BR>And Ranger armour has significantly less AC that the other hybrids.  In and of itself, understandable, but coupled with the much lower Defense Skill, its a double hit.  There is also the idea that the type of armour affects the damage you take for the same AC (plate vs. chain), equating to a third hit.  Our Tolans as exactly the same AC as Shaman and Rogue equipment.  Shaman have the same defense we do, and in the case of Rogues, they have 50+ more Defense points as well as much higher parry/riposte/dodge skills.<P>"2) Bonus AC from your agility"<BR>If you are relying on Agility to supplement your AC, or substituting armour class points for exta agility, you are mislead.  Agility only has a very minor effect on AC, and indiscernable affect on the defensive skills.<P>"3) Additional AC given by your buffs (And I suggest you run over to Everlore and look up our top "Skin Like" and "Thorncoat" line of spells, and add up how much extra AC those spells give you)"<BR>Only legitimate statement you made there was pointing out our "Coat" series of spells, as they are self only and stack with all the other buffs.  If you are relying on your "Skin" spells post 40... you are either solo, or, well, there is no excuse.  Anyway, point is, our "Skin" spells are pointless in a group, and any extra AC we get from any classes buffs that overwrite "Skin" are likewise applied to the rest of the group.<P>"4) All of the above modified by your level"<BR>Irrelevent for class to class comparision.  Same conditions apply for all classes.  However, does factor against mobs, but again, applies equally for all classes.<P>"5) Ability to avoid damage via parry, riposte, and Dodge. (I'm aware our caps here are lower than the other melee's. I theorise it's to make up for our higher inherent Agility VS. the other hybrids)"<BR>Funny thing here... prior to Kurnak, we had the highest skills in parry/riposte/dodge of any of the hybrids.  Post Kurnak, we saw 0 increases in any of these skills while the other hybrids saw substantial jumps.  We now have the worst skills of all the hybrids.  At one point, Rangers even got an increase to one (I no longer remember), as there was a date entry error, and Brad stated that we were supposed to have higher skills than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  Apparently no longer.<P><BR>Your second enumerated list:<P>"1) Most Rangers go for low-delay, high damage weapons to dual wield, forgoing 2H weapons completely."<BR>Most rangers I know carry two sets of weapons at least, and its usually a balance of maximum damage output while trying to not be on the top of the aggro list.  Sometimes its a 2H'er, sometimes its 2 1H'ers, sometimes a 1H with a shield.  Please quit with the "change your weapons" statements.  Just about every ranger I know post 40 is aware of this tactic that each new person to post this "idea" thinks is original.<P>"2) Alot of Rangers forego AC for stuff that gives them better stats."<BR>Then all the rangers I know must be unique.  None of them (granted, I don't know many rangers on my server less than 45th level) wear prom queen baubbles in day to day fights (exceptions of course for resistance gear when needed).<P>Can't really comment on points 3 and 4.  They seem to be accurate from my experiences.<P>Ladas Sindarin<BR>54th Feir'dal Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aradune, <P>I am not sure you completely grasp what is going on here. You and others from Verant keep falling back on a similar statement that you used here today. <P>&gt;&gt;With a subscriber base of 280k plus, I thought his call was a pretty good indicator that we're listening and considering issues<P>Now, this here does not pertain to Rangers, this pertains to the whole picture. As a whole, I believe most of us feel this game is great, lots of things to do, from tedious quests to dungeon crawls, to what have you. But, we rangers, till recently, have not been quiting the game, but simply our characters. Putting much more time into other characters that do not have this type of problem in the higher levels. I myself have a warrior that I am working on so that I can feel more useful to my Guild on raids, as a ranger, I am not a liability, but I nearly as useful as other classes are given the situation. <P>Right now, rangers are starting to completely give up, no longer even playing other accounts, but quiting all together, sunmoon included ( you will be missed, come back soon ) because of the total lack of response from verant on the issue. No respsonses, conflicting respsonses, and empty promises. This is the reason sunmoon and others are upset. Nothing visable is being done for us, we get no progress updates, no word that anything is being done or even being considered to be done. The archery upgrade, i'm sorry, while any bone you throw at us is to some degree welcomed, that is a useless upgrade.<P>Do this, I am sure with you sofisticated loggin systems, you can look at how many rangers are on during a given time, per server and as a whole. Take a look at the number of rangers in the post 50 game are actually playing, don't look at the subscriber totals of 280k. <P>Don't get me wrong, I don't think any rangers are going to complain that you are in the development stages of a new class defining weapon for all of the classes, but it won't do us any good if we can't live long enough to see it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It appears many of you have not being paying attention to this issue for the last six months.<P>Rangers have infrequently made posts to here (flameplay) and as a rule have been good natured about the whole issue.<P>Certain promises were made by Verant. The time frame of those promise, while not explicit, was certainly implicit.<P>The issue revolves around a large percentage (thought growing smaller by the day - many reported cancellations coming from Rangers on the 11th) of the player base's enjoyment of the game.<P>MANY people have chosen to be a Ranger because it was a Warrior hybrid that could not wear plate mail but could wield two weapons. This is consistent with the fantasy community's vision of a Ranger BEFORE Verant ever existed and is consistent with the Ranger before level 50. This is NOT consistent with what a Ranger is post 50.<P>It doesn't take a mathematician or a genius to figure this out.<P>Rangers total defensive caps STOP somewhere around 118 points SHORT of the other hybrid classes. <P>This doesn't take into account, lower AC, lower HP, lack of stun, class defining combat ability, etc...<P>I mean really, Rogues have the same Defense, Parry and Riposte cap as Warriors, and a HIGHER Dodge cap.

We were told that there were two entirely seperate teams involved and that nobody had been pulled from the live team to work on Kunark.  (We were also told that GZ couldn't look at the resist rates on Lullaby until he finished with Kunark spells, but we'll let that slide, since apparently the Kunark spells weren't the issue - there has still been no word on Lullaby).<P>Now we are told that the live team IS in fact being split and that the reason action isn't being taken on some issues is because the live team is working on SoV.  <P>I then raise the old cry - Why do you expect us to pay you more money to receive more content when you haven't fixed the old content yet?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There has been too much information supplied to VI describing the problems with Rangers for them to be able to deny there is a problem.  This leaves only 3 possibilities:<P>1.  Verant wants Rangers to have the defensive problems they now have post 50.  Meaning they do not want Rangers in close quarters melee past lvl 50.<P>2.  They are too arrogant to admit they were wrong in increasing all melle defense caps by 25% except for Rangers.<P>3.  They have not finished testing or developing a strategy to fix the problem.<P>I can think of no other answer to the current situation.<P>So Verant just pop in and say 1,2, or 3.  Thats all it takes.  Of course you may say to yourself I'm not gonna say anything, they weren't nice to me.  They talk like I'm a poopy head.<P>Well it has taken the mildly inflammatory tone of Sunmoon's post to get ANY response from Verant on the issue.

</FONT><HR>Let me get this straight.<P>You had the director of a major project for a company with 280k customers talking to you PERSONALLY on the phone and you blow up a few weeks later???<P>In the few direct emails I've had with Aradune and Abashi I have been direct- sometimes harsh- but I have always felt glad just to have that communication and expected no further communication.  They just don't have time to respond to everyone.<P>It is ironic that only 8 to 10 months ago everyone was making snide comments how rangers were the "favored" class since Aradune was known to play them yet now they conveniently forget that and talk about how Verant hates the class.<P>The ranger class has issues.  However- My ranger bud is capable of doing mass amounts of damage in combat without every needing healing.  She just does the same thing as casters and WAITS TEN to TWENTY SECONDS before joining the battle unless the mob will be stunned most the time.  That's all it takes folks.  <P>Casters can't Nuke from word go.  They have to wait.  Well- rangers can't "nuke" from word go right now.  It sucks- you are getting more aggro for about the same damage.  Verant is working on it but they are a big company and move like the titantic.  At least they didn't do something like take away Snare and Sow from you suddenly after nine months like the did with Monks and Feign Death.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nearly 3 months ago to the day I played my last full day as a ranger in Everquest, and Everquest itself. It's been this constant battle JUST for information and updates and not for thrown "bones" that we've really only been getting. We really desire recognition and ongoing communication with the developers of the game. These guys are definitely doing something right- http://horizonsvault.ign.com . This game is in development, and will probably be the next mmorpg I play, once Asheron's Call's playability tires for me. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>getaltmind-ninkumpoop<P>I tell you what. I won't tell you how to play a Trolling Flameing Necro and You don't tell me how to play my Ranger that I have over 100 days played on ok?<P>Try to &lt;r e a d&gt; the above post from a Ranger perspective. A vote was recently taken on Alakazams web page... html addy is:  http://everquest.allakhazam.com/<P>The old poll was something like 'What class is most in the need of Fixing?'...11910 people perticipated in that poll..25 percent thought Rangers needed the most fixing followed by Wizard with the next highest percent of 12...think about that number. Rangers won that poll by twice as much as the next class. Now there is a post this week that states,'What is the MOST powerfull Class?' 8881 people have voted so far and Necros have a 48 percent of the Vote so far with 4259 and Rangers have a whoping 1 percent of the vote on that board with 129. Anyway, go check those boards they are a DIRECT reflection of how 10000 people feel about this game.<P>I shall post here no farthur so if the Flaming Necro Troll above me wants to flame me back it shall fall on deaf ears..<P>Talan<BR>54th Resfinder<BR>'the rathe'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>talan---A poll on any site is truly innaccurate. Why? TOo many Dynamic IPS out there to throw it all out of wack...<P>I must say I am amused byt the Lower level Rangers that say they totally understand what is going on cause they experience it...heh-heh. yeah. Ok...<P>But anywho. Go ahead quit, give up...Quit the War. Hell, even Custer went down Fighting even though he had the odds against he, he fought till the end(glad he died though)...<P>Like Jimmy V said...Don't give up, never Give up...<P>If this is what you beleive in the FIGHT. DOn't be a quitter, Joan of Arc became a martyr because she went with her head held High, Not with her tail between her legs...So, if you want to be a Martyr, make them kill you. Don't kill yourself...<P>Oh, one other thing...Don't compare your class to another class, cause there is not other class like yours. State the facts as it pertains to your class VS Norrath, Not Your Class in relation to their class vs Norrath...all it does is create a sense of whining...<P>So, if you leave...So long! But if you stay FIGHT TILL THE END!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=010994&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=010994&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
