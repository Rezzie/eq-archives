</FONT><HR>People get all up in arms about a stupid little tetris clone and I begin to wonder why Verant tries to do anything to help improve the game.<P>Downtime is a neccesity in this game, although I hate waiting for the boat, or meditating, it is needed to balance the game, and these are the ideal times my mage/chanter plays gems. If I'm grouped with my buddy we both end up medding at the same time and get a little gems time in then as well (we have voice communication so it's a little easier), but in a group, I wouldn't even think about touching the game.<P>Needless to say, some people will, and instead of people getting in unfriendly, heated arguements of whether one was actually playing gems or not, please just add some simple tag like afk or lfg. It's a small change and should be more then easy enough. I already get upset when the puller yells 'inc' and the tank just sits there as the monk ends up tanking since the tank isn't 'paying attention' or elsewhere. I'd be even more upset if I had known they were actually there but just playing gems.<P>As for people complaining about this distraction being programmed versus the problems with the game...I hope it's tongue in cheek, if not, lighten up. First off, it's a tetris clone, noit very hard to program...next off, people are always asking for 'fun things' to be put in the game, and anytime one of these uneccessary but fun items actually goes in game, people complain about it.<BR>Verant just can't win, no matter what they do and no matter how small, there's a few thousand people bickering and whinning about it...gems is great to pass some solo downtime, if you don't like it don't play it. And as long as a gems icon or something appears near a players name (for the whole group issue), I think most complaing would subside.<P>"don't nerf my gems" :)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont quite understand why gems was picked as an in-game game. There should be something simple like chess and checkers that you can do /checker bob (or target) and play a friend at gates of city while goofing off and buffing newbies. Perhaps gaming houses in the cities to relieve people of there hard earned plat? This could make the cities a really happening place. Bars would actually be FUN to visit and get drunk and lose some money! Have it where you can put bets on private matches as well somehow. THis is a good idea that can be applied to the game. One arm bandit and all. Everybody knows the dealer always wins anyway! As for games you play while sitting and medding give us solitare or something.

</FONT><HR>Gems is a nice diversion when you're on a boat to someplace or medding in a very safe spot. But, if you're playing and you get attacked, you have to quit out of the game and then either defend yourself or retreat. Would be nice if Gems could be turned off by hitting ESC or something like that. <P>It amazes me that anyone would actually ask for a rez for this though. <P>Jondular Montreiul<BR>Wizard 55th Level<BR>Foundation Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Slayer, <BR>if you are so upset over how Verant chooses to allocate development for their game, then develop a game yourself.  With those 20 years of experience you should be able to do infinately better than the large staff of experienced people at Verant.  After all, one person programming this one little game must have taken so much away from all the other issues Verant is looking at..  IT'S THEIR GAME!  GET OVER IT!  ..  If you don't like it then DON'T pay $10 a month..  This is not a hard concept to grasp..  Just because you put how ever many hours into playing your character does not mean that Verant HAS to make you happy.  If all the people that keep complaining they are going to quit would just quit, then EQ would be a much happier place..  <P>And yes GEMs was on Test..<P>I'm sure the two minutes it took Absor to post this little response took so much away from his other duties..  especially since he is a project lead now..  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't mind gems, I played it for about 3 minutes and found it quite boring so I don't use it. But really when you have to make games inside other games, because your game is boring should't that tell you something? I understand it's use on slow group organization ie raids, or boat rides. But just a simple act as medding shouldn't take so long as to bore you out of your mind. mana regen should go about double it's current speed, in response  I would understand buffing up mob's HP 15% or so</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hang on a sec, if are going to add a [Gems] tag, make one [Book] - I'm reading a book while waiting, [TV] - same as book, [Dinner], [Other Computer]<P>Ummm personally it is no ones business what I am doing during down time, Gems is just another thing I could be doing while waiting for something to get started.  Letting a group leader disable Gems is just about the same as someone taking a book out of my hand....too much big brother.  People will either learn when to and when not to play gems, just like they know that they need to constantly look up when they have thier nose in a book.   OTOH [Gems] could be an optional tag that people could put up but no way make it a no choice thing.  Maybe I am waiting for a pickup at a ring and I don't want to be bothered, I make go AFK and play Gems until the rides get to me.<P>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gems is a cute little game and I think it was nice of Verant to put it in.  It cracks me up to hear people complain because it is such a simple game, when here you are sitting in the middle of one of the most complex MMORPG's around and YOUR CHARACTER in the game is playing Gems and you are complaining about what a silly game it is!  Hello????<P>I don't think there should be a tag above someone's head that says &lt;GEMS&gt;.  IF someone in your group is playing Gems, and they should be healing instead, then stop grouping with them!  Find someone more responsible.  I play Gems when I'm grouping in a very safe area and when I and my party members are all medding/sitting and healing.  I don't play gems when I'm medding during combat to keep the heals flowing.  When I med during combat I'm watching the groups health stats and deciding whether I want to rearrange what spells I have active.  Instead of playing Gems I'm playing Everquest.  <P>So if your casters can't learn to restrict Gems to safe downtime then replace them.  But I don't want to have to see even more stuff above people's heads... Geez, with a long name, and a long surname, and a long guildname, and then AFK or Gems, and then you walk into a crowded area like the N RO tunnel in EC and I feel like I'm reading an E-book!<P>Instead, what should happen is that if someone dies because they were playing Gems there should be a zone-wide message that everyone can see that says, "So-and-so was slain because he was playing Gems instead of Everquest!"<P>Ok, so the last thing won't happen, but it would be funny if it did.  It reminds me of a silly MUD that I was on, where in one quest you had to flush yourself down a toilet to get into the sewers.  You knew who was doing the quest because when you flushed yourself down the toilet a MUD-wide message was displayed that said, "Ewwww... So-and-so just flushed themselves down a toilet!!!".  Likewise there were a couple of really tough monsters on there, and when you attacked them they would broadcast a MUD-wide message like "How dare you attack me, So-and-so!"  and if they beat you, they would broadcast another MUD-wide message like "Big Monster has just laid the smack-down on So-and-So" and everyone knew that you just died. Not that exact message but something along those lines, it was pretty funny.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, since people seem to not want tags, how about a message like "soandso begins to cast a spell" type message for the group only.  This would make it so that just your group was aware that you were playing and wouldn't hinder you from getting a group if you were playing while waiting.  And as to the people that say that they can play while medding or between pulls, what class and level are you?  If you are a melee type or a 35+ caster you can see what is going on.  But low level casters need to read the text box and hear the sounds (and we all know how flucky the sounds are).  I think it is more of a mid teen to low thirtys caster issue than a for the rest.<P>Just my view.<P>Suzie</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Downtime, particularly of the EverSit variety, is not necessary to a balanced game.  Don't even try that one on me.  And the MOST I've EVER had to sit in other games is usually 2-3 minutes per 10-20 minutes played.  In Everquest the most efficient pattern of play, especially for casters, is 10-20 minutes sitting per 2-3 minutes of play.<P>Is it addictive?  Yes.  Is it fun?  Somewhat. Getting new levels, equipment, skills, etc. is fun, sitting arguably isn't fun at all.  Is gems the cure for sitting?  I think not.  At best it is a diversion from the carefully constructed, immersive game environment that used to be EQ (yes, people shouting about gems is really, really annoying if you're just roleplaying.)  At worst it is intended to distract us from the failures of the game implementors to complete their Vision (tm)--it is abdication of leadership in finishing the race they have begun.<P>I hope that the competitors don't misread the current excitement about /gems.  I would hate for someone like EA (UO) or Mythos (Dark Camelot) to believe their games will be superior if they just have better minigames.<P>But in closing I do give credit to Verant for this:  lacking something better to do, you found a way to stir up controversy.  Too bad it isn't a secret hacker network for breaking into banks or something powered by gems players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Now, I'm sure there are less teams than I have above, but when it comes to allocation of resources, that's probably pretty close to the "areas" of development.<P>The only true PROGRAMMING involves the UI changes, Server Team, and AI Teams...

</FONT><HR>I read these boards every so often, and the one thing that never ceases to amaze me is how much some people like to b**** about the smallest thing.  <P>It makes me wonder how many people aren't happy unless they're b*****ing about something.  How many are completely entranced by the sound of their own voice, or by the sight of their own words.  Some people complain just for the sake of complaining.<P>And this time, it's about GEMS, of all things.  I think some people pay $10 a month just to b****, and not to play the game.  <P>Spare time implies just that.  SPARE TIME.  You come in at 8 in the morning, work until 5 (unless you're lucky and have a shorter day), and that is deemed WORK.  Anything OTHER that is "SPARE TIME".  Get it?  It's spare.  Meaning that it isn't something that you have to do.  Meaning you should be able to do things, at your own will.  <P>Why is that such a hard concept to understand?<P>As for all of the repetition about adding an AFK flag, or what have you, if you are playing gems, NO!  As was mentioned previously, some people read a book, some watch television, yet these are not broadcast in most instances.  I've never been in a group where someone was talking about what was happening on Survivor, and what Monica did to Chandler on "Friends".  For all of you wanting to know who is playing gems while being in a group, you must be going crazy wondering what else they're doing that you have no idea about. <P>I don't feel as though I have to tell everyone in my group what I am doing at any given moment, as long as it is not taking away from my paying attention to what indeed is happening.  If I want to read a book, I'll read a book.  If I want to watch TV, I'll watch TV.  If I want to sit and pick crust out from between my toes, well, damnit, I'll do that too.  If I want to play GEMS, then I'll play GEMS.<P>The bottom line is this:  If you want to know if your group members are playing GEMS, *ASK* them.  Some have no problem playing gems, and getting ready for a battle when the time comes.  The ones that do have a problem will make it apparent, and you can deal with them as is necessary.  Find someone else.  Find someone that can do more than one thing at a time.  Ask on the group channel if anyone is playing GEMS..  If not, no harm, no foul.  If so, make sure they can still pay attention to the matters at hand.  If not, find someone else.<P>Either deal with the situation, or go play a board game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, put in the AFK flag.  But why stop there?  Why not have everyone install webcams, and link them through EQ so that at any given moment, everyone in your group can see what you are doing to make sure that you are paying attention.<P>There's enough big brother stuff going on WITHOUT trying to get it implemented in the game.  If I want someone to know what I'm doing, I'll tell them, not the game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Azural...you seem to have problems...<P>Deep paranoia. Try to get some psychiatric help. Its available.<P>If an &lt;afk&gt; flag goes up, people who are depending on you will know that you aren't playing EQ right now, you are playing gems or away from your computer. That's all. <P>Why are you so against that?
