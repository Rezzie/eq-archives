Im getting pretty tired of people attacking them greens. anyway as you said about CB and orcs, so what if you got good faction with them, WHERES YOU ORC LANGUAGE? huh.. WHY SHOULD AN ORC CARE FOR YOU? lol your a worst case. I dident read all your junk. I worte halfway that was more enough for me to PUKE all over the places. Dude your way a fatasy world should be is up in the skys, so if you dont like it here, GET LOST. Verant designed their own world as they wanted it.

</FONT><HR>In case you didn't know darkbanshee there is an alliance between the dark elves and the crushbone orcs.  It's called ROLEPLAYING!  <P>I agree with the orginal post, play nice rules suck.  EQ PVP sucks.  They ask us how to fix things and dozens of players make good suggestions so instead of even responding to them they delete the freaking pvp server discussion forum.  <P>I've had it.  After 6 months of playing blue servers I came to VZ and found new life and excitement in this game.  I enjoyed the role playing I saw.  I like the good vs evil theme and support cross-teaming of the good races but I also like that some people are strictly their team only.  It adds politics and excitement and creates a dynamic environment.<P>Your stupid darkbanshee.  You should just go play blue servers.  The whole idea of pvp role-playing is to attack when you have the greatest advantage.  Dark elves are allied with crushbone orcs, who the hell cares that you can't speak orc. Play nice rules suck on pvp servers.  What a bunch of freaking panzies.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>O yea, so theres lots of Roleplaying, ah, then please tell me your race. As a elf, good one. I dont see that much roleplaying, most just sit around whineing when gnomes attack, and when someone finaly attacks, no one assists. Bah, elfs stick together like jam and water. No one is roleplaying, such a shame, many of the guilds are striclty pking guilds, bah, come on. You may think Play nice rules suck, but I dont. I personaly think its giveing a better eenviroment for playing. And I agree that its crap they removed PvP discussion forum, so we have to stick with this VZ board, wich no one acuatly reads I guess. Im in for Viva la Roleplaying, Im sorry I just dont see much of it. Ok so if the orcs do have a pact with the Dark Elfs, ok they could help a stranded Dark Elf, but the game dosent support that sorry, so getting train after train on you so you lose lvs is the wrong way. Had they implented a feature so you as a Dark Elf, maybe Warriors only, could ask the orcs for help, ok I could live with that. But the way people is exploiting as it is now, its not good. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>alright, I have plenty of time to read and post.  Now, first, I hate to see people twinking and going about naked and pking.  I will make enough characters and hire people to kill those people I find that do so.  If you want to fight people, use the dumb play nice rules to your advantage.  You can only get warned if it was meant to cause a loss of experience.  Even if it wasn't, you MUST play SMART, not stupidly, like causing trains on people then killing them(I know no one does, but as an example).  There are plenty of bugs you can use, but I will find you, report you, then kill you any time I can, without getting warnings.  USE YOUR HEAD!<BR>allies are only in the form of pets and players.  Everyone else does not attack when you want them to ALL THE TIME.  I don't like people that rip other peoples opinions up, Darkbanshee is a good roleplayer, at least from other posts.  I am a dark elf, I use what I can, but NPCs are only usable by me when they are charmed...  hehe.<P>I have joined guilds that are dedicated to roleplaying, but they all think that you need to be high levels in order to roleplay well.  I really dislike that.  Rallos Zek has more of a rpg base, since it is not teams, but all vs all.  And only 4 lvls between, os you actually have a chance at losing if you are the max.  At least until the higher levels, anyway.  The lower levels get screwed by the higher levels on Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek, there is little you can do.<P>I hate camping creatures.  The only problem I've found is that there are faction hits I take for killing any players, this is terrible to have in this game, since there are quests that you could virtually never get to unless you wasted lots of time finding something to do to make them like you.  I am an enchanter, so I should have the highest chance of doing almost any quest, right? or maybe sometimes its a bit too powerful, heh...  <P>the thing that irks me most is that statement that Hazzy doesn't care if he has to buy everquest several times.  They ban the credit card number and the serial number of everquest, silly.  And then Kunark comes out.  Don't you dare think they put all this stuff in for those twinks, I want more places to explore, Norrath is too easily navigated and explored, the quests are not.  I wish they'd put all those programmers on the enchanter request for item enchanting instead of kunark, heck, they haven't even finished the original product of everquest before the expansion!  oh well, maybe they'll get their act together</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum37&number=37&thisthread=000161&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum37&number=37&thisthread=000161&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
