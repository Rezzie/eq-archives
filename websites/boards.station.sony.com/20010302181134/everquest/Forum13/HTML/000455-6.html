</FONT><HR>The more ability we get to tank, the less need would there be for a warrior.  Have many rogue friends that prefer me in their groups because I can taunt stuff off them a warrior can't... As we speak I'm in a group with a 60 warrior, myself 60 and a 55 rogue.. and the rogue has more damage on him than anyone.  Rogues may be behind the mob the majority of their life, but they aren't all the time.  Even with warrior/rogue groups, if the mob turns and faces the rogue at any time, that lessens the chance for them to backstab when it pops.  It would be nice to see a damage increase for the monk to be greater than that of a warrior, but not a rogue that is behind the mob..otherwise to ask for more is plain selfish.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see something along the line of having FD reduce agro. For example have it so that when you are FD you lose 'hate points' for FDing and more the longer you are down at an ever increasing rate. Even have it so that you are completely wiped off the list after say a minute. <BR>Of course they would also have to fix FD so that the mob immediately stops beating on you once you FD since that doesn't work very well right now. <BR>This change would still leave FD pulling nerfed as VI wants it, would be a great way to manage agro in large encounters, and would prevent the need to /q out of the game to clear agro all in one 'fix'. <BR>I'm sure it would take some time to tweak how much agro is lost and how quickly while FD, but as long as it got the job done (read: prevents me from getting killed) then I'm all for it.<P>Combine this with SOME form of damage upgrade to put monks between warrriors and rogues for damage (not necessarily halfway between, maybe 20% more than warriors) and I'd be a very happy monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>These are just some thoughts on gameplay issues:<P>Hate list:<BR>Monks go up quickly on the hate list because of the damage that they do.  This is reasonable.  Don't you get mad when someone hurts you a lot?  How does this relate to warriors though?  Warriors increase hate by 2 major methods, damage and the taunt skill.  The taunt method deals no damage.  In my view, the fair and correct way to balance this is to choose the hate generated by taunts to be slightly more than the difference desired between an average monk's damage output and an average warrior's damage output.  Trying to tweak the maximum damage output of a class is silly, due to the wide range of weapons available.  Part of the *skill* of playing a monk or a rogue is knowing how much damage you can dish out before whatever you're fighting turns on you.  It only makes sense that an opponent would attack the person who is dealing the most damage.  Say, for example, that the desired monk damage output should be 25% more than that of a warrior.  With the warrior's taunt then set to increase hate at a rate of 25% of his damage output, the total hate generated for that warrior would be 125% times his damage.  So if the warrior deals 400 dmg/min, the hate towards him increases as if he were dealing 500 dmg/min.  The monk can then deal up to 500 dmg/min without causing the opponent to attack him.  In this way, the monk outdamages the warrior, but is kept from dealing an unbalanced amount of damage.  Monks, along with every other class, DO have a way of controlling hate: their damage.  That is part of the skill and fun of playing a fighter class.  Charging into combat and doing as much damage as you possibly can is a sure way to get yourself killed, and that's as it should be.  The game becomes boring and pointless if all you do in combat is autoattack and push all your special attack buttons as fast as you can.  The same thing applies to rogues, except that their evade ability should reduce hate according to their desired damage output, so that they can deal 600 dmg/min while only increasing hate at a rate of 500 dmg/min.<P>Monk's role as damage dealers:<BR>See above.<P>Resistances:<BR>As monks hone their bodies and minds with discipline and training, it only seems right that they should receive some natural resistance bonuses.  As it is, with their small number of HP's and lack of equipment with resistance bonuses, they are super-susceptible to any casters.  This is one aspect that I believe was overlooked in the whole HP vs AC+dodge/block scheme.  In an effort to improve the depth of the game (see below), perhaps resistance bonuses based on wisdom could be introduced.  This would represent techniques of dealing with the elements through knowledge and experience.<P>Multi-dimensional gameplay:<BR>My most prominent concern is increasing the dimension of the game.  For monks, I believe this means balancing *within the class* the effects of the different character statistics.  Check just about any character creation guide and it says to do one thing: put all your points into strength.  This is about as boring as it gets.  Most monks I know would gladly give up their +7 AGI/+7 DEX choker for a +7 STR +7 INT necklace.  There's also stamina.  Why are the benefits of STA, DEX, and AGI so meager compared to the benefits of STR?  Shouldn't an agile, dexterous monk be able to whoop a strong, clumsy monk anyday?  Shouldn't a sturdily-built monk be able to take the extra damage dealt by a strong monk?  What's the use of the character creation screen if all you do is put all your points into STR for a fighter, INT for a caster, or WIS for a priest?  That just makes for a one-dimensional game.  I would like to see more balance between the character stats themselves.<P>Thanks for the time spent listening and the place provided to voice these opinions.<P>Enlyth Infinitum<BR>The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll probably get beaten senseless for this but you all realize the fists have a great ratio right?  Look at some of the uber weapons out there, Lamentation for instance.  Ratio on that is 2.1.  Our fists at lvl 60 are ratio 1.85.  Sure it would be great to do more damage, sure it would also be great to have a faster delay.  But don't go flaming because you think our fists suck so bad when in reality the don't.  Well I'm done sealing my fate with the monk community, I'll go burn myself now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>no, you're not sealing your fate, you just don't realize how damage works.<P>Sure, for the offhand 14/26 isn't too shabby (level 60 human monk fists).  A 60 monk will prolly have something better by then, but it's still not bad.<P>With your primary hand, however, there is a damage bonus, which makes low delay weapons more desireable than middle of the line weapons that have say 26 delay.  Because the damage bonus is the same for all one hand weapons depending on your level, lower delay weapons benefit more.<P>so if you take your 14/26 weapon, and make it 7/13 weapon (same ratio), the 7/13 weapons will own the 14/26 weapon in the primary hand, but they are equal in the offhand.  See what I'm sayin?<P>So the difference between 14 and 26 is 12.  the difference between 9 and 19 is 10.  With the level 60 damage bonus, the ratio for lammies is better than our fists in the primary hand.<P>and lastly, I don't know what the bonuses are for all levels, and this is just a really crude representation of how it works.  I'll probably get torn apart for it, but I'm just trying to show why 14/26 is no better than 9/19.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, there have been mamy good suggestions given in the quest to balance monks and restore our actual functionality to that of the "vision"(tm) that had been initially given. Namely, the masters of melee damage. I will not cry for defensive improvements but I will say that our ability to significantly out damage other classes in melee seems to have gone the way of the dinosaur. We no longer have any distinct advantage in this area anymore especially with the release of SOV and all those lovely 1hd slash hi dmg low delay weapons, some with additional damage procs. My 2cp to help our situation in this arena is "give us hand to hand critical hits at the same level the other classes get thiers". It makes alot of sense that a monk "masters of the martial arts" would be able to target those areas of the body to inflict maximum damage. And as our hand to hand damage per hit is about the same as a low to fair end warrior weapon, I really don't see the amount of damage a crit from a punh to be anywhere near unbalancing. It's not asking for too much and I think the impact it would make in the course of a fight would make a very satisfactory difference. And by all means, give the Higher level monks innate stun chances, this also makes more than a little sense especially when you take a look at how most of us perceives what a monk is supposed to be.<P>Humbly,<P>Chen Ming<BR>Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A friend of mine on the Bristlebane server told me how monks pull for groups in the high level game.<P>The monk scouts out a MoB, the monk agros the MoB and possibly other nearby MoBs.  If only one MoB agros, the monk brings it to the group and they kill it.  If a mob of MoBs agros, the monk brings the MoBs just outside of agro range for the group and FDs.  When the MoBs start to train off, if FD is successful, another member of the group will come to agro the MoB and take it to the group while the monk remains FD untill the party is ready for another fight.<P>This describes an entirely noncombat scenario for a monk that is restricted to pulling.  If this is what the monk is reduced to at the highlevel game, then what's the use of having combat skills at all?  As a monk, I want to be more than just MoB bait.  I want to fight too and be a contributing member in that fight.  Monks are becomming know as train conductors even at the upper mid level ranges.  Something needs to be done.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let's see.  I agree with any effort to raise damage for the monk.  But I think the monk realistic way to do so is to have Dex have a noticability on one ability to hit.  Then the monk will do more damage on the basis of more connection.  He still may have quite a few 1's and 2's but that isn't exactly unrealistic from a hand to hand perspective.  I also like the idea of unlinking strike and kick attacks.  Dex should also affect the success of these attacks with a minimum damage being set by ones's skill level and dex and str.<P>Some others may not care about our defenses but I for one do.  If we are below our weight limit, our natural AC bonus should be much greater as based on our AGI.<P>In addition, dodge, block and reposte need to be raised to work better.  I suggest that the formula for maxing them out per level should be raised by one level (i.e. [level+2]*5) and perhaps raise the caps a bit.  This, and an increased natural ac should put us better in the game.<P>I do not think this would unbalance us if done in a way that does balance out.  Right now, monks do not work as advertized.  Their defensive skills do not make up for their bad pick of armour, so we get pummeled.<P>I have actually been rejected from groups as the cleric didn't want to have to spend all his mana healing me because I was a monk!!!!<P><BR>Magic resistances need to be addressed in some way, I am tired of being ripped apart by ultra green casters.<P>Some form of ability to stun or knock back is also needed so we can stand a chance against casts as well.<P>And FD needs to be debugged and some means of having it wipe or lower agro put into effect.<P>It just is not right that a mob on the other side of the zone will simply stop whatever he is doing now and psychicly realize that the monk he was fighting, that he thought had died, was really alive and had just gotten up.  The idea is absurd.  Do what ya got to do, but fix it.  I never understood what the big deal was about stopping FD pulling anyway.  If I had the ability in RL in grammar school, I definitely would have fought only one bully at a time!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>As for other points mentioned, several should be addressed,  CF, treant fist, looks, etc.  But down to brass tacks, the above is what shall fix us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor.<P>I would like to reiterate what most monks want. While you have outlined various things such as chain special attacks, perhaps an offhand damage bonus, please be aware of the thinking behind these and similar suggestions.<P>Monks want to do more damage. Warriors do the same damage at level 60, due to the similarity of weapons and skill caps. Rogues do substantially more.<P>Warriors can taunt, making them a viable (indeed the best) tank. Monks and rogues cannot.<P>Warriors have HP's to put everyone to shame, and AC equipment to match. All three classes have the same defense skill, the other basis for AC.<P>Monks need to be doing substantially more damage than warriors, so that they are approaching that of rogues.<P>You or your predecesor have stated that FD pulling is not an encouraged idea, and the MOB AI in velious has made that true.<P>Monks don't get spells, they don't get AC better than any other melee class bar rangers, they don't get taunt so they can tank. Monks are designed to do damage: make the premise of the class a reality.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fact 1 - Warriors are tanking masters (defense)<BR>Fact 2 - Rogues are damage masters (offense)<P>These are undeniable facts.  This is what VI wants.  But, this does not make them masters of melee combat? Nope.  If you've taken any Martial Arts form, you'll realize that defensive and offensive skills go hand in hand.  That's why I'm proposing the percentage increase in dodge and riposte (or even an additional skill for defensive purposes).  Monks should rarely get hit in the higher levels.<P>What I want for monks...<P>1. Minimal damage for flying kick set.<BR>2. Either a percentage increase for dodge and riposte or an additional skill for defense.<BR>3. Minimal damage for Thunderkick<P>Now with a the defensive increases, monk still won't be able to out-tank a Warrior, Paladin or SK because of Taunt (If VI fixes it), monks don't have anyway to resist magic attacks and no way to stun.  But, any physical damage shouldn't be able to touch us (maybe a few will get through).  By level 60 monk should almost never get hit by melee attack damage, but get toasted by the casters.<P>Monks won't be the best tanks you can get because of a lack of stunning ability, magic resistance and taunt.  But in melee combat... monks should RULE!  Think it of guys, the idea will grow on ya.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I agree that hand to hand should be a viable option to weapons, the use of weapons by monks (okay, martial artists) is well established. Nunchaku. Staves. Bo sticks. Swords (tai chi, for example  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a good example. Or any Jackie Chan movie. Lots of hand to hand, sure, but lots of weapon use when available.<BR>I think top h2h and top weapons should do roughly the same damage (weapons probably need a small edge to balance the weight, but not too terribly much). What that damage should be is a different question, depending on where monks, warriors, rogues, etc. fall in the offense/defense curve.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is a quote from another post series.<P>Comparing monks to warriors only spells trouble. Warriors always have and always should out melee monks, period. Monks have their place though. They can feign death (a skill VERY coveted by everyone!). If you want your place in a group, you stay back and tank for a second and let everyone get a head start on the mob when the group is    running. And then you feign death to save your own hide. I have been in a group where a monk did this and he saved us all. Monks also can melee and do decent damage in the "off season", so they aren't useless when not running. There you have it. Monks have their place. Enough said.<P>Senadaar Arithuin<BR>35 Cleric<BR>Druzzil Ro<P>Ok, so a monks role is to lie on the ground until things go bad, then stand up get everything's attention while the rest of the group breaks for zone.  Then feign again.  Monks shouldn't do damage, they shouldn't take damage, they should just feign death.  <P>Mind you this could sound too much like a troll, but then again, I've been in high level groups.  Anyone who has pulled hate, knows that that is a far too true description of monk's role.  I read a lot of posts, especially on the warrior thread that says warriors are the masters of toe to toe damage and tanking.  I just want to know what a monk is there for, where does a monk fit in the vision.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I figure that if 5% of the monks get them well that may be a little high.<BR>Please also look into the drop rate of gear droping in the planes very little seems to be droping for monks these days I havent Looted the last 5 trips to fear. nothing droped I could use and i have never seen the tunic drop, and cresent pants i think are better than shiverback any way dont even wear mine in favor of the latter, please look into stats for the gear we have to die as many times as other classes to get it make it worth it.<BR>AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST REMEMBER THIS IS A FANTISY GAME YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES FOR THE BETTER WITH OUT KILLING ANY ONE. MAKE IT FUN TO PLAY AGAIN NOT A PAIN OF SITTING IN A ZONE FOR 60 MIN LOOKING FOR A GROUP.<BR>Ok that was just my thoughts on the matter and i proberly forgot a few. <BR>the big one SHOW SOME PROGRESS.<P><BR>Out here <BR>Ossler</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>New way of looking at existing skill and totally new ability.<P>First the new skill, when I used to play AD&D which this game is based on, the Monk character had a walk on water ability. This skill would also be great when walking into a room like in befallen when you fall through a hole, using the Walk on Water ( If it worked ) would be great, also used for crossing rivers and lava pools.<P>Next an existing skill "Sneak" I have not seen any mention of this ability, anyone use it? A monk should be fasst and quiet in my book, the sneak should be used to sneak up on someone and inflict a hit? Or am I missing something, why not let us monk get a back attack in using sneak before the enemy realises? When ever I sneak and attack from behind the enemy instantly hits me, how this is possible when they are facing the other way I have no idea.<BR>Again Monks should be fast and silent in my books.<P>Thanks for reading, please give us a walk on water skill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Firstly Mrmoo, I did find your comments a little rude, we are discussing a "Talk list" here so any ideas are important, ANY unique skill would go toward balancing an already unbalanced character, read my post, I never claimed adding this skill would balance it, ITS JUST AN IDEA.<BR>Secondly mrmoo this is not a discussion about VISION so stop having a go at people for this, start a new thread or direct your concerns to VERANT.<BR>Good Points EQMascot<BR>Good points Malkith ( 1st post ).<BR>Malkith 2nd post, again I did not say this was AD&D I said it was based on that game.<P>To conclude, I told agree there should be a vision, but this is a talk list from Absor, at least something is being done, now try and be more contructive in your comments.<BR>Thankyou</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Silent_Hand,<BR>I did not tell you off.  If I had, I would not be concerned about sounding rude.  The entire history of this board is derived from a discussion on class balancing.  This board is a result of those discussions.  The previous board explicitly stated that Verant did NOT want to turn this into a "Wish List".  In addition, we were asked to give explicit reasons for our suggestions and how they would bring balance to the game.  Since the list is still open, I think their previous statements are still valid.  You can post whatever you like.  If you think walking on water will help balance the class, that is great.  But I suspect that Verant will want to know why they should give this ability to monks.<BR>I apologize for huting your feelings.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Vision, the most important thing when trying to balance classes is having a clear idea of where it is suposed to be.  Anyone notice how often the monk class is left out by other classes in class discussion threads?  I think this is because the monk has no vision and hasn't for so long that people easily forget about the class that really brings little to a group that another class can't do better.  You don't hear anyone saying "monks do too much damage, bring us up to their level or close to, or they tank too well or they have too many hitpoints or they pull too well or anything of the sort.  Recently we were striped of one of the few things that made us special at 51, being the only class that could bandage to 70% at that level, in an essense it is nothing too special, but it was one of those few things i could contribute to a group to help reduce down time that was unique to monks, not any more.  <P>So what is the vision for monks, i and many monks have posted for months asking this to be clarified so that at least we can be balanced in light of the vision.<P>If monks are suposed to be warriors who do grossly equivilant damage yet give up heavy armor and hitpoints and taunt for the ability to feign death, then this is not very balanced.  In order to balance this, monks by chosing not to wear armor should have skill advantages to defense, which currently they do not.  They should have the ability to avoid damage versus absorb damage, we should have parry added to our list of skills since we have to use weapons to compete with warriors on the basis of damage.  Also since we pay so heavily for feign death in hp and in armor, it should at least work correctly.  Monks should also get the taunt skill if they are suposed to tank.<P>If monks are suposed to be more damaging than warriors and less damaging than rogues, and the lack of hp and heavy armor to compensate for this factor, as well as grossly equal defensive skills, then we need to in fact do more damage than a warrior, we need our damage tables fixed so that even using the same weapons we outdamage a warrior by a significant degree.  If we are outdamaging warriors, then we need some way to lose the mob's attention once it focus's on us (ie fix feign death and perhaps some sort of psudo evade (fd takes us out of combat, this isn't really effective way to moderate damage) or else we need a boost to defensive skills since we will invariably be the focus of the mob's attention.<P>If monks are suposed to be dungeon pullers (rangers always will be better outdoors), and give up hit points and heavy armor to be able to pull better than a warrior, then we need to have skills that justify this, feign death should be accepted as a tool for this and fixed, we should also get a boost to running speed so that we can actually live long enough to get back to the group, we should be unstunnable from the back and maintain all of our defensive skills even when something is behind us.  Too many times i have just plain ran out of health during the middle of a pull, where a warrior would have successfully gotten back to the group and gotten a heal.<P>Right now, when a monk pulls, he (or she) spends most of the battle laying on his back/side because feign death doesn't work to lose agro on mobs, when he stays with the group and someone else pulls, he does comparable damage to the warrior and doesn't come close to damaging a rogue, yet he lacks the health and defensive ability to allow him to take the roll of a tank.  So the monk is 2nd or 3rd rate at whatever he is doing.  Give monks a vision, make balance them according to that vision.  Verant always falls back onto the vision as being so important, and yet the monk as a class has no vision, does that mean monks are unimportant?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You're right, they've nerfed the monk's ability to pull significantly (completely in newer areas?).<P>Even with a damage upgrade, a monk will still remain second rate to a rogue.  <P>With less hp than a warrior and no taunt, a monk will remain third rate as a tank, paladins and shadowknights are better tanks.<P>I'm sure verant has looked at all of the options i've listed and the reason they havn't told us where we fit in as a vision is because anywhere they try to fit us in, we still are second rate at best.  So in order to allow monks to be pullers they would have to recode most of velious as to how mobs return, which isn't very likely, for us to be tanks we need more hp and more defensive abilities, or to do more damage we need a way to get rid of the aggro.. anyway you look at it there is a lot of work for them to fit monks into the "vision" because somehow monks fell out of the "vision" and have been passed up, and though monks have screamed about it since kunark came out, we have been ignored until this forum where they promised to actually listen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd have to reread all the posts by absor to see where he said monks should be inbetween rogues and warriors damage wise.  I remember his first response where he said he didn't know if monks really needed a damage increase or if they should be doing more damage than a warrior.  That one just hit home harder than his later posts, so i didn't take not of him rectifying that statement if he did.<P>The problem is, as it always has been, the well thought out (and thus long posts) tend to be skiped or left unanswered.  As the saying goes better to say nothing and be thought a fool then to open your mouth and prove it.  I think verant wants to go toe to toe against an intellegent poster as much as an enchanter wants to go to to toe with Trakanon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, we could suggest a minimum time before we could stand from a successful FD, but that would mean that they would have to have it wipe agro under any circumstance that FD was successful as well as making FD unbreakable by spells.  I don't see that happening.<P>The next idea would be a move behind skill that would interupt our attacks put us at the rear 180deg area of the mob and drop our agro.  But if they gave us that, the rogues would whine and cry untill they got it at a higher cap than the monk.<P>I've mentioned a few defensive skills on my first post to this particular list (pg 1 or 2) but I don't see either of those happening either.<P>I get the feeling that when it comes time for their meetings that the monk is forgotten.  I can almost be certain that no-one that works at VI actually plays a monk in game as their primary character.<P>I see the crew being halfway home and someone remembers that they didn't talk about the monks but "Oh well...  We'll talk about them next time."  And the cycle continues.<P>I could be, and probably am, wrong.  It's just that right now I am very frusterated.  My monk was my one and only character and last week I made a SK to aleviate that frusteration.  My SK may get one hit to my monks 3 since he's using a 14/40 2hs weapon, but at lvl 5, he's hitting for an average of 18 points and hitting about 70% of the time.  Compare that to my monk at lvl 26 punching for an average of 16 and hitting about 30% of the time.  I don't like that.  I want my monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just wondered if anyone read my post about adding a Specialize skill to the monk? <P>Casters get this "skill" in order to boost their fizzle rates on certain types of spells, i.e. they "miss less" using it. The code is clearly written to add some degree of skill beyond the skill's normal cap, so doing this for the monk's skills shouldn't be that hard a task. <P>My wishes for specialization would be:<P>* H2H<BR>* 1HB, 2HB<BR>* Defence<P>The monk class is allready split up amongst themselves in playstyle. Some want offensive styles of play, others defensive styles. Adding specialization to the monk's skills means that the choice would remain, and hopefully, bring better results to the monks out there.<P>I for one, would LOVE to specialize in H2H to further it's damage output - I'm doing way too little damage at 52 now, and according to everything Verant has ever posted about the monk, we SHOULD be able to sustain respectable damage even without the weapons. <P>I am also conserned about the lack of replies by Absor. This thread was started a long time now, and I have yet to see a single response. Please, Absor, at least give us the courtesy of a reply every once and again. That gives us some sort of feedback off of all the ideas that are swarming in here.
