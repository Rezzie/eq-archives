</FONT><HR>In response to the word the tracking cap on druids had been increased Absor said: <BR>"This was done at the request of the Druid community."<P>Well, in response to this, on behalf of Rangers, I am requesting that Rangers get defense increased to the same level as Knights offense, and also that we get ports.  Since you are such a "buddy" of the druid community, I think it only fair that you put one of my requests into game.  Oh, yeah, and could you do it by next patch?  <P>Now I know thats not going to happen, and I don't expect it to.  *Sorry for the bad humor above*  However, why are Druids getting an increase in the CLASS DEFINING ability of Rangers?  Are Clerics getting LOH or Necro's getting Harmtouch on Test?  I haven't logged in to check, but I doubt it.  Why are Druids gaining higher skill in tracking, the Ranger's Class Defining ability.  If Druids are going to have a skill that is over HALF of what a Ranger gets.  (Rangers only have a tracking of 200, druids now have 135?)  Since Druids are now gaining over half of a Ranger's ability to track, I think its only fair that Rangers get self-ports, binds, gates, or group-ports, or evacs.  (I'm only asking for one of the above, not all of them!)  C'mon!  If Druids get such a HUGE chunk of Rangers Class defining ability, its only fair that Rangers get a chunk of Druids class defining ability, teleports. With the increase in skill that a Druid gets, they can now track almost anything that a Ranger can. What advantage does a Ranger have over a Druid tracking now?  SCROLLING!  That's it.  A Ranger won't have to scroll, becuase he can set his list to display only blues, or sort by distance, so that he can find what he is looking for closer to the top.  What will Druids have to do to be just as effective as Rangers at tracking....scroll down a screen or two more.  So....it will take them about 5 seconds to scroll down that far...so Ranger's get a 5 seconds head-start to try and find something over druids now huh?<P>Heck, you gave druids better heals, better tracking...what are you trying to make them?  The masters of SOLOING AND GROUPING?!?!<P>/boggle Verant<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't remember who it was (either Abashi or Absor in a very recent post - look it up if you want) stated that bards tracking was never intented to be higher than druids tracking so this boost is to bring druid tracking on par to where it should have been all along.<P>Can you honestly say it would be better to nerf bards by lowering their tracking so druids won't approach rangers or do what they have decided to put on TEST (read: still not live yet)?<P>I didn't think so.  This doesn't hurt rangers whether you believe that or not.  Ranger tracking is still better than the druids.<P>Now if they wouldn't have given the rangers the extra "fluff" stuff for tracking then I would say you would have a "little" more room to question the move.  But that isn't the case so please don't get too upset over this.<P>It's only a game and rangers didn't get nerfed.

</FONT><HR>Let me state right up front that my primary is a Ranger...and I don't have a problem with Druids getting better tracking than Bards.  I DO feel that Bards should have been caped at 50 with Druids at 100 though.<P>Having said that let me throw this in.  I came out of Beta playing a Druid.  My first live primary was a Druid, and at that time guess what the druid traking cap was ...anyone....anyone....can you say "1".  Thats correct.  It was stated that Druids were suppose to have tracking but were not suppose to be any good at it.  This comment was made in post made by I "believe" Brad.( I still have it somewhere, I might try and find it)<BR>Well, it took about 2 or 3 weeks and this was changed to 20 when it was pointed out that if you didn't have ANY range then just HAVING tracking was kinda lame.  Okay.....now Druid tracking is 20.  But that kinda sucks, so last year it was lobbied to be changed to around 50 OR better yet 75. This was met with resistance from Veriant.  At the time I was apart of the Druid community trying to get this change and I was rather upset at the amount of resistance we were getting about this issue.  Needless to say, this change WAS put into place at 50.  <BR>Okay, that brings us to today.  On their own Veriant has decieded that "Hey, shouldn't druids have a higher track than bards?" ....Well shoot my foot....This has been what the druid community has been saying is beta and NOW they take credit as if this was always the intent....sheesh.<P>So please.....Give Druids the better track caps....thats a good thing.  But dont' pass it off as "This is the way Veriant intended it to be".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Celina,<P>This is the whole paragraph with the quote:<P>"But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community."<P>Now, it wasn't worded extremely well, but with just a little bit of thought it is fairly clear that Absor meant that the Druid community requested that the skill level be kept at 50 instead of higher because a higher level would mak it worse.  Therefore, the quote was EXTREMELY out of context.<P>That said, I have no idea whether or not Absor is CORRECT in his statement.  Just don't accuse him of saying things he didn't say.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Celina,<P>I believe you need to retake your speed reading course.  You forgot to mention a few lines of text between those two statements. The part about druids orignially having a higher tracking skill during beta that was reduced to where it was at the request of the druid community. That's the important part that you didn't bother to mention..<P>THE.. TRACKING.. ABILITY.. WAS.. REDUCED.. DURING.. BETA.. AT.. THE.. REQUEST.. OF.. THE.. DRUID.. COMMUNITY<P>There. Hopefully you can read that.<P>It was mentioned in another post that Druids were always intended to have a higher skill than bards. Due to the flaws in the User Interface, tracking skill was reduced for druids so that it would be more effective.<P>Personally I prefer the tracking sorted by distance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My biggest problem with this was that rangers should be and will always be masters on Tracking.<P>And Bard then came in second.  Everyone thought it was so strange for a bard to have track but think about it.  All they do is travel.  And not by means of teleports.  They travel everywhere by there own feet.  They see everything.  I know that as a bard I have seen almost every zone there is to see.  I can understand the bards track.<P>Then came druids track not as good as bard and no where as good as rangers but good enough to do the jobs they needed.  I always understood the reason why it was lower was because of their teleport skills.  After a certain level they stop traveling using the feet and start useing their magic.  They would keep their tracking skill under bards but still effective.<P>Now Bards are getting the low number.  Druids are being moved up in skill "somewhere between the ranger and bard"<P>I wish they would leave some things alone.  I know they are trying to really balance and they are going to make things better but somethings like this were fine.<P>All i am say is leave this little stuff alone and concern yourselves with the bigger issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Question:  When they say class banance, does VI means that every class will be the same?  That there is no class defining skill/spell?<P>I really don't get it.  I have been playing Eq for about 7 months.  I have 6 current characters.  53 necro, 26 ranger, 26 enchanter, 20 druid, 18 monk, and 17 cleric.  U would think that because i have a druid character that I would be happy about the change?  Not really. There should be a purpose for each class, something they can contribute to a group that no other class can.  Lets see, rogues backstab, paly's LOH, Knights harmtouch, monks FD (note this is only skills/abilities, not including spells).  Warriors, well what can I say, they have tons of armor and weapons to chose from, but too bad they don't have a skill only warriors have. And rangers has nothing. I'm sure i will get flamed, but here it goes.  Let only rangers have track.  Let warriors have a new unique skill (how about Area Effect Taunt, Range 5m that has a super aggro). I know that some classes has more unique skills, but i took the best skill of each.  Note this is excluding disaplines, and i excluded bard, because i don't know what to classify the songs as.<P>Patheon MT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, let me get this straight.  Rangers have been given the same mana pool as druids. (when wisdom is the same), They can cast many spells, post 50, faster than a druid casting the very same spell.  They got many new spells that only druids had before, they get a rare bp that has a teleport effect.  Now that druids are getting an increase in tracking Rangers are still, roughly, twice as effective AND can sort/filter the list, now rangers scream bloody murder.<P>Understand this, tracking is NOT a class defining skill like Backstab, LOH and HT.  No other class has those skills.  You share tracking with 2 other classes.  Not all classes have a class defining skill.  You are the best at tracking.  Even with the increased skill you are the best at tracking by a large number.<P>A level 50 tracking skill is not much at all.  For example, I can actually SEE Woushi in Wakening lands before he appears on my tracking. (I play with clipping plane maxed)<P>As for why Druids should have better tracking skills than a Bard.  Why would a class that gets the skill at 20 have a lower cap than a class that gets it 15 levels after that (35)?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But it's not.  So tell me what there is to complain about.  <P>Why is it that whenever a class gets an enhancement that there is always someone that has to complain about it.  Whatever happened to being happy for someone who got something good?<P>Even if we druids did get 50 extra points in tracking rangers still have double the skill plus a few other extras that we don't.  I don't care to be the "master of tracking" but lemme tell you something.  I was in Dragon Necropolis at the zone in waiting for a friend to get back so I could get him out of there and I saw a phase spider on the far wall.  I was able to target it.  I was NOT, however, able to track it.  My tracking list was totally clear.  So, yes, please at least give me the ability to track as far as I can see.<P>You know, when I saw the effect of the Tolan's BP, I was happy for you guys.  I don't care of you got a port when previously only wizards and druids had that ability.  Why should I be mad at that?  I guess I am one of the few people who is glad when someone else gets something nice.  /shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To say that there are role-playing reasons why a Druid should have better tracking than a Bard is immaterial.  Bards are a "jack of all trades" and were given this skill as part of their initial design.  Rangers got a cap of 200, Bards of 100, Druids of 20.  I would bet my life's savings that, when Verant did this, they did not in any way believe that this made Rangers 1st, Druids 2ND and Bards 3RD.  When they designed tracking, they thought that a higher number was better, and they balanced the classes for that.<P>To say that they need to adjust tracking to make Druids 2nd best is just bogus reasoning.  The only reason to bother to adjust tracking at this date for Druids is if Druids are in some way underpowered at levels where tracking matters.  Are they?  Hardly.  Giving the easiest and most flexible 1-50 class in the game more 1-50 stuff just boggles me.<P>All of this "why do you care what another class gets" logic is just self-serving blather.  If that's true, then give every class in the game the ability to port their groups to any Druid circle on the planet, and let us all cast Circle of Winter.  Druids won't care, right?  NOT.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mennion,<BR>"Too my knowledge, the ONLY spells a ranger can cast faster than a druid are flamestrike (which is still to slow to be of use in combat even at 60 with a 30% casting time reductiin) and whatever lame DoT i have which i dont even mem because it takes too much mana, doesnt do much damage to make it worth the cast time, and gets overwritten by any druid around. "<P>Did you read the last patch message?To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells. <P>That means, Snare, ensnare, your dot's, etc...  I'm sure you don't always have a druid in your group too, so you're spells aren't always getting over written.  Druids have overwriting problems with their buffs too.  SLN, STR do not stack with Clerics/shaman buffs.<P>The point is.  You have gotten several things that make you better at being a wisdom based caster (ie a druid), isn't it fair that you give back a little something as a class?<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
