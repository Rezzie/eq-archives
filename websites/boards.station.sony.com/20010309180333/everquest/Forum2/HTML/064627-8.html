</FONT><HR>i love this idea for the simple reason it kills multi-questing. i'm tired of seeing people auction off the ancient cyclops ring offering to turn it in as part of a multi-quest, just as an example. not only that, but multi-questing is a cheesy, but technically legal work around for someone not to do the whole quest themselves when no-drop items are involved. c'mon absor, most of the quest rewards that are no drop out there are no-drop for a reason. i mean, it's very hard now to accidently loot a no-drop quest item with the confirmation box in place, so why have multi-questing? it just eliminates part of the challenge that the quest is supposed to have and makes it easier or exploitable in some cases (like some people do the j-boots quest).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please do NOT remove multi-questing from the game, it is an undocumented feature, not a bug and many quests require/encourage it.<P>Perhaps there might be a way to differentiate multi-questing from normal hand-ins? Or maybe you could implement the suggestion of a pop-up box asking you if you want your items back if you did not turn in all correct items?<P>Most people that have a problem with multi-questing seem to actually have a problem with specific quests (ie Journeyman Boots) that encourage farming/KSing. By simply redesigning these few quests to require the combination of multiple items in a container you can make them 'non-multi-questable' (examples of quests like this already in the game are Staff of the Wheel and Eyepatch of Plunder) and leaving multi-questing for other quests I think you could make the vast majority of people happy.<P>In answer to your specific question: no, I do not think the improvements would out-weigh the loss of multi-questing.<P>Mistyn<BR>Virtuoso of Luclin<BR>&lt;Triad Continuum&gt;<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This would be a major exploit, and utterly ruin the usual method of looking for in-game clues for not-yet-solved quests. Instead, everyone would just offer every oddball item(s) they had to every NPC in sight, until the "Show" screen for one indicated an interest in item X"<P>And how is the original Verant idea different from this?  "Show" button would still allow you to multi-quest, while the original would not.<P>In both cases you could "probe" the NPC for correct items.  And what's wrong with that?

When I was questing for my legs - requires a permafrost snowball (no drop & extremely rare) and bone barbs (also no drop). I managed to get the bone barbs from unrest after spending about 12 hours in Unrest trying not to pull trains. I then went to Permafrost and started ooc and auctioneing for the snowball (which drops off goblin wizards). I also went hunting and managed to get killed - and no rez in sight.<P>I spent about 2 days play in permafrost killing all the wizards I could find - also made friends with a wiz and mage pair that were also after a specific drop - we promised to let each other know if it dropped - he got his drop, I never got mine.<P>Fortunately a guild mate had picked up a snowball when he was last there, and still had it, so I could get out of that godforsaken place.<P>So now I have my leggings because a friend helped me multiquest for them.<P>If the change is made, then fine, it will help out some people, but make sure you increase the drop rate for the quests in that case.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Stop multiquesting. Make people "really" do the quest. I suppose all cheaters and similar will tell you not to do this but hey, multiquesting is NOT doing a quest w/ full effort.<P>On the other hand, making the NPC telling you that you have done something wrong with your quest is a GREAT step towards real questing. I fear doing quests because if I lose items, I can start over.<P>So, both changes are great as any fair and non-cheating player should admit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Killing Multi-questing would stop twinking with jboots and the farming of them by druids etc.  I personally think this change would be better for the game overall.<P>There's only one problem.  And that's certain items.  There's certain items that only drop once a day or once every 48 hours or even less.  For example the rod for the robe of the whistling fists from Karnors.  Extremely rare drop and even though someone may spend hours and days camping it they could log out 5 min before it drops.  But if a friend can loot it and turn it in for them it's ok.  But if you go ahead with this change then this item would pretty much be unreachable for people who arent very lucky.  Then on the other hand there's people who spend no time camping it and have a friend who loots it for them because they got lucky and they get the robe.  That's really people abusing the feature.  But I don't think stopping those people is worth ruining it for the people who work hard for it.<P>So if you're talking about this change as you stated with no other changes (like taking nodrop off items or increasing drop rates) then i'd have to say no.  As stated above there's a lot of quests that pretty much require this.  Unfortunately.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Do not kill multiquesting..it promotes working together and also aids in getting round common LD problems. Many times in helping guildmates doing quests the person needing to loot the hand in item has gone LD or died in the fight..multiquesting prevents these events from being the end of the road for the quest. Multiquesting also makes sense as 9/10 groups are required to kill the npc's to get items..if people can help here why not at the end/hand in event. Questing in EQ is painful enough as it is dont make it Harder.<P>Vinyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

To have to have the person there at that specific time two times is very unreasonable.

</FONT><HR>I didn't wade through all of the previous 8 pages, but the obvious solution to me would seem to be:<P>Quest NPC pops up a yes no confim box when less than the full set of items is being handed in.  Click yes, you get em back, click no, you don't, and the next person can hand in the remainder and get the reward.  <P>The confirm box should pop up based on what is being handed in *now*, without consideration to the items already handed in.  This will prevent folks trying their luck on quest NPCs to see if they can get a freebie from someone elses goof...not that there would be as many of these, as they would need to have clicked yes on an incomplete item set...<P>This allows multiquesting to continue, while allowing the easy out for the experimenters and the careless.<P>If you want to address the AC camping issue, make the message box configurable on a NPC by NPC basis. ie.  Hasten doesn't pop up the confirm box, he just hands the items back regardless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I'm not going to bother reading all 300+ replies to see if this idea has already been given. So - apologies if already stated elsewhere.<P>You don't have to lose multiquest in order to fix the item loss. Use a DIALOG box!<P>Like this ...<P>Hand over 3 of the 4 items.<P>Box pops up "I'm not sure what to do with these, do you want them back?"<P>Yes / No buttons on the box.<P>Simple isn't it. Multiquesting still works, you can only lose your items if you're dumb enough to hit yes when you mean no. Kinda like the dialog you added when you try to drop an item.<P>Make this change to all NPC's, it won't harm the game. You just get the chance to confirm whether you want to give the pod your Ranger epic or not. Plus, you can add an eqclient switch to default to the old system - and please all people.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I vote NO!<P>Spend yer time fixing all the broken quests, stop wasting it on things like this that will only enrage the community.<P>One suggestion I do have though, Epic weapons should NOT be multiquested, I highly suggest redoing em so that you must combine components and turn the result in(like the treant fists quest).  This is an easy fix for specific quests that shouldnt be multiquested.  However, multiquesting in general still is too benificial.  And I speak from a long lifetime as a range of tracking a rare spawn all the way across a zone just in time to watch a druid it spawned next to kill it.<P>Another reason? Well some people kill stuff NOT for quest items, but because the mob gave them exp.  Now what if nobody is in the zone that can use it? Without multiquesting, the dropped item is wasted, and forever lost to the class that can use it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would have no problem if Multi-questing was gone.  Sure there are times when it's advantageous to multi-quest, but there are so many quests that people simply cannot do because the pieces are constantly being farmed (Jboots, etc)<P>People complain about not being able to multi-quest their epics.  Well, whenever I've brought up a problem with an Epic Quest (and the druid quest has a couple of things to complain about) I've been told that I need to plan my play style around the way the quest is designed and that not everyone is entitled to their Epic.  Fine, I can accept that.  I don't have to like it, but I can accept it.<P>Now, people found ways to multi-quest their Epics and get them easier than they were intended.  I point to all the threads where people told me that not everyone is entitled to their Epic...<P>I would support these changes.  I get so tired of people selling nodrop items in EC for outrageous sums of pp, when you see them monopolizing the spawns so that others can't get the drop themselves.<P>On the other side of the coin, I hate it when a quest NPC gives vague or erroneous text and causes me to give the wrong items.  Having him give them back would be a great thing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Man this is a tough one. It is a double edge sword. On one side it will be worth it if it cuts down on people camping spawns that are for quests.  But on the other hand it can be a big nerf for those really tough quests. I play a mage and my epic quest comes to mind. A month or so ago a guild member got Quil's cloak and I was looking forward to multi questing it.<P>If they implement this in the game I don't think it will have the intended outcome. Instead of keeping the high levels from doing the hard part of the quest for their friends and twinks, now they will do the entire quest and simply hand over the final product. The only way this can be avoided is to make all items that are the result of a quest no drop.<P>Just look at all the cool armor and stuff that drops in Skyshrine. You would think that since 90% of it is no drop it wouldn't be too over camped. Well guess again, as soon as a piece drops that no one wants, everyone in the group has their twinks parked there and the simply logs and pick up the item.<P>This can't be another thing that Verant simply tosses in without testing and giving it some careful consideration. This has to be done right to make it effective.<P>Vocare 51 Mage<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Granted this is a rare case but still an issue with NPCs having a knowlegde of whats right and wrong.<P>People just need to be careful.<P>I for one like the concept of Multi-Questing, it encourages interaction of people, regardless of what the levels are, etc.<P>I did read a post about if the quest didnt finish though the player could say something like 'that is all i have' or 'im done' and if something was wrong the NPC would hand the items back to _those_ that handed them in, that sounds very viable.<P>V<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Virtually every posting in this thread in favor of getting rid of multi-questing is about ONE quest -- journeyman's boots.  You've had two incarnations of this quest, and neither of them seems to have worked well.  It has been suggested over and over that you change this quest to one requiring a container to be combined and handed to Hasten, OR that you make the components tradeable.  <P>The scenario presented in the original posting is something I have never seen happen.  I'm not saying it doesn't, but something that occurs occasionally in-game is hardly reason to eliminate COOPERATION among players in this COMMUNITY game.  I've helped people multi-quest their ranger quest armor, their cleric quest armor, their bard quest armor, keys to OS, keys to HS, and several other examples.  Not for profit, just as a favor for friends.  I'd have been happy to hand them the components I happened to have so they could complete the quests themselves, but the items were no drop.<P>Multiquesting also helps casual players complete quests involving long, difficult camps (you could eliminate those camps, but that's another thread).  When people don't have a ton of time to play the game, but are fortunate enough to have friends who do, multi-questing allows them to help each other -- again COOPERATION.  COMMUNITY.<P>Fix, if you must, the Jboots quest because of those who feel that the fact it can be multiquested is being abused.  But extrapolating that to the dozens of really good mid-level quests in-game where working together helps everyone seems short-sighted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>decent idea, but if you do away with multi-questing all together, it might do more harm than good.<P>trivial quests, make it so that they can not be multi-quested. (ie: any item that is not involved in any manner with any FA quests.)<P>non trivial quests ie: FA items. anything that is even remotely gonna be used for a characters FA should still be multi-questable. just change FA related npc's. <P>this would stop ppl from farming jboots and other similar items. but still allow multi-questing for the FA's. which i think is important.<P>example: brother balatin in dreadlands for the robe of the whistling fist quest. that robe is not trivial, it's a required piece for the monk epic. that npc should be multi-questable. <P>example 2: hasten bootsrutter (sp?) he gives jboots, now, a very useful item, but it's a trivial item. and is farmed. <P>pls think about other options before just simply doing away with multi-questing. that isnt the answer.<P>-=Tunare=-<BR>&lt;Xavier&gt;<BR>Serk Soulblighter - 58 Myrmidon<BR>Ramek Soulblighter - 52 Rake<BR>Jenjuro Kibagami - 52 Disciple<BR>Vylin Vylore - 51 Heretic<BR>Tyrak Tyrmidon - 50 Warrior<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey how is this for a Solution:<P>Frist Lets Nerf Warriors and Clerics, then lets stick 2 of the stupidest spells on test for wizards, wait wait once wasnt enough, they seem to be still a semi-useful class, lets nerf those clerics again, this will show there high and mighty butts.  <P>Ok now lets stop people from helping others in quests, to make them harder, god knows people couldnt actually read the name of the item they are handing the npc before they do it.<P>Ok, well that should make everyone happy, lets see clerics and warriors cant do there jobs as well, quests are now harder. <P>Hmmm, next week we will be adding another patch that makes it so if you walk more then ten paces in the wrong direction you die and all your gear disappears.  <P>/sarcasam off<P>/laeriel out<P>P.S. - Is it just me or has verant been doing alot of stupid stuff as of late, i mean these "fixes" sure arnt pleasing the fan base, so why are they doing them?  Im just baffled, and dont understand.  Why make fixes if it makes your players unhappy?  Why reply to this post?  <P>P.P.S. - This is a bad idea dont make this change<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064627&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064627&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
