I'll certainly list any bugs that you would like to see addressed, but the focus should be balance. And please be concise when responding. These threads will get very long, and it helps me to be able to read all the responses if they are to the point.<P>Let's hear what you have to say.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Is it that hard to get a bind.. No not all the time..

</FONT><HR>Also everything is already said, I repeat it once more.<BR>The key words for Ranger balance are the following three, in my opinion:<P>AVOIDANCE<BR>MITIGATION<BR>ARCHERY<P>1. Avoid getting hit at all --&gt; <BR>A Jolt!!! Make it less resistable, like lure/lifetap / and of course lower it to 51 (at least)<BR>Nice idea was move jolt down to 49 or 51 --&gt; leave the spell as it is right now <BR>Add a new spell at 55 that is like lure / lifetap nearly unresistable.<BR>B Defense skills, hits that are comming in parried, riposted, dodged = no dmg <P>2. mitigate all hits that are coming in --&gt;<BR>A More HP, because the more hitpoints you have the less you have to care about a hit, and vice versa.  <BR>B More AC, the more AC you have the less hard you are going to be hit.<P>Therefore as stated in many posts above i would like to see 20 Points in Defense.<BR>And maybe even increase the Defense Skills 5-10 Points per skill<P>Archery<BR>I would love to see archery, our class symbol (BOW), to become a real combat mode, for ranger only.<BR>A once-per-day-skill in addition to the Trueshot Disc, which still in need to be fixed (stated in a dozen posting above) related to the bow is something i would love to see.<BR>There is no reason to be afraid of archery, we will never be able to quad kite like druids. Cause of the arrows and the way archery works etc. <BR>Archery would be a nice way of dealing dmg without getting smacked down to the ground. And i think the other classes would accept this form of combat. <P><BR>This is far away from balance talks, but this is<BR>my_vision_of a Ranger is more like this:<BR>htt://mitglied.tripod.de/Elrond/Bilder/elf.jpg<BR>how a lvl 60 Ranger should look like<BR>htt://mitglied.tripod.de/Elrond/Bilder/quic2.jpg<BR>boys, thats called EPIC weapon, not those whimpy two little swords :P and i always wanted to have a BATTLECAT  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif">)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor and Verant. Quite frankly I think its all been covered.<P>I would like to say THANKS for a great game and the most fun class to play in Everquest.<P>I think the recent changes will help. <P>The changes that may be implemented from test have great potential and are very exciting.<P>Please implement the tracking changes asap so that we are the masters of track as we should be.<P>Please tune up bow damage in genral and trueshot especially for my elders. With a good skill and decent bow arrows shouldnt miss near so frequently and should hit for considerably higher minimum damage.<P>I like the offensive focus and believe as light swift fighters it is appropriate BUT feel we do clearly pay to higher price in the triple whammy of lower ac armor, lower defensive skills and lower hitpoints. I believe a skill increase is most true to the class. I agree with the argumants about raising Thorny Vine ac and replacing int bonuses with wis.<P>There are clerics posting on this issue and that should tell you something. It amazes me given the high quality of armor etc, I maintain on my L41 Ranger how fast my life goes and how many heals I require as a Ranger pulling and tanking. AND I do the best I can to manage my taunt/aggro.<P>The biggest adjustment we need is something to help reduce the problem of taking damage so quickly. We are percieved as fast agile fighters, and if that is so, we should get hit harder than a warrior when we get hit BUT have better avoidance skills.<P>Thanks for your consideration. /bow  Az</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In addition to all the post 50 recommendations that have been posted here, I would like to make one suggestion:<P>1.)  For the HP upgrade, I would suggest it be implmented to all Rangers level 1-60.  Essentially, put us on the same HP charts as Paladins/Shadow Knights.  We would make up the 300hp deficit, and it would benefit all Rangers.<P>As for reasons for the HP increase, those have been listed many times already, and I agree with them, I am merely suggesting an implementation strategy.<P>This same adjustment to raise Knights HP's was done some time back, it would be easy to make the same changes to Rangers.<P>Lochtar<BR>Xegony<P>Also, Like the spell changes, and I don't think we should get SOW earlier.  :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My point of view is that there were only minor changes that needed to be implemented prior to level 45 so I will concentrate on what I believe Rangers need for levels 46+ IN GROUP SITUATIONS.<P>THE PROBLEMS:<BR>-------------<BR>#1)  Caster-like defense.  Ranger's spend 90%+ of their time in melee range yet have armor which is equal or lower IN AC than that of shammies and clerics.<P>#2)  Poor hit avoidance.  Rangers are restricted to chain armor which I assume is because they are supposed to be light agile fighters, who can avoid hits better than warriors, but take considerably more damage when hit.  However, Rangers have lower dodge caps than most of the other melee'ers and they don't have either the block or evade hit avoidance skills that the other armor restricted melee'ers, Monks and Rogues have.<P>#3)  Poor offensive spells.  With the progression of higher dmg/dly weapons, casting during melee will typically result in less overall damage than purely melee.  Casting a 4.5 second spell will result in the loss of 3-4 full rounds of melee(taking into account fizzles/resists/aggros).  Cloak of Flames(long quest) and Calefaction(lvl 59) being the only exception to the above rule.<P>#4  Poor overall offense.  For being the "offensive" hybrid, Rangers still have lower damage than Rogues, Monks and Warriors.  <P>#5  Poor stat buff/resist spells.  LEVEL 50 Ranger stat buffs and resists are matched or exceeded by most LEVEL 19 casters.  SOW and Str of Nature being the only oft useable group buffs.<P><BR>POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:<BR>-------------------<BR>#1)  Caster-like defense.  Raise defensive skill to 252 (even at the expense of the offensive increases that were proposed on test.)  IMO opinion, even if offensive caps were maxed we would be hard pressed to out damage Rogues, Monks or Warriors.  <P>#2)  Poor hit avoidance.  Raise the avoidance skills ABOVE those of plate classes.    Either that or implement a block/evade type skill.  This seems logical for lighter, agile fighters.<P>#3)  Poor offensive spells.  Model more spells after higher level druid spells with the DRAWBACK of recast times that are 5-10x longer than druids.  This would give us spells that are useable, but balanced, while maintaining the claim that Rangers are 25% druid.<P>#4  Poor overall offense.  I don't think that we will be out damaging rogues, monks or warriors any time soon.  I would just as soon see defensive improvements.<P>#5  Poor stat buff/resist spells.  Save for SOW, I would toss all the stat buff and resist spells for improvements in defense.<P><BR>SUMMARY:  <BR>--------<BR>It seems that VI wants to make Rangers the "offensive" hybrid.  Unless our offense moves up past 4th in offensive melee power, this will not improve our grouping situation.  However, increases in defense will have a dramatic effect on the defense and perception of Rangers.  IMO I would like to see a more balanced Ranger with all the improvements being in the defensive area.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Based on my 58 levels of exp as a human ranger, and coupled with 23 years of reading about rangers I would like to see the following considered.<P>Increase our Parry/Dodge/Riposte skills and leave our Defense alone.  We're meant to be highly mobile so put these above even the warriors/rogues (don't turn us into poor man's paladins by giving us Def). <P>Hp's are out of whack with the rest of the classes.  Primarily this becomes evident post 50.<P>Spell selections are generally great, with a notable lack of Cold based spells.  Tho I'll throw a bone to the younger rangers and say SoW at 39 is a bit extreme.  <P>Our Item drops as a whole seems to be intentionally cruel.  I've yet to find a planar version of Velious armor.  I don't think the WW or quested is meant to be it.  <P>YES YES YES , increase our offensive skills. I like any true ranger know how to avoid agro and now have Jolt(tho it needs to be more reliable).<P>Fandros Finglaflin<BR>Nightmare Clan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Rangers will be the only fighters with a wis caster defense, low AC armor, low dodge, low parry, low reposte, and low HP. Rangers are the high natural taunt fighters. Jolt is too late, fails too often, costs too much mana(Half Elf Rangers start with 65 wis), costs damage output to cast, and ADDS aggro on failure.<P>Move Jolt to the 49 spell set, decrease Jolt's mana cost, provide a minor HP increase before 60, and up the Ranger defense to 220 or 230 by level 60. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Arrow recovery.  That is, when you hit a mob with an arrow, have a chance to be able to loot that arrow back from its corpse.

</FONT><HR>One of the chief complaint of rangers is the fact that they are continually being plastered all over the map in regards to their taunt factor.  This comes in at high levels as well where several rangers have mentioned that their weapons taunt so much and they just don't have the HP to keep up with the damage that they will end up taking.  <P>Instead of asking for more hitpoints (which I'm sure many will do) perhaps it may be appropriate to give them the skill Evade ... which will allow them to step back to get out of the lime light of the monsters attacks.  Rangers are often termed the "rogues of the woods" and get hide and sneak as such, so perhaps the evade tactic ... essentially disappearing into the underbrush, would be appropriate to help fix this problem of overtaunting.<P>I think this would not only make sense from a role playing, but also in terms of game play balance.<P>Thanks for listening, we appreciate the opportunity!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As far as the HP bump, it was implemented to make Knights better tanks during the Ivy Etched period when there was little difference in AC between Ranger armor and Knight armor.<P>That AC disparity hasn't existed since.  Knight planar armor, Knuark armor, and Velious armor all have significantly increased AC over Ranger armor.  Therefor the huge HP gap is not justified 50+.<P>And once again (see my original post in the first page of the first thread), this is part of a triple-penalty.  We trade Dual-Wield for reduced AC (no plate), reduced HP and lowered Defense.  It was originally designed that we traded Dual-Wield for no AC.  It was also originally designed that the light (non-plate) classes had HIGH Defense (avoidance versus mitigation).<P>Please examine these details closely.<P>Finally (proposed on test):<P>------- Off / Def<BR>Ranger: 252 / 200<BR>Knight: 230 / 250<BR>Ranger balance: -28<P>'Nuff said...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a L49 Ranger and yes, I am opposed to moving SoW to a lower level.<P>Why?  Because the spell is broken.  It's too damn good.  It reduces travel time, increases defense and thus also increases offense.  Someone with SoW in an outdoor zone who keeps his head is practically invincible.  You may not win the fight by it's virtually certain that you won't die.<P>The spell should have had the no combat/casting limit from Day One.  It didn't, that was a mistake.  It would do too much damage to the game to fiddle with it at this point, but certainly proliferating the spell would also hurt.<P>During my 38 levels without SoW I made it a point to *not* go around begging or /auc'ing for SoW every 35 minutes.  I wanted to fight with only my own resources when I was solo (which was almost always).  I'm glad I did it that way, because now I know my own capabilities and limitations far better than a lot of other players I've run across.  (I've also noticed that a lot of people just roll over and die when they get in trouble without SoW because they're mentally fixed on the idea that you can't escape without it.)<P>I did, waaaaay back in Part One, advocate a running speed buff for Rangers as low as L9, but with the no-combat/cast limit.  I'll stand on that.  Better travel speed, yes; better combat mobility, no.<P>Leave SoW where it is.<P>On the related bind/gate/teleport issue:  the bind rules for fighters are indefensible (the company's supplied reasons are nonsense), but that's not part of Ranger balance and thus out of this discussion's scope.  Limited teleports from our Druid heritage would be nice but we don't NEED them unless the class is supposed to solo extensively; with the removal of the EP penalty, the changes currently on Test and a bit more tweaking it would be less damaging to the game and easier (design-wise) to cement the Ranger's position in groups rather than designate us as soloists.  (And that's from a dedicated lone Ranger.)<P>(Some people have asked to have the effect changed on Tolan's BP: please don't.  I don't expect to ever have one but the effect is very nice.  That gate puts you within one zone of a bind point, a bank, a Druid gate and a Wizard gate, and within two zones of all trade skill facilities and ships to Antonica and Kunark.  Very nice.)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My turn  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1) Tracking - on the cards (great!). I just wish that Druids and Bards weren't getting as many of the extra features as they are since this is really a Rangers best hope for a class defining ability.<P>2) Archery - Think Ranger, think archery - yet we really don't stand out in archery above other bow capable classes (with a few exceptions, some bows/trueshot). Maybe a Ranger only damage modifier based on the archers level *shrugs*. Wouldn't need to be a huge modifier I don't think but enough to give us the edge in archery.<P>3) Class defining ability - There isn't anything we can do (today) that no other class can. I'd like to suggest my (1) which is widen the gap between druid/bard and ranger tracking so that this becomes our class defining ability. This is really aimed at increasing Ranger group desirability (primarily in outdoor zones).<P>Other than that, I think Rangers are great.<P>Thanks.<P>Grungen.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>READ THE FIRST TWO REPLYS IN THE FIRST THREAD AGAIN!!!! I thank God these two made it in first. These two posts are beautifully consise and address all of the most import Ranger issues. If you are looking for balance ideas, they are right in there. The laundry lists that some people are asking for is rediculous. But nearly all of the things these first two posts ask for can easily be shown what the balancing opposite is. Here are my agreements and disagreements:<P>SKILL CAPS<P>Defense - The test server proposed offence/weapon skills increases are appropriate assuming you increase our defence to 230. SK/Pally get 252 defense and 230 offence. It seems totally fair to me for Rangers to have 252 offense and 230 defense. <BR>Riposte - Again, an increase here is appropriate. See Anaxgoras post (4th). It outlines the issue perfectly.<BR>Archery - I assume when the test server mentions weapon skills increase it includes the bow. If not however, no reason not to give "the masters of the bow" a skill equal to warriors if we can have slashing/blunt/piercing equal it as well.<P>JOLT<P>Lower to level 50, reduce resistability. In the mid 40s the Rangers drastic need to lower agro becomes evident, and by 50 many Rangers become so jaded as to their frequency of dying, they quit. I've seen so many before me do so and I am nearly at that point myself. I only hold out for hope of the Ranger talks leading to change. Jolt should be given at 50, and it's resistablity slowly lowered every level so that at lvl 50 it has the resist rate it currently does and moving up so that by level 60 it is as reliable as rogue evade.<P>RANGER SUSTAINED DAMAGE<BR>I've seen a few posts asking that our sustained damage by upped to be somewhere between a warrior and a rogue. That is not needed for balancing purposes.<P>MANA POOL<BR>There is no reason to increase this. It is already in line with other casters.<P>EARLIER SOW, ADD BIND AND GATE<BR>I'd be a liar if I said I didn't want bind/gate, but it is not at all appropriate. SoW is at a perfect level now. Do not move it.<P>SPELL ADDITIONS<BR>The additions/changes on test are exactly the kind of thing I would have hoped for. Only thing I'd like to see is greater healing moved down a level or two from 57 to give us time to reduce the fizzle rate that plagues the rangers at the levels we get them and usually one level after. Somewhere I saw requests for a broader range of spell types at higher levels. I feel this also is unnecessary and in fact unbalancing. Rangers have a specific affinity for fire. We get a bonus to fire resist to prove it. Adding cold or other types of DD spells is not needed. We aren't nukers. We are fighters with limited casting ability. The damage spells we have now are great. The only concession I'll make here is given that we do get some magic based spells in earlier levels, a lower grade magic based DD in the low 50 levels would not be inappropriate.<P>THORNY VINE ARMOR<BR>While not really a balance issue, I've seen you promise to bring these concerns to the developers<BR>on othe Class Talk threads, so I wanted to post my support for increasing the drop rate. Actually, the drop rate isn't the problem. It's the number of mobs. Count the number of tentacles and then count the number of Amys (SK drop mobs). There are an average of 7 tentacles that pop in a full spawn. However the number of Amys is on the order of 30 or so I would guess. Why would you place the most mobs there for arguably the least popular class? Clean out some of these Amys from around the temple and add some more TTs.<P>EPIC WEAPONS<BR>The weapons themselves need no changing. They should not be interchangable as many have suggested. A 13/21 primary 1Hs is too much. The idea of a permanent haste on the 13/21 off hand and putting the slow proc on the 14/24 primary hand weapon was a stroke of genious. The swords compliment each other beutifully. However - again not a balance issue, but one that bothers the hell out me and most everyone in the game. Venril Sathir is the giver a Kunark lags for every class that gets them. With the Velious expansion these items are not so incredible that VS must be a one week spawn. If you disagree, fine. Lower the drop rate of legs (although already too low in my opinion) and make VS a three day spawn. Giving him 2 gems every time he falls was a nice change, but it's not enough. On most servers, this spawn is monopolized by one or two entities making it impossible for some to get access to this mob.<P>These are the issues as I see them that must be implemented to balance the Ranger. It's not a wishlist. It is those issues that I feel without being implimented in their entirety leave the Ranger lagging behind.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ATTENTION....ATTENTION....ATTENTION<P>Ok, this is not the normal post where I repeat what the last hundreds of posts have explained (i.e. mainly defense and so on)<P>I have been playing EQ since a month after release and my highest level char is still only a lvl 32 Ranger, but what I have seen wrong with the class this entire time is that even though we are a mix of two classes we have NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING, to make us unique (except for RNG only Armor and Weapons but you know what I mean)<P>My Suggestions:<P>1.) Give us a Druid Defining Spells but at a very high level and nothing great but useful-<BR>       a.) Ranger Teleports-To Qeynos Hills right outside Surefall Glade, Ruins in Kithicor somewhere near either Kithicor or Morin areas, and either to Lesser Faydark or Greater Faydark Rings (Personally Lesser makes more sense to me, more dangerous so less useful and also isnt a direct route to a city, none of them would be)<BR>       b.) Ranger Charms-Give Rangers Befriend Animal at lvl 30 or 39, max level of pets are 15 I believe with this spell so it would not infringe on any of the pet classes but it would give us something nice and decently useful that fits our class and gives us a Parent Class Defining Spell, also a possibility is Charm Animal at level 56,57,58,59 or 60, this way the max animal is 25 I believe so it does not infringe upon the Druid Bear Pet Spell at all (believe they are 33-35 and do not poof after 8 minutes) but again allows us some use of the spell line beyond the Befriend Animal which can be known to dump your pet in about 3 seconds or less.<BR>       c.) Ranger Treeform-Give Rangers Tree Form (Level 9 Druid Spell) at lvl 39, this would allow us a very minimul regen spell earlier on and give us a Parent Class Defining Spell, could also be upgrade later during the Outrider or Warder levels if so desired.<P>       a. b. or c. will give us a Parent Class defining spell, something I believe we desperately need.<P>2.) Give Rangers a Class Defining Skill<P>My Suggestions-<P>       a.) Arrow Blast- You always here of a one shot Ranger Skill and this I believe has alway been asked for as an insta-kill or some damage way to high.  My suggestion is that we get it at lvl 15 or so and what it does is that we hit 100% Automatically and that it Hits for your level/bow/arrow combo's Critical Hit Max Damage +(2 times Your Level in Percent)<BR>            So lets say you are a level 30 Ranger using a Trueshot Longbow and 1 damage arrows.  The Maximum Critical Hit Damage at this level is 44 (or atleast it was when I was level 30) and so then you take 60% of this (Level 30 Character) which is 26.4, round to 26 and add...70 Point Shot.  Make the skill recycle 45-72minutes depending.<BR>   <BR>       b.) Tumble Back-Make this skill somewhat like a dodge or parry skill, that it is automatically triggered not manually.  This skill would trigger when you are hit and should be stunned and would work based on your level in percent (so at lvl 49 it would work 49% of the time that you would be normally stunned) and have it move you back a good distance, about twice the range of melee, so that it also has the draw back of you losing the fighting time of those seconds but not nearly as much as being stunned and also you dont take the damage for the hit, maybe have this skill also lower aggro rate so that we arent turned into bloody green pulps at higher levels.<P>       c.) Flurry of Sweeping Blows- Rangers are supposed to be the masters of dual wielding? So how about an ability gained at a level between 17 and 25 that allows us to make more attacks that round than normal? Perhaps 6 or 7 attacks that round that would be rolled against normally also give each attack a small chance of stunning a target (wouldnt 6 or 7 consecutive dizzying strikes stun you too?) maybe 5-15% chance on each hit.  The skill could recycle at the same rate as LoH and HT.<P>3.)  Ranger Allies-Always liked this idea but doubt it will go good with you, how about that at the creation of a Ranger he must choose between a number of animals, primary being Wolf, Cat, and Bear and from then on the ranger always has a pet with the fighting skills (max for that level), hit points (natural)and AC (natural)of 1/10 the Ranger.  If the pet dies it is gone for 72 minutes and cannot be summoned in and Indoor Zone.  The pet would be deleted when you zone but as soon as you come into the new zone a message asking to recall the pet would appear (like a resurrection message) and only if you zone into an Outdoor zone, if you zone into an indoor zone the next outdoor zone you enter will send you the message.  If you died and the your in an Indoor Zone when the 72min. recycle time is up then you will recieve a message to recall the pet the next time you enter an Outdoor Zone.<BR>        This in NO WAY, I repeat NO WAY would infringe upon summoning classes the maximum hitpoints the pet could recieve at lvl 60 is about 210-250 if that and would only have about 1-25 skill points in any skill at any time. Also if you consider the pet at a low level, say lvl 7, then the maximum hit points of the pet will be about 20-25 and it will only have about 4 points in skills to use, making it hit anything for a bout a max of 2 and dying in one to two hits, making it nothing more than a friend and companion. This would just add the Ranger with something class defining, fun and VERY original. <P>-Thank you, I have always wanted to share these ideas to someone that might get the to be put ingame, I doubt any of them will but please consider them like a serious post and request to Ranger Balance.

</FONT><HR>RANGER ONLY SKILL SUGGESTION FOR THE DEFENSIVE CONCERNS<P><BR>I have only read the first page of "concerns" regarding our class.  <P>I agree that since we can only wear chain based armor we should have the ability to Dodge parry and riposte (DPR) better.<P>Ok - so you want a tradeoff?  - I suggest that you place a Weight cap at say 130 stones (or some reasonable cap).  If we keep our weight below, we get the DPR bonus.  Currently only Monks are penalized for weight to give them the awesome damage dealing capability.  How bout the weight penalty (albeit a higher cap) under which our Defensive skills also recieve a bonus.  <P>One way to implement this might be as a ranger skill (Avoidance or Deftness) that must be trained and learned at say lvl 39 or 45.  This won't reduce our aggro ability. It won't help lower lvls where the problems don't necessarily show up badly and will address the 45-55 problems without making huge changes.<P>I think back to what one of the first posters said - we should be a riposting/parrying/dodge fool due to our ability as a LIGHT weight tank.  We are not encumbered by all that heavy plate - so make it worth our while to be a "bit" lighter.<P>Advantages to Verant:  You now have a major money sink as rangers look to buy tons of Tinkerers pack to maintain the weight balance. <P>Dyarrig Lawne<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P> I've scoured the thread so far and have seen no one address these 2 things .<P> Hide(sneak)-<P>    PROBLEM : Hide ONLY functions if immobile , with no way of knowing if successful(unlike Rogues) and if you sneak while hidden and start to move hide breaks .<BR>   Now bards have this same problem . The reason I feel this is wrong is simply . Druids and Bards get an UNdiluted version of Track . yet the hide we get is obsolete before we get (Camo at 15 , HIDE at 25). and Superior camo later on . Looking at it from a balance issue giving us a skill that is effective Negated by other givin abilities  removes some balance .<P>  Solution : Allow our Hide to work just like rogue (and give our sneak the fail/succes message) BUT make them only usable out doors (eing an Outdoorsy class) that way you remove our hide/sneak ability indoors but increase tyem outdoors and maintain balance .<P><BR>  Armor-<P>   Problem : I've noticed a LARGE Disrcepency in the many magical armors givin out in Game .(I'll be using Chest armor in all referances for simplicity due to the large number of differant armor parts) I Pulled up ALL the Cheast pieces USABLE by the following classes WARRIOR.PALLADIN,SHADOWKNIGHT,BARD,SHAMAN,DRUID,RANGER .I found no less than 9 usable by WAR,PAL,SHD,BRD but were unusable by Rangers . ( you say well they can use palte RAngers can't) THEN I found 8 more that are also Usable by ROGUES, and or SHAMANS  both of whom CANNOT wear plate yet while Rangers are left out of these pieces. all OF THESE are attainable on Norrath Not the plains . ALl are higher AC than and BEtter Stats adjustmants than ANY open to the RAnger . C'mon Guys SHAMANs being givin Better armor than us the guys in the thick . I even out of Curiosity Went thru all the Shaman and Druid specific Armors only to DIscover Nope RAngers can't wear ANY . Yet any Armor For RAngers (except Tolans , Ivy or Thurgadin RAnger , all types that other classes have counter parts to) ANYone else could wear. This SEVERELY limits and hinders us as a MElee Class .<P>  Solution : Either a) change a few Items so we can wear as well . or else Maybe make some items drop that we can wear with other classes like SHM.DRU . <P><BR>  I'll be happy to clarify or send all my research materials if you could use them .<P>Many Thanks for your time ,<P>Dubh Stormwarden<BR>Ranger Ronin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, so the theory is Rangers are the Warrior who gave up his armor for Tracking and Druid magic, but kept his offense.<P>One could also argue the Ranger is a Monk like class who gave up Feign Death and some offense for Tracking and Druid magic.  Or, a Ranger is a Roguish class who gave up Backstab and other Roguish abilities for these things.<P>Warriors want to get hit.  Monks can Feign Death when aggro'd.  Rogues Evade.  If Rangers are intended to be at Warrior level offense, they need to be able to inflict their damage for the whole fight, like a Warrior can.  There is a difference between allowing Rangers to actively tank (not what anyone wants) and allowing them to attack without being so fearful of death that they need to reduce damage output in order to control aggro.  Paladins and SK sacrifice offense for spells, but the spells compensate by providing the taunt lost with the offense, allowing them to tank (assuming they can take the damage).  Rangers do not get as many spells or abilities that allow them to inflict damage despite the taunt that the damage creates as Paladins and SK get that allow THEM to take damage despite the low taunt their lack of damage provides.<P>If Rangers could chew away at mobs as second tank in place of a Warrior (maybe a bit less well, like the Knights are lesser tanks to the Warrior) then Rangers would be happy I think.  But a Warrior as second tank doesn't mind getting hit, and the Ranger will get hit just as often and will not be able to continue the assault if he fears getting hit.<P>I am only level 25 as a Ranger and my highest is only 35, so maybe I don't know the real situation fully, but this is how it seems to me.  Rangers should be able to be a solid damage inflicting meleer, a bit behind Warriors in that role perhaps, who cannot tank, just as Knights should be solid tanks, but a bit behind Warriors, who cannot do second melee very well.  Rangers should not be dying faster than Monks or Rogues if they are doing less damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Quests<BR>------------<BR>* Please consider a triggered spawn of some<BR>sort for our epics; regularly booked boss<BR>mob loot (Venril Sathir, for instance)<BR>is now selling for 10k platinum<BR>because it can be multi-quested. Yuck."<P>This will never happen.  Verant uses mob spawn times to limit the rate at which special/uber items come into the game.  You see it with the epic weapons, you see it with jboots (AC spawn).<P>Rangers, let's be a little more conscious about our replies here.  We're discussing balancing issues, not a ranger wishlist.  Moving SOW from 39 to 30 is a wishlist item... it does not balance the class as a whole.  I had no problem getting from level 1-38 without SOW.  I'm sure every class that gets Uber Spell X would like that spell at an earlier level.  Like I said, wishlist item.  Doesn't belong here.  Same with outdoors binding and self-teleports.<P>Raising AC/HP to SK/Pally levels?  Okay, so then we can tank as good as them AND deal better damage than them?!  Let's be realisitic.<P>We are not a tank just because we were able to tank up until level 40-45.  We are being placed in with the rogues and monks as high damage, low tanking classes.  If that's the role Verant wants us in (the fact that they added Jolt proves this), then we should be asking for a higher capacity to avoid damage (dodge/parry/riposte).<P>High damage, low tanking, high damage avoidance would be more balanced than a high damage, low tanking, low damage avoidance class we are now.<P>Fubarness said it best:<BR>"#2) Poor hit avoidance. Rangers are restricted to chain armor which I assume is because they are supposed to be light agile fighters, who can avoid hits better than warriors, but take considerably more damage when hit. However, Rangers have lower dodge caps than most of the other melee'ers and they don't have either the block or evade hit avoidance skills that the other armor restricted melee'ers, Monks and Rogues have."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let's start off quick to save you time Absor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Half-elves: They are a mix of wood elves and humans. Now all their stats are in between the two extremes (which makes sense) - except for Wisdom. As this only affects rangers (only wisdom class half-elves can be) it seems appropriate to mention it here. I was just wondering if our parents ate GM food so that we ended up with a mutated Wisdom  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Seriously, from a realistic role-playing perspective it doesn't make sense.<P>Spells: As mentionned on other hybrid boards, we are penalized three ways. Lower efficiency spells, more mana cost for the same spell, and lower Wisdom as we devote our equipment to melee as well as casting. I'd like to have the mana cost the same - easier to grasp than an ephemereal equivalency formula that decreases the casting cost as you increase in levels. From a roleplaying stand-point it makes sense as well - a spell is a spell is a spell. Regardless who casts it, the effect should be in proportion to the cost.<P>Melee (excludes special abilities - see below): If a ranger is to be comparable to a rogue, instead of a warrior, then we should be given skills in consequence. It makes for a difficult balancing act - both for Verant and us players - if we are comparing apples with oranges. Let's take for granted that we are a mix of druids and rogues. Also take for granted that rogues are balanced. Then our chain mail limitation and HP makes sense (matches the rogues). But, in that case our combat skills should also match those of rogues - offense, defense, parry, dual wield, etc. We are now balanced with a rogue and hence a warrior, etc as well. How does this balance out the spells we receive?  See below.<P>Skills: Rangers receive several non-combat skills as do rogues. Tracking, foraging, stealth, hide, disarm. A rogue gets stealth, hide, pick locks, detect traps, backstab, evade, disarm, create poisons. Rangers rarely, if ever, use hide, sneak or disarm. We do not have the skill points to make it useful. To balance the class remove these skills. Doing so makes the rogue skills (including post 50+ disciplines) as a balance for the ranger spells.<P>Rogues vs. Rangers.<BR>HP: Same<BR>Armor: Same<BR>Weapons: Same<BR>Melee: Should be the same<BR>Non-melee skills.<BR>Pick locks, Disarm, Evade, Disciplines, Backstab, Hide, Sneak, Remove traps, Poisons vs. Spells, Tracking, Foraging.<P>Hope this gives you some ideas.<P>Longetalos <P><BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, also, Tracking needs to be fixed.  Ranger tracking is now a lottery, hopefully you will get the right mobs on your list of 20 guys out of the 500 in the zone, because if not, you can't really move your Track circle very easily to get new mobs, due to the extreme range (and if we did, any new mobs would be VERY far away, since they were out of range before).  So, we need a scroll bar allowing us to track anything in range.  And, we need to be able to sort by range so we dont go running to the other end of the zone to find the same mob that was behind a tree ten feet away (Druids and Bards won't make this error, and aren't burdened so much with the first issue either due to smaller Track range, and are now better trackers than Rangers because of this).<P>To clarify what I mean by the Track circle - the mobs on the Track list which comes up when you press Track will come from a circle with a radius equal to the Track range.  The ones that go on the list are not random, nor are they the closest ones, but are selected based on age I think? The newest ones get on the list right? So any mobs that are older than the twenty or so newest mobs will never go on the list unless you move the ones on your list out of range and don't simultaneously move other new mobs into range.  If a mob is fairly old, it will never get on the list.  Druids and Bards have smaller range and so smaller circles and less new mobs in range, and so can get newer and older mobs, who will be closer than the new mobs the Ranger is getting.  I don't care about other con filters as much, though tracking by typing in a name and better ability to track PCs would be nice for PvP (not the concern of this thread I know).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>I like the changes on test.  I think they are appropriate.  I have a few things to add:<P><BR>1) Increase Hitpoints<P>We need Paladin/SK level hitpoints.  We currently pay the penalty for being a "non-tanking class" three times: We get hit more often because of low defense/parry/dodge, we get hit harder because of poor damage mitigation, and it hurts us more because we have low hitpoints.  Higher hitpoints would make us more group friendly and effcient at high levels (Complete heal being more mana efficient).  <P>Please note: this would not make us solo more effectively.  We still take the same total damage in a solo melee and take exactly the same amount of time to heal/regenerate it back.  So the number of mobs soloable per hour would remain exactly the same.  As any caster can tell you, soloing efficiency is a function of how quickly you refill the pool (mana or hitpoints), not how deep it is.<P>Personally, I think that all the melee hybrids should have the same hitpoints as warriors.  There are enough differentiators otherwise.<P><BR>2) Keep Defense near current levels.  <P>A slight increase in defense is appropriate.  No more than that.<P><BR>3) Jolt sucks, Give us evade. <P>Give us evade after you fix it.  This functions much better as an ability, not as a spell.  EQ spell mechanics are obviously complex and subtle.  I still don't think the net effect of this spell is what you think it is or intended it to be.  Sidestep the problem by making it NOT A SPELL.<P><BR>4) Increase Riposte<P>Riposte is an offensive skill.  It has a defensive effect, but it is an attack based on the vulnerability of an opponent as they attack.  It should be at Warrior levels.<P><BR>5) Trueshot Damage should be greater than Melee Damage<P>Trueshot absolutely positively must result in more damage than the equivalent time spent in melee.  Otherwise it is a waste of time.  This is a discipline.  It should be *cool*.<P>6) Fix Track<P>I know you have plans here.  Get around to it.  Soon.<P><BR>7) Give us Scale of the Wolf <P>I know you won't give us TP/gate/evac.  Give us a better travel spell at 51.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055463&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055463&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
