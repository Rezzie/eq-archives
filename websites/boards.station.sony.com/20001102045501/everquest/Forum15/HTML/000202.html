</FONT><HR>******Is life as a high lvl bard fulfilling? Or are you stuck with sloppy seconds on all aspects of the game?<P>It depends on want you want out of the game.  Do you WANT to hack and slash your way to glory?  Then you picked the wrong class.  Do you want to wield fast magics and detroy woth a flick of the wrist?   Then you picked the wrong class.  <P>However, if you want the freedom to go anywhere, and fit yourself into any group, then the Bard is totally completely unequaled.   Can't find a group, ok I'll go kill some hill or sand giants to pass the time, the loot is great!  Not too may poor bards at higher levels.  If you get a melee heavy group, warriors, rangers, monks, you have a great lineup of songs to make them a glorious fighting unit.  Get in a group of all casters?  You can pump up their defense, AC and MR so they don't get hurt AND give them more mana faster than an enchanter of the same level casting clarity, as well as divert the attantion of the mob while they blast it to bits.<P>Got to get from point A to point B in a hurry and no ports availible?  No one can get ther faster than a bard. No one. No spell, no item, nothing can get there faster.<P>Who else can cast spells ON THE RUN? No one.  Play a caster and you get an idea of how annoying that can get.  Not for us though.<P>So if you HAVE to be the blood covered hero standing on a pile of your enemies, then yes, change classes immediately.  But if you want the ABSOLUTE knowledge that that warrior standing on a pile of enemies wouldn't be up there without YOU then the bard is for you.<P>And we just flat out look better than anyone else too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First off, Deiko, theres a guy in my guild named Deikon.  Thought that was funny.<P>Second, no, I have no wish to just be a melee idiot.  I pride myself on twisting songs AND instruments/weapons with the best of em.  However, you can't say that bards are the best at anything.  (oh, except running).  We don't snare the best, we don't tank the best, we don't nuke the best, we don't heal the best.  So what else is there?  Yes, we do them all, but we don't do them all very WELL.  <P>That is my problem.  We do a lot of things, yes, and we do them with a decent amount of ability.  But is that going to get you by after a certain point?  Just how good is a 33 DOT when the average mob has 500+ hp?  <P>Ah well, perhaps I don't want an answer.  I guess I'll have to get there and decide for myself how good it is.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't understand what you mean really, "Where does it get you"?  It gets you to be the most versatile class in the game is what.  Sounds like what you want is to be a powerhouse blaster. Become a wizard, I hear they do great amounts of damage.<P>And as for that 33 dot you mentioned, do the math.  At later levels, when you get Tuyens at 38, try twisting that with Fufils.  I zapped myself with both the other day, and after 10 seconds I had done myself 150 pnts of damage.  Add hand to hand damage and you could bring that up to 160, maybe 170 over a 10 second period.  Thats close to 1000 pnts in a minute.  And it doesn't have to be recast, we can just keep going as long as the mob is alive.  <P>Go a few levels higher and add Tuyens chant of frost to Tuyens chant of flame and Fulils.  Thats WAY over 1000, maybe up to 1500, not sure, I'm not there yet.  Now I'm sorry, but that is very very very respectable dmage for anyone, any caster, any melee character out there.  And no recast time, no mana drain, just you and your drum.  OHHHH and add a magic drum to the mix and the sky's the limit!<P>And our non gamage songs are not mediocre.  Our ac songs may not give as much ac as say a clerics, but a clerics won't add a damage shield AND increase resistance to magic AND give ultravision all in the same spell.  Our damage spell doesn't do as much as say a druid or mage, but it does also decrease AC or MR or attack speed at the same time, theirs doesn't as well.  Oh sure, you can always point to a specific spell of somebodies and say "This one does".  OK yeah this ONE does, but ALL of ours does something besides the main effect.  <P>The problem is most people have no clue as to the wide effect our songs do to a party and mob, so they only see the main effect (AC or damage) and think it's mediocre.  Also, the mid 20's isn't all that great, at least until 26.  Get that fear song and try fear/snare a try.  (Yeah yeah chains was nerfed, it still WORKS though)  The bard chain/fear is the secret envy of all caster classes whether they admit it or not.  Then later, in late 20's early 30's or songs really pick up again.  Like I said earlier, if you want to be the Great Magician/Wizard or whatever throwing incredible energies, drop the bard.  If you just want to out-cool everyone in a sublime way, keep plugging away as a bard, you will be out in the front soon enough.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think that we are taking the "don't do things well" much too serious, or misinterpreting it.<P>I prefer to think that we actually do things fairly well. No one can save a caster as fast as I can when he/she is being attacked, not even the taunting wonders. I just click on Charm, and my Caster or Healer is saved. Does he need to run? I just gave him/her a chance. Oh, they are out of mana? No problem, let's sit here for a minute and watch that blue bar move along. Ohh darn, those tanks have two very heavy weapons with a slow delay, I gotta get over there and help with that ... <P>I don't consider that a problem or an issue where we do not do things well. I actually believe that we do them fairly well, and a lot of that has to do with the quality of the Bard that is playing it. Unffortunately, this brings up the reason why many play the Bard, and also question the motives of why someone plays the Bard ... and I can tell you that there are many of them that do not play it well, or simply put on the weapons from their twink, play the mana song, and if someone dies in their group, that is not their problem ... they will say "Well, I did give the healer all kinds of mana, and he/she failed to heal them. Not my fault." ... well, I may be criticized for my opinions here and there and every where, but just about everyone that I have played with knows that I am always ready to help them and make sure that I can keep them alive, and I do this as well as anybody ... and I think that the beautiful benefit here is that I can do all this without using any mana at all, or slow down the group in any way.<P>And one other thing. You missed the reading at the beginning when you first created your Bard. I am a writer and proud of it, and in that sense I play a Bard, because it is a fun extention of my right arm, or left arm ... and not just a game!<P>So be a Bard, stop worrying about your being deficient in the all important ego department, and play the songs well, and help the groups, and then go write about it. I've put 8 Bard's names in the annals of literature and they will be there forever. The game will not be remembered after a few years ... how's that for irony?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Also, keep in mind that all the other classes basically do ONE thing well and suck at the rest (with a few exceptions).  Warriors do alot of damage with their weapons but they take forever to regen HP's and they are sooooo slow compared to a bard, even with a SoW.  Pallys are slow too, and do less damage then warriors, but have LoH and some spells. ALL the casting classes have to med.  After playing a bard for 6 months i started two caster classes, and let me tell ya, i am SICK of seeing that stupid book.  As a bard, you hardly ever have to look at it.  Mages and Wizzies have awful AC and no melee ability, if they run out of mana, they are useless, and again, they have to med too.<P>Basically, im saying that all the classes are severely lacking in talents that other classes have.  As a bard, you get to see more of these abilities then any other class, albeit at reduced success.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I am also a 25 bard. The problem I am running into, is that people think, oh a bard, they are mediocore, lets get something else. A bard is great in a group that already has everything else, in one that doesn't, we aren't that great. We do our things over time. Our heal? It won't save that tank that jsut went berserk. I have found a bard is great for reducing down time.

</FONT><HR>I've gotten up to lvl 30, and my prediction was right.<P>Most of my skills (Forage, Sneak, Hide) are maxed at pathetic lvls.  Around 40s and 50s.<P>I get resisted way too often by low blues, and it gets worse as the cons up go.  Melee skills are laughable at best.  And the worst part is, seeing other bards think they are tanks cuz they got the ph*t l8wt, and they hardly use instruments, twist like they got arthritis, and think that tanking makes up for it.  Pathetic!<P>I know no one at Verant reads this board in official capacity, but how about better rewarding bards who twist songs using instruments, which is the height of bard powers.  After playing a few hours on my bard, I am literally exhausted from all the song clicking, the item switching.  What other class puts that much effort into their class?  Closest thing is the puller, and that just doesn't compare.<P>For all that effort, bards should be rewarded.  I remember GZ saying how VI wants to see the bard class played actively, their effectiveness a direct result of the dexterity of the player.  Well dammit, give us a compulsive reason to do so.  I'm actually waiting for lvl 32, so I can click the mana song, and just chill.<P>A hella tired bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Mmm, Bards. Certainly one of the most difficult classes to play and everybody seems confused at what we are or what we can do for a group. Not even Verant seems sure. Case in point: we are not hybrids apparently (we are a 'special' case) but which forum are we in? Thats right, hybrids P <P>To the original poster, who was reaching level 26, I would say crack on...things are about to get more interesting. In the next few levels you will get Fear, Charm, Mez and of course, Mana song. For me these completely transformed my playing experience, especially Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity. Your melee will really suck by now, making that nice armour and weapons look like all show and no go. But you now have a different dimension to your game. You can still melee but can buff/debuff at the same time. Or you can do some mob control with Charm and Mez. <P>Bard buffing can be amazing. If you want to see jaws drop at how a Bard can buff, try out any of the MR songs with a drum; then see who in your group wants to be without it when tackling mobs that can charm THEM. <P>Charm to me was tremendous fun and still is; turn an angry mob into your plaything and watch it dish out more damage than your tanks. Sure it doesn't last long but you can chain cast it without mana cost. <P>The acid test on whether I had picked the right class was the ability of getting into groups in busy zones. This seems to have got easier as I levelled, partly because of the mana song but more generally because Bards are so versatile. As group members change, the Bard can adjust their role accordingly. In one group you can be enchanter, buffer/debuffer or tank. Which other class could do that?<P>In case anyone thinks I am trying to paint too rosy a picture here, I am not. Did I ever regret picking the class? Lots of times and each time we get stiffed again with a nerf I vow to start another class. What keeps me going? A sense of achievement. I look at (say) a level 50 &lt;insert own class here!&gt; and i think bah, easy. I look at a level 50 Bard and I think yeah, nice going!<P><BR>Dennaa<BR>Level 41 Bard, Povar.<P>Message for Verant: any chance of us ever getting a level 49 song?
