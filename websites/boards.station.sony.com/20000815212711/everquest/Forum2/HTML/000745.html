</FONT><HR>You thought they were small and swift, didn't you ? He he, wrong:<P>1) Post-50 Wizards don't need the missing large DD spells, because a double cast of Draught does the job (so Draughts are "large" if cast twice...) but<BR>2) Draughts are swift in single-cast, but "slow" in chain-cast, and this might be the hidden reason why some post-50 Wizards feel less effective than before. I suspect Draughts need a cast time of 2.5 instead of 3; the level 60 Sunstrike could also be given a shorter cast time (same as Ice Comet).<P>I know, DD isn't everything, but Gordon knows I have another post about AE damage, and he had better answer it some day :-(<P>All I had to say was said above; read the rest only if you want the details.<P>1) Post-50 Wizards don't need the missing large DD spells<P>A level 51 Wizard chain-casting two Draughts of Fire may generate:<BR>1286 damage (643x2), for<BR>430 mana (215x2), in the course of<BR>7.2 seconds (3+2.2+3).<P>(Note: I was never able to measure precisely the standard recovery time, but I assume it is 2.2 seconds).<P>The double Draught of Fire looks very much like a classic upgrade to Ice Comet:<BR>+15% damage (versus 1120)<BR>+7.5% mana cost (versus 400)<BR>+30% cast time (versus 6.3).<P>However:<BR>- the "spell" is split in two halves (with added versatility, but a few situational drawbacks versus a "whole" spell, such as: more chances to break Root, risk of earlier aggro when chain-casting, etc).<BR>- the "spell" has a poor swiftness: the double Draught has a -12% swiftness penalty  (damage / cast time) versus the single Ice Comet. <P>If you are a 51+ Wizard complaining that you don't get "large" new DD spells giving you enough "damage output", I believe you're mistaken. Cast double Draughts; and don't seek Rains as a replacement, unless you want a chance to improve your damage/mana (that's another matter).<P>2) There IS something wrong with 51+ Wizard DD: downgraded swiftness !<P>Isn't swiftness supposed to be the prime strong point of Wizards ?<P>Draught of Fire may be felt as swift, because its single-cast swiftness (damage / cast time) versus Ice Comet is +21%: looks good and versatile, but... it's not that good.<P>As outlined above, Draughts need to be chain-cast, more than earlier DD spells, if large damage is to be dealt. Chain-cast swiftness (damage / 'cast + recast time', an indicator of non-stop chain-casting damage-dealing speed) is the best measure of how a Wizard is able to "kill the right mob at the right time" to earn his/her place in a group. Draught of Fire deals slower damage than Ice Comet when the time comes for the Wizard to step forward and chain-cast. A minor gain in chain-cast swiftness versus Ice Comet is achieved only at level 57, when Wizards gain Draught of Ice. Isn't it somewhat late ?<P>Table of how much CHAIN-CAST SWIFTNESS (damage / 'cast + recast time') Wizards gain with each new DD spell (excluding Bolts and all-or-nothing Shocks):<P>Level 4: +83% versus level 3<BR>Level 8: +99% versus level 7<BR>Level 12: +96% versus level 11<BR>Level 16: +18% versus level 15<BR>Level 20: not worth mentioning (Force Shock can't be chain-cast)<BR>Level 24: +36% versus Flame Shock at level 23<BR>Level 29: +20% versus level 28<BR>Level 34: +11% versus level 33<BR>Level 39: +8% versus level 38<BR>Level 44: +39% versus level 43<BR>Level 49: +62% with Ice Comet, versus level 48<BR>Level 51: -6% with Draught of Fire, versus Ice Comet at level 50<BR>(Voltaic Draught and Draught of Jiva have the same stats as Draught of Fire)<BR>Level 57: +7% with Draught of Ice, versus earlier Draughts at level 56, and +4% versus Ice Comet<BR>Level 60: +26% versus Draught of Ice at level 59, and +33% versus Ice Comet.<P>The "shining" gains are obtained at levels 4, 8, 12, 24, 44 and 49.<BR>The poorest gains (or the penalties) are obtained at levels 20 and  51-59 (the improvement of level 57 comes too late).<BR>The "so-and-so" gains are levels 16, 29, 34, 39 and 60 (the improvement of level 60 comes too late).<P>With a Draught cast time of 2.5 instead of 3:<BR>At level 51, Draught of Fire would give a minimal +4% chain-cast swiftness bonus versus Ice Comet, instead of a penalty.<BR>The double-cast Draught of Fire would also be 4.5% swifter than the single-cast Ice Comet, instead of being less swift.<BR>At level 57, Draught of Ice would give a +15.5% chain-cast swiftness bonus versus Ice Comet.<BR>At level 60, Sunstrike would still give a +13.5% chain-cast swiftness bonus versus Draught of Ice at level 59, but, if Verant was kind enough to give Sunstrike the cast time of Ice Comet (6.3 instead of 7), the chain-cast swiftness bonus versus Draught of Ice would be restored to a well-earned +23%.<BR>All this wouldn't be tremendous, but at least the post-50 Wizards would have a chance to feel they are capable of a respectable damage output.<P>(Don't ask me about the cast times of Lures and Flames of Ro, there's a limit to what I can do to help).<P>APPENDIX:<BR>I'd like to know how a Warrior's damage-dealing speed improves from level 1 to 60, to have a mirror reference. I suppose that all classes feel that they need more time to kill the mobs, as level improves. But maybe some classes lose more kill speed than others (as level improves). It's a catastrophy for Wizards if they lose kill speed more than other classes do (as level improves), because speed is supposed to be the Wizards' most valuable asset.<P>Nicolbolas, Karana<BR>See also my claim on Wizard AE damage:<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000121.html</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Very good points=)<P>I agree to them, and if you add to that the fact that wizards compared to a warrior will run out of mana, that means we can only deal out a finite number of damage while a warrior can keep dealing out damage all the time untill they run out of HP. Their HP will be kept up by the cleric untill the cleric is out of mana so they can keep going for quite some time, and with kunark weapons do massive amounts of damage=) So comparing killing speed with a warrior might be tricky.<P>Well im off have fun brother wizards=)<P>"Full mana!"<P>Sorasil Lorewind<BR>58th Evoker<BR>Solusek Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sinari (Dax ?),<BR>"All you've done here is demonstrated that the amount of damage done per nuke is yet another variable in the spell balance equation."<BR>What do you call "the spell balance equation" ? A math equation, or a gameplay balance issue ? I don't get it. I want to demonstrate that "damage per nuke" doesn't matter most, but is only part of the "damage per nuke / cast+recast time" ratio, which matters most.<BR>"You assume something is wrong because a trend is not continued. This is not necessarily correct."<BR>I am not "assuming", only suspecting. There are only 2 stages in a Wizard's career when he/she loses chain-casting swiftness: level 20 with the non-chain-castable Force Shock, and level 51 with Draughts. I'm not sure it's WRONG, but I'm sure it's UNPLEASANT, and people should notice it. Post-51 Wizards chain-casting Draughts should feel as weak, for their level, as level 20-23 Wizards chain-casting weakly their old level 16 Flame Shock.<P>Sorasil,<BR>"wizards compared to a warrior will run out of mana, that means we can only deal out a finite number of damage while a warrior can keep dealing out damage all the time untill they run out of HP (...) So comparing killing speed with a warrior might be tricky."<BR>He he, this is the basic rules of being a Wizard: you have a load of flexible quick damage to distribute, but the load is finite. What I'm saying is that this damage NEEDS to be perceived as "quick" to be useful, otherwise it doesn't compensate for being finite. I hope very much that, on the average, I am able to deal damage more quickly than a Warrior over a short period of time, otherwise nobody will need me to save lives chain-casting (call a Warrior instead...) I'll try and enquire about Warrior damage-dealing speed evolution one of these days (I guess the evolution is constant, while ours is irregular).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Heh, from other topics it appears that, in addition to poor swiftness, there is indeed a post-50 issue on Wizard damage generation (direct damage a Wizard can generate burning all mana bar).<P>At level 35, I believe I'm able to kill an average high blue mob (level 34) with 85% of my mana (if you prefer, I can kill 1.2 high blue mobs with my mana bar). This is what a Wizard needs to be effective in a group.<BR>So the formula is:<BR>Direct damage which a Wizard can generate burning mana bar = average hit points of a mob 1 level lower x 1.2<BR>(Then, killing speed must be adjusted; killing a high blue mob chain-casting normally takes 40-50 seconds).<P>I heard that post-50 mobs routinely had 8-10-14K hit points (but I wasn't told their level exactly). Assuming an average level 54 mob has 10K hit points, a level 55 Wizard should be able to generate 12K damage burning his/her mana bar... Whereas he/she can generate "only" 7.3K damage with 11 Draughts.<P>Assessing the sheer damage issue takes precedence, but still Draughts ARE slow in chain-casting.<P>Gee, I begin to think I won't be playing EverQuest much longer now (awful AE in 40s and awful DD in 50s, that's too much... I'll stop at level 39 !)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The Draught line was created to give wizards the option of doing less damage at similar mana/damage ratio compared to ice comet, and also to give them similar spells across the three elements that the wizards control.  The reasoning behind "less damage" was to reduce the amount that the wizard would aggro the target. Had we wanted to continue along the same lines as ice comet, we could have given similar damage spells with equal damage, mana, and casting time requirements.<P>In this case, the additional time required to stack two draughts versus one ice comet is what you "pay" for the reduced amount that you aggro the target.  <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon I think you may be missing a point here.  Wizards are not getting much more effecient Post 50.  We are more like a level 50 wizard with a small increase in mana and a little better at resistance....supposedly.  Our spells are not getting all that much more mana efficient and we are not getting faster at dealing damage.<P>Its been said by you that wizards can deal dmg faster in a short amount of time then any other class yet here we see that post 50 we get slower.  Also when can a wizard actually mana dump?  Only if you time it prefectly with a enchanter to clear the agro.  Then you are really using 2 players to do 1 job.  <P>Don't get me wrong I like my wizard and I know that at level 48 I'm among the few classes that can still solo blues.  Problem is I am more of a solo class then a group class.  What class doesn't outdamage a wizard (take clerics heals as dmg and enchanters crowd control as save agianst dmg)  Enchanters would do less...maybe bards to bu they are there to augment the group.  <P>So this reduces my job to blast the last 2 shots and be prepared for evac.  I sit thru 90% of the the battle most of the time.<P>If I do more than this then the group ends up waiting for me.  (note that I haven't got IC yet so when that happens I'll blast 1 time probably)<P>Reztarn Solarflare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I can appreciate the sentiment behind the reduced damage to reduce aggro and allow you to contribute to a fight with a smaller blast at a greater mana efficiency than downgrading spells. That's truly a fantastic thing. However, I do wish the casting time was a bit faster to compensate, or as some other folks have discussed, think about lowering the between-casting delay further for wizards (or for certain spells).<P>As for it being a way to ensure reduction of aggro, I think the lower threshhold on damage itself is a good enough contribution in that regard. The rest is all about strategy and tactics, and having a faster cycle or cast time gives the wizard more timing flexibility and lets him make the call if he wants to escalate aggro or let it reduce. He can pause between his blasts or chain gun. Many times I WANT a high aggro as quick as possible, like trying to tear a foe off a wounded enchanter...<P>The other thing to consider is the addition of the Concussion spell is a far better means to manage and reduce aggro than having the casting time of Draught manage it. A caster who is being careful on aggro will periodically toss a Concussion on the foe between blasts and stuns, which is a fun excercise in learning proper timing. <P>If I'm doing Concussion between a blast, that's automatically adding like 6+ seconds between, as I wait for the spells to cycle again. Plus tossing on 20 mana on top of it.<P>I really do think it'd not hurt anything and give us a little oomph when chain-casting to reduce the casting time on Draught a little more. (Or better yet, reduce the hold time.)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sounds to me Gordon that the official verant stance was not to improve the wizard but to give them exactly what they already had but just in a slightly modified package. Casting one Ice commit later in a fight is the same (nearly) as casting one draught, then waiting and casting another. I do want to point out the Ice commit method allows the wizard uninterupted med time while just casting once Vs the option of the other so the benifit if any is that the mana starved wizard would opt for casting 1 draught?<P>This is another in a long line Official Verant stances of smoke and mirrors when it comes to the wizard class. <P>I ask why are you referring to the wizards damage to mana ratio for clarification of a Verant planning decision when public statements from Verant have been that the wizard is a damage to time master? Are we to assume that with the draught series damage to mana ratios were factors that out weighted other class defining parameters such as damage to time? Just curious as to how this decision of longer cast time equals less taunt factor when taunt is by damage done. If Ice Commit has potential taunt of 1120 and draught much less why instill a recast so long and defend it as a purposeful factor? Isn't that why you yourself Gordon say Wizards should find a group with an enchanter for crowd control? Your logic does not fit what you spooned us previously. <P>Vin </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the uninterrupted med time... actually medding between the two casts will probably give you more mana.<P>The reason is mana regens only at certain times (they call it tick).  If you happen to be medding when mana regens, you get more mana.  It doesn't matter if you had been medding since the last tick or just sit down.  As long as you are medding when the tick counts, you get all the medding mana regen.<P>So, when you are casting your ice comet, you are going to lose all the medding mana regen during the cast.  If you are casting twice and medding in between, you will get a chance to have a slightly better mana regen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>One question that i've been asking since Kunark opened and has yet to be answered:<P>What exactly have wizards gotten in the expansion?  You have basically given us two spells and just repeated them for over and over!  Draught has less agro and Lure is less resisted - but you repeat them for 9 levels!!!  Yes the new elements ARE nice BUT they should be like EVERY other spell in the game and have a minimal increase over the previous one.  Draught of Ice is the ONLY one that has a slight benefit and it comes at lvl 57.  Even the new AE spells lines increase damage from one spell to the next.  Then we get Sunstrike which is really a joke with its cast time and damage output.<P>I think the problem is this - Wizards needed these spells BEFORE Kunark to balance our class.  Verant threw them in now and thought that would make us happy and balanced - which it MIGHT up to level 52 (if you want to give Verant A LOT of leeway) but afterwards we our even more unbalanced than before Kunark.  To get NO sort of increases from lvl 52-56 is a COMPLETE joke, and the increases from 57-59 aren't even worth commenting on.  New elements and versatility is great BUT all other classes are getting way more powerfull while we stay the same.  Druids getting IC and Rogues backstabbing for 1k while Wizards so what?!?!?!?<P>Pluton<BR>Lvl 57 Wizard<BR>Terris Thule<BR>Officer of Dark Brethren</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I personally appreciate the response Abashi, but I do have a question for you...<P>I am not high enough level to know of this yet, but, I've heard many wizards say they can only do 7000-8000 damage on a full burn in their mid 50's, whereas blue mobs in the same range have 10,000hp.  If wizards are to help a group, they can't even take down one MOB with a full burn, as they used to be able to do.  The other part of it, is if they are just helping their group a little, being as they can only do 70%-80% of the total damage of one mob on a full burn, even helping them a little would cost a lot of mana, and adding a lot to downtime, making them a liability to a group.<P>Could you explain why this is, or check into it and see if it is really a problem?  I would hate to get into Post 50 and find that my effectiveness has diminished so much.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>lore22, good point however, I cannot confirm nor deny that without actual mana numbers but it sure makes logical sense. Certainly the taunt factor is less using the Ice commit method listed above than using two spells of anything, IMOHO. <P>Kunark added the concussion spell for the wizard class, or should I say good raced wizard class. My mid 50's wiz does not have this spell, hell i forget what he has I play him so little because the fun factor of the wizard class is rated the same as having a high colonic. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>One more comment.<P>My wizard rarely if ever agro'd a mob in grp play.  So, again it is obvious that Verant isn't aware of how a player should play this seemingly one dimensional class.  Yes, I am experienced as I have a 55 necro and a 54 ranger (I also have two other classes above 50).<P>Comparatively the responses from Verant on this are ill-thought out and very poor in their planning if that's what they had intended.<P>I'm tiring more and more of Verant's responses to legit questions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Arggg do you have any clue how ill-thought that reply was? Its obvious you only see what you want to see. The answer was perfectly valid. If it doesn't pertain directly to you then take what does pertain to you and disregard the rest! Last I checked you didn't design the game, you don't in fact have any credentials that would lead us to believe you could. Just because you play in the world doesn't mean you fully understand it. Your experiences are just that, YOURS. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000745&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000745&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
