</FONT><HR>Actually I seriously doubt necros care. The spear of fate (shaman FA) has an effect very similar to splurt.<P>Splurt however is not a class defining spell.<P>Necromancers have a whole basket full of dots, including several that were exclusive to shaman pre 50. One more or less isn't going to affect them at all.<P>However if shaman got pants that cast level 60 necro pets, I think they'd be suitably outraged.<P>Their lich line is class defining,their pet line is class defining. Splurt is not class defining. <P>Unfortunately, Turgor's Insects (51 Shaman slow) *is* class defining.<P>Give that to another class,especially one that can take hits better than a shaman and is already required in a group(ie.a tank class) and there is really no reason to have us around. Sure we do other useful stuff, but we don't do anything else that is vital. <P>I'm all for removing class 'requirements', I know what a hassle they can be.<P>Unfortunately last I checked, enchanters and clerics still had more or less a monopoly. In virtually ALL meaningful high level encounters they cannot be replaced. <P>Last time I tried to get into the Crypt in Sebilis, we *needed* a rogue.<P>Last time I wanted to go to the Plane of Hate, we *needed* a wizard.<P>Last time I needed to retrieve a corpse, I *needed* a necromancer.<P>Last time I wanted to fight fire giants we *needed* a feign class. (shadowknight,monk).<P>Last time I wanted to hunt rares in trakanon's teeth we *needed* a class with tracking. (ranger,druid,bard)<P>Last time I needed to get a replacement to my group during a raid we *needed* a magician.<P>So given that enchanters,clerics and fighter types are required in all cases, if you don't need shaman for slowing, where are we needed?<P>Is it our laughably green pets or our group charisma buffs that you feel you can't do without?<P>Inquiring minds want to know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Jalariz,<P>  play an enchanter, and you will understand. Shamans are a class that cannot be replaced. I failed to understand your post full of cut and pastes, but if that was indeed an insult to me so be it. I know I am right, and I know you are wrong. I play a 54 enchanter and a 51 shaman and I hang with higher levels of both classes. I have been on raids to every high level thing besides veeshans peak, and believe me, you cannot, ever, replace a shaman or a spell like turgurs with a weapon. there is so many ways in which it could go wrong, what do you do on pultiple mob pulls, what happens when an enchanter fails a mez and a juggernaut is pounding on him, should the rogue or whoever has the weapon switch targets and hope for a proc? Be reasonable, you whine like a child. Make some sense before you start spouting idiotic ramblings. Show me one, just one situation in the whole game where a slow proccing weapon would be more efficient or more desired than having a shamana round. you can't do it can you. Didn't think so.<P>There is a big thread on this over at the shamans crucible, basically everyone is telling Eudin the troll to shutup about the same stupid "shaman is dead because of this weapon" kind of crap. Shaman has been killed about ten times now according to the troublemaking whiners.

</FONT><HR>Complain all you want about the Enc + Enc vs Enc + Shm issue.  About how needed you are in a group, class envy whatever.  Wether you are shaman or not, having a lvl 60 effect on a weapon (proc or not) is just wrong and EVERYBODY here should agree on that.  That it is a class defining spell (that IS why you invite shamans to your group) makes it even worse.<P>That aside, do we even KNOW if Earth sap is a 75% slow?  Assuming the entry in the spdat file is correct, it's listed as 16% (lvl 1) to 75% (lvl 60).  Given the other fields for that entry it seems that the spell Turgur was copied (although minimum lvl reduced).  One clue is that it uses 250 mana (normally effects don't have a mana cost).  But here is the kicker, items (just like potions) can have a fixed lvl OR the lvl can be the lvl of the wielder.  SO, it's possible that the 'lvl' of the weapon is say 40 which means it's a 55% slow.  The only way to confirm would be to log (unreliable) or have shaman of various lvls try to overwrite.<P>I suspect Verant was tired of creating multiple 'slow' effect and created one (just like the Haste effect) that could be used for multiple weapons.  They would have called it slow expect that one already exists and is capped far too low.  If on the other hand the lvl IS based on the wielder I would assume it's a bug that needs to be fixed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, now this weapon is seriously messed up.  If any other class had their class defining ability added to a proc that is exactly as good as their best spell, they would scream bloody murder.  Well that's exactly what shaman are going to do.  This is not going to get dropped by our community.  The main problem as I see it isn't that this weapon exists, but given that it has aready been acquired, it doesn't appear like it's going to be all that rare.  This is a epic level weapon minus the stats.  So much for class interdependence.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin, I guess I should keep responding to you, like you respond to necros?<P>"Maybe you don't know how to play your class."<P>or<P>"No class that can solo, should be useful in a group."<P>As I said before, with the many idiot posts Eduin<BR>has made on Necro threads, and so many shamans cheering him on, not alot of sympathy from me and my pals for you.<P>Also, it is time to nerf that shaman pet some, you know, you are not a solo class ,or a pet class. So, lets make it like the wizard and cleric pets, good for show, and that's it.<P>Oh, and to the post that asked how necros feel about a item for other classes that use necro spells? How is this<P>Blood DoT- Bloodfire<BR>Taps- Bloodpoint, Lifeleech<BR>Darkness- Serratted Bone Dirk<P>So, what is the big deal? Make a item that give lich, just complete the set. It is the only necro spell that is not on a item of some sort that is not useable by necros.<P>Also I hope it is just as buggy as the necro spell. Will just give me a warm feeling to see other classes die like pigs, when they don't pick up on the bug with the spell.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I highly doubt the slow is this good. The highest proc currently on a weapon is a level 34 spell (superior healing on the artifact butcherblock hammer,) but I could be wrong, and Velious may change some stuff, but not this drastically. NO weapon besides artifacts and very rare god items have ever had an outstanding proc as well as outstanding stats. <P>I doubt this weapon procs at all levels. Kunark dungeon weapons had level 45-50 proc limits, I doubt they would change this in Velious.<P>As for shamans, they are not useless. Enchanter + Shaman is a much better combo in a group then two enchanters. Shaman stat buffs are NOT useless. Tuna and Kragg stack with all HP buffs except the shielding line, and kragg is like 400 hp. Increase all party hp by 400? That's not useless. Strength adds like 80 attack rating. Dexterity increases proc chance tremendously, I proc up to 3 times more often from personal experience with my Felhammer. Dexterity also increases your chance in combat not to get interrupted while spell casting, every caster i know asks for this buff, especially enchanters. Stamina buff is more hp, maybe only 40-50 more, but it adds up. <P>Shamans can also resist debuff, slow, heal, and stat buff. You guys that complain got to understand that there are very few class restricted spells. Summon corpse, Complete Heal, Call of Hero, that's about it. When you add someone to your group, you get a "bushel" of abilities. You try to mix these bushels to get the best combo, and thus the best group. Do we want a magician who can resist debuff, fire shield, pet, and nukes... or do we want someone who can evac, nuke, heal, and snare? Each class will add not just one ability to a group, but a few. Shamans are my preffered "secondary healer", much more so then a druid because they regen mana faster and take away a duty from the enchanter. <P>Even that being said, there are some classes that are too group friendly. Enchanters are one of them, Clerics are close behind. Enchanters allow their group to take on things that 2 groups would get killed by, and they lower downtime and increase tank power by a good 20-30%. These two classes are so group friendly, that they have become a necessary foundation of ANY deep xp group in a dungeon. Any group that is missing an enc or a cleric is playing VERY dangerously deep inside a dungeon. They have no choice, monsters hit way too hard, have too many hp, and almost never come alone. Enc and clerics are necessary, and they shouldn't be. Highly preffered? Ok, but not critical.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I apologize for not doublechecking my post.<P>I do agree that Shaman + Enchanter is a good thing.  I do agree that this weapon will not replace a Shaman in a group just cause the tanks all have one.  What is the gripe?  The gripe is that this weapon has a Shaman-type only spell assigned to it.  And not just any spell, the Shaman Class Defining spell, and the best one at that.  Why are a lot of Shaman upset about this?  Because several of our spell lines have been given to other classes or nerfed.<P>Shaman aren't the best at anything, except one thing, and that's slowing (you *can* add in stat buffs there if you really want).  At high level you want the best.  Your group has no tank.  Warrior and Ranger are LFG.  Who do you pick for the job?  The post 50 game is comprised of forming groups and the people in those groups performing their specialty(ies).  Shaman are becoming less and less special month after month.<P>This weapon was put in by someone at Verant intentionally.  It didn't just spawn out of nowhere.  Someone at Verant felt that a 13/20 dagger should have at maximum a 75% slow.  Whether or not that meats there "overpowered" algorithm, it's still extremely bad form.  I am offended that they took my high level group wanted ability and put it on a weapon.<P>Jilariz Intrepidus<BR>Level 53 Iksar Mystic<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But if you understood risk vs reward you would understand that this will not be a common item in the game for along time.  Dragon Necro is not one of the easiest places to get to in the game.  Plus you fail to say that this item drops off a 63+ rat guarded by a 60+ war.  Also has around 30 or so 10 min spawning rats in the room before it...and around 20 to 30 or so roamers.

This new item with the ability to slow as much as a level 60 ORACLE is the straw that broke the camel's back.<P>Malosi line..pimped away to Magicians at almost the same level.<BR>Slow spells..pimped away to enchanters and item procs.<BR>Stat buffs..dubious value, but dex pimped away to enchanters for their WW illusion anyway. THANKS VERANT!!<BR>Cripple line..pimped away to enchanters. Verant comes out with an AE upgrade in performancee to this type of debuffer..and gives it to Druids! (?!?..)<BR>Spirit of the Wolf..pimped away to Druids<BR>Regeneration line..pimped away to Druids, and they get more efficient group versions<P>Basically, Shaman abilities are pimped away with little regard to shaman. No,  no single action of this sort is  going to kill the shaman class, but repetitively doing things like this WILL help weaken it. Consider it the death of a thousand pinpricks if you will.  What the hell is the defining shaman ability? What is going to be left? <P>At high levels basically most of what I do is Turgur. When I ding 60, I will have malo. One Shaman will be required on an Uber mob raid to cast malo. ONE. I also bring stackable health buffs to a group or raid. The rest is pretty much crap when you get down to it. Now this weapon invades on what I do, and it has the ability to do it at the effectiveness I will at level 60. That is beyond reasonable.<P>Change it to slow 50%..55%..but NOT 75%..no way in hell bucko.<P>Give me my clarity 2 proccing hammer, my complete heal boots, my group magic resist bracer, etc. This item should NOT have the power it does. No item should take away class defining abilies. 75% slow is considered by most shaman to be a class defining ability. We take a mean mob and turn it into a kitten that can't hurt others. Now anyone with this piercer can do the same. THANKS, GUYS.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I have a different opinion on this problem about a too strong proc...<P>As I see the game, it is made around grouping and working together. So one good item like this makes the whole group stronger. The shaman doesnt have to slow every single mob (given that the proc comes in often enough), so he has more mana for healings when needed, or he can make a little crowd control when things get out of hand and such things.<P>Oh, yes, I know, shamans are no healers, clerics are (and now please dont start that stupid thread again that clerics are too powerful eduin, as it seems we need powerful healers in Velious), but as we all know a CH takes 10 seconds cast time and this can be very long if mobs are beating a tank down, so one or two gheals from a shaman can make a difference.<P>By adding powerful items Verant doesnt TAKE something, no Verant ADDs something to the group. And from all that I hear about Velious (still waiting for the game in germany) we will need strong and powerful groups to go deeper inside this icy land.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's a crazy idea, how about we add something new instead of (you guessed it) Pimping away the LAST major ability Shaman have for their own in this game.<P>What part 'walks all over a classes last defining ability' did you not understand?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>some response would be nice. Is it correct that this weapon procs a 75% (at level 60) slowdown spell? If so it's too powerful and gives away the most powerful shaman spell to anyone who can wield it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
