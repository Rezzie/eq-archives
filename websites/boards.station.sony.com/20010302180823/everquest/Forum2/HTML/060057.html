</FONT><HR>Hey why should anyone want a warrior now in their group/guild when they can have a hybrid? i meen really we have 500 more hp, some more ac...big deal. when you could have a ranger to do about the same damage maybe a little more (btw i hate rangers, but it's the truth) and have some spells that are usefull if your durid or shaman is dead. <P>Then there is the rogues and the monks. monks can pull like no others at mid to high lvls..in some cases, some what self sufficent in the healing department with mend, not really but it helps when healer is oom, and anyone who knows about melee classes knows that monks do the most damage, other then rogues. give a monk a master wu's trance stick and a cane of harmony, and you have a hahah-stupid-meatshield-warrior-couldn't-taunt-off-me-for-his-life-cause-procs-dont-taunt-uber-monkey. and lets not mention the kicks and the epic.<P>rogue, wow lets not start with this. ok lets. back stab owns crits and crips any day, we all know that the rogue is the best non-caster damage dealer, the unfortunate thing is that they have about as much HP as a cleric with some buffs. i love(d) to have rogues and monks in the group becasue i could just sit there with the yak in main hand for proc and can of tranquil in the other and ussaly taun off them. but now if the rogue has say a ragebringer and a trak tooth or something...something even less than a ragebring it's going to be next impossible to taunt of theese two.<P>basicly what i'm saying is what good is the warrior class if they cant do their job? warrior's job=taunt off casters and other melee's. with this new patch what are we supposed to do /auction wts full crafted ws yak hood cane lammy... /auction wtb monk gear. <P>  I meen really i guess all i can say to VI is Thanks, thanks for nothing...again!<P><BR>Truc Barellbut<BR>40th warrior Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>it is a known fact that monks/rogues do more dmg than a warrior, yes i think the warrior class is the best melee class, am i whining sorta. it's more just being pissed off at VI beacuse they had to go and srew with the hate listings. making the warrior a less effective taunter isn't going enhance the game much at all. so basicly i cant comprehend what VI is trying to by doing this? i guess that they just dont care about the good ole warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>warriors are the best all around melee class in the game. When all is said and done you want a warrior upfront facing the MOB, and thats from level 1 to level 60. Thats a huge deal! You are the melee kings from level 1 to 60th. I think warriors have it pretty good, I would give my left nut to be a "niche" class of the 55+ endgame.<BR>So I would hesitate complaining about how bad warriors have it.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My main is a ranger and I think from what I read, that most rangers did not ask to have the same offense as warriors. Where that came from no one knows. What we really wanted was about 20 more points on defense which still would have been well under the warriors max defense. Trust me I think most 50+ rangers would gladly drop their offense to get a bit more defense and i dare say that the pallys/sk would trade their D for more offense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well maybe you guys should just go over my posts once more. i dont think that you guys are exactly getting my point. how many of you are high lvl warriors? ok well if you didnt notice you arent the ones doing the main damage, the casters are. what happens when the casters die? you die? see what i'm saying? a high lvl warriors job is to keep the mobs off the casters so they can do damage. granted, warriors can do their fair share of damage but it's not significant enought to say that they are a primary damage dealer. i do understand that wariors are the kings of meele and they are very kick ass from lvl 1 to about 50 then it starts to not matter as much. i think a warrior with the mentality of keeping the mobs off of our casters so we live and kill the mob is  a little more valuable then a warrior that has the mentality of i'm gonna go pull something cause you sissy casters are sitting down doing nothing...i can solo this blue...HEAL HEAL...[EXPLETIVE] WHY DID YOU LET ME DIE!!!<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry bob...  But are you on CRACK?!?!?  LOL  Saying any class is better than a warrior?  Wait about 6-10 more levels and you'll quickly see why you're the best.  To answer your statement:<P>Rogue is not a tank.  They deal a lot of damage out but only cause the tank is there to taunt it away from them so they can backstab.<P>Rangers?  LOL  Number 1...  A ranger tanking post 50 scares the bejesus outta me.  It can be done but not very well with a tank with the AC around that of a shaman...  IF THAT!  Number 2?  Although they can taunt quite well (assuming they don't use their dots which probably won't stack with whatever the group evac'r is casting unless it's a wizard) they don't really outdamage warriors.  And eventually (although extremely late) the warrior gets triple attack which although rare still boosts the warriors output.  And lastly?  I've played both a ranger and a warrior to post 50.  Anyone who says a ranger would make a better tank than a warrior (OR EVEN COMES CLOSE!!!) needs serious psychiatric evaluation.<P>Shadowknight?  Some cool abilities and can be a tank in a pinch but doesn't really seem to have the taunting ability of a warrior even if he nears him AC wise.  This translates into basically the problem of keeping the mobs off the rogue or the casters and if the mob is aggroing the cleric and can't be taunted off him?  You're looking at a CR.<P>Paladins?  Basically a shadowknight with less battle friendly (or battle taunting spells) spells who carries some buffs that are ok if there is no cleric and some ok heals later in life.  One get out of jail free card LoH but even that doesn't bring all the hp back of a fully buffed tank from what I've seen.<P>Bards?  LOL  Well their songs are pretty taunting but they don't have any real taunt ability past that and the dual wielding skill.  I've often wondered how bad a singer the bards I travel with frequently are to be able to irritate the heck out of the mobs the way they do as it is.<P>Warriors?  Best AC.  Most HP.  Best Weapon skills.  Most consistent tanks in the game (aside from the recent quasi nerfs that aside from the UBER encounters I don't see causing an enormous amount of trouble)  <P>Simply put I find it more disappointing that the game is designed on so much of a bring 30 people and hack away to beat this mob or that rather than (and I'm not saying it doesn't take skilled tanks/clerics to do it) a group of 6 overcoming adversity.  The *Vision* doesn't really allow for that though.  Oh well.  I can still hope for better games though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
