</FONT><HR>another thing to consider, is that some of the names which my be offensive to a very few people, are probably not going ot offend the rest of us.  and some names do nothing more than reflect the general sense of humor of the player behind the character. the thought of having one of my character erased (after however many levels of play) because someone was possibly offended by my commonly accepted sense of humor (as you will find the most extremely sensitive people are often offended by that which others find acceptable or even amusing); WITHOUT warning or being giving the opportunity to change it; to be VERY unaceptable.  many poeple, even a semi casual gamer such as myself, can amass a lot of time into a character (especially after seven months), this policy seems to be unreasonable to the extreme.  im all for enforcing a naming policy that has the best in mind for all players. but deletion, without so much as a single warning or opportunity to correct is grossly overborn and heavy handed.  but remember...<P><BR>all your names are belong to us</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I have a beef, dry, overcooked and with no Ketchup or mustard to soften the blow.<BR>Sometimes the Name Police seem to be a bit arbitrary with their power. The current changes give them even more arbitrariness to that power.<P>A for instance: According to your naming policy Sir Lancealot could never have existed as the Naming Police would say that is a phrase, not a name. An EXACT parrallel came up with a guild member whose surname was Healsalot. If Giantslayer (your example) is acceptable, why is Healsalot not? The person in question is a cleric, BTW. <P>In the above case the person was allowed to choose another surname that he was satisfied with. But, according to the posted changes, this is no longer the case. I would be horrified to find any of my charactors' names changed to say Darren Greenman and have no way to correct the situation.<P>Also, more horrifying, would be to die, have a corpse that has fallen into a wall, petition for a GM only to have a Name Nazi answer and say my name must be changed and no I can not recover anything that I have worked for 40 odd levels to aquire. Giving more respect for compensation to those that purposely make vulgar names than to those that make an effort to be creative but are deemed to be outside of the naming policy restrictions is way out of line.<P>Also, the ambaguity of what constitutes a "compound word" that is or is not accaptable gives way to much power of the arbitrary to the Name Police. I have several Charactors that have names that could fall either way to this ambiguity, but still have very appropriate names for their race and/or class. I will mention one here: a woodelf ranger named Truepath. I have two of these on different servers. I will not get into the name of a hungry Ogre here, but it too is appropriate for true hard-core RP'ing. <P>I believe a name is more than just a name. A name is an identity. It should state something about who or what kind of charator it is that one is playing. My rangers hunt exclusively by tracking, for instance. The level acceleration since the con-track patch is beyond belief. One of my Rangers goes into areas that are way over his level to hunt in only to hire his services out to aide others to find a rare spawn for a quest. The name Truepath *is who he is*, it is his identity. No other name would fit the charactor properly. But according to the changes in the naming policy it could fall either way depending on the GM's descretion. <P>I do not feel that this kind of ambiguity coupled with this amount of GM discretion is good for coustomer relations and should be rethought and rethought quickly.<P>Kenneth E.

</FONT><HR>firebizz:<P>Nowhere in the naming policy does it say that if one person petitions your name because they are offended then your character will instantly be deleted. If you are petitioned and it is determined that your name does in fact violate the naming policy (under rules 3-13) then you will be given the opportunity to change your name to something else. If you've ever read the rules for this game, you would know that at the point you are told to change your name, you are instructed to inform the GM/Guide if you have corpses in the world that you have not looted. They are then REQUIRED to give you a fair amount of time to loot the corpse before changing your name.<P>Now, on the other hand, if your name is something like upyoursbich ( and I apologize if my example offends anyone, but I had to give an example  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> ), well, just expect to get your character deleted as soon as a GM sees it. But it's your fault, not Verant's.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>~ArchAngelis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few points:<P>&gt;&gt;Krungle said: A for instance: According to your naming policy Sir Lancealot could never have existed as the Naming Police would say that is a phrase, not a name.<P>His name was Lancelot.  Not a phrase or compound word.<P>&gt;&gt;Rake_of_Rathe said: Similarly, while a name like "Merllin" might (might) be taken to be akin to "Merlin", the example of "Murrlin", while not a RL name afaik, sure reads sufficiently distinct to me. I mean, ok, it may sound like "Merlin" when spoken aloud, but I don't see "Merlin" and all                     that is associated with that name by looking at "Murrlin" on the screen.<P>I'm not sure I follow your point.  The example you cited are all attempts to use the name Merlin by just spelling it differently.  So are you saying that by corrupting the spelling the name should be okay?<P>&gt;&gt;dAvenger2 said: So as far as that goes, you're improving the game for a very small percentage and ruining it for a large percentage. Kinda backwards thinking.<P>But that is what happens all the time.  A very small percentage of the players are over level 50, and yet new content and tuning is all for this small percentage of the player base. <P><BR>I do think the enforcement of the naming policy is a good thing.

</FONT><HR>The fantasy random name generator isn't a guarantee of not getting an offensive name.  Someone on the Vazaelle group describes a female ogre warrior who was offered the name "Boggroku" by the FRNG, which is a homophone of the French phrase "beau gros cou" ("nice big a$$"), which would qualify you for deletion without warning if I understand the rules correctly.<P>I appreciate Verant's restatement of this old policy, and hope that it is followed-up with current and long-term enforcement.  I like the idea of having someone review the names of every character that was created or surnamed in the past week.<P>Also, for the sake of setting the fantasy environment that Verant seeks, I hope that they do revisit the issue of NPC's whose names violate the spirit of the policy, since I interact with them more than the d00dz.  Heck, if you could just uncapitalize the middle names in compound surnames like MightySword, it would be a welcome change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Your solution to better customer service is updating your FAQs and changing and removing even MORE player names?<BR>We don't need any more FAQs we need ACCESSABLE telephone support for technical AND customer service issues and we need support staff that are ONLINE (not at lunch or working monday through wednesday noon to 5)and empowered to help not just recite the same old tired textbook responses.<P>We need customer support folks that will actually LISTEN and understand us rather than just giving us stock answer number 25. Do you know how many times a day people are threatened with suspension after being forced to repeat a question to a GM and never getting an answer. "Because I said so" is NOT a logical answer for GM action.<P>We need polls about customer service that give us the ability to say customer service is bad. Review your last poll, it was cleverly worded so we could not express our dissatisfaction.<P>We need customer service individuals that understand changing someone's makes people madder than almost anything else. Regardless of your vision this is NOT a roleplaying game and getting your name changed or removed with no explanation other than "read the policy" (which we've all done 200 times) is unacceptable. Unless it's vulgar or involves legal trouble LEAVE OUR NAMES ALONE.<P>You need to understand (I'd ask you to acknowledge but THAT will never happen) that the majority of everquest players think your customer service is HORRIBLE. Not just "needs improvement" or "a bit spotty" but absolutely HORRIBLE. Consistent and regular (every 2 weeks) customer service polls will help you analyze and repair this problem.<P>You need to DO something and IMPROVE your service not just make more political statements and an FAQ once a year.<P>Good luck, I hope you take this to heart.<P>Illucia<BR>The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A very small percentage of the players are over level 50, and yet new content and tuning is all for this small percentage of the player base. <P>Yes you could look at it like they're doing all the tuning for a minority of players. In actuality they're tuning the part of the game that needs tuning and will move on when it's finished. It just so happens to be that a minority of players are at that level. So really they're doing something that's aimed at the majority.<P>&gt;&gt;NLightN1 said: I do think the enforcement of the naming policy is a good thing. I just don't see how it ruins anyones fun if they can't have "poopypants" for their character name. If you can't be creative, use the random name generator.<P>Well of course I agree that "poopypants" is mildly annoying. BUT how many times do you actually see those types of annoying names with players who are over level 30, much less at the 40's or 50's? Extremely rarely if it even occurs at all. What the rules allow them to do is basically take any creative name that isn't a typical name and make you change it. It's so open to interpretation it's sickening. I'd be glad to put up with a few poopypants people than to lose the freedom to have a reasonably creative (and obviously non-vulgar) name. This involves a very large number of people, and because it is so subjective, it can't be done fairly.<BR>Are people really that nearsided that they would gladly give up freedom for some piece-of-mind?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063448&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063448&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
