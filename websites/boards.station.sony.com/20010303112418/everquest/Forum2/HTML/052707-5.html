</FONT><HR>Ill just list what I dont like, since thats what needs to be changed.<P>Skyshrine faction is way to slow to raise, Ive been killing giants since the first day Velious was online and I still cant buy from Skyshrine.<P>Seems to me that all the zones past cobalt scars are for uber guilds only. Good luck trying to even get to west wastes unless you have major backing. Sirens Grotto is insanely hard for a "gateway" zone.<P>Spell drops. Can we please put level 39 and 44 spells on something a level 39 or 44 can hunt? Puting the level 44 spels on the uber sirens is a joke, these things can charm/ kill a level 60 no level 44 in there right mind will try to hunt them.<P>To sum it up, dont tune half the zones to require 3 groups of level 55's, maybe its just me but this is no fun. Tune most zone to the avg player and leave 3 or so for the ubers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Generally speaking, I love velious!  But I have a few issues.<P>1) The giants.  Their resists are ridiculously high.  And both the loot and exp from them is lousy.  The only good thing they give is dragon faction, which btw is way too hard to get up.<P>2) Wizard ports on a dragon vendor?  I've killed giants nonstop for about 3 levels now and I'm still only dubious to them.  Also, I think we should be rewarded somehow for having to work so hard to get our faction up.  My idea, put Translocate on the port vendor too.<P>3) Boy, those snow dervishes sure do hit hard for their level.<P>4) Please make yew leaves easier to get.  If they were foragable that would be great, but ground spawns in WL is ridiculous.<P>5) Keep up the good work!<P>-Hippastus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I went through some of these comments and while most are about zones too high level for me (level 36) I do have a few comments of my own:<P>1.  The dragon portal in Iceclad is actually ok if you know what you're doing.  Yes we had a bad time the first time in but after that we just go in invisible and are fine.  The same druid who TPs you can invis you.  No big deal.  It can stay as-is.  Dreadlands can sometimes be far worse.<P>2.  I need to buy food in Thurgadin!!!  Maybe there's something there but I can't find it.  I hear you removed the NPC who sold food because of a problem with a quest.  Please put her back or put something back even without the quest.  That's probably the most important thing you could do to Velious from my perspective.  This needs high priority.<P>3.  Please remember that not everyone is level 50+.  <P>4.  The factions in Great Divide are treacherous to say the least.  It would be nice to give people some warning.  A friend of mine went from apprehensive to dubious with the Coldain from killing a single wolf.  So either tone down the negative faction adjustments or arrange some sort of warning -- perhaps along the lines of the undead herald in the evil outpost in Kunark with regards to the Venril Sathir faction.<P>5.  I just made friends with the Icepaw Gnolls and am hopeing they have some nice quests.  I hope I won't be disappointed.<P>6.  How many giants do I have to kill anyway to get in good with the dwarves so I can do quests for them?  Since by doing so I'm making things more difficult later down the line I hope it won't be too many.<P>7.  Will I be able to get to the higher zones if I'm KoS to giants or can I just forget about that right now?<P>8.  There were a lot of nice touches.  Your model of Icebreaker was cool.  Wierd but cool.  Also, the gnomish pirates are a hoot.  Everyone should go through there once and hail all of them.  Also, some of the Coldain comments are pretty good.  I liked the broken window in the bar in Thurgadin with the guard nearby, although since the scene has to stay static it'll loose something in a dynamic game.  Also, I liked all the translucent materials, especially in Thurgadin (may be elsewhere but that's where I see most of it).  I also liked the crowd noises in the dwarvish bar and the way the wind noises get greater as you go to the top of the Graightspan (or however you spell it) plus the way they're directional.  Ok, none of those impact gameplay but they're nice and appreciated.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I must agree with most of the posts here. I have learned to my chagrin that most of the zones in Velious are designed for the player that has a standard group and can rely on his/her guild to play in the zone as well. Without a consistant group, we who play mostly in "pick-up" groups have a very hard time building a group for each session, as the slant of Velious seems to be geared to large groups of mid to high levels.<BR>I may go back to select areas IF I can find a group to join, although this philosophy of grouping has taken away much of the enjoyment I have had with my druid. In my experience so far in Velious, to try to solo in almost any Velious zone is to invite a very swift death. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>The graphics are tremendous, but the play philosophy I find in those zones is totally contrary to anything I have found so far in EQ and I won't be back very soon. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Boat in Ice Clad that picks you up from docks on island where raft from North Ro left you: Sometimes 'runs into' ice bergs and pushes players around on the boat. Seen it happen afew times and it has happened to me acouple. Some people have been standing on the railings looking at the ice bergs only for the boat to hit one and they go sails off into the ocean. <P>Also: Why is there this huge railing around the boat that not even an Ogre can walk up on? Didn't Gnomes build this thing, not Giants? Jumping on that railing to get off is tricky (Well it isnt, it is lining up with the ramp that is and not falling into the ocean). Please fix this to make it lower like the rest of the boats.<P>Zone from Great Divide to East Wastes needs some serious tweaking. You placed it right where players fall for around 25dmg+ right at the zoneline.<P>Wurm tunnel in Great Divide is a great idea and wonderfully laid out, only problem: The Wurms teleport a random (but always large) distance away when they are DoT'd. Then you only have a few seconds to find them and kill them before they poof. Yep that is correct, once they are DoT'd and are fleeing (Even with Darkness and/or Snare) they teleport out of normal agro distance then *poof* they are gone. <P>All the work for nothing. Happened repeatedly tonight with my group fighting Guardians and Ancients. When they poof they just disappear, no more target, no exp, no body, no nothing, just gone. Please look at this.<P>East Wastes:<BR>Great zone, underused. Why? Poorly laid out with mobs. There are "patches" in the zone where mobs wander:<BR>Giants 'here' and 'there', Griffins 'over there', Ulthorks 'over here', Orcs 'over here' and 'over there', etc... Sure they wander, but they wander within "bounderies" and that keeps them split. Now maybe this is so that level 40 mobs do not wander too often into level 30 areas and slaughter the players, cool. But there are MANY areas in this zone that *nothing* roams in. I mean just completely empty always. Please do something about this. This zone is beautiful, and has much to offer, but to only see 'roaming area's around the Great Divide zone, Kael, Ice Clad, and all the Forts and camps just plain sucks; it takes away from the realistic feeling this zone could give with seemless wandering creatures/features.<P>Thanks,<P>Rev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel that faction is a major issue in Velious.  Consider the person who wants to be chummy with the Giants.  Sure, he is kissing away his Dragon and Dwarf factions (fair enough) but he starts out in the Giants' bad books too.  What the heck?  A melee character of level 30 something should at least have the option of binding in Kael from the beginning.  Didn't those first explorers say something about stumbling across the helpful Giants?  I would say that this should apply to the Dragon's as well.  Make them start dubious perhaps but not KoS until you do something to piss them off.  <P>As it is you have the Kunarkian problem all over the place.  Ack! I am being attacked by something that I want to befriend (or is friends with someone I need)!  Defend and my faction is trashed!  Blech... that's why I keeel Giants I suppose.<P>(Oh and fix that shawl quest please... I didn't learn mastery in baking for nothing I hope.  Silly me for trying to plan ahead.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>anyone know which files we can remove to make EQ boot up faster. After I installed Velious my boot up time was at least doubled. Since the consensus is Velious sucks I don't see any reason to make the game slower if I'm going to be in Kunark and antonica all the time. Guess asking for our money back is out of the question?<BR>    A simple suggestion. Make the game FUN. It's a game. We play it to have fun. 2 people in this whole post gave a favorable opinion of Velious. Obviously, loot, experience, and playability are important and it seems nobody really enjoys dieing and long CR's for some reason. Please, I really want to hear your reasoning, truthfully, for making this expansion an overwhelmingly pain in the ass. <BR>   Sonan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>God, I just wrote the longest flame in history and deleted it. I'll sum up the points without rancor here.<P>1. Planes do not have factions in the 'material' world anywhere else. Fix this, it's stupid (oops, venom slipped in)<P>2. Velious Mobs hit way too hard for their cons.<P>3. Velious mobs have way too many hitpoints for their cons.<P>4. Travel in Velious is a pain in the ass (there I go again). Locking half the continent behind a key quest, or a hostile zone was er... not the brightest of moves if you expected people to actually go there.<P>5. I don't know about other classes, but ranger spell drops are definitely screwed up. Call of Earth, a lvl 50 spell is currently selling at 4k platinum plus, if it sells at all, and I only know 5 rangers on my server that have it (here's a shocker, they're all over lvl 55).<P>6. If mobs are un-mezzable, they should have some other weakness, not be 100% MR also, with insane amounts of hps and ac.<P>7. All of these issues have kept me from going to Velious since the first week of release. I recently re-installed my system, and seriously debated even re-installing Velious. How bad is that? On a 30 gig drive with 25 free, I almost decided to save the extra however many megabytes and the time it takes to install something I probably will never use again.<P>I applaud your efforts for trying to get feedback and suggestions for improvements, no matter how late in the game it is, and despite the fact that the design of Velious has turned me off more than the screw up with my order of the Kunark expansion (at least I felt Kunark was worth the hassle, after I finally got to play it for a while) so I will likely not even go to Velious no matter what you do to it. (barring a serious, serious nerf to mob damage and hps there. Nerf the mobs there as much as you have buffed rogues, and I may go someday, if it's before Anarchy Online comes out).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This will be short but sweet.<P>Iceclad - Seemed good for levels designed.  The portal in point is a death trap for slow zoners though.  Nice items like Cougar Claw Earrings.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow - I loved this zone and busted my ass for all the keys.  Making Tserrinas 100% MR to Necros was a bit maddening though. (yay, mana pump the wizard/cleric, this is fun)<P>Eastern Wastes - The armor drops in the Orc Camp can result in pissing contests.  Put the armor on some roamers for gods sakes.  Or give the roamers some decent drops.  Orcs are the only thing worth camping.<P>Crystal Caverns - Great zone.  I really enjoyed it.  Kudos to who did this zone.<P>Great Divide - Nothing gave me exp except for the Elites so I was bit eh on it.  Tizmat Caves and Bear Caves I'm sure are fun but there's no reason to hunt there.  <P>Thurgadin A - Nice city.  I can deal with it.<P>Thurgadin B - The Dorfs drop that great Royal Frosted Velium Armor and every guild was there camping that stuff.  Better than planes gear which is kind of sad I thought...

</FONT><HR>I agreed with Uberon-SolRo's assessment. A rule of thumb on Velius: Mobs hit too hard and con too low for their strength.<P>Example: <BR>Norath- Seafuries in OOT have about 5000 HP,s hit for a max of 72, and con blue to a 54th (well, the ones who can blue hit for 72 max).<BR>Kunark- Ravashing Drovargs seam to have about 5500-6000HPs, hit for a max of 105, are slightly higher level than Seafuries (I think these go to 44th). Very blue to a 54th.<BR>Velius- Sentient Armor (about the same level as a Ravashing Drovarg) have 7-8k HP's, hit for 115.<P>There is less reward hunting in Velius because the mobs who do offer experience are much harder kills.<P>I also thought Velius would have something for the 50 to 55th level players. Nothing to hunt except 1 or 2 types of Mob's in the whole continent as a solo. Everything is either green, or blood red... or even/yellow in such mass that it requires full guide raids.<P>I spent a lot of time there when it came out. awesome look and feel to the zone. It is simply mistargeted and overpowering for any solo play beyond 50th.<P>Big point to mention... the armor quests. The gems are rare (ultra-rare) and the torn enchanted must be obtained through guild raids only (again ultra-rare drops of uber-mobs in a uber-zone). I dont think everyone under the sun should have this armor but the drop rates should be up'ed just a bit.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wakening Lands. <BR>i love this zone barr one thing, Woushi ive not been killed by him (except on raids for him sometimes), but imho he should start non-kos or start no were near the dragon circle.<BR>i know you made the dragon circles require a tooth to port too that location, yet a lot of people went to grab the tooth right after we killed him, each time, and we got tells often asking when were next killing him because someone ported there without realising he was up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.... we dont kill him anymore nor does(or can) anyone else on emarr yet<P>Kael Drakkal.<BR>i love this zone, despite what others have said i like the drops (gladiator chain is real nice) but considering how difficult it is for rangers/druids/paladins to get there armour from plane of mischief(compared to how evil classes get it dropping like rain in PoG) i do think there should be some sort of increase in drop rates on the erroded armour peices<P>PoG.<BR>have no problems at all i utterly LOVE this zone, weather im exploring it with my druid or destroying it with my warrior  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>some of the mobs are a little... overpowered by im assuming they will be re-tuned with the donals BP fix?<BR>                   <P>PoM.<BR>my only problem with this zone is i cant get there, ive seen rowyls druid armour(and really dont care much for it) but i just want to see the zone really  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> its the oposite of PoG and way too difficult to get too<P>Iceclad.<BR>hate this zone personally, just makes my computer lag due to the graphics more than any other zone in the game other than EW and GD(not sure why)<P>East Wastes.<BR>same as iceclad<P>Great Divide.<BR>same as iceclad<P>Cobalt Scar.<BR>the cobolt drakes have the same breath as the dragon in this zone (ie same damage and dispell effect) if this was intentional thats fine  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> but they are quite difficult if invis drops near one,<BR>also the dragon himself in this zone is great, he is weak and that means even a pickup raid can take him, a lot of Velious seems aimed at uber guilds and i like the touch of adding an easy dragon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>                    <BR>Siren's Grotto.<BR>not sure how to take this zone.. at the time being it is simply too difficult to be worth bothering with, since no items drop there worth the difficulty and theres more fun to be had in western wastes which is the only reason i spend a breif time in this zone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Western Wastes.<BR>this zone is amazing, the landscapes are a little rugged but i think that was intentional, dragon after dragon after dragon.... currently my favourite zone in the game<P>Dragon necropolis.<BR>this zone is very fun, loot seems a little spare and considering how hard this zone is/ to get too, it should be a little better or more of it than there actually is<P>overall.<BR>the high end encounters (dain, tormax, yelinak, etc) require tunning, your vision of these epic encounters was not to go at them lemming style im sure, there should be tactics and fun to be had in these, but at the moment it is simply tank+ cleric, tank dies, ressed then sent back in.. etc<BR>the 100% magic resist disallows any tactics  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Ainianu Sylvanfyre<BR>Heirophant of Midnight Sojourn<BR>Emarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(my apologies if repeat posts are objectionable, but I struck the "new topic" without paying attention and wound up making a new thread instead of replying)<P>A minor annoyance issue that could be solved by a large number of nukers, but I have to raise this.<P>There are mobs in PoG (and I suspect elsewhere) that attempts to gate, heal, buff, or nuke. Now, when a mob starts casting, there are two ways of stopping the cast. Killing the mob, or stunning it somehow. The stunning part fails for some reason.<P>Using an agitated serene forest spirit for this example, this lovely red wisp attempted to gate with roughly 25% of its hps left. The party there trying to kill it consisted of 3 wizards with several fighters.<P>Two of the wizards attempted to stun the forest spirit, and I know that my stun certainly landed. I recieved the, "an agitated forest wisp has been hit for non-melee..." from using Tishan's Discord successfully on it, along with "an agitated forest wisp is stunned." This stun landed after the wisp had started casting the gate spell, and the stun takes only about two seconds to cast.<P>The spirit proceeded to successfully gate 2 seconds after my stun.<P>This happened not only once, but several times, without any "has regained concentration" message.<P>It may help to make these mobs fully resistant to any stuns, or let them be interrupted by them. Perhaps this is a bug that needs looking into?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Looks like a can of worms got openned here actually.  In thinking about it, I probably would not buy Velious again knowing now what I know.  The Graphics are good, the dungeon and outdoor zone designs are generally good and the quest system is great, but the mobs are awful.<P>Risk via Reward:<P>For me, the reward of playing a game is simply having fun, hopefully with both new and old friends.  Things that I have fun with involve exploring new areas, seeing new things (and hopefully killing some of them), playing with new toys ... while I am certainly not Farmer Fred, I do love having a new and neat piece of equipment to exclaim over, and advancing my character to become more capable of doing all of this.<P>Velious does not really fit the bill here for me.  My cleric at 44 can barely make the trip to Thurgadin alive.  Usually I spend about 30-45 PP on Invis potions and SoW potions.  And even then invis seems to drop a lot - usually right in front of an elder snow griffin.  Risk vs Reward.  I don't make this trip anymore unless someone brings me along.  What that means is that I am not usually anywhere near Velious for rezzes or grouping.  Someone else's risk vs reward.<P>My druid does hunt a bit in EW and GD when bored.  Typically I group with Necros or Mages since their pet/spell combinations work well.  But I frankly prefer DL or Burning Woods where I can be more than a snare machine with SoW.  Oh, I forgot, I can also save the mages some mana by damage shielding their pets.<P>I don't have any of my 39 or 44 Velious spell drops.  Nor am I in a hurry to make a long run through a city filled with scowling giants who automatically see invisable on people doing Corpse Recovery.  So I don't have any of the ports.  Risk vs Reward - a major corpse recovery filled with multiple deaths vs getting a TP spell to a Dragon circle where the dragon is ALIVE!  Or one where roaming wurms might kill me before I even know whats going on if my ISP gets overwhelmed as I port.  <P>I will probably not see Wakening lands or anything past the front door of Kael Drakkel.  Experience is slow in Velious and risks are high.  I have had people rave about the experience hunting bears in Great Divide.  I get more experience than they do in Dreadlands, Kaesora and Overthere (I've actually been hunting in these zones and compared exp).  Again the exception is a party of pet users.  Oh, and I actually stand a chance of soloing a mob that jumps me on my way to those locations.  <P>I guess what I am trying to say is that I just don't have a good feeling out of Velious.  At level 44 as a cleric or as a druid, I have died so often that I have lost any desire to explore it (6 deaths in Kael Drakkel trying to get to Wakening lands for example).  <P>Kunark on the other hand I am still enjoying after a year.  <P>I have a suggestion for any future expansions.  Make the maximum size of a guild 35 members.  Then scale encounters and mobs to groups appropriate to what a 35 member guild might field.  The vast majority of EQ players do not belong to Uber guilds.  Stop trying to force people into supersizing guilds (and would you like biggie fries with that) in order to explore and "do" the new content.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Perspective: 51 Ranger in small guild (30 people, 9 over level 50)<P>WHY VELIUS AS A WHOLE WORKS PRETTY WELL:<BR>1. Variety of good, equivalent loot in many areas (Ry Gorr mail, Sentient Armor, Sentry Mail, Guardian Armor, for example)<BR>2. Nice mix of indoor & outdoor zones, alternating<BR>3. Large amounts of No-Drop items...controls greed<BR>4. Huge zones...little interference between groups<P>MAJOR SHORTCOMINGS:<BR>1. Uber-Guild pre-requisites for great stuff.<BR>I can't coordinate multi-groups in Kael Drakkal, Icewell, Siren's Grotto. There's never enough guys there or within 3 zones. My guild isn't big enough and the large guilds, are shall we say, jerks (on Povar, at any rate). AND YOU MADE IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HAVE 12 to 24 PEOPLE JUST TO GET IN TO THE GOOD LOOT AREAS.  I thought the exp bonuses would help but they haven't. I still hear "guild raid, sorry" even when there's a number of people in the raid that aint divisible by 6.  As if the three tag-alongs in a 24-person raid are really going to get the guild's stuff. This has kept me from even getting beyond Siren's Grotto. Thanks a ton. Lost 52 trying, since I figured it was possible, just very tough and only the best could get through. Nope. Apparently the grotto is the Uber-Gate. It is noteworthy that the grotto is NOT tough due to faction...that makes it a universal barrier - only Ubers need apply.(is Triton PAYING you guys or something?)<BR>2. You've created a wonderful faction deadlock.<BR>As a ranger I HAD to get better armor. So now I am KOS to dragons...and I am more than willing to deal with the repercussions of that. But I am HALF-KOS in Kael Drakkal...but you MIXED the faction of the see-through invis guys in Kael Drakkal....no sneaking my Skyshrine buddies through there to where the good stuff drops - EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE FACTION FOR THE QUESTS!!<BR>3. PoG was my biggest disappointment, concerning the complete absence of any ranger-quests. It would have been nice to meet a friend in my God's realm. I found about 50 hectares of nothing. As I recall Tunare didn't say jack to me.Not even a Hello. I have been serving her faithfully for 51 levels!!<BR>All in all...I am tired of being penalized by VI for NOT belonging to a huge guild. I mean criminy...how hard is it to structure things so some guys can go to the good places with a group of buddies...make it there with some challenges, and get some sense of accomplishment. All I got was a sense that until I do join a huge guild I am will see anything except the door-wardens.<BR>4. Velius has exacerbated some long-time problems of EQ. How the heck do you get a bind as a 50+ melee in Skyshrine? When I play there is usually no one in the zone, next to no one in Wakening Lands, ditto for Scar. You are wasting my game time. Am I wasting it too? I think as a 51 Ranger and 41 monk I have earned the right to bind myself in cities...criminy! Cant you make a bind-potion? is there really a BALANCE issue when it comes to where I go when I die? Of course not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Velious is god-awful.<P>Besides reasons I listed earlier.  Velious also buffed all the mobs in respect to their damage, hitpoints, and resists.<P>A simple HP buff was enough to cripple all the casting classes as their total damage is not scalable.  They can only do damage as long as they have mana.  Add in resists and their damage has been scaled even further down.  <BR>Therefore, All int casters are rendered effectively useless in Velious.  <P>Shamans and enchanters cannot crowd control, thus useless.<P>Druids and wizards can still port at least.  Too bad they cannot contribute after the porting is done.<P>Because of the increase in the amount of damage that mobs dish out 850 ring a bell anyone?<P>Only warriors can survive long enough to be complete healed, and complete heal must be used for efficiency, again ruling out shaman and druids.<P>Velious has made it so that you must either be a warrior or cleric.<P>1 of each of the other classes is allowed to come along as well, thanks too abilities that make them a must have.<P>Mage - CoH<BR>Enchanter - Clarity Haste<BR>shaman - ?<BR>druid - port<BR>wizard - port<BR>rogue - open door to mob that we are killing<BR>bard - ?<BR>sk - ?<BR>necro - CR<BR>paladin - ?<BR>ranger - ?<P>In conclusion, velious is the root of all evil.<P>Looks pretty and nice loot though.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am going to post my limited knowledge of Velious and hope it has some beneficial impact.  I am a level 44 druid on the E'ci Server in the guild Deliverance.  <P>Iceclad-<BR>Been through it once, 1st time.  No experience in there that is good.  The druid portal is HORRIBLE.  Make it atleast *SOMEWHAT* safer.  You want mobs around it .. fine .. .you want the occasional roamer .. fine .. you have 3 dervs whailing on *ANY* group and that's just obscene and unfair.  Kitty Cats are fun to romp in the snow with.  The Giants are ok.  The loot is typical for animals, pathetic.  The loot for giants is OK.  I didnt explore the zone much (I came over to Velious at 30).  <P>Tower of Frozen Shadows-Luckily, guildmates have keys, hear they're patheticlly hard to get.  Exp is nice, loot is nicer.  Finally you guys did a good job IMHO risk-v-reward.  Granted I was tehre with a full group of 44-52 on the 6th floor and we did excellently (exp all around, and did i mention nice loot).  Thank you Tserrina (sp) for your Sybmol, it looks lovely around my neck, i wear it with pride.  Wedding party i hear is great, teacher syllabus i heard is awesome, etc.  I hear the mobs are fun and frequest, i hear it's a little dangerous 30-35 but i didnt hunt here, i dont know.  i liked the short time i spent here.  If it was *a tad* easier to gain access to floors, i'd move in.<P>East Wastes.  <BR>All in all one of my favorite out door zones.  Unfortunately, it's going to become Oasis/IllOmen in a matter of time.  It already hits 50+ people.  Just a matter of time before we see 150.  <BR>I've spent *ALOT* of time here.  Kitties and Wolves by the bridge are slightly underconned.  For someone under 35, it's pretty much sure death to take one solo.  And with a group, it's hard but doable.  Loot is terrible, as per animals.  Mammoths .. both Tundra and wooly, HORRIBLY HORRIBLY underconned .. the loot is PATHETIC (not like tusks in Everfrost!) ... they have *WAY* too many hit points.  Kodiaks are ok with bad animal loot, orcs are ok and have some good loot.  Giants same as orcs.  Orc Fort, nice area ... a bit disturbing in the center .. as a full and experienced group with a 56 cleric had trouble not pulling whole fort  3 times in a row.  Usually uber camped and farmed. Nuff said.  Oracle, usually uber camped and farmed, nuff said.  Ulthorks, awesome, i love them, more more more all over the zone, more!  Probably my favorite adversary in the zone.  Vary the levels a LITTLE (make some a tad higher in another part of the zone, not the man-o-wars).  I am fighting too many groups for the few that DO pop.  Walrus, i hate them, loot per animals.  Rhinos, eh, i ignore them.  Man-o-Wars .. i'm coming back for revenge.  Usually farmed, but not uber camped.  Too many walrus make them a bit hard to take, solo or with a full group.  Snowgriffs are nasty, but do able in the 40s' with a group or pet class (mage/necro)  Look is junk but quest driven and i killed more than 20 of them in 2 days.  Nice exp.  Manticores, nice exp with full group or pet class.  Snow bunnies, kill them all!  Every last one.  fun quests, though damn those 4 giants hurt and I didnt even do the quest.  If i missed something, forgive me.  Good zone, Bravo.<P>Thurgadin (sp, i'm tired)-<BR>Fun City, love the natives.  Outrageous quest.  Some too outrageous (eroded leather, feh!).  Prayer Shawl Quest, i love it dont you DARE nerf it and please continue it.  I havent spent a LOT of time here ... i havent hunted ANYTHING in here.  I hate the 1 food vendor (Mordin).  I dont rely on food or water (forager/baker) but it's a bit annoying for guildmates/friends.<P>Icewell Keep-never in<P>GreatDivide- Again, not the safest druid ring, but not nearly as bad as the others.  I dont mind using it.  Flavor and design of zone rocks.  I love the stream and waterfall.  Wizzie spires are useless, 100% and might as well remove it.  Never see less than 4 mobs on them, and more around.  Useless.  Giant Fort is awesome, fun, good loot, great exp.  Elites are uber uber hard to high 30s low 40s (though we can take them, we need 2 healers atleast).  Wolves are ok, and drop loot.  ABOUT TIME!  Shardwurms (elder younger) are fun and great looking ... havent done any guardian or broodmother.  Loot is eh to ok from what i remember.  Kodiak Caves.  I love it.  I think there should have been more to allow more parties in on the fun.  2 parties per cave is no exp per party, period.  1 party per cave, 5-10 caves would have been awesome.  Loot is bleh save the "eh" claws and "feh" pelt.  But exp is awesome.  If there's more i didnt do it.  All in all, an ok zone.  Not a favorite.  Guardian wurms that supposidly drop spells are uber camped and farmed, and if there are spells, i dont know of anyone that has.<P>Velketor's Labyrinth-Love it!  Naysayers dont plan well, sorry.  Never did velky himself, understand the difficult and crappy loot.  Spiders are fun and interesting.  Ramps are outrageously fun, though so frustrating when you have a slow PC or someone who doesnt navigate well.  Only got to the 2 (then 4) statues up top, dog pound was fun.  Ok loot, though light, IMHO.  Going down the bowl was JUST as fun!  The loot from the icy shad (spec) was HORRIBLE!  Cloth Sandals for a 50+ mob ... *****PATHETIC******  Ultra high aggro range bugged me ... pulling 5 specs when you and your 4 groups (5?) pulled well and safely all night was NOT a good plan, thx summoncorpse!  We'll be back, we love the zone.<P>Kael-Hate it.  Fought in it once, experience was disgustingly terribly horrible and pathetic.  Did i Say i hated it?  Eroded leather drops here, i heard, didnt see any on the dozens we killed.  It's a transition zone for most.  We will discuss Super Cammo in a bit.<P>Waking Lands ..HATE IT..  Woushi *CAMPS* the druid ring.  Ok, dervs are bad, WOUSHI IS HORRIBLE.  Aggro range is huge.  Cool zone design wise.  I love the trees and plants (druid) and unicorns and and and .. i'll never fight here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Ok, maybe i will, but i doubt it.  Woushi should be more like Gore in Dreads ... i dont bug you, you dont bug me!  I know where skyshrine zoneline is  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Skyshrine, INTERESTING.  Cant figure out how to raise faction.  Doesnt seem to be claws of Veeshan, cause i have killed *HUNDREDS* of giants and should have *ALTEAST* 1/2 way decent faction with them.  I dont fight there anymore, i just run through when people dont have teeth to CScar.<P>Cobalt Scar-Hmm ... blech.  Granted, we didnt go far in yet.  Beach, druid ring, that area.  But killing a Red to 44 Bulthor Herddude and getting 5 copper and a bloodstone, COME ON GUYS!   Loot is ***HOOOOORRRRRIIIIIBBBBBLLLLLLEEEEE*  2 full groups for 4 hours get a few crushed gems (ok, NOT BAD) and 10 gold 5silver 15 copper and some words that drop everywhere else.  Sirens, cool design and they charmed our pally, cool.  Haunted chest, fun to kill.  Wyverns, ok .. junk loot.  Cobalt Drakes ... OK *WAY* underconned here guys.  Granted, we finally figured out how to fight them well, but still, *ONE* of them downed almost an entire party of 10.  And granted, the wyversn and drakes drop hides for tailoring, but loot was not worth it.  <P>Passed that i hear is worse  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Not there yet.  Wont go to Grotto, never heard one good thing about it.<P>My overall conclusion is the loot passed East Wastes for the 40-55 crowd is either way too random or way way way too bad.  This game is NOT all about loot .. but to get next to nothing from 50+ level mobs, wrong.  Mobs are underconned, everyone agrees.  Yes, velious is 35+  Yes, i am in agreement that most no-one should see the last zone or two save ubers and super 55+ raiding parties.  That was the design, i am 100% for that.  But, for the places that *ARE* for the 30-55, make the risk-vs-reward better.  <P>Like i said, i havent done it all, and i havent seen all of what I did do, but I like it overall.  I'd realign the cons, i'd fix the drop rates (CLOTH SANDALS OF A 50 SPEC????????), i'd move Woushi, i'd make the druid rings and wizzie spires atlesat safe to zone into!  Make them mob path free within the confines of the ring/spire.  Atleast let me get my party on, or get my solo bearings, before you kill me.  Graphics are good.<P>Last 3 topics:<BR>1)Spell Drops - they are horrible.  Havent seen my 39 spells and dont expect to see my 44 either.  I spoke to one of the "uber" guilds on E'ci and none of them have Group Super Cammo.  MM, i think that's wrong.<P>2)Super Cammo - i am a level 44 druid.  I have a 200+ div skill.  I have to say having Super Cammo drop instantly, or even 1-4 minutes after casting is *TERRIBLE*  You cant tell me after 44 levels I havent mastered the art of Cammo.  After level 30 we should get a bump, fixed duration + random additional duration ie:  5 min + 0-5 min.  Dont tell me about Imporved Cammo .. i have heard that even the drop Group SuperCammo is ULTRA RARE<P>3)FIX THE DARNED ARMOR GRAPHICS FOR HALFLING DRUIDS.  No matter what I do, i look like a bellhop.  EVERY class has other looks with their armor, i have a different color shirt, my arms get something with my plat armbands, and my feet arent fuzzy.  *****COME ON******<P><BR>Rexron Toebiter (Deliverance)<BR>Druid in the 44th Season of Karana's Cleansing Rain<BR>Master Baker (Oh that sounds naughty)<BR>Anyone have a spare SoW?<BR>Rexron checks his back pocket.

The spells I want are low-level spells that drop very infrequently off a very select group of Mobs, encouraging constant camping and farming which is not good for gameplay.

</FONT><HR>Level 30-50, the place rocks. I can't say enough how great this place is. Dungeon design, mobs, areas, ect.<BR>Iceclad -big and original, nice touch on boats<BR>Tower of Frozen Shadow - heartbeat  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> keyed floors, and all sorts of levels. With nice end of a 100%MR boss to kill<BR>Eastern Wastes - Great place, snow bunnies? Perfect zone.<BR>Crystal Caverns - have to see this place. Even if you are 60th level, venture in and just look at the design.<BR>Great Divide - Great zone, and some cool quests as well.<P>Thurgadin A - Nice City, Dangerous traps (Ice) but the manual warned about it.<P>Post 50 adventures into Velious<BR>Hit the Plane of Grove - one of the best planes so far. Sucks for rangers and druids, but who needs kelethin anymore anyway. Plants? Yea most things up there are plants or animals, and yet are not flagged as such. Please correct this.<P>Wakening Lands - Nice zone, Washui? Could you move a KOS to everyone dragon out of the druid ring? <BR>Skyshrine - Nice dungeon. Key to get to the next land shouldn't involve faction loss though. Unmessable mobs start to poke thier head again.<P>Thurgadin B - Too high MR, This is a cleric and Warrior dungeon.<BR>Kael - high MR, and unmessable. Bring only clerics and warriors. -see a trend?<BR>Zones that continue the no thought proccess to make them tough.<BR>Cobalt scar, velkners, ect.<BR>12k HP rule for mobs has been lifted, to stop FD pulling, they nerfed it already. To stop messing they giant flag every mob in the zones. To stop rooting, snareing, and charming, they up the MR so even green mobs are immune. <P>This takes very little imagination to design, and excludes all casters but Wizzards from doing damage. Warriors do a ton of damage, can be Chealed very easy, and basically need no other classes for any encounter.<P>This is incredible!  The entire continant of velious is astounding as far as questing, faction, design, traps, items, mob looks, translosant(sp) walls and items, and overall feal of the place from sounds textures, ect. I could go on and on. <P>Then we get to difficulty, and the people who put in the mob flags lost it. Wushui gets KOS flag to all, see invis, and put in agro range of a teleport site. The MR stats fly off the board in the tough zones. Unmessable mobs? Green mobs that can't be rooted, messed, ect? There is even a level 1 creature that hits for 60 points!<P>Want to add to dificulty? Take Cheal out of a zone. Before you laugh, think about it. Cheal makes clerics overpowering. Think about donald's BP. If a player cannot be CHealed, supior heal would be used. This means any melee class is now equal as far as HP sponges. Warrior's damage and starting health makes them a great choice, but rogues are great, SK and pallys would do almost as well, monks and even rangers take the same amount of mana to keep alive. Now as far as healers, Clerics are the best due to resurection, but shamen and druids can then heal at about the same rate, and can regen. Then you can lower the overall MR of mobs(cold, fire, magic, poison, dis) and every caster has a use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My honest feedback on Velious?<P>1.  It wasn't designed for normal players, it was designed as an uber-guild playground.  Guess what?  The majority of players aren't in uber guilds.  <P>2.  The balance of risk versus reward needs to be re-evaluated.  Some areas seem fine (Crystal Caverns).  Others can see you die in 5 seconds to something that drops 3 silver.<P>3.  Having MOB's with insane hitpoints doesn't make the game more entertaining.<P>4.  Wuoshi (sp?) with a half zone aggro radius isn't fun or entertaining.<P>5.  Having to bring one or more full groups with you isn't fun.<P>6.  I am an enchanter.  I can't mesmerize the majority of the MOB's.  I can't root park them out of the way, because root breaks almost instantaneously.  I can't stun them.  The majority of MOB's have extremely high magic resistance...guess what...ALL of my spells with the exception of Tash are magic-based.  Everything is resisted.  Everything.  Repeat, everything.  Is it fun?  No.  Will I be back?  No.  Will I ever be suckered in to another expansion pack?  No.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BIG peeve.  Having quests that require you to have massive numbers of higher level NPCs spawn in a location that many not high level players wander through.  For example, Eastern Wastes, spawning the orc fort - while some may find this humorous, my level 54 cleric had zoned into Crystal Caverns to rez someone, wandered out, not expecting anything untoward and got killed by a horde of Giants I never even saw.  Just STUN STUN dead - I took all of 1 step, I have no idea how many giants hit me but I died in less than 10 seconds.  This event also caused 3 other members of my guild to die, 2 of them over level 50 - mainly because I had died and they were going to come move my corpse for me, not realizing there were about 20 uber mobs outside.<P>Perhaps if you could move the zone in and outs to Crystal Caverns somewhere else besides in close proximity to the MEGA spawn point that would help.  It seems there could be a more isolated orc fort this could be staged at so as not to have people die for no good reason - as if there is a good reason to die  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I already hear the responses saying I should expect to die anywhere... so be it.  I just think this kind of design is harmful to the idea of having fun, when suddenly your night is totally disrupted by an event you had no idea you had to avoid.  I mean training is one thing - you go into a zone that is tough, and you expect trains to zone that if you stand in the way you are going to die - in a zone that seems mostly geared toward mid to high 30s characters this just seemed a bit much.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, let me re-iterate some of the earlier posts - almost anything worth going after requires UBER guild raids to do.  Seems kind of silly - I mean grouping is one thing (party of 6), requiring decent loot to have a raid of 3 or 4 groups seems a bit excessive.  By the time you get to the point you can do some of the zones with a single group, most of the mobs in zone are green to you, and only the high level guy is huge red.<P>I do like most of the look and feel to the zones in Velious - that I have been able to get in to - but for an area designed for level 30+ players, it appears that there are a lot of good areas to do single group experience camps below level 50, but once you reach level 50 it almost requires you to get into multi-group raids to find any decent loot.  I think if you look at Guk as an example, there doesn't appear to be anyplace like that in velious - that requires you to be higher level and you can get decent loot in a group.  You see the dungeons in Kunark... CoM, KC, Sebilis - they don't seem to have too many equivalents in Velious, even if they needed to be designed for a mid 50s group instead of a high 40s - low 50s group.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dungeons seem great so far, outdoors is dull the places I have been (except for Thurgadin's entrance, just beautiful).  The real complaint I have is that the monsters hit EVEN HARDER than in Kunark and are even tougher, which makes it pretty tough to explore.  Since that is stated as being part of what you wanted players to do and part of the fun, that seems like an odd decision.<P>The snow dervishes are just out of control.  Resisting magic heavily and hitting like freight trains they swarm from a HUGE distance out and are green but lethal to people in thier 50s.  This surely can't be a great decision can it?  Calm these stupid things down and make creatures know their place better (low greens shouldn't aggro).<P>Wuoshi is another issue covered before, whats with a hugely powerful dragon patrolling one porter?  IF faction is such a big issue, why make just ONE porter like this?  Why have ANY porter that dangerous to use?  That is just a very poor decision, whoever made it should get a nerf ball upside the dome.<P>The quests seem pretty good, unlike the Kunark ones for the Iksar it looks like you actually spent time talking between the guys that created the quests and the guys that implimented them (coughGRANITEPOWDERcough).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will agree most things are tougher than even Kunark and nothing was done to make us PCs tougher and keep us in line.<P>Skyshrine is far from finished.  Lacking quests or they are mostly broken.<P>Sentry Emil gives near 0 faction hits for the note delivery quest.<P>Sentry Emil wants a Boysenberry pie that does not exist, was removed from the baker and cost 1100pp when he had it.<P>The baker and cook both want you to settle an argument.  Since you can not get a Boysenberry pie, see above, you can not do the quest.<P>Compare Kael and Thurgadin to Skyshrine and you will see a large difference in amount of quests.<P>Eryl Flynn Level 52 Wood Elf Minstrel on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lets see...<P>Prior to Kunark there was only one zone that i couln't 'do' because it was too time intensive to do, the Plane of Air. When Kunark was released, Veeshan's Peak was added as another zone that i will never see. Two zones was not something really to whine about. However, with the release of Velious the number of zones i will never see has skyrocketed. Anything past Sirens Grotto i will never see because i am not uber enough. That is the major problem with Velious, it caters to such a small percentage of your customers while ignoring the rest. I read this quote somewhere on the board, it is not mine but it is so true. Velious, designed for the few, paid for by the many.<P><BR>The second major flaw of Velious is that 'mobflation' has drasticaly reduced the use of strategy in the game. Insane magic resistance and hitpoints of mobs has reduced all casters to mere buffmonkeys (a very boring role) for the only stars of the show melee classes and clerics. I really feel sorry for wizards, who yes can do damage with lure, but damage that is so insignificant it is laughable.<P>/rant off<P>Yes there are other minor problems and even stuff Velious has done right. However, because of what i have stated above, Velious has been a huge disappointment for me. In the end it just is not fun.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052707&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052707&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
