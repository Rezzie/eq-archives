</FONT><HR>Please do NOT nerf multiquesting.<P>There are a number of reasons listed that I agree with, one I didn't see, was that if someone accidentally loots a NODROP item for someone else's quest on a rare spawn, that person can choose to be a "good player" and help the person complete their quest.  As someone else said, this encourages grouping as well.<P>Thanks for asking us first.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Personally I don't like the idea of taking away multi-questing.<P>I'll give you a few examples of why.<P>First the one that has the most talk.<BR>I've played this game since it was release and not until 2 weeks ago did I finally get my Jboots.<BR>I had Camped Najena for Over 28 hours never to get 1st.  Then when I attempted to camp the AC, I saw it 3 times and each time it was KS, by a nuking class.  Since I know you would ask was one of them a druid, yes one of them was, and I know they would have had no business camping it had it not been for multiquesting... In the end tho over my personal time spent on it was over 60 hours, only to find CONSTANT dissapointment. I had given up, till one day I mentioned it in my group and the person in my group was able to camp and get it for me the next day.  Without multiquesting I would STILL not have this item.  One I think I put in PLENTY time to deserve.<P>Number 2, Let's take druid/ranger epics now as the example.  Without the ability to multiquest, no druid/ or ranger without a uber guild in theory would ever be able to complete thier quest. They need a stone from Venril Sathir.  He dies on my server within 1-2 hours of server up.  On my old server within the first 30-1hour  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> I remember the battles over VS, and I'm glad I don't have to fight for him anymore.  But it's unfourtunate that one would have to be in a Major guild one with people who have the fourtune to spend over 14 hours a day playing EQ.  Or have a large amount of people in the guild, enough to have a good enough amount online when servers come up.<P>Last example would be my epic.<BR>Thier is two halves to the book that you need to get from NERIAK.  Thier are ways to fix this faction.  However, it's still alot easier to have an enchanter collect the books.  Let's say 1 enchanter was there for a Nag book when it dropped,  and then that same enchanter wasn't there when a Vox book dropped.<BR>Then you would need another vox and nag book for both enchanters.<BR>Even if we took enchanters out of the equasion let's put paladins in, lets say Caanon wasn't there when a Vox book fell, even tho this is the absolute last peice he needs to complete his FA.  But I was, I'm not top paladin in the guild so I would then have HIS Vox book.  I personally would'nt want to loot it, because it would then make it mine and I would still have to wait until I was up on the FA, and recieve the Nag book.<P>Now to address those two issues.  We'll making the Epic Items Not No Drop would help alot.<BR>But in general...<P>I vote NO on changing the way quests work.<P>If your against voting NO, please take time to read my post and understand what you support when you say you support it.  Your supporting a more hostile environment to play in by doing so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sounds Like a good idea absor, but the problem is...what about multi-questing?<P>Parts of my epic require killing trakanon *yes, bard epic* and another part requires killing amagalgym tendrils in PoF...Now the problem with this is, I could go for weeks, and never see the guts drop off trakanon, and then the one time I don't go, they drop. If you took away multiquesting, those people would be out of luck.<P><BR>Solution...<P>If you hand in an item that he does not need, or is not part of the quest, he will hand it back to you.<P>If you hand in a piece of the quest, he will accept it, and await for someone else to turn in the other items.<P>People know when they don't have all the items for the quest, the only thing people don't know is if they are giving it to the right person.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I say No.  Because, well, this yet another change directed for only one part of the player base.<P>&lt;Begins ranting about how all changes to this game are to/for/against high level players.&gt;<P>The ability to multi-quest is a key ability for lower levels. (Especially the casual player.)  It is a great time saver and risk saver.  (Like, for example, allowing people to become non-kos with iksar by doing the bone chip quest...since Crusaders do roam.)  But, then again, taking away the ability to multi-quest would help "the Vision" well, wouldn't it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There are at least 2 quests I'm aware of that virtually require it.  The "Orc Illegible Cantrip" quest in West Freeport that requires 2 of a Lore Item to be handed in, and a necro quest which I believe runs from Paineel that requires good faction with Halas (don't know details, just that a friend has asked me to help him with this).<P>Again, thank you for asking us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This will make at least one quest impossible to complete. The Necromancer "Mantle of Souls" quest from Paineel. It requires that you get a potion from a Barbarian in Halas. There is no way for a Necro to get his faction up to where he is not KoS there. Currently the only way to get the crystal of capturing is to have one person get the potion from Gorth Bearsoul and they turn it in to Jalen Goldsinger in Tox, you turn in 1000gp and you get crystal. You proposed fix will end this and the quest period. I am curious as to how many other quests were put in with the knowledge that only by multi-questing could the quest be completed.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Leave it the way it is. Even if you did fix the journeyman's boots this way there would still be 30,000 people camping. Makes no difference to me if the person there has them, wants them or getting them from another character.<P>I think the amount of ppl "camping" the AC for ring sale or twink purposes is greatly exaggerated.<P>I'll suck up my mistake if I did not read the quest definition from the NPC correctly, with a little care you'll never lose hard earned quest items. Especially when there are probably a 100 people at any given time online that have done the quest your attempting and can answer your questions about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think you should leave multi-questing in unless you remove a lot of the no-drop status on many quest items. Especially higher end ones. Nobody likes seeing high end quest items rot. Also, I think an NPC should tell you if you don't have enough space for the reward. Its artifical and 'rude' to have an NPC take your quest parts and then 'destroy' the nodrop reward cause the large item won't fit into your regular backpack. You should get the items back and the NPC should say, "You don't have the room to hold the reward!"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I dont post here much, as i'm sure a lot of the EQ community doesnt for one reason or another but apparently this looked to a lot of people to be a reasonable question (the people who posted "ooh post 212!" notwithstanding..)<P>to answer the question, for me is an easy one. <BR>I say do it..fix the issue with NPC's eating items and do away with multi-questing. I'm sure there might still be some way to work out multi questing for some items, since in some circumstances it just might be necessary. <BR>One of the parts of quests, for me at least is the sense of accomplishment of doing them. I dont do a lot of quests but the ones i do are usually something long and drawn out. Treant fists, robe of the lost circle, the bard epic etc..when i get that item i feel all proud that *I* did the quest. Sure others might have helped me kill some of the critters, but i was there on every single raid, camp and loot necessary to complete it. <P>As an aside..even if this doesnt go thru for the love of god make jboots non-multiquestable. The reason some people who probably should have them (meaning they are the level of the people the things are meant for) is that high level people are either twinking or selling the rings via multiquesting...quite annoying to have your AC stolen by a high level bard or druid or something you know has zero use for the boots in the first place. <BR>end mini rant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Reason : Its very nice that if you want to get  a jboot and some nice guildmate donate that ring for you to make the quest done... and you try to do that likewise. Its very nice feeling in the game.. It still worth taking chance that pple might ruin the quest by  giving something to the npc rather than using one char to keep trying because that char might not have the ablity to do everything and take forever to complete the quest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Gosh, you guys just ooooze with empathy for the plight of your customer base.

Any set of items handed in partially triggers this 5 second delay, and if the item set is not completed within that window by a grouped player, then push the items back to the submitter.  If it is completed, then the person submitting the last item recieves the reward.<P>Eliminating quest chaining in the face of the NO DROP mess you have already created in EQ would just be another major nerf to the game.

</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>First of I got a laugh about "I would like to talk" part, but that aside I have a few things I would like to say.<P>In the last few months EverQuest, has under gone many changes in the game mechanics, and you have seen the problems this has caused. When change the rules, you change the game. With that in mind you have to make changes to keep it somewhat balanced, the way it is now. If you make the changes two thing are going to happen. 1) You are going to make some quest super easy and 2) other quest near impossible to complete. Now, you must think about all the quest you have in the game, you cannot possibly balance them all, you need to make a choice, choose what you think are most important, and some what 'fix' them to the changes you have made. Here are some examples: Pegasus cloak, Skin of Cazic Thule, Staff of Elemental: Mastery: Earth, and many others will need their lore tags removed for many reasons. Many of the FA quests were designed with multiquest as a possibility, you even hinted at it, just like many of the SoV we mobs where designed with Complete heal in mind. Another thing to keep in mind is the FA quest are designed for 46+ and some items will need the Lore tag added or kept on.<P>I am also sad to see one the major problems with questing is not addressed here, if you are going to make these changes, why not fix the problem with no inventory slots open. This seems to be the number one problem with questing, often the quest do not tell you if they are giving you and item that will not fit into a bag. Maybe you will change this so that if you have no room, they will return the items.<P>I got more to come, but I will end with this for now,<P>Ernie<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seeing that this is at the back of the list I am not sure if this will be read but what the heck.  Alot of those people that like say, God mode in Quake, will not want you to take multi questing away, and those that think that the game should be played right will.  For the most part, this question isn't going to be answered validly. I think the question at hand is should you take away a type of cheat in the game that has been there from the start or should you worry about those that actually validly want to do the quest and, knowing everyone isn't perfect, could make a mistake.   I do not believe there is a valid answer to this question.  I know just as many people that like the little work arounds in the game as I do those that like to have it work correctly.  I know I seem like I am leaning toward having it fixed so you get your items back because I am.  They would not have made the items no drop so that someone else can just hand in the pieces to get you what you want.  That is just a bug that was never fixed.  Again, neither answer is correct.  You will tick the same amount of people off either way you go.  The question is, do you want your game the work the way it was originally intended or do you want to allow it to continue the way it is. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Therefore, if there's a way to keep both in place, it's all to the better.  If Verant was questioning the validity of multi-questing, I'm not thinking they'd ask our opinion of it.

</FONT><HR>I'd much rather have the ability to get right and possibly even wrong items back than the ability to multiquest, as long as it is implemented so that you can't just randomly hand NPCs items to find out who gives quests, etc. If player demand for multiquesting is such that you decide not to do that, perhaps you can make NPCs just destroy NO DROP items and allow multi-questing with other items. Either this should be done, or high profile quests such as Jboots and certainly ALL epics should be changed to be non-multi-questable. I mean, come on, it's supposed to be an epic quest, the least you can do is actually be present for the whole thing.<BR>So yes, change it, or change something to prevent the "best" quests in the game from being multi-quested.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE DONOT CHANGE MULTI-QUESTING.<P>Want to stop the jboots farming/multi-questing, just have the dang AC drop the no-drop lore boots, once you got the ring the boots are yours anyways, its the same thing without the farming.<P>The AC is the most complained about quest mob in this game, to stop multi-questing because of this is wrong.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I gotta give you credit, you worded it really well.<P>But the summary of what Absor wrote is this:<BR>"We want to nerf multi-questing"<P>Unless you remove the No Drop status of about 100000 gazillion quest items, you are goin to have ALOT of pissed of customers if you do this.<P>I think it would be alot easier and more pleasing to the players if you just had the NPCs who give the quests out be a little bit more exact with what they want. These flowery passages that allude to what the NPCs want are real the problem.<P>If you gave us quests that were better worded and planned out we wouldn't have to have to play games to find out what the hell the NPC wants for the quest.<P>I mean think about it. You go up to some guy and get a quest from him. He blah blahs about some stuff and you aren't sure what he wants from you. SO YOU ASK HIM, AND HE TELLS YOU!!!
