Unfortunately, they are long since a thing of the past.  However, reading a few posts about the server recently brought up an interesting debate between my friends, though it might be a long dead horse here.<P>Everything on FV is no drop, with few exceptions.  To combat farming, the trivial loot code is in effect in some form (been a while).<P>Wouldn't it have been more roleplaying-conducive to have all gear beyond storebought and crafted be no drop, but with no trivial loot code?<P>Granted, it is more "realistic" to have everything no drop and tradeable, and it promotes a thriving player economy, but when I think of a "roleplaying" environement, realism isn't always my first order of business.<P>If everything were no drop, people would actually have to work towards their goals, rather than purchase them, by doing quests and venturing into dungeons.  To me, this translates to more people following storyline to get geared up, which creates more roleplaying opportunities.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Go somewhere else if you dont like it!".. Why cant they? Because the server is the only one with TLC and as it was, not very popular amongst the masses.  They should have made a second TLC server that wasnt meant for roleplay, and given anyone the boot who doesnt roleplay imo... they have every right to do so, its not a "public" product.<P>The game would have to be totally re-engineered as well.  EQ was built so high levels could sell stuff to low levels, ever notice how many focus effects on items drop off of mobs way more powerful than the level of the effect?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Of course, they would also need to redesign the quest system.<P>As a person who came to EQ, and later FV, as a roleplayer, the quest system is mindboggling, particularly when you factor in the TLC.  Ok, hail an NPC, begin a quest.  After many trials and tribulations, and not a few screw ups, you finally complete said quest, only you can't use the reward because it's for a different class/race.  Add to that the fact that you may start a quest on FV and not know until you get there that a necessary part drops from a greened out mob, and you've ruined any chance that people might rely on exploration and roleplaying to carry them through, rather than spoiler sites.<P>Maybe to some truly hardcore RPers out there, the reward doesn't matter, and I'll agree that some quests are just plain fun.  But the design is just plain awful.<P>I'm not sure why I'm rehashing old flaws.  Maybe I'm just looking forward to some new games, and starting to think about what things would scare me off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

While I don't personally care what a person wears or how they acquired it (as long as they don't go shoving it up my nose at every opportunity), I think it would help the whole immersion factor if you knew that there wasn't the equivalent of a K-Mart in the Sky to service your every need.<P>To make it even more interesting, such a server might also have the one-avatar-only rule, and also have it so that only the person who gets the kill shot can loot the body (with the option to default to someone else in the group at the time, with the members of the group locked as per LDoN), and have the body rot without being lootable to casual passersby.<P>Having incoming transfers locked out permanently goes without saying.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The only real problem I can see here would be with people used to other rulesets.  This would be such a drastic change that I doubt anyone used to the "normal" blue server rules, especially people who live for the high end, would like it other than as a temporary novelty, so the server population would suffer.<P>Who knows, though--it might be popular enough to be self-sustaining.  I would certainly play there almost excluysively.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Llanwe na Finn<BR>Druid, Daughter of Tunare<BR>May She be with you in all of the dark places where you must walk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=052055&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=052055&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
