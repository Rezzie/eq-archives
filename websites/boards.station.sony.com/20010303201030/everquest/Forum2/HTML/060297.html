</FONT><HR>I would like to say the Hate increase on healing has crippled clerics healing abilities. This game has evolved and been designed from the Old (prior to todays patch) Hate modifiers on healing. It is now utterly insane. Perfect example:<P>Tonight i was doing a CR in Chardok. So 3 friends come to help a bard a ranger and a warrior. When the warrior needed a CH I cast it. To get the Sarnek Myrmidon off of me I had to DA (twice), root it, and then chain heal myself to remain alive. All of this took place from ONE Complete Heal. The Sarnek was aggroed on me the ENTIRE fight. This is Completely un-acceptable and needs either the entire game Re-Vamped to match the new hate  modifiers or the modifiers changed back.<P>Lenaleni<BR>58th Templar of the forever broken Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know. tried it out some and the hate is a bit worse but, I think we are not the ones who get it bad on this one. We do have DA, etc. I find it kind of ironic that the druids/shammies get their new heal spells along with this change in hate list. Think about it. Hehe is kinda ecvil really. Druid/shammie happily cast their nwe heal spells and whammo mob eats them. No DA, no plate armor, and no way to mem wipe the mob (Atone). Shammies a little tougher but druids are "thin skinned" when it comes to armor and get eaten real quick in general. I find it rather poetic myself <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.

</FONT><HR>"Guess clerics will have to learn how to fight old school, back before they could chain cast heals."<P>The point here slick is that we've been playing this way for two years now, then all of a sudden, with one patch, EVERYTHING changes. My tactics will need thorough polishing now because of this idiotic patch. Increasing hate aggro according to a proportion of how many hitpoints we heal is insane. I read the patch message again and I realize that it isn't based on exactly how many hitpoints you heal your target for, but it's still cruel. <P>Example: I was in the Plane of Fear last night with my guild. We had 47 people bashing on the squid boy knights (eh, name escapes me). There were four of these things and they were all mezzed save one. I put on heal on my tank and BOOM, as soon as the other three were unmezzed, they ran to me and the one banging on TEN, let me repeat TEN, of our tanks ran through that crowd to beat on me. I had FOUR level 50+ monsters beating me to death and I couldn't even GET DIVINE AURA TO CAST!!! They couldn't taunt, they couldn't root them because they just summoned me over. <P>Another cute example occurred in the Dreadlands last night. I healed some poor soul who was about to die while trying to get to the KC zone line... well... my heal gets off and TWO Drolvarg Ragers come over and start bashing no me. One came from out of nowhere and then of course the one that was on him. <P>Does this make sense to you? Do you see the underlying dangers of playing a cleric at such a high level now? This increased AI was either increased too much, or definitely bugged somewhere. It's sadistic to change tactics that we have used for several years. I'm adapting, but it will take more time to get used to having something beat the living crap out of me everytime I try to heal my tanks. If I let it beat on the tank a bit, everything is fine, but if there is more than one mob and the other doesn't have a long enough hate list, then I might as well kiss my high elven arse goodbye because it won't work to taunt them off because taunt sucks now.<P>This isn't a bash to Verant, I love them and the game... what this is is an example or two displaying what happened last night as a direct result of this patch. <P>I understand that CHeal didn't have a hate list aggro on it before that was even close to GHeal... but it shouldn't be THIS MUCH... I'm literally SCARED to heal anyone now because of this...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Now if someone has some solutions, PLEASE post them, by all means. I would love to see them, but root, fyi, does not work with the higher level mobs as they summon. Maybe I need to test this more, I don't know... just ranting here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

He wouldn't, he would go straight for the person keeping the tanks alive.  That's what we do in dungeons isn't it?

</FONT><HR>If a cleric is having trouble because his group mates can't get a mob off him, well to be frank, leave that group immediately and find a new one because it is painfully obvious that no one in that group has a clue what they are doing. Especially given the fact that you mention Chardok of all places. If someone didn't stick a root, or a snare or a stun the INSTANT the mob went for the cleric, then the people you were grouped with are suckers and have no idea how to play.

</FONT><HR>Georgia_Everlore,<P>Thank you.  Most of the times when someone with a different opinion posts it, s/he gets flamed.<P>I understand what you are saying.  With one heal you were attacked viciously by multiple monsters.  That can definatly be a scarry moment.<P>But, now is a time for us all (not just healers) to reevaluate our tactics.  Roots, memblurs, debuffs, DoTs, mezzing and nuking are taking a larger part in battles now.  The standard: let the tanks fight and the healers heal while everyone else does misc. things is not going to be good enough anymore.  <P>Classes will now be put in separate required roles.  You didn't bring a necro last time you fought?  Well now you may want one, his fear spells will be WELL liked.  Palladins will be more needed for thier stuns.  What about that shaman you didn't invite because you had 2 healers and 4 tanks in your group?  Well, his roots/slows/debuffs are very liked now.  Remeber that wizard you didn't take with you because you had a druid?  Well when a monster is eating up a cleric I'm sure a wizard's fast casting large damage spells will be helpful.<P>We've been going through the motions of battle and our hearts have stopped beating fast.<P><BR>Raenfal<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well I think some warning on a hate/agro change would have been nice..  I hate to say this but the people who say a change in tactics and group make up are needed are correct. CH is not going to be a good viable combat heal anymore if its going to generate huge ammounts of agro..  I guess its time to use those low agro spells they put in post 51 and make sure the tanks spread the damage around instead of concentrating all the damage on the warrior so CH can be used with maximum effectiveness.. <BR>EQ is "supposed" to be a dynamic changing game.. well guess what.. the Mobs just woke up and realized they really really dislike people who heal their targets...<BR>Forget the exp grinding, the loot farming, etc and take some time to try out some new tactics..  maybe clerics need an upgrade to Atone something less resistable, faster casting. something not quite as reliable as the Divine Aura series but can be used more (instant recast maybe).. or how about a point blank area effect (melee range) stun something fast casting to give you TIME to get DA or DB off... <BR>OR maybe its time to go through your spell book and look at ALL the spells you don't use (or never bought) and see if there is anything you could use creatively.. <P>One thing is certain though.. using CH at the wrong time is going to be extremely risky.<P>And to the person who said She felt Scared to cast a heal on the tank because she might draw the mobs attention. well people were saying Clerics were boring to play, V fixed it by putting a porkchop around your necks... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

My party always runs through walls before attacking from under the world, while impervious to falls, drowning and lava, before focusing our attacks on the healer.<P>The game got a lot easier for us when we could summon all mobs once we past 50, regardless of class, and the high level people of the group, regardless of class, could backstab for incredible amounts of damage.

Nerfs to Donals, increases in hatelists, giving healing and ressurection spells to other classes are all designed to get us out of the way and make the rest of you play longer.<P>Yes, we're upset that our healing spell went do Shamans and Druids.  True, it wasn't our best one, but look at it like this: When the clerics are all gone, and that Superiour Heal is the *best* you can get....imagine how many deaths will result, and imagine how long raids are going to last, and imagine how much of the game *you* won't be able to see because of it.<P>I particularly enjoyed the little quip: "Just think about how angry it makes you when you've nearly got Vox dead and she casts a Complete Heal."  Uh-huh.  Right.

</FONT><HR>I beg to differ about a ranger helping in this case.  Last night in Cahrdok we get a 2 pull.<BR>Group has 60 ranger, 57 warrior, 56 warrior, 55 Paladin, 56 Druid and 56 Cleric.  Nice easy exp group 2 kills shouldnt be a problem.  WRONG.  The cleric lays a heal on the 56 warrior bam both mobs goto him.  60 ranger and 56 warrior jump on one 57 warrior and the paladin jump on the other.  They would not come off.  They beat on him till he ran.  I layed 5 snares on each as well as healed the cleric constantly.  Normally snare will move me to the top of an agro list.  I evewn casted heal and sat right in front of him.  No dice.  <P>It seems they made it way out of proportion.  This was not a fix this was an outright break. Removing the Donals breastplate from combat use, was sort of a fix.  I didnt agree with it but thats me.  But now totally removing the ability to have a viable hunt is ridiculus.  You have made healers prime target.  Unfortunately I have seen no notice that you have reduced HP of the mobs to help offset this.  So Vellious encounters of normal raid size will now be epic battles.  Watching clerics die as they throw a heal.<P>I have to belive this was just a poor decision.  In a marketing sense you have effectively reduced the amount of timakes to level, hence more revenue.  But you have also reduced the enjoyability of the game.  Actions like this do not help any long term goals.  Awhile back some one in the Verant staff said you were going to cease nerfing.  Please stick by your words return the hate list the way it was.  Actions like these will just make the migration that much larger when a new game comes out.  The market tone should be keep the customer happy. Happy customers mean more profit.  Un happy customers mean loss of sales and revenue.  I know this the companies work.  Please re think your stance and return the hate list to its prior position. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not that this is the only place that it can happen, but just one time it happened to me sticks in my mind.<P>I was on gargoyle island (in oot) with my lvl 40 monk one day when I was bored, and started beating up a gargoyle.  (Of course I attacked him, but he would have attacked me if I was sitting down.  An orc pawn will attack me if I'm sitting down.  An orc pawn with 5 gozillion intelligence will attack me when I'm sitting down at level 55 if he is only level one half.  It's only sensible.)  I was hurting the gargyle a good deal, of course he stayed, and fought, even though he couldn't hit me.  A low level character near by was in his own fight at the time.  He got very low on health, and even though the gargoyle I was fighting had his back to him, he took off like a rocket to the other guy.  It's funny that way.  I always knew social NPC's would jump you if you reached very low life, even if they were so green they would normally ignore you (while you are standing up of course).  I just had never seen one leave a beat down to go kill someone like that.  It's probably just sensible though.<P>Really, nothing is done because it is sensible.  It is done if it can make things harder--&gt;make things take longer--&gt;keep you subscribed until you fall out of your chair and die--&gt;wait for family members to cancel your credit card.<P>And role playing?

</FONT><HR>Zaphodius,<P>Rooted mobs most certainly can summon.  In the majority of encounters where there are mobs of that level (55+), you don't get one at a time, you get multiples, so you can't really root them all anyway.  You can't stun them either, as 55th+ mobs are immune to stun.<P>Atone is slow-casting, slow to recycle, and doesn't work very often.  Enchanter mem blurs fail quite a bit also, and give no resist messages when they do fail.<P>What this boils down to, is that your paladin is going to be stepping up to the plate to fill in for a dead cleric that just got pummeled into the dirt by multiple high-level mobs, who are now pissed at you for tossing LoH/heals around too.  You might last a bit longer than the cleric, but I doubt it will be long enough to get to a zone or evac.<P>This patch, and the uproar it's caused, have done nothing but reinforce my decision to switch to another game as soon as one is available (AO is looking good).  In the meantime, I'm just burning off the game time I've already paid for.  This SNAFU patch can be fixed - Verant will have to de-tune mobs throughout the entire game, especially those in Velious, in order to make high-level encounters manageable again, or else they will have to back out the aggro changes to an extent (be they reducing the heal taunts or giving the taunt factor of procs back to tanks).

You've just got to remember how to play the game is all.<P>If you have more than one MOB your tanks should know that they have to hit each MOB for a bit of damage if you're not going to root/mez them. <P>You don't have to do much damage. Once you've hit each MOB once all the damage you do to other MOBs in melee range counts as aggro on the tank ON ALL THE MOBs.<P>Had your friends in the CR been smart and hit all the MOBs BEFORE you cast a single heal I bet they never would have jumped to you at all.<P>Clearly your group has become complacent and got used to the simplified world where clerics NEVER got aggroed.

In time, they will eat their words.<P>Listen well, because everyone of you who is 'happy' about that nerf will probably want to quit the game once it starts to truly affect you.<P>You know why?  Because in a Video Game, you should have a fighting chance against most Monsters/Enemies assuming you are correctly prepared.  Ultra powerful, truly unkillable characters are for novels and movies.  There should not be more than an 1 or 2 of them in the game.  Velious already introduced one.  This nerf makes a lot of Velious Ubers impossible to kill for the greater majority of people, for 99% of players.  I'm talking about those who will take 2 or 3 years to level to 60, expecting to have a fighting chance against those Monsters.<P>I'm sure FoH and a few select guilds will find a way to go on owning stuff around Norrath ; Just know that you do not.  Know that you are PAYING programmers to develop encounters/zones against which YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE, even when you Ding lvl 60.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This isn't about "relearning how to play"...<P>This is broken code, plain and simple.<P>Here's a good example from last night.<P>I was just logged in on Veeshan server playing in the Lake of Ill Omen in a Fort Group.<P>In the middle of a combat with my group (28 Warrior, 28 Rogue, 26 Shaman, another 28 Rogue, 28 Wizard, and myself a 27 Cleric), I cast a Greater Healing on my badly damaged warrior.<P>**Every Mob** in the area decided to have my butt for lunch and I died.<P>I had waited until very far into the combat before healing (the warrior was at less than 2 bubs of health before I cast and both Rogues and the Shaman were damaged, I cannot recall if all mobs were damaged but one was close to death). <P>There were nukes, DoTs, and Procs going off yet *I* was singled out for casting only one heal.<P>It is my opinion that the new Hate calcuation for Clerics and healing needs to be examined and examined quickly.<P>There is no way that five mobs -- including the nearly dead one that was pounded on, DoTed, Nuked, Proced, etc --  should come after me for casting one and only one heal (before I died).<P>I had done nothing else during that fight. I was medding for the heals.  I had no chance to cast Root or Holy Might or even buff during the fight.<P>The new Aggro code is broken.<P>Please fix it.<P>Thanks<P><BR>Theramor Laeroth<BR>&lt;The Imperial Alliance&gt;<BR>28th Level Cleric<BR>Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
