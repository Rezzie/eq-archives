</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt; Should (In your opinion) they both have <BR>&gt;&gt; similar sucess rates (on average) in a similar <BR>&gt;&gt; time period?<P>Not necessarily. It depends on the classes you are choosing. Not all melee classes are designed to solo as well as others. The Warrior will potentially get more kills in your test because higher AC and HP probably means less down time for healing. But in a group I think the differences will be more important and balance things out. <P>For example, as an Enchanter, Monks love me because I can Haste them. Warriors like Haste too, but it doesn't seem to be as important to them. Is this because they can take more damage so a longer fight isn't as much a concern?<P>---<P>Regarding weapons, didn't you ever watch Kung Fu on TV with David Carradine? That dude could kick but with his bare hands and feet as needed, but if you gave him a 3-part staff or something, man he really wailed. Ok, it's just TV, but this is just a game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The point is, why shouldn't a master of martial arts be able to cause more damage with a weapon than without? Really who's going to go against a scale-armored dragon with his hands if he could use a magic sword? Unless you gave the Monk "Gloves of Icy Piercing" or something, in which case, you've still given them a weapon, just a different kind.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Exactly Oddbod.  Who ever said that a monks most powerful weapons were his hands.  That goes against every martial discipline.  Yes, through the basics you fight with your hands, they are what you learn to fight with first and foremost because they are always with you.  But I'm not sure of an art that doesn't teach weapons in the higher belts.  Every one I know of throws in naunchukas or staffs or other sticks, knives and assorted weaponry.<P>Monks were NEVER supposed to tank as good as warriors either.  In fact, a monk shouldn't tank as well as a SK or a Pal in my opinion.  Monks are there as the masters of mele damage and in a given time frame a monk will almost always outdamage a warrior (unless a statistical freak of nature occurs).  This is as it should be.  Everyone who is complaining because their monk can't tank as well as a warrior has missed the point.  The point is a monk SHOULDN'T be able to tank as well as a warrior.  <P>Mele damage kings, undoubtedly.  Just as they were designed to be.  I fail to see the problem.  Quit yer whining and go play the game there is no problem where you are claiming there to be one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hum, I have a stupid question.  Are the monk and warrior, fighting naked?.  He says he got a lvl 60 monk, and a lvl 60 warrior.  He did not say what equipment they have.  My lvl 56 monk has a strength of 130.  I can get a little higher if I give up AC. But my point is that a lvl 60 warrior would not have a strength less then 200.  There selection of equipment is vastly superiority.  So a warrior will have higher str/agi/dex/sta then a monk.<P>A warrior with 200 str has a much higher atk then a monk with 130 str.  Add in the fact that warriors get weapons that have some damn nice procs, I see the margin closing even more.<P>If you included the runed fighters staff, or the tranquil staff as standard equipment, then MAKE IT DROP LIKE STANDARD EQUIPMENT.  Having it be ultra rare drops is crazy.  Then saying that it is standard equipment just adds salt to the wounds.<P>Windsom 56 monk (karana)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't know why some of these monks are thinking we should have similiar defensive abilities to those of a warrior. Seems to me that our defense is fine for what we are. Monks seem to be the best damage dealers with the least defense for melee classes while warriors are the worse damage dealers with the best defense for melee classes. I enjoy playing both my monk and my warrior. The only problem I see with monks is that we should have a much better than 20-25% better damage output over a warrior since our defense capabilites are much less than 20-25% less than that of a warrior's. Seems to me that the best "fix" monks would be to give us the 50-60% better damage output that we use to have pre-Kunark. Prap's making some of our better weapons a bit more common would help too. People like to talk about Ton Po's Bo Stick of Understanding a lot thinking that weapons of that like give us a significant damage output even though there's probably three or four Ton Po's Bos on all the servers together... Oh well, I still like my monk as he is, would be nice to do more damage than my warrior did at his level though, not that dual fighting batons aren't great weapons.

</FONT><HR>Here's a couple things that are bugging me.<P>#1) I read a few of the monk posts before Gordon's<BR>kind test. They all seemed to be complaining that<BR>wariors could outdamage them. That was it, just a<BR>simple "we don't do as much damage as they do"<BR>post. Now that Gordon has tested this, NOW the<BR>posts are about damage taking, AC, and hitpoints.<BR>Be a bit more consistant.<P>#2) Taking more damage. Where is it written that,<BR>as a monk, you must stand up in there and fight<BR>fight fight, every moment of combat? If you're<BR>getting hit a lot, and your hp's are going down,<BR>turn off your autoattack and let the tanks taunt<BR>the mob off.<BR>Back out for a bit, throw some shriukens, just use your special attakcs, make sure none of the casters are being hit, feign pull some of the mobs that have added away from the combat, bandage yourself, or just plain let the mob hit someone else for a while. You have options.<P>If Gordon says that you monks do around 20-25% more damage thank warriors, dosnt that mean that you can step out of 20-25% of the combat, take less damage, cause less strain on the healers, and still do relatively the same damage as the warriors in your group did?<P>Ok, you might not kill the mob quite as quickly, but you'll let the warriors with the superior AC suck up some damage for a bit.<P>Just getting some things off my chest..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  I'm not tired and cranky anymore after a good night's rest, but everything else here seems to hold true.  I did change my chat handle btw, since the Rathe is acting relatively decent recently...<P>  Pulled from another thread because I think it needs to be in this one too...<P>Monks are supposed to be loose cannons - high damage at a fast rate, low tanking skills. Monks used to be the combatant most likely to stop an enemy caster from casting with a click on the "Flying Kick" key. If the kick went well, there was a Good chance the caster would be interrupted. Warriors did NOT take this from us, they have a hard time stopping higher level casters from casting as well. Monks with their proper weapons (HANDS) now do approximately the same damage as a warrior of the same level with high end equipment. Unless the monk has a superweapon which 99% of monks will never see. The prior balance of the melee classes is Broken now. Groups will suffer for it because the monk does not have the extra offensive power to stop a casting mob from completing it's spell. Did you ever notice the shiverback armor defenses? lots of magic/heat/cold defenses - monks are melee casterkillers. Even a single lvl 50-60 offensive spell can make a HUGE difference in the outcome of a battle. Sure monks will still have their place in groups - it is a game after all and we have friends. Until some relatively good low-weight, more than once per month drop, high damage monk WEAPON (*snarl*) is implemented, we will not be able to do our JOB - stop the casters from casting. If lvl 50-60 enemy casters start dropping 1000+ point damage Dots and massive debuffs on the tanks, the tanks will eventually die, then the hapless party wil get smacked around by casting mobs that punch for 100+ damage.<P>I believe that in an even fight, a warrior Should be able to beat a monk about 50% of the time or more. Against a warrior type mob, the monk should get squished, a warrior of the same level and general equipment quality should do FAR better. Against a spellcaster type mob, the warrior should get fried - the mob will cast between attacks. The monk _should_ have a better showing here because he will be interrupting spells, but against anything in the 50-60 range this is not the case unless the monk has a ultrararesuperstick of some sort.<P>If there was balance before, then the relative strengths of the melee classes should remain the same. Monks aren't the only ones who are suffering - Rangers are hurting too - their defenses need a lot of help - they are a puller class, but can suffer horribly in many cases if they get a crit on an initial pull (now with 2x damage), it will be a while before the warrior/pally can taunt the critter off unless the ranger is using 1 damage arrows (Doh!). Both classes still have good core abilities - monks have FD, mend and warrior level damage ability, rangers have great bow skill, some spells, and tracking.<P>Forgive me if I am a bit suspicious, but I am _almost_ to the point of believing that both of these "nerfs by default" were intentional in order to make the game more "challenging" to groups. There are supposed to be unbreakable upper limits to skills (252). This means that mobs cannot have skills above a certain ability. Where am I driving with this? Again - back to enemy casting...<P>I'm thinking that if rangers were allowed to actually have defenses, they might be able to (with the new more powerful buff spells) stop casters from casting by plunking them with an 8 damage arrow out of a shaped darkwood compound bow, or perhaps even a better bow, and actually live through the brief furious assault likely to follow after doing a big chunk of damage. Monks would also be able to do the same thing - do enough damage to stop a caster from casting - they have a possible way to avoid being nuked in worst case scenario though - FD, so the easiest solution was to simply not give them the same relative offensive capability as other non-casters - if they can't hit hard enough to disrupt high level casters regularly, then the developers do not need to figure out a way to increase the skill levels of mobs beyond the current limits of the game in order to reduce the monk's chances if interrupting spells. In order to give the appearance of maintaining melee class balance, ultrarare new monk weapons were introduced. If I am correct, the new ultrarare monk weapons will go the way of the dodo once a few are established on each server, and monk offensive capability without weapons will remain at their current level.<P>I'm tired, I'm cranky, and I'm upset. Going to bed soon. I'm hoping that some of you who believe that monks want to be the end-all-be-all of melee combat will eventually realize that we just want our relative ability back without having to spend 6 months camping a creature that can kill 30 level 50-55 characters in 5 minutes (granted with time and practice Trak will die easier to fewer players - but it's still a monster mob).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, I have a 44 monk that I put a ton of time and energy into...some of you may know him as Candor of Quellious Server. I stopped playing my monk for a couple reasons. I look at the game as an RPG, i.e. what is my role in the group. At this point, monks no longer have a role in the game. There used to be a point where you would have a monk for pulling or damage, a warrior for tanking, etc...and you would tailor your group for the events you had planned for the evening. Now, there really is no use for a monk. Monks are mana sinks, can't pull as effectively as an SK or are less valuable than an enchanter of the same level, etc...<P>Bottom line is this. Until the folks at Verant quit trying to prove that they're right and the people who play monks are wrong ('cause that is what the whole argument boils down too,) I refuse to play my monk. Playing him is no longer fun and I originally played the monk class because it was fun. Do your tests, focus on the questions that you know you can answer and be in the right, and continue to ignore the valid arguments of the people that are putting their time and effort into achieving the next goal. I'm now playing an SK and have to say, I'm having fun again. I tank better than a monk, I deal more than enough damage to kill a mob in enough time that I'm not at risk of a wanderer getting me. My down time is minimal, really, I no longer see the use for my monk. <P>I found it interesting that one argument was that it is more important to kill the mob quickly and be almost dead than it is to kill it slowly and be almost dead. That idea is absolutely ludicrous. Almost dead is almost dead, so what. The Verant VISION is not to solo. The Verant VISION has clearly restricted one's ability to solo, so much so, that they have beefed up Kunark MoBs to the point that a low blue is virtually unstoppable by any solo class (to include wizards, the master's of fast damage). SO, in respect to the testing conducted by Abashi, I say, "so what?" Maximum damage output is really irrelevant at 40+. The true question is, is my role as a monk in a group a helping role or is it an inhibitive role (i.e. more likely to cause the demise of the entire group). In EQ these days, a monk can't be a tank, he's too much of a mana sink. The monk deals approximately 10% more damage than a warrior, that's great, but frankly the extra 35 seconds to kill a mob is far more acceptable than the 2 minutes needed for your cleric to get back to enough mana to begin healing the monk again. I can't pull because MoB's remember 99% of the time and I'm more likely to pull the entire dungeon onto our group (yes I know that you can try splitting hi lvl mobs with 2 people but then your monk is COMPLETELY removed from the next few battles, consequently diminishing your group effectiveness by 1/6th....what happened to that 10% more damage!?!?!) So okay, a monk an sit there and whack stuff. Nope, no more fun in my book. <P>What I would like to see is a written statement of Verant's VISION concerning EVERY class's role in game. Then I would like to see a poll asking people what their primary character is, whether or not they feel that their character fits Verant's vision of that character's role, and perhaps a suggestion on how to achieve more balance for their character. And finally, (and I know this is asking a lot) I would like Abashi to run those tests again under real conditions, i.e. have the mob attack, have the warrior able to go berserk, etc...I think you'll find that the damage difference may be the same, but only if the monk will survive long enough to finish the battle. Also, insure that the warrior is either a large race or at least has a 200+ str (buffs or whatever). Control the environment during these tests. All stats should be the same for the monk and the warrior. AC, STR, DEX, etc...should not vary by more than 10. Allow the use of disciplines, test with weapons of the same speed, no procs. Then provide us with the test results...<P>Anyhow, back to my SK. I'm having fun but I wanted to comment on this. We'll see what happens. Perhaps we monk types just need to complain more (no offense but it appears that the only people who get their classes effectively balanced appear to be those that whine and complain the loudest). Still, I may be off base in which case, show me where my logic is off. I'll be curious to see what, if anything, happens with the monk class. Take care and best of luck to all.<P>Candor<BR>semi-retired monk of quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>GREAT JOB ON THE TEST, ABASHI!<P>I think your test was very eloquently descriptive of your argument that monks are better damage-dealers than warriors.  The question, Gordon, is:<P>Does the damage they dish out that exceeds a warrior's act as an appropriate balance for the warrior's hitpoint balance, and which is more important in a player vs. environment situation?<P>Perhaps you should have equipped a monk and a warrior, in their currently "best available armor" and see how long each can stand in against a certain NPC.  I think the result will be pretty descriptive of our concerns.  We monks wanted to do enough damage to compensate for the fact that we get chewed up by mobs, especially in Kunark.<P>One might think a relatively reasonable result, if the classes are balanced, would be for the monk to die quicker, but only in a proportion relatively close to that of how much more damage he does than a warrior.  That would strike the balance between damage absorbtion and dealing, with the warrior absorbing more and dealing less, and the monk absorbing less, and dealing more.<P>Currently, AC and HP are king in your game.  Warriors have the best of both of those under your current system.  We just want our damage superiorty not to cost us more than a reasonable amount of armor class.  Try that test of yours with the mob hitting back.  You'll see what we mean, I think,<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  I have discovered a good role for a high level monk in Kunark without a hyperbonkindragonbeater stick - wizard or druid pet.  We don't tank, we just follow behind the monster beating on it and trying to Instill Doubt while the wizard with jboots or the druid casts enough damage on the creature that it will keep chasing them.  If the monster turns around to beat on the monk, thats ok for a short while until the caster burns it again.  So now monks can be pets too.  I can get exp this way, but would rather be in a larger group killing higher level creatures - invitations which I rarely get except from friends and guildmates.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon,<P>It's good to test.<P>However your methodology is flawed. <P>The damage potential of a PC is directly derived from the resources avalible to the PC, and this is part of the reason why things are so utterly hosed up in the game when it comes various classes capacities when compared to anothers.<P>In order to do an accurate test, the mob one beats on must be class-appropriate (something that X class would reasonably fight, that does reasonable damage to the PC), and the PC must fight until their resources (HP/MANA/STA) are exausted either by zeroing out & death, or some short bit just above death. <P>THAT provides an accurate test. Look at high level rangers as an example, the class does ok damage for a melee class (nothing to brag about), but has a very low offensive potential becasue they die like freakin flies the minute a high-end mob starts beating on them. Monks are talking about a similar sort of matter.<P>The dead don't do damage. Defense is a big part of any offense. This is way more true of melee classes than caster classes.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>So you want to do insane amounts of damage and tank like a warrior?  I see.  You want SoW too?  How about teleports?<P>So, by using the logic of some posters, a lvl 20 warrior using a rusty sword will outdamage a lvl 60 monk if he manages to stay alive longer.  Get real!

</FONT><HR>  Monks also riposte - a warrior wielding a very high damage 2h sword will do much more damage on a successful riposte than a monk, but compared to overall damage, the difference would be pretty much negligible - ripostes don't happen extremely frequently - maybe enough to shift percentages 1% or 2% either way over the course of a couple thousand damage would be my S.W.A.G.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004016&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004016&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
