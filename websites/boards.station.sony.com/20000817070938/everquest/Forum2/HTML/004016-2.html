</FONT><HR>Thank you Gordon this shows that there is a commitment to client base and I am happy to see it. Good work!<P>This test was valid in answering certain questions. I think the problem is the some people do not like the fact they were proven wrong. <P>As to what question it answers I think that falls to how you interpret the test. My believe is this shows that a monk can out damage a Warrior. Which I believe was what was challenged. Now you can add all the extra clauses you like (mob need to fight back, give him a 40 stone pack to hold, make him stand on his head etc...)  but the fact remains that IF the monk was improve to the extent asked then would he then not be the Warrior class. Your class like others is should be used in a group, and in that situation you will do more damage. Now Rouges and Rangers can say the same thing that you have that there class does not compare to a warrior, but you are not suppose to REPLACE the warrior class, you there to compliment a group. If one class starts to replace the other then would you not have the warrior class calling for monk skill so the can compete for groups. We have all heard this before an we know where it leads.<P>Some people have labeled these people as whiners I think a more accurate tittle would be passionately driven. I think we all are when dealing with our favorite classes. And it  sometimes hard to stay impartial. We should remember that you can make a test that will favor one class over another easily enough but in this case I see a test that was setup to prove a point about the overall damage that can be dealt out by a monk in melee combat. That was done.<P>Again good work on the challenge, and for those that are still upset please try to take a sober look at it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Dark</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If you're going to put words in my mouth, be sure you finish it. <P>Yes, 1 class is ALWAYS going to be far more popular and effective than all other classes in certain situations.  This is how the game is balanced.  If we could all do the same thing would this really be a fun game?   Nope..  It would be more like Asheron's Call.  <P>If you want a "cookie cutter" game then this is not the game for you.  I'd recommend Asheron's Call.  In that game you can customize your character to pretty much be able to do anything, anytime, anywhere.  Verant designed the game so some classes will be needed more than others in different situations so you're motavated to get out and meet new people.  If all classes were able to go out and achieve the same thing without the aid or others this game would be pretty boring.

</FONT><HR>For the past several weeks, the complaints by monks here on the board (most of the complaints anyway) have been that they no longer outdamage warriors.  The tests that I did were only to confirm that that wasn't true.  Yes, I conceed that monks cannot takes hits as well as warriors, but that's never been where the disagreement has been.  When people said, "Monks no longer outdamage warriors", I had to disagree, which is why I ended up testing it out.  However, when people now say, "We can't take hits like a warrior", I agree with that.<P>Dealing out more damage than the warrior doesn't mean that you'll beat the warrior in a duel, nor that the ratio of damage dealing to damage taking capability is constant.  The benefit of extra damage has more weight than the disadvantage of being defensively inferior. <P>I'm sure that some would say, "If a warrior can solo creature X in two minutes and be almost dead at the end, then a monk should be able to do the same in a minute and end up almost dead".  This would be an example of constant ratio between offense and defense and the two classes.  This however isn't the case.  If the ratio were constant as suggested, there would, again, be no reason to have the warrior, because the monk's other skills would make them preferable in all cases.  Not to mention, there's an added benefit any time a creature is killed faster than normal, a benefit that can't be measured directly against the power of the class, but more against its usefulness to the group.  Would a group, for instance, like to kill things in 2 minutes and end up OOM and near death at the end? Or would the rather do it in 1 minute and end up the same way?  They'd want it done faster in all cases.  That's what monks and rogues add as melee classes.<P>Concerning everyone saying that the test wasn't "valid", I fully agree with that from a scientific standpoint.  Many more combats would have to be carried out than the ones I could do over a couple of hours yesterday.  To be honest, its not really my job to test things of this nature, I just do it as needed so I can speak with first-hand experience.  Though the specific percentage point differences can't really be considered averages, I do think that the test fairly well answered the question: Do monks outdamage warriors?<P>There was one interesting thing in the test that I didn't mention in the post yesterday, concerning the one time that the warrior outdamaged the monk.  The warrior was using his best combo out of the 5 weapon combos I tried, the monk his worst (bare knuck).  The damage ratios were determined by seeing how long it took for the character to kill the NPC in question.  The monk completed the task in under two minutes in every case but one, where it took 2:03.  The warrior was over two minutes in every case, with its fastest time at 2:01.  The monk's best time, by the way, was 1:30.<P>-Gordon<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>I think the test is a great step to show us you're interested in player concerns.  I have two observations:<P>1) This is ONLY a test of damage OUTPUT, not combat effectiveness.  Do not mistake the two.<P>2) As with other places where you have been burned, and I hate to pour salt in the Alchemy wound, but if you summoned up two ready-made level 60s, I would suggest this immediately throws the results of the test into doubt.  Are you 100%, absolutely, POSITIVELY certain that your rigged characters' skills are NOT influenced by the fact that they were not naturally raised?  I recall that with Alchemy the big problem with the test was that your summoned test character had artificially set skill levels which somehow got around the real bug in the code that prevented players with skills raised naturally from zero from using the skill in the same manner.<P>Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordo if you missed my last post in the other thread... thanks for testing!<P>sure we all can offer better testing ideas, but it shows some initiative on your part as a customer service rep... id suggest passsing the issue along to the TESTING TEAM and have them run all these 'real-world' situations people post about<P>if what you say is true... then yes i agree that it becomes a choice for groups... do we want another warrior to absorb more damage and fight longer... or do we want a Monk or Rogue and kill faster.<P>perhaps one issue you have not addressed is the LACK of the appropriate weapons for Monks... im sure your testing was as accurate as possible... but did you take into consideration how many of the playing Monk population have some of those weapons you tested with?<P>people test on their own given what they can REASONABLE attain... and as it stands the warrior weapons and monk weapons that are reasonably attained are similar.<P>perhaps Verant should look into the availability of these weapons that are necessary to make us deal above/beyond warrior weapons... if they remain far too rare and elusive... then 99% of the Monk population will always be a weaker warrior.<P>As it stands... basically only those 1% FEW MONKS who have a Runed Fighters Staff or Tranquil Staff will offer the group the 'ability' to kill a monster faster... the remaining 99% of monks will only offer warrior-type damage without the TANKING of course.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  As I have mentioned before, a monk with a superswankmonsterbonker and the appropriate skill maxxed is gonna outdamage a warrior  -  I KNOW this, ALL monks know this.  This _totally_ goes against the basic concept of the monk.  No Weapons.  A monk is supposed to be a master of unarmed combat - honing the body into the ultimate weapon.  I would like to see ALL of the lightsabers gone from the game, but that won't happen, so I would like to see a MUCH smaller discrepancy between monk unarmed combat damage and monk combat damage with twinkomaticsmacksticks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

To snidly say that I claim to know something about mathmatics, Your correct I do, and I stated in my argument, That a 25 set sample does not accuratly test the premise. Take a coin and flip it 100 times and chart it. If it comes out 50/50 head to tails every time you do the test. Well then I guess someone must be useing a weighted coin...chuckle. Well Im tired of this, Gordon and all the collective you win. Well I guess all the classes are balanced then and noone never ever will need a patch or change or update. If someone does get one it certainly wont be the monk..Call me names if ya like but , that what children usually do.<P>Katn<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Ok, now it is apparent that no matter what they do, people will always complain...the grass is always greener on the other side and what not. <P>We should be very thankful that he did the test, it shoes that he does care.<P>Each class has it's purposes.. and it's abilitys. Each has ways to survive, and to solo, and they each have their roles in groups. The monk has incredible ability to do damage. That has been proven, but part of that ability to have the possibility of doing so much damage comes at a cost of less AC, and HP's. It's not a bad thing, it's just the way it is, and it seems IMO to be very balanced in that aspect. Even if we look at things from the basic RPG fantasy model we'll see that these are comman differences between Monks, and Warriors. A monk is faster, can deal more damage rapidly. That's not the same with a warrior. A warrior is toting extremly heavy armor, which in operating theory makes the warrior easier to hit, but harder to do damage to..i.e translated into more a combined benifit of AC and HP, since their armor is keeping a lot of the damage from ever reaching the warrior. A monk bennifets from his operating theory by having, good dodge, and blocking, and riposting. Think about how this translates into game. You are blocking weapons with your bare hands!! The sheer amazing concept of this alone should be enough to keep monks happy. I know I am with mine.<P>/end rant<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is a repost of a question that I asked above. I am sory but recent posts have made me believe that this point has been overlooked. Gordon this is not realy for you. It is more for people like Xmortal, m3i3rDOrf, DorianBrytestar, and even Bakpai<P>&gt;&gt;:&gt;&gt;&gt;I wish you monks would stop complaining just because you can't do you 50 to 60 % more damage that you use to before expansion.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>Answer me this. Were monks overpowered before the expansion? Verant was quite vocal before and after the expansion about Monks and all classes being "Ballenced" If we accept this as true and then look at the post expansion statistics is it still true.<P>You said yourself that we can not outdamage like we used to. This means that in this area Warriors (And other classes) have caught up to monks. Are the classes still Ballenced? I must assume that Verant put that 50 to 60% damage gap there for a reason. I also must assume (Based on their words) that this gap was necessary to maintain the "Ballance" Well 1 thing that you and everyone seem to agree on is that this gap is no longer there. If the gap was necessary before why is it not necessary now? Were the classes Imballenced before? did Verant Lie to us?<P>I like playing my monk and I will continue to play him. I think he is an extreemly playable character and I never have problems getting a group. Gameplay has not made me think that there is a problem. Verant in its various posts has made me think that there is a problem.:&lt;&lt;<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  I see the new monk weapons as having already severely damaged the monk class.  We are now a "have or have_not" class  If you have one of the new weapons, you are a monsterstompingmaniac, but if you don't you are only a shadow of what a "real" monk should be.  No other class that I know of is polarized so severely by rare and nearly unattainable items.  If they were QUEST items I would still grumble and groan about them.  If monk unarmed combat it improved, I would still grumble and groan about them.  Don't get me wrong - I am going to attempt to get a couple dragonstompinsticks, or maybe a megaboinkblastermasterkrunchinrod, but considering my limited play time, I don't know if that will ever be possible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>m3i3rD0rf :<P>  I did not miss that.  Did you notice the restrictions he placed on his testing?  The part that caught my eye was when he said that disciplines with the exception of Kick (warrior) and flying kick (monk) were disabled.  I've been trying to get clarification as to what exactly that means, but have not been able to find out.  I have to make my best guess.<P>Hmmm, what level is flying kick?  I wonder why the monk won the race...  The warrior was operating with lvl 1 skills at lvl 60 ability, the monk was operating at lvl 1 skills at lvl 60 ability EXCEPT flying kick.  The warrior was much more severely crippled by the restrictions placed upon him.  THAT is why I think the only real answer is a large All Server GM event SG killing contest like what I outlined under a different thread.  Real characters + real skills + experienced players + a real reward = real data.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You cant even begin to say if a warrior outdamages a monk because he used mighty strike while he was berserk in 1 fight that all of the sudden he does more in every fight or vice versa for a monk discipline.

In fact they might not even have enough people at that point.  Yes, aggregate data will tell you something.

</FONT><HR>I have one point of curiousity, which is: what weapons were used for the two classes?  Be interesting to see what was considered best  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. I also doubt they'd tell us which ranked where, or even what the five were, as it might effect people's perceived value of other items.<P>Agreed that all this high end gear is difficult to obtain.  However, where a monk might have to obtain one or two difficult items (2-hander or pair of items to dual-wield), the warrior types have a boatload of rare items to obtain... weapons, armor, etc.  <P>Yes, my primary is a warrior, but I've grouped with the same monk since we met at L13 in Oasis. He still outdamages me, albeit by less than he used to.  Amusingly, while he's L47 and I'm 49, he still has a higher AC (I've got 3 pieces of Indicolite, but not a full set) by a few points as well.  Yes, I have substantially more health pre-buffing. But when you add 1500 pts of buffs (cleric & shaman), the percent difference is much smaller.  <P>Why do I group with him? Simple, he's a great guy, and we've fought side by side, after the rest of the party died, surviving by the narrowest of margins. Yes, I analyze the combat data to death, and try to be as effective as possible, but I'm not going to toss friends aside over a percentage point or two  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Relax  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon,<P>As I posted in the original thread on the test, I really do appreciate you taking the time to investigate these claims. However, in light of what other high level monks are saying, I have a difficult time accepting this test as valid without seeing what weapons were used for comparison. In your initial post, you mention that the lowest level weapons you used were Short Swords of the Ykesha for the warrior and fists for the monk. Obviously, the monk will outdamage the warrior with this set up: even prior to Kunark, Yaks were not consdiered particularly good equipment for a warrior, and this was when the monk was still using 14/30 fists. <P>If the warrior is swinging a Worn Great Staff at level 60, I am pretty sure I will blow his damage out of the water using a fighting baton and my fist. The offensive concern of monks is that warriors will deal very nearly the same amount of damage as monks with the equipment available to "ordinary" level 60 characters. Without knowing what weapons you used to compare the monk and the warrior, I am sure that you can see how such a test would be difficult for us skeptics to accept, especially given the flawed baseline of level 60 fists vs. a Yak.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi<P>again, thank you for doing, and clarifing these tests.<P>now, would it be possible to make the monk weapons drop more often or *gasp* make them quest items?  the weapons we now need to fulfill our role are necessary to fill that role.  As neccessary as warrior armor and caster spells.  I see no reason why monk weapons should drop less often then warrior armor (cobalt..etc) and caster spells.<P>typically there are only a few (less than 5) tranquel staff's on each server. Most of thoes are either given to twinks, or sold on ebay.  I've heard of monks auctioning for them for over 100kpp!!  I dont think this is right.<P>if we do still fit our role as your tests proove, then great! Im happy.  But make it a bit less than impossible to fulfill that role please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Do you people not group with shamans, enchanters or clerics?  I group with monks and rogues plenty and they NEVER have to "back off."  Whatever happened to the ever-useful blanket of forgetfullness spell?  If your monks are getting pummelled so bad they have to feign for awhile, then something is wrong with your group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Argggg :<P>  Appreciate the support  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Seriously though most of us monks don't expect to be primary tanks, though there are times when we need to be.  While fighting in Fear and in Lguk, my lvl 49 monk does occasionally have to step up and be the one between the casters and the mobs - normally only when the big tough heavy armored person is on his last sliver of health and kneeling in the bandaging position while the party healers sit and cross their fingers hoping to get mana back to heal the tank before repop.  We monks aren't designed to do this for extended periods against masses of blue mobs or white/yellow/red mobs.  I don't want to be a warrior - they have their place in the big picture - I want my place back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>-------------------<BR>Dealing out more damage than the warrior doesn't mean that you'll beat the warrior in a duel, nor that the ratio of damage dealing to damage taking capability is constant. The benefit of extra damage has more weight than the disadvantage of being defensively inferior. <BR>--------------------<BR>Wrong. Their exactly the same.<BR>If a monk does the same damage in 1 minute that a warrior does in 1.25 minutes, but the monk dies after 30 seconds and the warrior dies after 1 minute, then the warrior not only out tanks the monk, but the warrior also outdamages the monk.<BR>This using your results from your test gordon.<P><BR>--------------------<BR>I'm sure that some would say, "If a warrior can solo creature X in two minutes and be almost dead at the end, then a monk should be able to do the same in a minute and end up almost dead". This would be an example of constant ratio between offense and defense and the two classes. This however isn't the case. If the ratio were constant as suggested, there would, again, be no reason to have the warrior, because the monk's other skills would make them preferable in all cases. <BR>----------------------<BR>Once again you show your lack of problematic math.<BR>A monk takes more mana to heal because if using Complete heal, the most mana effecient healing method. Then your using it twice as much mana on the monk as you are on the warrior. So for half the mana, you can fight twice as long, and do more damage in the end.<P>------------------------------<BR>Not to mention, there's an added benefit any time a creature is killed faster than normal, a benefit that can't be measured directly against the power of the class, but more against its usefulness to the group. Would a group, for instance, like to kill things in 2 minutes and end up OOM and near death at the end? Or would the rather do it in 1 minute and end up the same way? They'd want it done faster in all cases. That's what monks and rogues add as melee classes.<BR>-------------------------------<BR>Your not going to be oom unless you go with the faster kill gordon. A monk only does 25% more damage right? A warrior soaks lot more than 25% more, so basically, a warrior will outdamage the monk because the cleric will run OOM healing a monk more than 25% faster than he will healing a warrior.<P><BR>So in the end, warriors cause a party less down time, less medding, more xp, more fighting, and why?<BR>Because the damage in and damage out isn't balanced like gordon says it doesn't need to be.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon, <P>Thank you for posting these results and taking the time to do the test.  I am satisfied with your answer and although I am not a high level monk, I was curious as to the outcome.  I was wondering if you tested the monk's fists in the fight as well...I have seen some differing information as to how good a monk's fists are.  Were they considered one of the top 5 monk weapons, or not used at all?  Thanks.<P>-Gihl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004016&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004016&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
