If you are actually serious, I am shocked.<P>If you are serious:<P>I am just curious how it is possible for someone to actually go through life with that type of attitude.  As if the world should bow out before your own set of morals.  Do you live in a small rural area where your biggest problem in your life is whether you will have enough milk to eat along with your morning Wheaties?<P>Excuse me, but I come to these message boards for fun when I get slow here at work.  I mostly come to mock the 'crusaders' who think they are going to change the world one message board at a time.<P>As far as getting offended about ANYTHING said here, that speaks volumes about you and your petty, trivial issues that you have to deal with on a daily basis.  Sorry but I actually have more important stuff in my life to worry about than whether a complete stranger made a passing comment that offended me or not.  Geez...I would happily trade my problems for yours.<P>Well no...I would probably throw myself off of a roof in boredom.  gawd.<P>However, if you have been joking this whole time:<P>lol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love how witless people fail to make the connection that living in a society that condones censorship will be INFINITELY more harmful than hearing some immature little kids talk about "getting crack".<P>Typical.  Rather than taking responsibility for his/her child's upbringing (by, say, oh... hmmm... how about not letting your child play?), try to get the government-- er, VI, that is-- to censor anything you don't like.<P>So typical.  Hate to break it to you, champ, but the morality/immorality of drugs is actually HOTLY debated in society and culture at this time.  You do not, and CANNOT win a debate by refusing to let the "other side" have their say.  All you'll do is add legitimacy to the "other side" by your heavy-handed tactics.<P>Anti-troll-racism person (if this is you), why don't you quit EQ if it frightens and offends you so much?<P>I STILL think we should have an under-10-safe server where the only things appropriate to discuss are crayons and puppies, where everybody looks the same and talks the same, and where MOB's are subdued by lots of hugs and cuddles instead of clubs and cudgels.  Maybe THAT would make Noonga happy.  Disney-EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

What offends me is the use of circular reasoning and using the EULA wich in no way states the use of the term crack is innapropriate to prove her point.

</FONT><HR>Noonga,<BR>  I just read this thread...you initially posted at 12:40, my time.  The last post I saw from you was at 3:55, my time.  That's over 3 hours that you've intently followed this thread and people's responses to your opinion.  I'd say that this is a disservice to your employer, as I'm sure it isn't covered in your job description.  I'd be interested in hearing your response to the question of affording your employer the respect of providing the service you offered upon accepting the postion you hold.<P>It really bothers me to listen to people like you.  Not that I don't appreciate a vigorous debate, but you've allowed yourself to look foolish.  You've been payed for 3 hours of work that you've dedicated to posting on a gaming board.  You said you spend time with your daughter and we can ask your guild how often that you leave the PC to spend time with her.  I pity that child.  She has to drag daddy from the PC to get his attention.  What measuring stick do you use to determine the merit of your daughter's request that you spend time with her rather than spend time ingame?  Hypocracy is such an ugly thing.  I love the way you avoided the "violence" questions in order to maintain your argument.  None the less, I find your views petty and poorly thought out.  The unfortunate thing is that I genuinely believe that you've created this thread because it makes you feel good about yourself to see how many responses you can get (kinda like the folks that like to get FIRST POST on a new thread).  Oh well, if that's how you get your jollies, I guess I'm feeding your addiction.<P>A couple of sincere suggestions:<P>1) Dedicate the time you're at work to your job.<P>2) If you really care about the fate of the children of the world, cancel your EQ account and spend ALL your free time with your daughter.<P>We can't save the world by changing others...we can only act as rolemodels for what (we think) the world should be</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nemaj, If you knew of my work, you probably would not have made that issue, but that's ok.  I'll leave it at that.<P>And everyone wants to keep saying that I do not spend enough time with my daughter. hehe, I beg to differ with you.  I DO spend a ton of time, and no, she does not always have to go pull daddy away from the terminal.  I just reached level 50, and been playing, hhmm, 2 years now?  Most people can do that in what, 3, 6 months?<P>I'm done, and have directed a reply to eqmail on the original question I asked, since its obvious no one here would DARE answer other questions to them.  I'll be leaving from work shortly, will get home and spend time with my daughter, and have a nice dinner.  Maybe when she goes to bed I will play some EQ.  I doubt it, since I am really tired of dealing with children today though.<P>So, hope you all had a good laugh, glad people I know directly have higher morals and can have more mature discussions. (shrugs)<P>Have a nice night.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, let me try to answer your question maturely, being a responsible 46 year old I believe I may qualify.  First off, what was your question?  If it is and I quote "Verent do you have no stand?", and I believe this is in reference to the usage of the crack term in EQ.  Did you not state in your post that you directed this to a GM and their response was to ignore him/her.  Isn't it obvious to you that after 176 reply no one from EQ has deemed to answer you means that you were already given your answer "JUST IGNORE THEM" that is their stand on the matter.  The fact that you even posted this question on the board is a joke.  Then you become enraged when you are flamed.  You obviously spend some time cruising this site and most know any reference to censorship will get you flamed, so please drop the indignant attitude about being flamed when you so obviously were asking for it.  I truly hope this has helped you in figuring out what EQ's stand on this whole subject is.  Their silence should be answer enough.<P>Oh yeah, Isladar where u boarding at, kids just got from mile-high snows good there.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Well, to start, I think the term is about as far OOG (out of genre) as one can get. "Crack" when used in speach in EQ is simply put, the wanting of something addictive. Breeze/Clarity."<P>Im sorry, but I cant beleive anyone could have much of a problem with it.  No body, unless mentally challenged, is not going to do crack because thats what their favourite spell in eq is called.  I see how it is sorta OOG like you said, and crack is not related to EQ, but then again, wasnt the game meant for role-playing, and how common is that?  <P>"Lets define "Crack" in todays world since it is not an RPG term: (No dictionary, so going to wing it) Crack is a drug that is illegal in the US. Crack has killed many many people, just for its use and distribution. Crack is often sold to kids for use or distribution. Crack is plain and simple, "bad"."<P>Crack can have many different meanings.  The drug is one of them.  You could also refer to it as an addictive substance, which is what crack is.  Yes, it has killed many, but alcohol has killed a lot more then crack, and you dont seem to have a problem with beer in the game, which honestly serves very little purpose and the game would be no different with out it.  <P>"Verent says to use /report when someone tries to get around the language filter, but won't take a stand when someone proudly uses the term "crack", in a sense of "Hey, I'm cool! I use Crack!"<P>It is very possible to get around the language filter.  I see swears all the time in the game, it doesnt bother me.  Most people say something like "Anyone want crack?" or something like that, ive never seen soemone say "Hey, I'm cool! I use Crack!".  And unless you are completly new to the game, you know crack is for breeze or clarity.  <P>"Well Verent, are you saying you want kids to use the term freely in that sense? I don't know of any of my guild that uses the term, because, we are all adults. (21 or over)."<P>Thats weird...my guild is about 90% 20-30 year old people, and almost every enchanter in the guild uses that term.  People are different.  Verent is not trying to tell kids that Crack is cool.  I dont know where you got this from.  Verant probaly never even considered Crack being mentioned at all in the game.  <P>"Everytime I do a /tell to someone to please not use the term crack, I get some childish answer, something like "FU". So, who is being "cool" by using the term? Actual real life addicts or younger ages who think using the term "Crack" is cool? What is their next step?"<P>I think the reason you get people saying that is because youre probaly one of the very few people who has a problem with the term.  If they do say FU, then just report them and get it taken care of.  <P>"I think you need to do something about this Verent. You say you have 300,000 subscribers (plus) that play your game. What happens if one, just ONE person decides to really see what "crack" really is and something happens."<P>LOL, im sorry, but this is insane.  Out of the 300,000 people, who doesnt know what crack is.  With the drug education schools give, television, movies any kid over 12 or 13 knows what crack is.  They know its bad, and most drug dealers are pretty secrective.  Its not like you can go to a gas station and get a bag of crack.  And anyways, any kid under 12 isnt going to find someone who sells crack, isnt going to have the money without stealing, and may have no idea its really a drug.  A lot of young kids accept things if they dont understand them.  Im sure a lot of people may not know what NPC stands for, but doesnt go around asking people in RL for a NPC.  <P>"Though I doubt much legal actions could be taken, let me ask you the one question I think needs to be asked...."<P>Youre right, there isnt.  <P>""How would you morally feel?""<P>It wouldnt bother me at all if I created EQ.  Have you ever played a game other then EQ?, they are a lot worse.  Go play a game like Half-Life or any game like that.  The number of people under 20 playing it is much, much higher.  There are much more swears, refrences to drugs, etc...I feel EQ isnt a bad place for anyone to be, its safer then most places on the net.<P>"There is a time and place for everything. An online game that kids play, is not the place for a company to say "It's ok if people yell for crack.""<P>But its ok to go around killing for profit.  Its ok to duel to the death when you get in an argument.  Its ok for half nude(wood elfs, dark elves, even barbarians or a lot of human monk skins) to be running around all over the place.  Its ok to call someoen else(gm) to end disputes for you rather then learning how to end them yourself.  <P>"I know as a parent, that if my daughter ever was playing a game, and I saw people asking for crack, I would have NO regret pulling the plug, and any future funds I have, away from that company, and would do my damdest to make sure other folks are aware that company promotes (Hey, you won't stop it you said) that kind of actions."<P>Oh...How old is your daughter.  I bet you if shes over 12 or 13 she knows what crack and drugs are.  If shes 14-16, she already has friends using crack and other drugs.  If shes under 10, yes, I can see you being worried.  But if shes under 10, can she enjoy the game that much anyway without getting overwelmed?  Honestly, it is a pretty complex game.  And in my opinion, if someone is going to do drugs, they are going to do it even if they see the term Crack in EQ.  <P>Dont get me wrong, I am against drugs.  I have never done them, and never will.  I was taught at an early age(about 5) the effects of drugs on you, and I have always stayed away from them.  Whether you beleive this or not, when I was 11 a few of my friends took up smoking(tabacco).  When I was 12-13 1/3-1/2 of my friends smoked reguarly.  They got it from friends, older brothers.  Some of my friends rolled theyre own cigerettes.  They probaly wouldve done drugs, but where I lived was more of a small town with about 1500-2000 people living there.  People didnt make all that much, and drugs werent widely available.  And even with that I never gave into it, even after being offered dozens of times.<P>Maybe at a very young age this may make you think crack is cool.  But at this age you ask your parents EVERYTHING, you would ask them what crack is, and at that point they would take EQ away from you anyway.  If youre 11 or 12, youre smarter, you wont do drugs because of a slang term in EQ.  And refrences to drugs are all over the place, tv, movies, music, history, friends, school, the news/media etc....<P>Dont worry about it, if you would rather your kids not play eq because of this, dont let them, but it gets a lot worse then this.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Never used the term crack in-game, and frankly I think it's moronic. <P>But, I'm confused as to what you think to accomplish here. Crack has been adopted by the EQ population as a slang term for clarity/breeze. Verant never (that I know of, although I don't follow their policies that closely) condoned its use; EQ is so much more than a rpg, it is also a huge chat-room, and people are going to make up their own lingo to talk to each other. It really isn't Verant's place to censor something as harmless as calling a spell "crack". How would you even expect them to enforce this? Start giving warnings out to anyone who auctions crack? Do you REALLY not see how: 1. this would be a huge headache to enforce; and 2. outrage a huge portion of their player base?<P>Crack is not a racist term, it is not a hate-mongering term. Personally I hope if a 13-year old sees the term in-game, they WILL ask somebody what crack is. Because, if at that age, nobody has taught them the dangers of drugs yet, it is past time that they learn.<P>This was civil enough that I hope you finally see why every poster on this thread thinks you are wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/rant on<P>This post disgusts and annoys me to no end.  I can feel the rage boiling inside of me.  Im just so sick of the PC crap.<P>EQ is a fantasy based RP (well sorta) game.  If children cannot differentiate between RL and in game, then the blame lies SOLEY with the parents.  It is their responsibility to tell them that this is just a game, and not real life, that they may see or hear things that you should not do in real life, I mean on its common frikin sense!  It is their responsibility to tell their children that drugs are bad, and not to do them.  <P>My parents talked to me about drugs and the harm they can cause on NUMEROUS occasions.  Sure all kids kind of blow off parents, but guess what?  The things you tell us sink it, its learning through repitition.  Sit with your kids, talk to them it sinks in trust me.  <P>Also, why should all the players of EQ have to change the way that they speak or play a game becuase there are lazy parents out there?  Thats just not fair.  Ill stress it again TALK to your kids, sit and talk with them, they may say, yeah mom and dad I know and seem annoyed, but that stuff sticks with them.  <P>Someone (forget who) said it best on page 2 when they stated:<P>&gt;&gt;"should we childproof the whole world so parents don't have to parent anymore? *sigh*"&lt;&lt;<P>/rant off<P>-Skabahz<BR>-Pissed off Warrior on Warrior CRACK (alacrity)<BR>-Hater of PC, Protector of the People of Norrath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I didnt read through every last post in thsi thread, as there are wuite a few, but I wanted to post my opinion as well.<P>Crack.  If there is a child who hears the word Crack, used the way that it is used in this game, and cannot associate it with a drug that they learned about by simply walking around, reading, watching movies and TV, or listening to family members, then that child has lived in a bubble and would not be allowed to play EQ in the first place.<P>Seems like logic to me.<P>Did you like that song everybody must get stoned?  You probablly did.  Do you ever jokingly state "Man, he looks stoned" and not actually know?  I'm sure you may have made this reference to someone before.<P>What I am getting at is that Crack, just like Pot, is a common word used by americans and the rest of the world.  (Well, majority at least)  Not only this, but as stated by quite a few others, this game has WAY more offensive things in it than crack.  <BR>#1 - You kill people/things throughout this entire game.  Is this better than the word Crack?  This should be enough for you to realize that the word crack is nothing.<BR>#2 - You steal things from other mobs, usually by murdering them first.  I dont know about you, but this sounds pretty bad.<BR>And to top it all off, most everything is PRE MEDITATED.  Scary.<P>So really, think about it, how is saying gimme crack worse than saying "LETS KILL THAT GUY!"<P>Have a nice day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What I do know is that there is absolutely nothing "jocular" about this term to those that have witnessed a loved-ones downward spirel of drug addiction.

</FONT><HR>Edgar9, I am sure there are very few terms that wouldn't remind someone, somewhere of a loved one's misfortune. However, crack is an everyday term (in RL), and has been adopted as slang in a virtual world. Now, somebody getting a breeze/clarity and attempting to simulate a crack cocaine od in-game would enter into the realm of what you're talking about. But simply calling a spell crack? I see that as big-time over-sensitivity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Edgar9, applying a blanket statement like that is a dangerous road to wander down. I've already stated that I don't use the term crack beacause I think it's stupid, but I also don't get offended by it. I never assume anything about anybody in RL because of what I see on a message board, or in a game. Many people don't see using the term crack as being offensive; they use it because it is widespread, largely-used slang in the world of EQ. So even though I don't like its use, I don't automatically assume that somebody has never lived in the real world because they use the term. That type of prejudice gets me a whole lot more riled up than a mildly (VERY mild, judging by people's attitudes in this thread) offensive term.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
