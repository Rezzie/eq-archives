</FONT><HR>Oceanus_FOH,<P>    Hmm... Diagnosing sympoms...  Hmmm.... You have a case of Anal Rententivness... :P<P>    Hey, If Verant decides that all tall races have to walk on all four cause the Little races feel inferior... it's their right... They are the DM... they Rule... It's their Game.<P>    If Verant decides Water is Red, and the Sky is Yellow... Hey, it's their game... We have to abide by it...<P>     hehe... Oceanus_FOH, I love EQ and Think verant had done a great game...  But you need to loosen up a bit and stop walking with Blinders on.  Life isn't just what people tell you it is.  And Verant stretches the rule every day... but some GM's out of the blue picks on people when they feel like it to bring them back.  If Verant was the DM, and had an issue with names... well, they should go in their DB... and cross every name in there...  I mean, if you want to be fair..<P>    A DM has up to a dozen players... sometimes more.  EQ had thousands per servers...  Names get duplicated with Double "l", "n" or other letters...  It's getting ridiculous and some names make totally no sense.  It is coming to the point where some "CompoundName" make more sense than the one that are suposed to be "Legal".<P>    Look man, if you got stock in Verant or Sony Entertainment...  Go ahead...  But open your eyes a bit.  Yes it's Verant's game... But we need to OPEN THEIR Eyes to a problem here... There are too many people per servers... they need to become more lenient.  Yes some names need to be changed.  But A lot of them need to be left alone.<P>    WE Can live without Verant and EQ...  But Verant & EQ can't live without it's customer base.  And the funny thing is...  Verant has a whole is not as Hard as you portray it...  you make it sound like they are Unforgiving...  The problem we're having is with some GM's... not the company as a whole...   And if some of you think a name is stupid...  Well... Don't interact with them...  Personally I think that the 4 last letter of your name Oceanus, is vulgar...  And if I saw it in game...  I would have to petition it, and tell a GM why... and maybe make up something about you just cause I don't like you're name...  Would that be fair ?  Would you like to find out you're name is changed to Ocenos... cause Ocean is a word, and the last 4 letters were vulgar...  And have a GM tell you you, well... that's how it goes...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok..this thread caught my attention because of the name involved. Managirl. <P>I have been in LIO for a while now and a couple nights ago, while FD waiting for a couple mobs to put away their forks and walk away, I caught an /ooc conversation going on.<P>Someone made the /ooc comment about seeking Crack.<P>Managirl /ooc "What is Crack?" <P>Soandso /ooc "With a name like Managirl, you don't know what Crack is?"<P>Well, some people laughed and called her stupid and whatnot. Couple mobs left and I was back to fighting and lost the rest of the conversation. My guess, from what I caught the following night, is more comments were made about her name (which doesn't bother me)<P>The following night, I was sitting by zone trying to help a friend out w/ his corpse. Caught an /ooc about "where is Managirl" and comments to that extent.  Someone replied /ooc that aww, too bad..they must have changed her name LOL. My guess is that someone from the previous night got upset at her for whatever petty reason (she didn't aknowledge the term crack -so?-she didn't clarity someone..I don't know) Whatever, and that is what drew the attention of the guide. I do know that there were quite a few immature (don't mean RL age) groups there that thought it hysterical to train the pullers in the gob mines and fort. So if her group got on the wrong side of one of them, they could have picked her name out as revenge.<P>Me personally? I don't care what your name is as long as it is not offensive. Your name could be Garren or Rosegarden. As long as you fight good. And if it is offensive? I won't petition, just not acknowledge you...why? GM/guide's are too busy with real problems to have to look at names.<P>And About her crying...for those of you who tell her to get a grip, get medicated..whatever....how do you personally know that she wasn't having a bad day? Her day could have really stunk and all she was looking forward to was relaxing. The curt attitude the Drinal GMs have + her name being changed could have been the last straw for her that day.<P>To Managirl, whatever your name is shredded to now: Look me up sometime if you decide to stay in Norrath.<P>Xiri Sleekscale<BR>26th monk of Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hrmmm...I ran into the same GM in the same place as ManaGirl did. My mistake for not having spent the 22 weeks that it would take to read every policy in the game. Fact is...the GM was curt and rude about the entire incident, did not wait for me to think of a new name...and did all this while I was trying desperately not to get killed. Luckily I was able to kill the MOB with the help of several others in the group when they realized what was happening as my name in the group had suddenly changed. I tried to politely ask why I needed to change my name from 'Iamabrat' (as I said previously I had not read the naming policy). Instead of an explanation I got a response of "change it now" blah blah blah...<P>Point being...do you think it's better business practice for a GM to issue the warning with a brief explanation and be a little compassionate in the game when dealing with a name change that is obviously NOT offensive...or you think it should be common practice to be a total jerkoff over the whole thing by changing the persons name before you even issue the warning and then being a complete ass by being rude to the player instead of explaining the policy?<P>I've run into a few other GM's in the game that were very polite...extremely helpful...and pleasant to chat with. This GM was an arrogant...mean...rude...power hungry...blowhard that most likely got off on the fact that he/she could push people around.<P>As a former GM for a massive multiplayer online flightsim...I found his/her behaviour to be out of line and petitioned him/her myself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus_FOH, bear with me.... I can't Type today...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>"Symptom"...  And sorry... Where I come from "Anus" is not exactly a clean word.  And yes... I could debate it, and bring it on to Verant...  And what if it wins it cause... Wouldn't you feel cheated ?<P>You need to stop thinking you're in the right... Cause if you read some post, some names "Choosen" by EQ Pressing the button were changed by GM's...  Don't you think that's funny ?  Why ?  Cause someone might take offence.  That's all it took.<P>So If I take offence to your name, and say that where I come from it is very vulgar... and come up with a story...  I might get lucky and win my cause, and you get struck with the Name Change stick.  Well, you know you didn't do anything wrong... but it happens.  you've got 2 words in there Ocean and Anus, but they are mingled together...  It's just a point of view, if you think about it.<P>Verant needs to talk to their GM's and loosen this up.  There are way too many people in this game to come up with names that are not similar or totally Idiotic... and I'm sure you can't disagree with that.<P>I saw these names on my server<P>Raistlain<BR>Raistlin<BR>Raistliin<P>  I bet there are more versions of it I didn't see.  This is one of the main Character of the Dragon Lance Saga (Main character of the 2nd Trilogy).  Not only is his name in the game, but you have different versions of it...  Should all of them be changed ?<P>   The problem with policing things in a game with this many players... you can't go off chosing you're vitims...  You either go across the board, or you leave people alone.  The Rules are for all 300k + accounts.  Not only for those the GM's decide to pick on.  If they WANT to apply it, then they need to go at it with EVERYONE... if they don't want to go that route, then they need to tone down the rules a bit.<P>   I personally thought "Soulsavor" and "YourFriend" were cool names and possible names in Roleplaying.  Just happens that I'm deleting my Warrior, and replacing my Cleric.  So I won't have to sweat it in the future in case they target me...  Sad that I have to fear that...  Yes, I should have read the policies.. and as many playing this game.. I didn't.   there shouldn't be any policies regarding names other than those that are Vulgar, or have titles.  But Hey...  Who am I anyway...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

One day I logged on and the One was missing. who,what,where when, how it happened is beyond me. I cant even use the /surname command. I petitiond 4 times, 3 GMs couldnt see a problem with the name I have chosen. 1 a guide simply said it was against the nameing policy. I asked for an explanation and was told, "Any further tells would result in the suspension of you account." <P>I reported his reply and name to customer service as well as the head GM. The head GM gave me my name back but now its gone again.<P>Frankly this game is grating on my last nerve. Its not because of game play issues, its because of policy issues.<P>Every one of my friends have had a run in with the name gistopo. Zaphid Battlemage (GM given) is the only one among us that has a last name.

</FONT><HR>You only have to read through this thread to see that there are a good number of selfish little jackasses playing this game. Immature boys that have yet to grow into the concept of compassion.<P>The name may or may not have violated naming policy.  It is not as obvious as some have said - It is not MORE than 2 words - it is not a phrase (like Ontop is).<P>It all comes down to the major inconsistencies that exist within the guide program.  Sometimes you get guides that are great - they know what they are doing and they understand the rules, sometimes you get some idiot that doesn't know the rules and has an attitude about it.<P>The only arguemtn Verant has is that they have to be heavy handed to encourage others not to try to find a loophole - though with the sheer number of anti-naming policy names, it obvioulsy doesn't work.<P>So the naming policy will continue to be a weapon of the grief players - but Verant's guides don't really know how to deal with grief players anyway - so no big surprise there.<BR>-tera</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus_FOH, ignorance is thinking a word is only Vulgar or not in the US.  Ignorance is thinking that where you were raised, and what you heard all your life is golden and there is not other ways....<P>Ignorance is also to think you're in the right until someone proves you wrong.  "Mana" and "Girl" are 2 words if you want to play with the term.  We can all play with words, that's the easy part...  But "Fairness" in EQ has always been distorted.  There are 2 other threads on name being changed which were choosen by EQ's name button.  How can we explain that ?<P>What many people are saying here is the Rule is to strict, and needs some leeway.<P>You're the perfect example of the one that says "Well, I've done everything right...   Didn't offend any rules...  Ok, looks fine too me...  Hey!  You Screwed up, you loser..."  But the moment anything happens to you, you'll be so far up Verant's @ss you won't be able to see... and you'll be B*tching like hell... and it makes me laugh... cause people like you... are large in numbers.<P>Doesn't make sense to debate this with you Oceanus_FOH...  You think you're so righteous... that nothing else really matters.  There are now thousands of people on each servers playing, the space for imagination has been totally narrowed down quite a bit to really stupid looking name.  I pressed the button last weekend, and 10 names in a row were already taken.. What's the point in using that Button ?<P>The main issue is not about the "Rule" being violated, but the "Rule" being nocked down a bit... some of these compound names shouldn't be changed, and should be accepted...  So stop talking about Rule violation, when some people here keep talking about the Rule being too restrictive.  Everyone has an opinion, stop nocking everyone elses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus...  <P>What can I say...  You can use a Dictionary, and you've perfected your art in insults.<P>Read how this all started.  Instead of having any compassion what-so-ever to the person being hurt, you go to the "The Rules" defense for Verant.  You don't care, and showed that very clearly.<P>We both got into a debate against each other, which didn't really go anywhere.  Yes this is a Roleplaying game, and some names are valid as Role playing game goes... You started the insults by putting it down saying the "Roleplaying Defense".  Yes you do think you're right.. and you're being very full of yourself, and I'm happy someone else saw it too.  Hypocryte ?  Why, cause I defended myself ?  What did I put down of your opinions ?  Other than you keep stating the rule...<P>Oceanus, Anus is considered Vulgar in many places... Play with words all you want, contradicting this fact makes you look more ignorant than I... Why continue pushing it...  Seems from the Education you proved in this discussion, you should have known when to let go of a touchy subject... hehe  Did you read the discussion of the guy that got their account suspended(or banned, don't remember) for shouting "Penis" crossing OOT.  Well, go in the dictionary boy... give me the definition.. Common boy.. Cause there is nothing wrong with a part of the body... or is there ?<P>Well... thanks for the laugh Oceanus.  you've been fighting a fact that "Anus" was not vulgar... when in fact it is... hehe  And many would tell you so, if they live in an area where it  is.  It's not all about where you live, it's about how others percieves a word...  You're right... continue thinking "Anus" is not Vulgar, and that you're not Ignorant yourself in thinking that...  hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus...<P>hehe..  <P>You now have the Greeks after you...<P>And like he said, there are tons of interpretations... and everything can be taken out of context.  Nothing absurb about it.  YOU just don't get it.<P>Vulgar VS Inapropriate...  Hmm...  Common, stop all the Mumbo Jumbo... You keep playing with words, thinking you'll get someone dizzy enough to fall off their Chair...  Ain't happening, I strapped myself in!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Something that is Inapropriate can be Vulgar to some and just uncomfortable to others.  I'm half French/Italien...  I was used to saying "Merde" a lot in French... which is no big deal... After I came in the state, I just started to used "****"... Well, I'll tell you something.  I got the looks, the Shock and all you can think about... hehe  I couldn't understand it, then.  Well, what was not offensive to me in Canada...  Well, in English... it was where I was in the US.  Now, I bet I could go in some places where people have the "****" in every sentence they say... and it's just common talk.  It's a matter of who you are around... So again... Playing with words has not changed how people will react to it... but Hey... good try.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>JCC, you are trying to argue RP'ing with someone who has no idea what it is. To RP you need to be able to step outside yourself, and that is something most people are to scared to do. Including quite a few in this thread. A fear of a loss of self I suppose. More a basic insecurity. The same thing that makes people attack spelling and grammar instead of the ideas.<P>Pretty sad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
