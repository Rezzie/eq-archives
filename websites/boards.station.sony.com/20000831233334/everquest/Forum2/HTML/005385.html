</FONT><HR><BR>To make this invitation relevant to our friend Gordon, I believe we need to put a very important item for his class onto a spawn such as our beloved glacier bear, grizleknot, etc.<P>So how about we relocate the necro 49th pet spell on his server to...  Bilge!  Make it drop on one out of 4 bilges - so it's not too hard to "encounter it without camping".<P>After all, a necro can operate just fine without his 49th level pet.  Makes life a lot less fun for him, but he's still got some Dots and darkness and all.  Why camp one silly spell.<P>You up for it Gordon?  Ready to give up an item that actually affects the performance of your chosen class in the name of "I don't camp"?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmm... do you really believe that a cleric or a shaman can not function without its class specific breastplate or helm?<P>From what I see, most often players will even favor something such as a bloodstained tunic over their all important havtacamp bp.  <P>I am a paladin, and have got my molds for both my helm and boots purely by coincidence, we happened upon the named SG in north ro, and I ran into a undead cyclops in south karana, and got one of my skulls, and a friend of mine also had a skull taking up space in his bank which he gave to me.  did I spend hours camping these items? no. Hassim isn't the most common guy to run into, yet I suppose I was lucky, and as abashi said if I happen across anything rare, it's that much better.  I dont plan on camping netmasters or sharks, although I will visit there area once in a while to see if they are around and if so, ill try my luck.  If I don't get my full ro set, well there are so many alternatives it's sick.  And in the time you spent camping these items you could be adventuring and making much better experience.  <P>I specialize in 2 handed slashing, but also use 1 hand when fighting a caster, I'm level 35, guess what I use for a slashing weapon... No its not a ghoulbane, i use bladed thulian claws.<P>Yeah Ill go to MM to see if the cooks are up, kill them if they are, the continue on my merry way, maybe slaughtering some vile minions of Mayong along the way, but I don't plan on sitting in the same spot for 45 minutes just for another chance to possibly see them not drop a cauldron so I can wait another 45 minutes... as this isn't my nor many other peoples definition of fun<P>now a challenge... please tell me one thing that will cripple you if you do not have (or at least reduce your effectiveness incredibly as would be the case with the 49 necro pet) that can only be found on a single rare spawn monster.  Im drawing a blank.. it certainly isnt the +8 sta breastplate, and there are plenty alternatives for the +5 wis on the helm. If it bores you, please give up the camp, have some fun, and you will get to the point where you don't really care about it, and plus you wont look like a clone of every other blue bard, gold cleric, tan shaman or crafted warrior out there.<P>&lt;/rant&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I posted on the "I love this game" thread also. But it's posts like this from Abashi that really tick me off.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt; I'm sorry Microbe, but I don't camp. I prefer to play the game, have fun, and if I happen across anything rare, it's that much better. I think that if I were to go out specifically looking for something rare, I'd be setting myself up for disappointment.    -Gordon &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>The PLAYERS didn't design camping into the game. Camping is required because you must keep killing the same thing in hopes that the rare "spawn" appears and gives you what you need for the item that VERANT designed. Camping the "spawn" is part of the game, so it is intrinsically "playing the game". The fun part is in question. As an SK that suffered through the Darkforge Armor crap, I know a little about camping.<P>And that disappointment stuff? So you are saying that anytime we try to complete one of many quests designed by VERANT, we are going to be dissapointed? That says a little about your playing style, but also alot about the design of the game.<P>I still don't understand why it isn't embraced by Verant and considered part of the game, because it really is. It provides purpose and goals. Without purpose and goals, it becomes meaningless and droll. And SOMEONE has to camp for items, otherwise how will they be obtained?<P>And again, if you are speaking from a professional standpoint, your answers should be from a customer service viewpoint. That was not a customer service answer. I can accept a personal viewpoint, but it would be nice to be able to seperate the two. Sometimes I get confused.<P>This is indeed a great game though.

</FONT><HR>Caeeldor-Rodcet<P>I applaud your last sentence.  The game produces too many clones.<P>I suppose every game inthe end produces clones, everybody wants "the best."  But EQ does it so badly it's sick.  You can look at a person in dark blue and know they're a bard.  You can look at a person in light blue and know they're a warrior.  You can see a person in tan/brown and know it's a shaman.  You can see a person in black and know it's a rogue.  You can see a person in green and know it's a ranger.  The list goes on and on.<P>What Verant needs to do is clone items with just different graphics.  Exact same item, different look.  Drop off the same monsters too!  Say creature X has a 25% chance to drop a breastplate.  Clone the breastplate, and give creature X a 25% chance to drop either one, which makes for the same drop rate, but different items.<P>*shrug*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>A mid-level shaman can indeed function just fine without a totemic helm and breastplate.  But he will have less wisdom and AC than his peers, and those two things do affect his performance.  He'll also look silly without having a decent plate-style item to put on his head.<P>One can equally argue that Gordon's 50-ish necro can function just fine without that 49th pet spell.  He can use fear, dots, darkness, lifetaps, and his 44th pet just fine.  The 49th pet can be properly spun as a "convenience" since it's not really required to be a necro.<P>So it boils down to the question:  How critical to a class does an item need to be before it's unreasonable to put it on a "camp or you'll never see one" mob.<P>Exactly how often is ANYONE going to chance upon the glacier bear which lives in an underwater cave with no other mobs of similar level to hunt, and a  wandering level 50+ necro mob in there to "keep life interesting".  Just how often is a questing shaman or cleric going to just find a glacier bear by chance?<P>Camping has been designed into the quests.  Gordon claiming that he "won't camp" means that he acknowledges that these quests are broken since they cannot reasonably be completed without weeks long camping sessions.<P>If camping is "wrong", then why are many major quests designed such that completing them _requires_ camping mobs which would never be encountered randomly in 1000 lifetimes because they don't exist in places where the appropriate level players would ever be, and their place holders (ice bone skels in this example) would never be hunted by players of appropriate level to do the quest.  It requires specifically going to an otherwise worthless location (underwater cave) that poses significant danger (wandering Miragul), killing things which give no exp (placeholder skels), and then standing around for _days_ with nothing to do waiting for a specific mob to spawn so you can kill it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aye, I agree. What cleric would wander on it the way Abashi suggests? To even get to the cave you need to be prepared with Enduring Breath, which is a spell clerics don't have (you'd have to buy a potion or just happen to be wandering around aimlessly with someone of a class that can cast it). Then you have to totally ignore what would normally be a cue to GET OUT NOW! when you see the wandering lich that is KoS to everybody.<P>We've been through this before. The original set of cleric quests were absurd (one piece actually was on Bilge) and after the weight of evidence was unmistakable only then were they changed in a way that makes them doable. This quest seems to have fallen through the cracks during that revision, and should be addressed in the same manner. Take a count of how many of this item are out there compared to the rest of the set.<P>What sequence of events, I wonder, does Abashi have in mind that would reasonably represent a way to complete the quest? Remember the start point is an NPC in the Temple of Solusek Ro telling you to find this cave and kill the glacier bear.<P>Don't even put in the quest if all it's going to be is a wild goose chase. Whatever happened to risk/reward?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It gives you a clue on when the PHer or bear will be up, it was 7:30am EST on my server. I bound myself there and headed off to a relatively safe area to hunt. Everyday I gated back about 7am and when the higher levels where finished I started looking for myself. Make one round and kill the PHers and leave. That way even if the bear spawned 8 hours later the person who got it wouldn't be back. I repeated this for a couple of weeks and when I hit 34 there he was. A scourge, an affliction, two poison dots and a couple of roots with a tagar's and he was dead.<P>Getting the stupid ogre skin chamois was a bigger aggrevation to me.<P>Only thing I ever camped was the testament just to be camping it.

I killed it, but there did not find the item you told me to look for on it.  What did I do wrong oh great and wise one?"<P>"Oh - silly young one, you must repeatedly kill the many incarnations of this unique bear until you find the magic one which happens to have the item"<P>"But I have never seen any but this one bear, and others tell me I was wildly fortunate the first time will likely never look upon one again even if I visit the cave each time I happen to pass by the zone of EverFrost - how can I kill so many of these strangely cloned bears to find the item you want"<P>"Ah - tis a simple thing.  Form up you and your team of adventurers (since the gods have deemed that fighting alone is to be discouraged at all cost), and go to the cave.  Kill the petty creatures there repeatedly each 8 real-life hours, and watch for the bear to appear.  Alas, this will involve many days of sitting and doing absolutely nothing since the caves are lifeless (except for that one wandering liche).  You will likely find that a bear will appear approximately once each game-time week, and after only a few months of (ahem) camping in the cave you will have your item."<P>"But Gordon told me camping was bad, and that quests should be done by randomly encountering the required items"<P>"Gordon does not know what he is talking about in this case - I am the quest giver and to satisfy me you must camp"<P>Go ahead Verant:  It's your quest design.

</FONT><HR>I think the problem is that most PCs and Abashi have totally different viewpoints on camping.  He has the fortune of playing since the creation of the game and does it for a living (sort of.)  In a  year and odd months you could stumble upon 70 hour spawns.  Most of us can't, we just dont have the time to go on when the servers are uncrowded.  It bothers us a heck of a lot more when we die and lose xp.

The whole camp issue makes me want to yank my teeth out with pliers, if only so I'll stop grinding them.<P>This game WAS designed around camping.

You will NEVER, I repeat, NEVER get Abashi to say anything other than "EQ is not a camping game." There are two ways the game is viewed: The Vision Way, and The Realists' Way.<P>The problem is that Verant's left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, I think. Game designers designed a game around camping, but then somewhere along the line, someone in VI decided that they were going to promo the game as a non-camp game. That's THE PARTY LINE, and anyone who disagrees with it is therefore verboten. <P>Unfortunately, about 85-90% of the gaming populace realizes that what Verant SAYS and what reality is are often two different things.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I'll throw my comments in on this thread too.  I know (in game) 2 people who have seen the bear.  I have been playing for over a year, so I have met and talked to many people.  Obviously I have met and talked to a good number of shamans, I don't always ask them about their helms.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I have never seen the bear.  Nearly every time I go to Qeynos, I will pop up to Everfrost, look around in the cave, kill any and all skeletons and then leave.  Having an 8 hour spawn with placeholders in an out of the way spot is really pointless.  If a placeholder is up, you won't see the creature.  If you don't read all the groups or sites, you may not know to kill the placeholder.  Stumbling across the bear at random is extremely unlikely.  I've never done it in several months of looking.  <P>Zahal is bad enough with a really long spawn time.  I have only seen him one time, and thankfully he had the troll guts on him when I killed him.  I was hanging around the N Karana zone for about 3 hours when he popped.  I was there for that specific reason.  If I had just run through (doing a complete circle/search of the area) as I usually do, I wouldn't have seen him at all.  A rare spawn with a slightly randomized timer (make it 6-10 hour spawn time rather than a set 8 ) and no placeholders makes more sense than the current setup for the bear.  <P>And to add support to the person who commented on the rarity of the item.  Look at the prices for people who are selling totemic pieces, it usually varies from a couple hundred (for the bracers) to several hundred (arms, legs etc.).  The exception to this is the helm, which I have been told goes for around 5000pp.  For a mid level quest item, this is absurd.  That is 5 times the usual cost of most of the quest BPs.  <P>I'm also curious how Abashi plays without camping... the current setup in the game doesn't really seem to support this, or expect it.  In most places that I hunt it seems to be 'kill some stuff', 'recover from killing (heal and med)', 'oh look, more stuff where the last stuff was so.... I kill that', and recover, and repeat.  When I get bored, I move to a different place that doesn't have people (or a different zone) and do the same thing again.  Moving around within a zone killing things at random is more likely than not going to really annoy the other people who are doing what I listed above (in different spots).  If you are pulling to a safe spot, and not camping and one specific creature for loot, you are still camping, it is just an area and that you are camping rather than a spawn or loot.  Assuming that the zone is relatively unpopulated, and you want to do the nomadic killing spree, the stuff behind you will likely pop before you get to the 3rd or 4th set of new things that you kill.  This brings in the problem of wanderers attacking while you are engaged with other mobs, or attacking while you are resting.  This really would only work in a dungeon where there is a set path that you can take to get to the end and get out, assuming no side rooms (or paths) were taken, otherwise you'd have to double up on the killing that you have done (to clear at least some of the stuff you killed before so that you can get back on the main path).  It also assumes that there aren't groups ahead of you either successfully killing the mobs, or training them back to you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Or is there some secret that I have yet to learn since I haven't gotten to a high enough level?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>May I point out to you non-camping advocates: the glacier bear is in Miragul's lonely cavern complex. Did I mention that Miragul is in there? What the DEVIL would anyone be prancing around in there for other than looking for Glacier Bear? You don't run to Everfrost and swim under the frozen river to the caverns, then ponce about in Miragul's house in passing, on your way to Lake Rathe.<P>Don't compare this to "finding" the Undead Cyclops in South Karana. It's *nothing* like that at all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am proud to say that I have never camped anything in my 26th level Druid's existence except for his Testament of Vanear.  (Shocker).<P>However, I have totally subpar equipment except for that which some higher-level friends of mine procured for me after seeing me STILL IN STRAIGHT LEATHER AT 23rd LEVEL.<P>I'd also like to note that because of my subpar equipment and my "no-camp-em" play style (which I enjoy), I have gone from level 17 to level 26, in the same time that my friends have gone from 1 to 30, 22 to 50, and 11 to 36 respectively.<P>Not camping items = subpar equipment = more deaths.<P>Not camping XP = not leveling.<P>More deaths + not leveling = Getting NOWHERE in the game.  And I'm sorry, but social interation ceases to be enough reason to play the game when everyone you'd like to be social with is busy organizing raids into Guk and you're stuck roaming the Karanas hoping to find some decent blue mobs to solo.<P>Oh, yeah, and in case you were wondering: if you've ever spent any time at all in Unrest, Mistmoore, Runnyeye, or any other mid-level dungeon in the Old World, you have camped.  Perhaps in a group of six and perhaps only for XP, but you CANNOT "do" Mistmoore, Unrest, or Runnyeye.  Or Splitpaw, or Befallen, or...or...or...<P>The dungeons are built wrong for it.  If you can take the opening spawns for XP, then you can't go into the dungeon.  If you can take the middle spawns for XP you can't take the high room and the opening gives you no XP.  If you can take the high room, nothing else gives XP.  The result: Camping!  Camping at every stage of every dungeon by different people of different levels because you CANNOT NOT CAMP AND EXPECT ANY REWARD ANYWHERE NEAR THAT WHICH IS ATTAINED BY CAMPING.<P><BR>Jarrup Puddlejumper<BR>Just now breaking down and starting to camp the giant fort in Frontier Mountains -- and leveling much, MUCH faster than ever before.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
