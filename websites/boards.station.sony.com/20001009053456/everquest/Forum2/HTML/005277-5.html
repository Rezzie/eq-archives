</FONT><HR>Besides which, preventing twinking would be one of the poorest ways to create a better RP environment.  The first step would be to have a character's actions affect the environment, beyond the faction adjustments.  If a character goes out and slays the dragon that has been terrorizing the land, the local citizens should know WHAT he or she did, not just that the character is viewed warmly now.  That adventure should have some signifigance.  The dragon should no longer exist in the character's environment.  Sure, it would be visible, since other character's need to see it and be able to have the same adventure.  But, the dragon should no longer be able to affect the dragon-slaying character, nor should the character be able to affect the dragon.  MMRPG mechanics require some compromises.  This adjustment would also require a change to the ridiculous camping of rare drops.  Said dragon would have to drop the same loot for all characters involved.  Then, we could have locked treasure chests for rogues to open... etc.<P>This is just one example of a better RP environment.  Verant WANTS endless camping of the same NPC for rare drops.  Keeps us playing and paying longer.  Twinking keeps people playing and paying longer.<P>Why is it that my character can attack a townsperson, get slaughtered, then return to the same NPC and hear, "Welcome to my shop, would you like to see..."?  Shouldn't my character have to do something for the NPC to make up for his stupidity?<P>You CAN play EQ as a RPG if you try.  If you claim to be trying to roleplay, then say twinks are ruining your RP experience--well, you are simply very bad at roleplaying.  Roleplaying means you play the role suited to the environment.  If the environment is laser-blasting space cowboys with jetpacks, then strap on your pack and blast away.  If the environment is crook-slaying, police-dodging urban vigilantes, then load your .357, **** your double-barrel, and rescue some theatre-goer.  The EQ environment IS Ro-wearing, Silvery-weilding, buff-item-carrying newbies.  It may not have started that way, but it has evolved to that.  Worlds change, not always the way you want; MMORPG worlds should, too.<P>If you can't beat them:  join them, leave them, or b*tch about them on forums.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all to Apollohades...<P>I can't believe that you think your comparison is even close to being the same thing as twinking in EQ.  That's just sad.  <P>Secondly...I agree with an earlier post:  If we are to take EQ as a "roleplaying" game then one of your characters would have no in-game connection with any of your other characters.  Each character has it's own history that should begin the same way every other character begins.<P>regardless of the reasoning any of you provide "for" twinking or the fact that Verant is slack on their twinking/anti-twinking rules, the fact remains that none of you twinks are roleplaying.  Personally, I am thinking of quitting EQ because of twinks.  <P>Some of you say that the twinks don't hurt me and I shouldn't even bother thinking about them and just ignore.  But they do bother me in this sense:  I wish to play a game that has roleplaying in it...I wish to see that everyone like me is having the same struggles as I am and wants to work together in getting past them.  However, EQ has proven to me that the player base is full of people who do not Roleplay, do not respect roleplay and treat EQ as some kind of arcade game.  Geez guys, I could play gauntlet and have the same game experience you guys are having with your twinked out characters and lack of RP.  <P>I want to be able to walk into a tavern in an EQ town and see a bunch of players drinking and chatting about the recent hordes of orcs that are coming too close to town etc...not just people who are "inconvenienced" because they have to come into town for a food/spell/guild run.  Do a /who in any town/city and you will usually see 2-8 players.  <P>I think I will go back to playing muds.  I get better RP...hell I get RP - and I don't have to pay for it either.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all to Apollohades...<P>I can't believe that you think your comparison is even close to being the same thing as twinking in EQ.  That's just sad.  <P>Secondly...I agree with an earlier post:  If we are to take EQ as a "roleplaying" game then one of your characters would have no in-game connection with any of your other characters.  Each character has it's own history that should begin the same way every other character begins.<P>regardless of the reasoning any of you provide "for" twinking or the fact that Verant is slack on their twinking/anti-twinking rules, the fact remains that none of you twinks are roleplaying.  Personally, I am thinking of quitting EQ because of twinks.  <P>Some of you say that the twinks don't hurt me and I shouldn't even bother thinking about them and just ignore.  But they do bother me in this sense:  I wish to play a game that has roleplaying in it...I wish to see that everyone like me is having the same struggles as I am and wants to work together in getting past them.  However, EQ has proven to me that the player base is full of people who do not Roleplay, do not respect roleplay and treat EQ as some kind of arcade game.  Geez guys, I could play gauntlet and have the same game experience you guys are having with your twinked out characters and lack of RP.  <P>I want to be able to walk into a tavern in an EQ town and see a bunch of players drinking and chatting about the recent hordes of orcs that are coming too close to town etc...not just people who are "inconvenienced" because they have to come into town for a food/spell/guild run.  Do a /who in any town/city and you will usually see 2-8 players.  <P>I think I will go back to playing muds.  I get better RP...hell I get RP - and I don't have to pay for it either.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Which would make them more money? Someone who blows through levels when they decided they wanted to switch from their 50 wizard they were bored of, to a fully equipped hitter that will be 50 in two weeks, or from someone who wants to play a hitter, but is forced to do it the long hard way? Think about it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>We have, and it wouldn't. Quite a few people have said, many of them being twinks, that if they could not twink, they would have quit a long time ago. All you would really have left is the Roleplayers and people who were indifferent. The number of roleplayers in EQ is much less than the number of powerlevelers/twinks/k00l d00ds."<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree that twinking (despite the other persons post) does include the longevity of the game.  <P>I also said 'good post gordon' because (despite the whining) Verant has established what I believe to be a firm stance on twinking.  I also believe that if I were upset by twinking, I'd have switched to a new server when it was avaiable.

The number of roleplayers in EQ is much less than the number of powerlevelers/twinks/k00l d00ds."<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree that twinking (despite the other persons post) does include the longevity of the game.  <P>I also said 'good post gordon' because (despite the whining) Verant has established what I believe to be a firm stance on twinking.  I also believe that if I were upset by twinking, I'd have switched to a new server when it was avaiable.  That so many of the whiners have not speaks volumes. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok i havnt read all the comments yet so this may already have been said.<BR>The story goes like this : I create a character and start to fight  i earn some money and buy me some items i use these items to help me fight bigger things and earn better money  and buy better stuff   eventualy i realise i need even better items so heres the delema  what do i do with the items i no longer need  and have worked hard to get no matter what lvl i got them at ? Destroy them  give them away  or sell them and as i get higher the items become even better  eventualy i get to the point where i have items no longer needed that i use to crave for at lvl 10 or so now what so i do with them ?.<BR>If they are capped  then i may aswell destroy them as  anyone around the lvl that could use them has prob gone and got there own.<BR> Now at this point i ralise im no longer getting the enjoyment out of this character ive started even though lets say hes lvl 48  so i decide  to try another char  but to be honest i dont fancy spending all them hours lvl'ing him up again scatting around for money or items  so do i stick with the lvl 48 not realy enjoying it or twink another char so i can get him lvl'd asap  and carry on exploring the higher lvl  zones but this time with a char i hope i enjoy playing  more.<P> The only prob i have with twinking is when a lvl 50 goes camp a lvl 30 or 40 mob  just for the drops and not the exp  so he can pass them onto his lower lvl char  that person is denying lvl 30's or what ever lvl from getting there items the way i did when i started my first character . <BR>Now to the point :<BR>Twinking if its in the way off passing down nolonger required items has to be fair play  but to camp  spawns  that are way below your lvl just to get items  to pass to one of your other chars is spoiling the game for others who legit want to camp them . This has recently been seen when lvl 50+'s camped nejina  for drops from lvl 30 mobs  when Verant deciced to let them drop rubicite and Verant then had to pull the plug on it that spoilt it for the genuine ones who would have loved to get the armour for them selves. So if you want to play this game  then put some fairness into what you do and think of others not just yourselves  were a comunity in the game lets act like one.<BR> Friedel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Twinking is such a difficult issue to talk about.  There are two sides to it and always will be.  Neither side will agree because it changes a lot of fundamental things about the game.<P>Speaking personally on the side of twinking, I created about 6 different characters until I finally settled on a ranger.  In the time I remade them, I was gifted very few, and low end, items to help me on my way.  Instead of handing them over to my new char, I gave them to other members of my guild, or to friends who needed things.  I refused to accept gifts or items, because I wanted to earn everything I had on me, one way or another.  By level 30 I had some things on me that level 40s were drooling over because of shrewd trading, real hard work in saving up every penny, and sheer luck  in rolls.  By 43, I had heard stories of why you should not be a high level ranger, and up until then had loved the class.  By 45 I had made another char, and retired my hard earned, hard worked character.  Having spent that long working up, I knew what cool things were out there so knew what I had to work hard to get and strive for.  I gave my new char money to work on a trade skill.  Using that trade skill I earned everything she is wearing.  I would consider her twinked by the mark that she should not have such a high  trade skill at the level she was at.  However, having done the skill, I know she could with shrewd trading, and a little more time invested.  But, that makes me a twink because my character has things that others of her level do not.  Gets me called rude things, treated horrible, and made to feel bad because I earned everything I have, one way or another.<P>On the side of anti-twinking, though.  Starting over is a new chance to see how things are from a different perspective.  Being a low level ranger looking at a lvl 5 magician wearing an SMR, GEBs, and who knows what else since I avoid inspecting, was a shock to the system.  It can be disheartening, make you jealous, angry, and annoyed.  Made me think that, at level 5, they must either have some high powered friends, or a higher level char that got lucky on a roll or has a lot of money to just spread around.  Seeing a level 5 in a full suit of banded didn't bother me at all.  In bronze, well kinda, but if you go to highkeep people sell it all the time, and some folks just give it away.  Still not really doable, but doesn't hurt the eyes near as bad as seeing a level 5 warrior wearing full crafted.. something that has to be quested for.<P>There is no real answer, and unless Verant stays out of the middle and just keeps neutral, they will lose a lot of customers.  If they go to the side of twinking, they lose their anti-twinking players.  If they go to the side of anti-twinking, they lose their tiwnking players.  It's a no win situation for them, so staying in the middle and trying to work with both sides is about the only way they can do it.  But they have taken steps to help with the anti-twinking.  Proc levels on items to make them just like a regular item until such time as someone could have actually earned it in the sense of fighting for it, not earning the cash to pay for it.<P>Of course, then you get into the question of, what defines earning something?  Spending 10 levels killing willowisps, bears, rats, snakes, orcs, scarabs and so forth to sell to have enough money to buy something cool like a full suit of bronze?  Or enough money to work on smithing to get up good enough level to be able to make yourself banded by level 10? Or wearing leather armor until you can get into the keep so you can kill pickclaws to get the bronze to wear?  Both worked hard for it, but I guarantee that if you see a level 10 in a full suit of bronze, you will call him a twink without even asking how he got it or commending him on having worked hard.  And yet, he worked just as hard, saved up every last penny, to get it as the guy who went to Highkeep.<P>The twink is the level 10 wearing an SMR and GEBs and so forth.  Obvious twinkage, but the level 10 wearing bronze that he worked for is called a twink.<P>Someone once gave me a description of what the difference is between twinking and donating.  Twinking is when you give yourself stuff, donating is when you give others stuff.<P>Do you really care, when you look at someone, where they got it from?  Or just the fact that they have it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Didy, you are very wrong on saying I am pro-twink... The fact is, I am neither.<P>"Most" twinks don't bother me...I don't care if a level 1 Ranger has about the same stuff as my level 15...But, I don't like the idea of some level 1 Rangers have the same stuff as some level 45 Rangers. that personally annoys me...But it's the way I feel, not everyone, so I just look the other way and let the twink go on...It's that simple.<P>Now to address you comment on abandoning a high level character for a low level character of the same class, I agree with you. I couldn't possibly understand why someone would want to do that, but I have seen it happen. But, if you read the whole statement, I also mentioned similar classes...<BR>i.e, warriors, paladins, shadow knights, rangers, all are "similar", as in most can wear alot of non-class specific armor, weapons, etc.<P>And again, if you paid close attention to what I wrote, you would have noticed I said that it was a VALID point. I never wanted it to be, or said it was, the end all be all defense to twinking...it wast just a defense, and like I said, it was one that makes sense...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Man, major post duping going on here.  Well, here are my thoughts:<P>It is my opinion that twinking has unbalanced the gameplay, from the economy to player interaction. I can give you two prime examples of that:<P>#1: The economy: I recently tried to sell some of my older weapons (a BBC, a SBH, and a barbed Leather Whip) near Freeport on Mith Marr. As I walked from zone to zone, basically offering to give them away for almost nothing, there wasn't a single level 1-10 character who wanted them. Now, some people say this is because there are much better items available in the game. With that, I don't disagree one bit. But better for who? A Level 1 character?? I've played a level 1 character, and I can tell you you're lucky if you can afford fine steel by level 5. What these people are really saying is that there are much better twinked items available to the level 1 player. Which is exactly my point; every single level 1-10 character I ran across already had twinked weapons better than what I had. Therefore, is it not logical that twinking has completely collapsed the economy for level 1-20 items?? Who wants them anymore? And, if you can follow that logic, then what will stop that curve from moving upward. Next year, everyone will have twinked 1-40 items, and the only economy will be for the Uber items, which is actually the way the game is progressing right now. Excuse me, but if that isn't unbalancing gameplay I don't know what is.<P>#2: The newbie issue (or the jealousy factor and the twinkers like to say): This one has to do with new customers playing your game. Let's say that I'm Joe Customer and I go buy EQ. I log in and start building up a character from scratch. Suddenly I look around and I'm the only one getting killed regularly. I'm the only one with almost no armor on. And I'm the only one using a wooden club. Before everyone starts the jealousy flames, think for a second. If you start playing a game and everyone else appears to have a massive advantage over you, is that a fun game? Is it fun to know that everyone else in the game has improved their characters through means which are not part of the gameplay you're experiencing? I won't even touch on all of the detrimental aspects that a low level twinked character could visit upon a naked level character IF they chose to, but suffice it to say it's not a lot of fun. To back this up, 99% of the twinks I have seen post here say they would never want to play the first 20 levels untwinked again because of how boring and camped everything is. So why would a new customer want to go through all that when they can plainly see that everyone else is on a different playing field???</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kidf<P>You believe that twinking has collapsed the market for level 1 - 20 items?<P>I believe what is collapsing the market for items, is the fact that a never ending stream of items and cash is constantly flowing into the game.  Its obvious that things will lose their value.<P>Has twinking made this problem worse?  <BR>Maybe, probably, who can say 100% for sure.<P>Does server age make this problem worse?  Absolutely, since the number of items in the game is directly tied to the age of the server.<P>So why is the 1 - 20 market so depleted?<BR>I believe that as players are advancing, they are getting new equipment, and they are giving/selling old equipment to lower levels.  Given enough time, this equipment just keeps getting passed down and down and down, given even more time, this equipment just saturates the game, since its never destroyed.<P>Does twinking effect this process?<BR>A person who is twinking is, in a sense, taking items OUT of the game, since they are giving them to their twink, instead of selling them to lower level players and putting the item back into the general economy.<P>Of course, this whole discussion assumes EQ actually has an economy.  LOL <P>Has twinking had a big impact on the economy?  <BR>I would guess that it has had some effect, but I would be willing to bet the constant stream of equipment and cash entering the economy has a much bigger impact.<P>Rotgut<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>After reading a few posts over again, I actually find this thread very amusing...<P>Some people are for twinking, some people are against it. That's simple to understand. But what makes it hard is that some people, not all because there are a few intelligent posts, but some people revert making others seem inferior.<P>Maybe that's ok with some, but I find it appalling that some people can't even have an intelligent debate on the subject.<P>And I used the word debate for one simple reason, there is no right or wrong to twinking. Sure, I'll agree that in some cases twinking hurts players that don't twink. But, in some cases it also helps people that do...So what should be done? My answer would be nothing. I belive one person already said this:<P>"You can please some people all the time, and you can please all the people some of the time, but you can never please all the people all the time."<P>Meaning, twinking is good and twinking is bad depending on the situation. I'm not going to tell anyone that they have to like it, but I do you really have to complain about it?<P>Also...Alot of posts say that twinking is detrimental to the EQ economy...Is it really? What kind of economy is it? Many non-twinks would probably say Capitalist, but then that would go against what they think about twinking...A capatalistic economy would allow anyone to earn whatever they wanted, either by camping the item, questing or buying...As long as they earned it, they would have a right to that item.<P>Now, we take what I just said and put it into an EQ setting. <P>Player A has a warrior named Jon, how high a level isn't very important. With Jon, Player A earns a Minotaur axe (they seem to be popular in the thread). Now mind you, PLAYER A earned the axe, not Jon...<BR>Now Player A starts a Ranger named Mike. Player A earned the axe, so he has the right to do whatever he wants with it. So why not give it to Mike. <P>See, the thing everyone fails to understand is that EQ is a game, no more, no less. Nothing is gonna be perfect. Just look at our economy, alot of things are good for one person yet bad for.<BR>I can even give you a simple example that proves that statement....<P>I want to buy a car...Naturally, I don't have the money fr a brand new car just sitting in my house, so I take out a loan. That loan will have to be paid back, plus interest. Now tell me, is having to pay interest good for me? No. Is it good for the owner of the bank? Yes. But, that wouldn't stop me from taking out a loan, and I definatley wouldn't complain about how that owner of the bank is getting more money than he gave me. I wanted that car then (such as non-twinkers don't want to to twink) for that decision I pay interest on a loan instead of waiting to save the money. (and non-twinks have to go through the low lvl's all over again.) But then another person (a twinker) saves the money for the car and doesn't have to pay interest(or, he doesn't have to go through the low levels again)...<P>Now I know it is very crude example...It's very late and that was the best I could come up with...But the point I am trying to make, is that there are benefits and for each way of thinking...<P>For those that don't twink, you get the satisfaction of knowing you earned those items...(but whose to say the twinker didn't?)And that's what you wanted, or so the post say, so maybe it is jealousy...But that's not important.<P>For those who twink, they don't have to go through the low levels which they so hate, but in that case, maybe they do miss out on "learning" about the class, but its a trade-off.<P>Well, my rant ends for the night/morning...I'll be back tomorrow, maybe then I'll make more sense...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If someone in a group needs an item (to wear mind you) They get that item before me.<P>I have yet to explicitly camp an item just for my twink though.

I didnt camp her armor for the quests, or her FBSS.<P>I bought these items from other players.<P>As for the comments that Twinkers are non RPers...how you couldnt be more wrong.  Thats like me saying anyone over level 50 is a non RPer.<P>NoseSocks, if you were on my play server and ran into my mage or warrior and started an RP conversation, by god I would continue with the RP.  <P>It just gets me when people say You twink, You cant be an RPer.<P>I say if you don't like twinkers, fine, thats not a problem I have with you, it's one you have with me. I don't, and don't think I ever will understand how my warrior, wearing a flowing black silk sash harms anyone else.  If this were a true RP environment, there may only be one Ykesha as the Ghoul Lord would only be slain once.  There would only be ONE of many items.  ONE ghoulbane.  ONE mithril two handed sword.  ONE Crown of the Froglok kings.<P>I would support this fully also.  I would love the idea of it spawns once.  you kill it, noone else ever sees it again.  It would add immensely to the RP environment.<P>I'm still the type of person that believes that EQ is what you make of it.  Want it to be an RP game?  fine, Roleplay then, if people dont roleplay with you, so what.  You dont need them to.<P>If you want to power game, so be it.  Noone is stopping you.<P>As I said, I myself am a roleplayer.  I have nothing against said powergamers.  I have friends who would be considered power gamers.  But, they also pay their 10 dollars a month like I do.  I have no right to tell them "Hey, this is an RPG, roleplay dangit!" Just as they have no right to tell me not to RP and gain level after level.  Ive been playing for a year and a half now.  I have a Level 45 mage and a level 33 warrior and a 16 cleric.  Thats It.<P>My warrior, I twinked because I wanted to get her to where she could group with some mid 20s friends.  IT was alot easier to level her with the items that i gave her than without the,.  Yes, I admit to wanting to make it a bit easier.  Thats why I twinked in the first place.  Not so I could have all the l337 l3w7 on a warrior and have people go OOOOh and AAAAh.  <P>Oh well, I've started to ramble here.  If anyone wishes to continue to discussthis, ICQ me at 33974267 or email me at mrmoose@ec.rr.com<P>To the people that keep this thread civil (Qwinn and NoseSocks stand out) thanks, its nice to have intelligent discussion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Falaanla Marr<BR>Lv 45 Mage, Fennin Ro<P>Aluinie Winterblade<BR>Lv 33 Warrior, Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Answering some comments...<P>"What do you mean by "badger, pester and generally try to convert"? Do you mean they won't stop roleplaying and thus this offends people? I have yet to meet a roleplayer with ZERO tolerance for non-roleplayers."<P>By "badger, pester and try to concert" I mean that the RP'er simply will not shut up about the fact that others are not RP'ing. Granted, they RP this, but it still distracts the group and lessens the fun of the experience.<P>"IF they cannot listen to me and understand such a basic comment, only heaven knows what will happen if I throw an interesting strategy at them during mid-combat."<P>In this instance, if someone just kept repeating themselves, RP or not, I would kick em too. Seems to have nothing to do with RP'ing though so I missed your point.<P>"So WHY do you twink? If fun is your answer, please describe it."<P>I did say why, might have been in the next post though (but I guess reading em all isn't required). I simply don't want to do it again.<P>I have enjoyed the fact that most of my (especially melee) characters are masters of all their weapons. I am not willing to do this without twinking. I find it horrifically boring that to master the 2 handers, I actually have to slow down leveling to further adventure and explore the tactics involved with that character.<P>I suppose that one could argue that I am "lazy" for the above opinion as I read that a name-caller toss at twinks in general. Frankly, someone else's opinion of my work ethic really has absolutely no meaning to me.<P>Someone asked for an intelligent argument for twinking, I've posted what I consider to be a few of them. I read all the responses after those posts and never saw them refuted. Here's a few from my bag. <P>"My parents are wealthy beyond your imagination". "I have a patron teacher."<BR>"A kind old adventurer gave me these gifts."<BR>"My love is a jeweler and made for me this wonderous set of jewelry."<BR>"The Bard told me that I must take this mighty weapon and slay the Ghoul Lord with it!"<BR>"The "Kights of Ni!" have loaned me this fine weapon so that I might learn it's ways nd be more usefull to them."<BR>"The "Scholars of Spellbook Staring" have given me 45,000 platnium pieces and all these fine garments so that I might master the craft of jeweling."<P>Need I continue? Please tell me where my roleplaying skills have failed me. Also, if you are going to contest those reasons, please remember that roleplaying is indeed a way or being that is both personal and varied.<P>To Yogi and a few other of the Pro-RP'ers out there. I would like to point out again, EQ is NOT a roleplay only game. All of your own posts attest to this fact. Seems you might want to move the thread to one to change the game to an all RP enviornment other than defend this position from crumbling logic. All arguments based on the fact that it's against RP (whether intelligent or not) to twink, are invalid by there very nature. THE GAME IS NOT ONLY A ROLEPLAYING GAME! I am sorry that you wre deceived by the box, the hype and your own clouded if desperate attempts to make it so. Go play a MUD or an RL RP game if RP is really what you are after. You'd be happier than raging against this machine.<P>I would like to fess up though. Someone posted, quite intelligently I felt, that RP'ers were "playing the game" where twinkers are "playing with the game". Well, that was a brilliant observation from where I stand (err sit). Luckily, the game does not dictate how we can and can't play it.<P>I play with the game most of the time and sometimes, I play the game. I have fun both ways. Sometimes one is inappropriate though, then the other is right where I need it.<P>Good luck converting the game to RP gang. If you pull it off, I'll be there RP'ing my lil avatars heart out. Until then, I will continue to play games I enjoy for the reasons I enjoy them. Sometimes in character, sometimes out of character.<P>Dayne, 50th Wiz<BR>Irial, 50th Cleric<BR>Valor, 46th Druid<BR>Dworkyn, 41rst Chanter<BR>Carpi, 28th Necromancer<BR>Palais, 27th Paladin<BR>Wystler, 24th Bard<BR>Valradorra, 21rst Bard<BR>Brannd, 21rst Wiz<BR>Thugh, Lyll, Olov, Glupper, and many many more...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005277&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005277&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
