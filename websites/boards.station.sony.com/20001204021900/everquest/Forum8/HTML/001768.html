</FONT><HR>Yep, HQ wolf drops a bit rarely.<P>Minor issues: these recipies actually look usable for training.  Before, Ruined pelts trivial'd out at 26, you are making them trivial out at 50 (in large groups).  So, it wouldn't stop the flood of leather backings - it would help it, 'cause newbies would practice using their ruined pelts, get more LQ pelts (even at a low failure rate), and skill up faster.  Not that I think that is a bad idea.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I would love there to be a flood of backings!<P>The asymmetry of excluding a MQ to HQ Bear pelt recipie also worries me.  The MQ to HQ recipies in wolf and cat _exclude_ the addition of a highly useful (on the level of HQ Bear) recipie for the other pelt times.  Asymmetries are often signs of flawed designes.<P>Here is an example of the flaw:<P>Lets say Yaka wanted to add a new recipie, Halfling Cultural Boots of the Wolf from HQ wolf that gives a 5% speed up proc with unlimited charges, requiring a 2 SoW potions as a curing agent.<P>See what I mean?  The above recipie would make HQ wolf pelts as much in demand as HQ bear, well, on the same order of demand.  So, in order so save the Boot market, would we remove the MQ -&gt; HQ recipie on Wolf?<P>I would think a better choice, if you wanted Reinforced to be easier to make, is to bump the pelt quality required for the existing armors down by one.  So, Studded would require LQ, and Reinforced MQ, leaving the HQ pelts for neato stuff.  And getting rid of the LQ 'gap' in armor manufacturing.<P>Really, Reinforced armor does not deserve the rarity that the game currently gives it.<P>The above might require (ik) trivial level munging, or not - after all, while Reinforced is _currently_ pretty much the top of the tailoring heap, when recipies go to 200 it will become as low on the totem pole as banded gorgets are currently.<P>And, unlike your suggestion, it doesn't ruin the rarity of HQ pelts of the other two types!<P>It does make gaining skill in Tailoring easier (MQ to 108), but if it was introduced with a bunch of other improvements, I'm sure the existing GrandMasters would be to busy being excited over the new stuff to be too disappointed at it being easier to skill up now (which won't be the case, due to increased pelt demand that would be caused by any upgrade).<P>That sentance was way to long.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eh...<P>I've gone around looking for Low Quality pelts in EC, and last week in Neriak.  Got 6 Low quality skins , and as many High quality skins.<P>I agree it's very frustrating, cause I started looking into merchants which I refused to do for so long...  But the combining of Ruined pelts to make Quality pelts makes no sense what so ever.<P>You can't take a trashed Animal fur, and make it look like good quality.  There's some reality to consider here... this is not Alchemy where you can make something out of something else... this is Tailoring we're talking about.<P>As frustrated as I've been, with tailoring at 36 now...   I'll be b*tching for quite a while longer, but still don't agree on the suggestion.  First, It is so easy to get ruined pelts... that tailoring will become a piece of cake.  I was using Ruined pelts, now have probably destroyed/sold over a few hundreds in past 2 lvls.  Can you imagine if it was so easy to convert to LQ, and them make paddings....  What used to be 100 plats for a stack, would be probably 10 plats for a stack.  Why the hell would a Smith bother... go to a merchant buy tons of Ruined pelts (cause there are tons at merchants)... and get your skill up yourself.  This opens an easier way to increase Tailoring, and makes some things that were rare....  even more common....  No Way!<P>I'll get to be a master one day, and it's because I was patient and persistant... not because it was fed into me.  Tailoring is the most frustrating skill to increase, cause you have to work at it...  And it's what I love the most out of it.<P>Baker (49)<BR>Brewer (26)<BR>Tailoring (36)<BR>Smithing (31)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Until now.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR> <BR>Neriak traders should go:<BR> <BR>1) Kill skels for bone chips. Sell stacks for a starting fund for trading.<BR>2) Keep killing skeletons,wolves,spiders,spiderlings. Backings out of LQ,studded out of MQ,thread from spiderlings,silk from spiders,etc. May want to sell the odd HQ bear you nail for more money at this stage. BTW,very good area for HQ wolf. Got three there last night in an hour.<BR> <BR>You'll eventually find yourself making a profit and can then start mining merchants now and again for supplies. It's a self-sustaining cycle until you hit cured silk and backpacks,when tailoring gets to be an even more positive cashflow.<BR> <BR>Like I've said,dark races get the best tailoring area in the game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>everyone is so worried that it will effect how easily the better pelts are going to be to get, how about this: 6 pelts, a silk thread, and the skinning knife to upgrade, then make all of them trivial at 101.. thereby making it so only Master Tailors are able to easily do it on a regular basis, and with it having some sembalance of a fail rate, that way, newbie tailors cant just start taking a bunch of ruined pelts into lq pelts, because everyone knows, if your skill is too low, skill raises are just not gonna happen.. or better yet, make it a Grand Master item (200+) that will make it even better  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>how does that sound for balance everyone?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Think of it this way.  Say you have a skin that is pretty good in the center, but the fringes are all battered.  Its considered "ruined".  Now, if you have 5 of these (or however many), you could cut the "ruined" parts off and sew the good pieces together to make a low quality skin.  Then you get 5 "low quality" skins, trim off the pieces that make it a low quality piece, sew together the better parts, and make a "medium" quality.  Repeat to make a high quality.  I think if you had 125 ruined pelts, you could find enough great patches to create a High Quality piece.<P>And if you want to get into realism, how come we can't save the patterns?  Or at least trace a pattern onto another piece of paper?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Drakezius, Khel is right. My bad.<P>I failed to mention the veritable mountain of LQ/MQ  Bear/Wolf/Cat pelts I got to make all that padding. I mean, 10 stacks of padding, is 200 quality pelts!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"><P>I only specifically mentioned the wolf pelts, because they are what the origonal poster was looking for.<P>Heck, the only reason I know how many HQ wolf I had found is because I ALMOST saved them to work studded leather to improve my skill. Decided at the last minute to just skin them down to padding since studded is such a HUGE pain in the butt to do...<P>Regardless, even after a great deal more thought, I still cannot support this. A stiched together pile of pelts is still NOT High Quality. Seams are obvious, and weaken the pelt.<P>Even if you make the stitching a skill that requires a master tailor, IE trivial at 101, what would you have? A newbie who can become a master tailor by paying silvers for Ruined pelts. That would TOTALLY negate any pride I have in my tailoring skill. I worked my butt off to get where I am, and knowing someone can combine Ruined pelts and get to master tailor in a day just sucks. Yes, between East and West Commons, Freeport, and NRo, you can buy enough ruined pelts to expect to do this.<P>The concept is interesting, I will give you that, but it just isn't practical.<P>Balkin Ironfist &lt;Winterborne&gt;<BR>32nd Dwarven Warrior<BR>Xegony<P>Master Blacksmith 179<BR>Master Brewer 168<BR>Master Drunkard 165<BR>Master Fisherman 109<BR>Tailor 97<BR>etc. etc. etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First...  Trades were added at last minute, in last Beta.  So a lot of things with trades that we'd think should be obvious... aren't there.<P>Yes, you can cut up some good parts of a ruined pelt and then sow it back together.  That gives you a Low Quality pelt.  Now...  Would you make a bag with it ?  It's not going to be as solid now, you took something who.. and made a puzzle out of it.  Ya, you sow it with thread... but it's not as reliable.<P>Let's say I give you the fact that you could make 1 LQ pelt with 5 Ruined pelt.  Are you going to cut into that LQ pelt now to make a MQ.  Wait a second...  you just sowed parts of 5 Ruined pelt to make this LQ pelt.  Now you want to make it even better... What are you going to do, cut into it again... find 5 LQ Pelt that were made out of 25 Ruined pelts... and make a Medium pelt ?  Common.  I can give to a certain point...  But you'll have a piece of crap if you continue cutting, and sowing.<P>If you had 1 WHOLE Sqare foot of Leather from a bear skin.  And then you had that same 1 Square feet done out of 5 pieces sowed together...  Which one will be more resistant ?  the Whole piece one hands down will be much stronger.  But you want the Frankenstein piece of art sowed together to be considered as good as the WHOLE one.  Am I making any sense here ?<P>By sewing pieces together, you get something less reliable than if it was a WHOLE piece of that quality.<P>If they wanted to add, LQ Made skin.  Which is made out of 5 Ruined pelts that would be cool... but they need to be different than the LQ Skins.  You can't combined then over and over again...  if you keep cutting and sewing the thing, you'll have junk in the end...<P>Hey...  125 pieces of leather sowed together doesn't not EQUAL 1 High Quality pelt.  You might have 1 High Quality Pelt's worth... but sewing it together gave you 1 High Quality piece of junk.<P>Think!  It's as if I'm taping my broken Hockey stick and hope it's going to perform as good as a new one...  I taped the sucker...  Then I wonder why it the tape didn't take and it split in same place...<P>HQ Pelt is not for the looks... it's for how solid and resistant it is...  You start sowing the thing away...  it's not good anymore for what it was intended for.<P>If you undestand anything I'm here... you know now why the Idea is absurb.<P>I've been stressing, and been very aggravated with Tailoring.  You think I wouldn't like it to be easier...  I would, but not when it makes total no sense.<P>I saw my Grand mother make clothing when I was a kid... the Patterns would but cut, put on cloths and by the time she was done...  Sometimes the patter could be save, sometimes it was trash.<P>As for Copying the pattern... Why can't casters make copies of spells with blank paper and just start selling to other casters.  Why can't we just tear down the trees in Kunark and start building Shacks.  Why, why, why...  Well EQ is still in the building stage, EQ2 will be the goodie stuff we're beggin for.  hopefully they'll hear about some of the good things in UO, and other games to come... and make sure to put it all together for us.  Until then... I'm going to continue my frurstrated accent towards Tailor mastery... hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good points all.  I realize that sewing bits and pieces wouldn't be as good as a whole.  How about this.  5 Ruineds creates a "Patchwork Low Quality Pelt".  this can be used to create anything that a low quality pelt can make, but with a 10 skill point penalty (so at 50 tailoring working with a PLQ pelt is equivalent to a person with 40 tailoring working with a LQ pelt).  you could take 5 LQ pelts (but not PLQ) to create a Patchwork Medium Quality pelt.<P>This means you can't take 125 ruined and make a high quality.  It also encapsulates the idea of lesser quality.  Any thought?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Krell, great Idea...<P>As I said... Creating something similar to LQ, without being LQ... I'll bite.  Cause it is "Low Quality" after all.<P>What I had a problem with was making Medium or High Quality out of this... or the thought that 5 Ruined pelt made a LQ Skin.  Then using 5 LQ Sking to make MQ Sking... and so on.  So that 125 pelts would make High Quality... Ya, a lot of work... but made no sence.<P>a "Patchwork Low Quality Pelt" has been the best Idea yet.  Maybe should go on the Wish List section... hehe<P>IT would make some things easier, but wouldn't unbalance everything.  And would give more usefullness out of Ruined pelt, and maybe could be another possible Skill Increase thing to try too.<P>Sorry, if I sound grumpy in this thread... hehe  I'm getting all worked up with people complaining about the new spells that we WEREN'T suppose to get that might be in SOV.  Cool to know, we get a surprise... but we're complaining about it... hehe  Oh well...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
