</FONT><HR>At the very top of my wish list is this...<P>Change the way EQ determines "who gets the kill."<P>Right now, the kill goes to the individual who did the most damage.  If that individual happens to be in a group, then the group splits the experience and anyone in the group can loot the corpse.  If the individual is not in a group, then they get the exp/loot.<P>While this may seem like a viable method, consider an example (taken from last night).<P>My group attacked a rare spawn.  We were the only group in the area.  An invisible wizard showed up about 3 minutes before the spawn.  He was anon, but was red to the highest member of our group, so he was obviously a bit above us.<P>When the bad guy appeared, everyone attacked.<P>I hit for my max of 93 damage.<BR>A wizard in my group hit for 102.<BR>Our two tanks hit for a total of 60.<BR>Another mage in my group hit for 80.<BR>The two pets in my group hit for a total of 39.<BR>I was the only one to get a second shot in, and hit for 56.<P>That is a total of 430 points of damage done to the baddie by my group... 391 if you take away the pet damage (not sure if it counts).<P>The lone high level wizard got one spell off, and hit for 175 damage.<P>The wizard got the kill, we got nothing.<P>Please do not get me wrong, I do not think wizards are too powerful.  I do not think that players should be forced to play the "socially acceptable" game (in other words, if you want to be a jerk and steal kills, go ahead, just be ready for the backlash from other players).<P>What I *DO* think is that it is just plain wrong for a player who did less than one third of the damage to the bad guy should get the credit.  If he had done more than half, then sure, he should get the credit.<P>If a group of six players shows up and does more damage to a beast than a group of four players does, then the group of six should split the experience... it should NOT depend on individual performance (unless of course, the individual is playing solo).<P>I am not asking for Verant to solve the social problems of the game, just give us the tools to do it.  For example a magician is taking all the kills at a spawn area designed for charactrers of lower level.  Right now, there is NOTHING these characters can do, because even if they group together, a caster 4 or 5 levels above them will ALWAYS be able to do more damage then any of them can do individually.  If GROUP damage was used, these same lower level characters would be able to band together, combine their damage, and maybe be able to compete with the lone mage for the loot/experience.  At least they would have a chance.<P>The designers have said several times that they want to encourage group play.  Well, here's another way to do it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> You must consider the other side of the coin. Today i was happily soloing in hk when this one group would constantly try to take my kills . Well they tried and failed 3 times. If the group damage had been totaled then they would have stolen my 3 kills.<P>  Unfortunately theres no way to please everyone.<P>  Then their enchanter got pissed and tried to charm me and lead me up to the guards to get me killed. Luckily it wore off and then i petitioned her for this exploit as well as the casting through walls. After i equipped my magic resistant gear and buffed myself up to 78 magic resist she was suddenly nowhere to be found.  And to anyone who must know this exploiting enchanters name is Mintika and she is on the Rallos Zek shard.<P>Oberon<BR>35 DE Cleric<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would have to agree with Cygnus for the most part on this one. I do see the other points about how if it were that way a group of wizards could own everything they wanted, or that a group could steal kills from individuals, and that would be unfortunate, but from what I have experienced and heard and read, it is almost always a SINGLE character that comes in and does the kill steal, all the while using the group attacking it basically as the tanks. The kill stealers I have seen are VERY rarely grouped if ever, and usually consists of a wizard or high level cleric, depending on the type of area you are in (undead or not).<P>I guess I am just trying to say that in most cases that i have seen, singles do the stealing from groups, not vice versa, and although a group of wizards grouped could kil anything they wanted for the most part and steal it all, the ones that like to steal kills tend to not be the grouping type, which is why they need to steal kills in the first place. <P>I just hope for some sort of solution.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Malach you are correct, but drawing the wrong conclusion.  They people stealing kills are not grouped because currently, group damage means nothing.

</FONT><HR>I am a wizard, and I am aware that I can steal most any kill on a ground of equal leveled characters. There is nothing that they can do to stop me. My damage is far greater than any one of theirs. But I dont. Its a personal choice. If someone is stealing a kill from you, then bring the fight closer to them. There is a point when the wiz has to decide whether to try or not. When he makes his move, drag the creature on top of him. Or if in rallos, kill him as soon as the fight is over as he will be low on mana at that point. To my knowledge pet damage counts as the controller's damage. Which would actually (contrary to popular beliefe) give the magician class the best kill stealing standpoint. But what do I know. Im just a wizard.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A couple points.  <P>One, I wasn't intending to bash wizards or imply that they are all kill stealin' bums. <P>Two, if a bunch of wizards grouped together, then they wouldn't be kill stealing, they would be killing the damn monsters... which is what they should be doing.  I am sure that a group of 6 wiz's would do more than 50% of the damage to a creature in a contested spawn, and they would rightfully claim the kill.  I have no beef with that from a game design standpoint.  (As a player it would certainly upset me if they hogged the spawn, but that is a social issue, not a game design issue)<P>My post was not about "hogging the spawn" (which is one thing a group of 6 wiz's would be damn good at).  If six wizards band together and take over a spawn point, then fine, at least they will have to do the work themselves, which is all I ask.  My problem lies in the fact that right now they don't have to do the majority of the damage to get the kill, and that just plain sucks.<P>Some of you seem to think that if party damage was considered, then a group of 6 wiz's would be able to claim any beast they wanted.  You are right.  But, they would have to actually kill the damn monster themselves, instead of counting on another group to do 3/4 of the work, and then take advantage of the fact that they can do more damage individually then the opposing group did.<P>I don't have a problem with a group taking over a spawn point... I have a problem with an individual taking advantage of other people's work.  For instance, a party of 6 does 100 points each to a monster, and a kill stealing rogue comes in at the last minute and backstabs the beast for 101.  The rogue gets the kill.  It should not work that way.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Cause you do not own the regions and you do not own the mob, there ant be the speach of kill stealing. When a high level wizard decides to kill something below him, its his problem, he is surely wasting time. When 6 wizards want to hunt together, they are dead meat, espeizially in HH. At the spawn rate and delay to attak, they cant target all separate ors spawning and orc warriors can kill a wizard with few blows.<P>By god, this is a group game and when they want to burn down everything, its their right and you have to move off when you cant compete with them. <P>But, the lone "kill stealer" is annoying. There should be group damage in PvE as well as in PvP, who do the most damage get the kill. This is not an ego-shooter and Verant should do its best to protect the game against such "Quake" players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  Hi there!  I am a wizard, first and fore most.  I too could KS anything from anybody yellow or below to me (except other wizards of course) but I don't and I WON'T  I am all for the group damage being cumulative in determining who gets the kill...<BR> In response to the post about a group trying to KS from you 3 times, if that happens, find somebody to group with you, even just temporaraly, even if they're significantly lower level, the extra couple of points (compared to what you're doing) will make the difference.  In payment for their help, then give them $ or help them take out a hard spawn, and let them get the xp... If offered that option, I'd take it!<BR>  In short, those of you worried about this doing nothing but creating reverse kill stealing, there's nothing preventing you from grouping to protect your kills, even if you like to solo, how often are you going to have to defend your kills?  Usually it'll just be from one group of people following you around, so you temp group with somebody, and teach them otherwise... they'll leave to find easier prey.
