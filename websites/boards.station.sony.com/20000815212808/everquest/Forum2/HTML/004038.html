I saw a 5th level bard the other day decked out in a full suit of lambent. It was hilarious and sad to see this fool running from a few centurion orcs.<P>I'd like to see this message when trying to equip too high armor or weapons on a low level character:<P>"You lack the skills to benefit from this equipment."<P>Trueshot Aspenglade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oh boy another one of these posts..<P>Verant is against twinking as stated in a faq somewhere (I actually read them at one time) and it's their game so they can do what they want.<P>Jealousy is not any factor of it for me.. sure I'd like to have better equipment for my lvl23 .. equipment like I saw a lvl1 with. But.. what'd I'd rather do is progess through the game normally as intended to acheive it. Seeing someone 20 levels below me with an item I've been longing to fight for kinda ruins the excitement of the challenge to get it. And on PVP is *does* interfere with other players' enjoyment of the game. <P>As this topic is discussed (if you call it that) so much, that's all I'll add to it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Cut from the FAQ<BR>***************<BR>Q: Is it allowed? Why?<BR>As game designers, we are aware that players seek any advantage available in order to get a "leg up". It has been the nature of massively-multiplayer games since their earliest manifestation. It is with this in mind that EverQuest was built. Since we recognize the issue, that being that people will always desire to "pass down" items from higher-level characters to lower-level characters, we chose to remain more or less neutral on the subject as long as it doesn't unbalance the game.<P>The idea on our side was to present an environment where a "twinked" character is not so much better off than an "untwinked" character, that the "untwinked" character has a problem getting groups.<P>Given that the only way to truly stop "twinking" is to put level-limits on everything, we moved forward with limiting its effect.<BR>********************<P>Verant knows that twinking actually helps keep people playing and paying longer. They will not ever make twinking impossible. They may make it harder to do and require you to seek the aid of others in passing stuff between characters but they will not make it impossible.<P>Oh, and i believe Gordon said that dropping an item should be considered the same as deleting the item, not that dropped items would be destroyed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Obviously anti-twinking is one of Verant's prime directives for its live team. . . any twinkage means less time spent leveling and by their point of view, a decrease to their revenue stream--an unfortunate and fundamentally flawed model of the massively multiplayer gaming model (that people will run through and "finish" a game in the traditional sense. . . but that's a whole other thread)<P>Having said that, I think the change to consent has less to do with twinkage than it is a small piece of a larger paniced reaction--which includes nerfing FD and the reconnecting your client after LD--to the various duping workarounds that players have been disseminating in the EQ community.<P>Stylepits, I take issue that twinking does not make sense from a roleplay perspective. . . if you are familiar with any sort of folk or mythology, you can see endless examples of callow heroes invested with artifacts of great power. . . Arthur with Excalibur, Bilbo Baggins with the Great Ring, Mickey Mouse with the magician's wand...<P>In fact this is one of the seminal themes in classic literatures, the Hero's journey which starts from a position of immaturity--often symbolized by his impotence in a multitude of aspects, a struggle to master a great hereditary artiact being one defining aspect. of this journey<P>So if it helps you with your illogical jealousy when you see a twink think of him having wealthy parents.<P>As for people twinking others, think of them as "teaching" others.  Merlin was a twinker, Athena on many occasions, and most famously, Chiron<P>so to recap:<P>minding your own business: good<BR>twinking: eh<BR>camping: bad<BR>jealousy: bad<BR>helping others: good<BR>verant: bad<P>hope that helps</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Verant will NOT eliminate twinking.<BR>"Why not?" <BR> Because it is one of the few factors that gives this game any significant replay value.  On Older Servers (Fennin, Karana, etc.) I'd estimate about half the server (easily) is twinked to some extent.  <BR>  Mask of Deception is not a item particularly suitable for a 40+ character, I looted mine at level 5.  I rode the boat from Kelethin, I ran to guk, I Hide and sneaked to the Ass-Sup Room, spoke with the camper, and he says "Sure you can loot one, I hate having to destroy them" (The cries from players "WTH is a Level 5 doing here,"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)  By putting level caps on items, you dash the hopes of people who might be above average players, and may achieve items "above their level." (You have no idea how many untwinked-Shadowknights around 25 I've seen able to purchase a few pieces of DF)  It would also kill the economy.<BR> A great deal of the major buying and selling is caused by twinking.  Most of those "/auc Selling everything on me, at the tunnel."  are soon to be twinks.  Trust me on this,  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>  What do you do, your level 60, you have optimal equipment, your getting sorta bored with you class.. you look at that level 60 &lt;Insert Class here&gt;  that your grouped with..  He looks pretty cool... I think I might be able to get into that..<BR>So you twink your brains out (LOL)...<BR>  Once more, I must stress, it adds REPLAY VALUE to EQ.. Verant wants that, because despite their best efforts, there are level 60 players, LOL..<BR>Sorry for the long post</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"I take issue that twinking does not make sense from a roleplay perspective. . . if you are familiar with any sort of folk or mythology, you can see endless examples of callow heroes invested with artifacts of great power. . . Arthur with Excalibur, Bilbo Baggins with the Great Ring, Mickey Mouse with the magician's wand..."<P>You contradict yourself. You present mythology and folklore as arguments regarding role-playing and twinking. Stories are NOT role-playing...simply put because you are not playing the role of anything, you are reading something set in stone by the author.<P>How do you twink in rpgs such as Baldur's Gate or Planescape? You mess with the hex code or download some hacker's proggie. That is also called cheating. That's fine in your own game. But guess what? You share your fantasy world with the rest of us and it ruins the role-playing setting to see some 5th level dork running around in full lambent...one of many examples.<P>Jealous? Why be jealous when I have pretty nice gear that I quested for myself and with friends? My ranger is in character and was role-played, thus earning what he owns. Twinks just look so dorky and are often shunned for that very reason. You bring it on yourselves.<P>Trueshot Aspenglade<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I open up my bank and guess what?  I throw that equipment I have on to a "twink".<P>I do not feel its right for someone to take a spawn from a legit camper for his twink.  However, I also know its not right for someone to tell me I can't put gear I have obtained through the course of my playing on another char.<P>Drop the jealousy and play to have fun.  If someone is camping something that you need for your primary char and its obvious he doesn't need the item for his primary, invoke PnP.
