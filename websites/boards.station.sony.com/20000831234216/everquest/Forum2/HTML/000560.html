</FONT><HR>If noone at Verant wants to deal with the current state of trade skills, I really don't know why they don't just remove them altogether.  As a Master Smithe, the toolboxes were the best thing that ever happened.  Most of the players using it to make cash didn't take the time (and money) to improve their skill past 51, but they do have cash now....and I have armor to sell them.  If they are busy maing toolboxes, they aren't out congesting the low level hunting areas.  Works good for everyone.  Up till today.<BR>Thanks guys.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Blacksmithy is being worked on currently, with plans for tailoring and pottery shortly thereafter.  Jewelry is probably on the bottom of the list of revamps right now due to the fact that it is already so useful.  It's without doubt the most robust trade skill currently in game.<P>We do however have plans for the "Bottled Mana" series of spells in these revamps  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Also the JC skill is capped at 200. Wasn't Alchemy upped to over 200 ?<P>I don't believe that alchemy was, but poison was bumped over 200.  Increase of the skill caps on the trades might be revisited during the revamp.  Poison had components that made skill over 200 necessary.  The other skills are currently built already taking into account the 200 cap.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Is Begging considered a trade skill? or does it kinda stand alone.  Since pet classes cannot get the weapons back from pets and since begging is of limited use (at 100 it's still the occasional copper... or get attacked) how about the possability of begging pet weapons back.  I'm sure the low success rate would still make players leary of giving pets powerfull weapons and the trouble of getting begging up to mastery would give them an additional dimention.  <P>-Memspector on Quell, who wants to beg a bonechip off a skelly</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just wondering if the Smithing upgrade is going to be along the lines of the silvered/blessed/holy weapons and armor I've been suggesting for the last few months...  Don't have the url for the threads, but the concept is:<BR>Any smith can make a silvered weapon.  Add enchanted silver bar(s) to the weapon recipe.  Silvered weapons are same as normal forged weapons, but hit magical.<BR>Blessed weapons require both enchanted silver and a hammer (from the Cleric/Paladin Hammer series) in conjunction with the normal weapons recipe.  Blessed weapons would be slightly improved over the normal forged weapons (lower delay by two or three, higher damage by one, maybe) and would only be usable by "Good" races/classes.<BR>Holy weapons would require enchanted silver and a HIGH level hammer (see blessed weapons) as well as Holy water (or something to substitute for this, such as globes of summoned water, crystallized mana, etc) in addition to the normal weapon recipe.  These weapons (very hard to make, require 24th level cleric or 39th level Paladin (or something like that)) would proc a VERY LOW LEVEL ward undead occaisionally (2-14dam) and would be similar in other respects to blessed weapons.<BR>The above recipes could (certainly SHOULD) involve folded sheets of metal, as well.<BR>Blessed and Holy armor would be created along similar lines, but would be slightly better than banded.  Holy armor would also provide bonuses to saves against spells, disease, fire and cold.<BR>However, since Abashi POINTEDLY mentioned the mana series of spells Enchanters have, it's a safe bet that magical armor recipes (hopefully there will be some) will involve gems and crystallized mana.  I imagine that, in order to avoid having to create a huge amount of new items and causing a huge patch download, they will have specific armor pieces have specific recipes thereby making each magic armor item different from the others.<BR>Nosesocks, help me out here.  Do you remember all my previous posts about Silvered/Blessed/Holy weapons/armor?<P>Aragir<BR>15th level Paladin<BR>Xegony Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Abashi - I can't believe I got a response !<BR>You are getting better ;-)<P>I agree that in the past, JC was a very useful skill to have,  but you missed my point in that it has become a non-profitable skill now.  There are just too many items coming into the game that replace crafted jewelery, that people see as 'better'.  I love new items in the game !  But with everyone dumping their old items as they replace them with newer ones, prices are below what anyone crafting can make any profit on.  People often dump the plat items for hundreds less than a jeweler can make them.  This used to be rare, but go into East Commons on TM on Sunday and take a look.  It's hard to understand this phenomenon unless you are a crafter trying to sell your wares.  I'm not saying Verant is blind, I'm just saying that they don't understand because they don't have people trying to make a living in Norrath selling wares.  We aren't asking to be filthy rich,  just help us to craft and not lose money after we have put so much time, pp and effort in becoming a 'master' craftsperson.  Trade skills can be fun, but JC is in need of a serious revamp.  Please don't bury us at the bottom.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

At this time only a few specific items require an cross dicipline interaction.  I would like to see much more.<P>My ideas are crafted to assist the low to middle lvl characters as well as build a good foundations to the ideas of good thinkers like Palli5g.<P>1.  As low lvl players we all experiences loads of mobs dropping rusty weapons of all descriptions.  As it stands now, throwing them in the old forge with a sharpening stone gets us a slightly better weapon.  I would like to see the ability to use the skills of a potter to manufacture enamel, or tempering clay.  This would allow smiths, as they progress, to make their weapons a little better as they go.  Tempering clay would be the next logical step, as a smith with a decent skill could then make a tempered blade with a damage bump to match the delay bump of the tarnished blade process.  Enameling(just kinda pulled that out to include the potters...clay you know)would possibly be the first low lvl stat bump, (+1 cha.<P>The tempering clay, and the ability to use it should be possible at the same skill level in both trades.  The higher lvl products needed to enhance the weapon should also be linked to other trade skill lvls. <P>In effect, this sort of interaction would allow all trade crafts to manufacture and trade valued skills for like skills or items.  A smith and potter could work together to produce a weapon for each, enriching both by the cooperative process.<P>I admit this has some holes in it, and I plan to post a longer, more complete post with data next week.  I hope that good folks like Palli5g will give it a look and bat things around with me.<P>Ok one last *****...As someone who works in RL as a craftsman, this idea of failures producing nothing but a monitary loss is bunk.  Bad pottery is ground into grog for new pottery, bad furniture is sold at a lower price.  I would propose that items attempted to be crafted that are well within the skill lvl needed never completely fail.  Items such as a banded tunic may not come out at ac15 for a failure, but ac12, or ac10 or even ac8 for a really bad job.  They would not be the best we can make, but at least we could still sell them and it puts more gear at a price that lower lvl characters could then afford.  Should those items then be reworked?  Possibly...something to think about. <P>Thanks all,<BR>Rid <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Smithing is such a tedious skill to begin, and master. The introduction of weapons was a bust simply because the cost didn't match the price you could charge for them. Mino axe was just as good a slash weapon, and sells now for about 4p. Bastard sword cost more than that to make. Fine steel was just as good and often sells for the cost of forged weapons. Made weapons a waste.<P>It would be nice if smiths could skill up to plate, and then work with enchanters to make magic armor. <P>Would be nice if they could make weapons that actually earned them some cash-or that players (past level 5) could use. Maybe fast weapons that are just as good as hunted weapons of the same level (and cost effective). Maybe even weapons that proc and effect. <P>Not hard to fix smithing, with a little thought.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi said... "We do however have plans for the "Bottled Mana" series of spells in these revamps"<P>/shout WOO HOO!<BR>/em does the Happy Dance<P>Best news I've seen since the CS revamp.  <P>That said, PLEASE do it right.  What do I mean when I say "right"?  Glad you asked.  In descending order of importance...<P>1&gt; Do it in such a way that it gives time-impaired and casual players an alternative to hyper-camps.  With my playing time more than doubled now, I'm trying some of these for the first time and let me tell you they're NOT fun, by any viable definition.<P>2&gt; Craftable items should come in two flavors:<BR>a&gt; Those that PLAYERS are going to want enough to pay more than cost for; <BR>b&gt; Those that the MERCHANTS are going to buy for *slightly* over cost (110% - 125% would be fine) to help recoup the cost of training the skill to the point the crafter can reliably create items from the first category.<P>3&gt; Do it in such a way the skills can legitimatly be trained at all points along the growth chart without undue risk/expense.  There are gaps in jewelry, for example, where the expense of moving to the "next step" is prohibitively expensive, but going to the next cost-efficient point is prohibitively risky.  And I said UNDUE risk/expense, not free or easy.  Sound Bite Version: Heck levels are bad enough, don't have Heck Points in trade skills.<P>4&gt; Do it for ALL of the trade skills.  Yes, I said ALL of them.  Fishing, Tinkering, Begging, and even Research could have interesting revamps.<P>5&gt; Do it in a timely fashion.  Repeat your performance with Poison and Alchemy at your own peril.<P>Just a thought or three on how the skills could be revamped.<P>TAILORING: Introduce a caster-specific version of Cured Silk with has small/moderate amounts of mana per piece -- enough from a whole suit to cast an extra 12th level spell, on average.  Also introduce a Druid-specific tailored leather armor (check with druids on what they'd want).  The once-suggested and excellent delay-reducing quiver idea should also be implemented.<P>BLACKSMITHING: The main thrust initially should be weapons, as that's where the main "power gap" between the time-impaired and time-blessed appears to be.  That's not to say improved armor isn't called for -- I'd recommend a single style wearable by multiple classes (not unlike Curscale).<P>POTTERY: Two words -- containers, symbols.  Pottery already has a Clay Diety pattern; allow potters to make religious symbols using this single pattern but different ingredients based on faith.  As for containers, let me name two very specific desires:<BR>a&gt; a 10-slot, small-items box with no or minimal weight reduction (and possibly the Lore limitation) to hold components, reagents, research items, and the like.<BR>b&gt; a 10-slot, large-items "urn" with a prohibitive weight (in the 20-pound range), also with no-to-minimal weight reduction, to serve to hold items in the bank (this item *definitely* should not be lore).<BR>[By The By -- anybody found Urn Sketches yet?]<P>TINKERING: Tinkered items should come in three forms.  To Wit --<BR>a&gt; Items that serve as superior replacements to existing in-game tools (retractable fishing poles shouldn't break, for example)<BR>b&gt; Items that provide constant spell effects (such as the Rebreather)<BR>c&gt; Very specific, narrow-use items that are as expensive to make as they are useful (a non-expendable throwing item, for example).<P>Thank you again, Gordon.  If there's any way I can be of help implementing this, you folks have my email address.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Not working on Jewelery?  Fixing Smithing?<P>My 100 skill smith can whip out a set of banded like nothing and make money on it SUPER EASY.  Smithing is already QUITE useful.  <P>But don't get me wrong while you are actually working on Smithing the MOST obvious logical thing people might think plausible is an Enchanter should provide enchanted metal for basic Smithable weapons with modest plus.  <P>Perhaps a combination of Smith and Jeweling might be a cool idea where a person with Jewelry skill could take a smithable weapon and combine it with a gem to add the plus similar to Diablo where we socket jewels into the weapons?  Nah that would be way too cool for EQ which has maybe started on the downhill already from lack of anything COOL that players all agree they would like and just plain getting the usual Verant response of <P>Umm let me think NO.<P>Jewelry is last on your list because It's already sooo useful?  What complete utter TRIPE!!!  Who makes this garbage up?  You can;t seriously actually believe this?  What planet are they on and can we find them and help them back to Earth or Norrath either would do?<P>I wasted a ton of good money developing jewelry and if you check you'll notice that at level 83 skill I STILL can't make a dime with jewelry so it was a COMPLETE waste of hundred and hundreds of plat to learn the skill but its ALREADY SOOO USEFUL ya RIGHT!  I can spend 4pp on a jade and 3pp on an electrum and if I'm quite VERY lucky get a bracer worth what maybe 10pp?  Even on the item which is possibly the best item I can make in electrum at 83 I only break even!  At 83 skill I still flub the holy crud out of ANYTHING gold and half the electrum stuff.  But Jewelry is JUST GREAT!  it's so peachy we arent gonna look at it at all..  <P>I have to say like the others if you haven't started THROWING your money away on this trade skill don't bother just get your's made by one of the POWER PIG guild bunnies with 200 skill like everyone else and TOTALLY FORGET about actually PLAYING the game like it is supposed to be played.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>While you are "revisiting" trade skills Abashi consider this:  Does it make sense to have a 200 skill cap on a skill with so long a list of products that you can't even make the High end stuff ith any amount of reliability even as an Uber Master?<P>Granted I don't yet have direct experience here but I know the trivial on Gold Opal is 191 and that means the 200 cap is just around the corner and I am still nowhere near beginning to make platinum jewelry. Frankly at 200-400 a pop on some attempts in platinum, that scares the heck out of me!<P>And yes, one more cry for the "Please let us Enchanters enchant stuff" thread - magical weps, armor, and already existing items (taking a non enchanted ring and enchanting it to the equivalent of its previously enchanted counterpart).<P>And lastly, the toolbox recipe was not broken as you say. The only thing changed was the sell price. The recipe is one metal bit and one water flask, so says the book, and so goes the attempt I made AFTER the patch. I would have agreed that had the recipe been broken and was supposed to require a mold or something and that explained the large profit margin then it would have made some sense to "nerf" but all you did was change the sell price to be unprofitable. Perhaps it was "broken" or "out of balance" at all. Consider that the toolboxes are containers and must be sold at a maximum of every seventh success. This was not the fast money maker or insta plat machine as FallenHero (yes, I still think you are a dork) made it out to be. Perhaps somebody with sense at Verant set it up that way on purpose. Perhpas the original intent was to give toolboxes more profit because balance was the fact that they are tedious and inconvenient to make them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It's not. Nearly - they almost missed the boat on crafts entirely - but I guarantee you - if monster bashing was THE ONLY game - I'd have never bothered to install EQ in the first place.<P>The risk vs. reward if fine - if you need to thump your chest and have bragging rights you killed a dragon - be my guest. I don't. I don't want to ever SEE a dragon - much less have any desire WHATSOEVER to kill one.<P>Some folks are more into the social - merchant game. Being a craftsman to me provides me with reasons to interact with others. <P>My game in no way interferres with yours - it's rather irritating to see comments like this that basically tell me my reasons for being in Norrath are invalid.<P>While craftsmen/merchants are a minority - we tend to be the spice and glue that start communities - and hold them together. At least if we are needed.<P>Craftsmen of Norrath so far have done it on faith - someday we will be useful.

</FONT><HR>Well I agree absolutely that all Crafts ought to be able to turn at least a modest profit beyond skill level 80-120.  If I can fish for flounders and turn those into sandwiches or fish wine and use that to make foreworks or invisible potion or whatever.  The more skills you use to accomplish a product the bigger the reward should be.  If some nerd wants to sit and make a million fishcakes for ten hours straight to earn his 100 plat then why the heck not??  <P>Why does EVERYTHING we make with a craft have to sell back to the vendor for LESS than the cost of ingredients?  Am I the only one who thinks this is a no brainer?  if it keeps some people home making fishcakes then maybe ONCE just ONCE when I arrive at a cool spawn it wont be UBER camped to death and people will say that thing we all dreamed we would one day hear in EQ "Oh thank goodness you have arrived we need one more to complete our group!"  The way the game was intended to be played but gosh would they ever consider adding a few more servers and allow us to migrate over from old servers...  <P>Mmmm of course not what are you kidding me!?  If somethings are so camped to death it makes the game no fun for everyone who ever sought that item, they need to add more of that item so it drops more often, radomize where it drops to more mobs or better still make it NOT drop for people who have already looted one NYA!  You got yours now move on power pigs we are tired of looking at you looking stupid camping the same thing for 36 hours like some person with a toilet by their computer doh!  And they think we admire them because they have cool gear or something help them find a clue!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>...&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't believe that alchemy was, but poison was bumped over 200. Increase of the skill caps on the trades might be revisited during the revamp. Poison had components that made skill over 200 necessary. The other skills are currently built already taking into account the 200 cap.<P>If poison has components that make over a 200 skill nessisary and Jewlery dosen't according to the above post then i would REALY hate to see how bad that high end poison is, cause i have seen a jewler with a 200 skill and even with a 180+ int and 160+ wis still fail 8 of 10 plat ruby veils</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>oh, and Verrant didn't make the skills not sell to vendor for profit for any reason other than to force us to interact and bargain with other players like they want us to do.<P>...Remember, you have entered THEIR world now...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>One thing I'd like to see is a small addition to fletching where combining gnomish fireworks to a certain arrow recipe produces explosive arrows. Or maybe make explosive arrowheads a tinkered item to be sold to fletchers and be put on several different arrow types.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000560-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000560-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000560&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000560&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
