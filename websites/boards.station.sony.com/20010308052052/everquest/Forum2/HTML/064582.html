</FONT><HR>nazgorath said:<BR>&gt;&gt;look, if you don't like it, then don't activate it.<P>there IS that option, it isn't there automatically.&lt;&lt;<P>Ah, but you don't see that this effects EVERYONE, even those who decide not to play. <P>Lets take a possible example: A group of six (we'll say for arguement's sake 3 melee types and 3 caster types).  <P>Now, lets say one of the melee types is out pulling and yells INCOMING. One or two of the others in the group see that, but are soooo close to the next wave or beating their own high score that they figure they can play for 10 seconds longer and get it before the puller shows up. They are thinking "It takes him so long to pull it anyway, he isn't even sowed" so they keep playing.  And lets compound this by saying this caster (or maybe even a hybrid) are below level 35 and have to also stare at their spell book. They won't see the pulling coming in right away.<P>This could inevitablly add to enough time wasted on GEMS that someone or the entire party dies if the puller made a bad pull. This adds to EVERYONES downtime that was in that group now because there was someone distracted while playing.<P>And its not like you are told they are playing. You have no way to know they are playing and have to assume they are paying attention and will stop playing that game when it comes time to fight (if they in fact are playing it).<P>I dunno, seems to me like VI avoiding the real problem of fixing the downtime/time sink issue, and giving players something to "feel good" about while they nerf and don't fix other more important problems.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>spicyChef, your argument is so lame it almost does not deserve a reply.<P> if you and or your group members would be putting off an incoming to play gem, then you need to seriously re-examine their competence. that is SUCH an extremeexample that is ridiculous. like someone is going to let team maytes die to stack gems.<P> maybe the people YOU group with, but not MY guild mates. i bet the people you group with are real proud of you right now, you just basically called them all stupid, i hope they all see your post. Same to the guy who posted first one to play gem in his group gets kicked out-<P> What if they all want to do and kick YOU out, big guy?<P> You hotshots who think you are in charge of everyone and everything in a group / guild / raid / game are  on some kind of control freak trip, whats up with that?<P> i think gems might be good for people to have something else to do during downtime than listen to your drivel, thats what i think.<P> and what about those hours long camps for rare spawns? leave one "on patrol" and rest can have something to do. if you don't like it, don't use it, but don't tell everyone else what value it has, thats not your decision to make, only your opinion.<P> you guys would complain if someone gave you a new car, about what color it was.<P>                  me        <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I personally would rather see card or dice games you can play against other players in bars, or anywhere (if you could bring the game with you).  You could make bets, and the like and it would be fun.  It would also add to roleplaying experience, having different cultures play different games, or have games be part of quests.<BR>(something that gems does not)<P>There are lots of role playing games that have mini games within them (look at all the rpg games that come from japan for consoles) but usually there is a in game reason for the game. (example: it is part of the combat system, or an NPC won't help you til you beat them at a certain game, or maybe you need to gamble for extra money for fare to the next area, etc)<P>The fact that they put a mini game in doesn't upset me.  In fact them putting a game in because they realize that there are some really boring aspects to the game doesn't upset me (which IMO is the wrong reason for a mini game).  I just really wish they'd consider maybe making a standing auto-med at 45 or something. I think it would be a better idea than the one they are thinking of providing. (I say thinking because its on test and not live yet)<P>Personally i think the whole sit and rest method leads to the boring downtime aspect of the game and I would rather see a more active resting period, maybe something like Diablo 2 where you gain mana back regardless of what you are doing.  This would of course encourage exploring and 'doing' a dungeon versus camping (something Verant should have thought about back way before beta, but hey its their first try), but the system is the way it is, and if the only solution for people who are bored is to give them a mini game that doesn't really 'fit' into the game then so be it.

</FONT><HR>"Only the person playing /gems sees it. It has nothing to do with whether or not you are roleplaying."<P>That I must reply to in the interests of game design, as an industry developer for over a decade now.<P>Every single caster in the game, which leaves out maybe 3 classes, has this available to them, in-game, in-environment, and if it goes live it will be in-conversation.  Just the existence of it on Test means that it has invaded the meta-game of EQ on these discussion boards, taking us further away from a cohesive fantasy environment.<P>The screen environment we play in has nice borders, class-specific graphics on our info screens, period costuming, and spells/effects with appropriate names.<P>The world we inhabit has swamps, deserts, mountains and forests populated by a wide variety of mythical and mundane beasts, castles and cities, caves and dungeons.<P>All elements should have purpose, and add to the fit-and-finish of the player experience.  Inconsistancy glares, tearing attention away from the experience and towards the ridiculous oversight or mistake.<P>When we see "Bait Masterson" and like-named in-game personalities it is a slap in the face that wakes us up from the pleasing fantasy of an exotic locale.<P>And now, to compensate for grievous and over-bearing down-time meditation wherein all casting classes must sit and stare at a book, we are given TETRIS.  A modern arcade game embedded directly into our experience of EQ.<P>A glaring, attention ripping artifice attempting to make up for extremely boring gameplay for low-level casters.<P>I always leave a suggestion, in an effort to be part of the solution and not yet-another-gripe-artist:<P>1- Make meditation separate from the spell book, which is used to inscribe or memorize new spells.<P>2- Disallow actions other than cancel-meditate selectively based on level.  eg. a lvl 5 caster can just sit, while a lvl 10 caster can visually check his inventory, and a lvl 35 finally can do all he can do now while sitting and auto-meditating.<P>3- Let people see what is going on, but tone-down the "sampling" of the world outside, dim the 3d part of the display, muffle the sounds, based on level.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;spicyChef, your argument is so lame it almost does not deserve a reply.&lt;&lt;<P>Naz, then why did you make such a flaming reply? haha.<P>Anyway, you miss the point completely Naz. I never said I was in groups with people that would do this, I used this as an example to make a point. I have no clue where you got the idea I grouped with people that would use this and not focus on the game. Sheesh. Talk about reading more than what was there.<P>Naz, you need to wake up a bit and look at the bigger picture, which is what I was attempting to show people. This in-game game will have a larger impact than some people realize, I fear. It will cause some people to focus on the in-game game when they should focus on EQ, not GEMS.  If I came across someone in a group I was in that was paying too much attention got GEMS, I'd boot them from the group or leave it in an instant. I don't need to have my time wasted by someone wasting their time.<P>Don't assume VI has to entertain you every moment, as they have failed with that in EQ itself and with GEMS have said to at least me, and I believe some others, that they are unwilling to fix that real issue.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You are giving mixed signals, and I think thats the problem most people see in it.<P>For me its not a matter of "dont knock it before you try it". I can see that the game would be fun, but its like giving an aspirin to a guy with his hand chopped off. By adding Gems you are admitting the medding and resting part of the game is boring (and would need some sort of distraction), but instead of fixing the problem you cover the symptom.<P>Anyways my 2 cents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Give an intern a low end graphics program and tell them to change the background colors, add stripes, a letter on top, something... oh, and thanks for the tab that lets me see what spells I have memmed, that one WAS helpful.<P>Jiksaw Puzl, 51 Channeler, Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I understand the desire to add a 'game within the game' it frightens me that Verant would spend so much time on something so trivial when there are more serious matters to be fixed.  <P>Rather than get into that list, may I ask if Verant has considered Bards in this game? As it is, bards must hit a key every 3 seconds in order to maintain a 'twist'.  Because of this, most bards (Who are supposed to be entertainers) are more quiet than any other class, out of necessity.  Now you add this game...&lt;shrugs&gt;.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064582-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064582-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064582-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064582&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064582&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
