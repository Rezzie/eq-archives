</FONT><HR>My role:  I keep everyone regenerating mana and swinging swords quickly.  I keep extra monsters sleeping so they don't demolish my friends.  I explore the world as a friend to all people, masking myself as a denizen of each city.  I craft lovely magical jewelry for friends and acquaintances.<P>Here are some changes I would very much like to see:<P><BR>1. Give us something to do when faced with monsters that are immune or nearly immune to magic-based spells.<P>Give our high level mez, blur and charm spells a lure resist or change the resist to a different element.  For the extremely high cost, I would like to see them stick better than the normal ones, at least in some situations.<P><BR>2. Remove tedium in buffing.<P>Change the Gift of Magic/Insight/Brilliance to a group spell at the same cost and increase the mana regeneration component enough so that it is noticeable (+1/2/4 instead of +0/1/2).<P>Where possible, increase buff durations (with a proportional change in casting cost).  In particular, make Boon of the Garou less tedious to cast.<P><BR>3. Make illusions more fun and useful.<P>Make illusions last through linkdeath.<P>Give us group elemental illusions for water breathing and levitation.  Illusions are a great way of granting controlled buffs, since a character can only be under the effects of one illusion at a time.  (I don't think group racial illusions are balanced because of faction considerations.)<P><BR>4. Fill out the enchantment aspect of the class.<P>Put in the rest of the mana vial spells and make some recipes using them.<P>Put a gem vendor in Freeport.<P><BR>5. Remove the bottleneck on the enchanter epic quest.<P>Make that Shissar Spirit spawn more often than once a week!<P><BR>6. Fix our single target stuns.<P>The Whirl line was effective.  It was too effective and needed to be brought into balance.  Instead it was gutted.  We went from having single target stuns that were better than anything any other class could provide to basically having none at all.  To interrupt spell casting when AE is not an option, I have to use my level 8 DD spell, Chaotic Feedback.<P>Perhaps the Whirl line could be modified to interrupt spellcasting for its duration but allow melee.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor Wrote:<BR>"And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems. But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun… spells that completely change the combat. Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<P>So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited. Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot. Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd control), and it adds a lot to the party. Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools."<P>So your saying at high levels enchanters are only buff dispensers.  We have no other skill but to clarity and haste other players... FUN.  While haste and mana regen are very, very effective tools they don't define the enchanter.  However Crowd Control does, and when you take away from us we become a useless class that can be logged on a second machine for buffs.<P>I honestly don't mind being useless at epic encounters, cause the majority of epic encounters require an enchanter to get to.  Its been like this since my mid-40's leading up to Naggy & Vox.  In Kunark enchanters are useful leading up to Trak & VS, going through lower sebilis without an enchanter = a pain or death.  Then we hit SoV where I'm useless from the beginning of the raid till the end other then casting two spells, clarity and haste.<P>Your reasoning that we are cutting the encounter in half is true... but it comes at a cost.  If a MoB can only be mez'ed by a spell that costs 425 mana, only lasts for 30 seconds and has a 30 second recast then you are still really limiting how effective an enchanter is at reducing the encounter by 1/2.  (say the fight lasts 3 minutes, it will cost me 6*425mana to keep the second mez'ed for that long, probably close to a full bar of mana... the next encounter I'll be limited because I can't med all that back fast enough, but at least I will be able to do SOMETHING).<P>I don't want to be a buff whore at level 60, it isn't why I choose an enchanter.  I want to make impossible situations possible, but I can't do that anymore.  Our new stratedgy on crowd control is stick an extra warrior with defense up on the extra mobs and have a cleric CH him while everyone else is on the main target.  Thus I've started a warrior twink so I can once again be the master of crowds.<P>Gaza Jetamio - Level 60 "buff dispenser"<BR>Element of Darkness - www.elementofdarkness.com<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. change Giant Mezable by Kintar, with same level limit as other mob.<BR>2. Fix Memory Flux (lv55) This spell took 350 mana to cast, yet it still gets resisted. Memory Blur (lv12) 40 mana, works better than the lv 55 one, also both spells doesn't display any resist message if it got resisted.<BR>3. Enhance the Trepidation (lv56), again it costs more mana, yet it doesn't work as good as lower lv series of similar spells.<BR>4. Umbra (lv57), Same AC as Shadow (lv49) only longer duration.<BR>5. Enhance the Gift of Insight/Brillance, It only adds 100~150 mana, By up it to between 300 ~ 400 mana might match with cleric/shaman's buff? maybe adds some hp or ac?<BR>6. Reduce the aggro on RUNE IV/V? by buffing this at a fellow tank friend while he/she attacking a mob, would just cause the mob to start bashing at you.<BR>7. Fix Chrisma against npc pricing ratio, currently anything above 140~160 consider the same to npc either buying or selling. Isn't stats caps at 200?<P><BR>Thanks for reading..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am very pleased with being an enchanter.  I consider us the most balanced of the classes out there.  We are fun to play and quite powerful.<P>One thing I would like you to consider.  Playing an enchanter requires that you play it very well.  Its a very unforgiving class.  I have read a few posts that mention we might get nerfed.  I really don't see the need.  Noone appears to complain about enchanters.  Other classes seem to be envious of some of our abilities but on the whole Enchanters are happy with themselves and another classes are happy with us too.  A nerf would only balance us in the sense of making us as unhappy as many of the others.  Let us be.  Don't forget we've been nerfed quite a few times already and even once totally by accident (Dagger delay nerf for necros. It was overlooked that it effected Chanters pets too)<P>There are a great many good suggestions on this post already and for once I find myself with very little to complain about.  Am quite happy with my class.<P>My few suggestions for improvements though.<P>1.  Whirl-till-you-Hurl was too powerful in the beginning.  Now its too weak.  All I see that needs to be done is stop other stuns from breaking it.  Its an 8 second stun that is broken immediatly by other stuns.  I don't see a good roleplaying or gameplay reason for this.  A 3 second stun shouldn't be able to "cure" a target of an 8 second stun.  Same goes for Dizzying Draught but also with a slight mana reduction.<P>I know that these spells were mentioned before and are on the list but I didn't see my particular argument put forward.  I apologise in advance if I just missed it.<P>2.  Is there a reason why enchanters still have to carry around 1hs weapons to get their animations to dual wield.  I know their not a pet class but even Shadowknight pets don't have to be given a 1hs weapon.  We conjure an animation from tiny daggers yet it can't dual wield on its own.  If there is a good reason, well ok.  I just question it.  Seems like purely a frustration factor.<P>3.  As I mentioned before, I do know that enchanters are not meant to be a pet class but from reading the posts you may notice that most of us LOVE our pets.  Whether were supposed to or not.  I am not yet level 55 to comment on our level 55 pet but I understand that other classes have had issues with thier 55 pets not really being an upgrade.  I would like our 55 pet to be looked at to make sure its as adored by us at that level as our 49 level pet is now.  If not possible at least make it be seen as a "true" upgrade.  Something to be worthy of the extra mana/time cost.  <P>4.  An animation is a sword and shield.  It can't bleed.  It also has no life on its own.   As such, I totally agree with it having fewer hitpoints then most other "pets".  Shouldn't it have a slightly higher AC though?<P>Great Job btw.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i like boon of the garou and would like to see it extended as a line of spells allowing us to use illusions as a way of buffing groupmates.  if nothing else, add illusions to some of our current higher level buffs.  this would truly make us masters of illusion.<P>as i understand it, necros and bards have spells that let them mez the creatures we can't.  unless it's undead, a necro shouldnt be able to mez anything i cannot.  as far as bards, i don't mind them as much since music does soothe the savage beast.<P>considering it took almost 30 more levels to get it, i would have expected collaboration to be a little bit better than benevolence than it is.<P>lower the recast times and/or mana cost of some of the buffs we cast slightly, or increase their duration slightly.<P>a spell that lets us give mana to others would help, too, if it doesn't infringe on the necro spell.<P>we have been told countless times that we aren't a pet class, so i don't buy pet spells, so i don't have any idea what could or couldn't help them.<P>overall, i think enchanters have always been the most balanced class in the game.  there are a lot of things that could be added to increase the fun aspect (instead of our fear just being a clone of the necro version, have it transform us into something fearsome), but overall i am quite happy with how things are for me.<P>thanks for adding these balancing idea forums and giving us a chance to speak.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor wrote:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, so a mez that will work on stuff that can't be mezzed now, but costs so much (or has a long recast) that you will NOT be able to chain cast it to keep more than, say, one mob of this type mezzed? I know that's not exactly your suggestion, but something of that type might work… It would have to be a 53+ level spell, and even so I see a problem with this spell in the old world, with encounters like Vox… So I dunno. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>We aren't asking for mez spells that work on monsters that are flagged as unmezzable.  Lady Vox cannot be mezzed.  Nor can most giants.  That class of spell simply does not work on them.<P>We are asking for mez spells that work on monsters that have extremely high magic resistance.<P>Current high level mez spells:<BR>Level 49: Dazzle, cost 125, duration 96 secs, recast 5 secs<BR>Level 54: Glamour of Kintaz, cost 275, duration 30 secs, recast 2 secs<BR>Level 59: Rapture, cost 425, duration 24 secs, recast 24 secs<P>The level 59 spell, Rapture, is as resistable as any of our other mez spells.  There is absolutely no reason to use it.  If it held on creatures that were functionally immune to magic but not unmezzable, at least level 59 and 60 enchanters would have something to do in Velious.<P>I would like to see Enchanters get a role in Velious before level 59, but any improvement in the situation would be appreciated.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Educate me on this. Can't you just click the illusion off? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>You can click off an illusion you cast on yourself as a spell, but not an illusion cast on you by an object or by someone else.  The only exception is the druid wolf form illusions which can be clicked off because it contains a movement component.<P>It would be nice if people could click off illusions regardless of the source, since they can be a blessing or a curse.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'm correct on how mez works (and you all know I might not be), there are just some monsters with a really high resist to it. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>You are not correct on how mez works.  There are monsters that are flagged as not mezzable and monsters that cannot be mezzed by particular spells.  It is not simply a case of high resistance.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>Boon of the Garou:<P>Currently, this spell lasts 6 minutes with a 3 minute recast time.  Recasting the spell every six minutes is very annoying.  Losing a spell slot so that you can have that spell recharging all the time is also annoying.  Making it a half hour spell with a 15 minute recast time would not really solve the problem, because that initial recast time would be terribly annoying to overcome when you decided you wanted to start using it.  At the moment, you can only cast it on group members, so that functionally limits the number of people you will cast it on.  <P>Why not just get rid of the recast time, make it last 15 minutes, and let it be limited by the group-only provision.  Nobody is going to want to juggle groups every 15 minutes just to keep a buff up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, so the reason you won't impliment a mimic monster illusion is because it would be to complex to factor in all the faction changes that would take place along with assigning mob related abilties... So, make it to where you target the mob, cast the spell, assume the shape of the mob with no mob related abilities (or maybe a generic set based off the mob class [I.E. undead, summoned, animal and etc.]) then have the faction change work exactly like the alliance line of spells...<P>Also, a secondary Tash like the spell malo would be nice...

</FONT><HR>Another annoying bug I forgot to mention in PvP is the following about splurt and illusions stacking:<P>If you have any illusion on, and get splurted, there *is* no splurt icon while the spell itself does take hold. The normal illusion icon is the same as the one from splurt and if you dispel it (there is only one icon and not 2 like there should be) only your illusion fades, but not the splurt. If you zone instead the icon is gone and you cant dispel splurt either.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*******New Solutions********<P>Ok, I've read all 7 pages of this thread.  I'm going to attempt to propose some new solutions to problems I've seen repeatedly mentioned.<P>---<P>Problem #1: Enchanters take as much if not more damage than Warriors in many fights.  Why?  Two reasons:  Tashani line taunts better than anything else in the game and Enchanters lack AC.<P>Solution to #1: A spell that lowers magic resistance (Tashani) as well as reduces aggro (Mem Blur).  Combine the two in one spell.<P>Solution to #1: Change Umbra to be a self only buff, and seriously increase it's AC.  Say 100 AC self only.  Following the Shadow theme, the Enchanter would be twisting the reality around him to appear as if not there, therefore increasing his AC by such dramatic numbers.<P>Problem #1a: Whoever designed the 55+ spells is high on something.  The Tashani series is the biggest taunt in the game.  I can easily pull any mob off any party member by casting Tashania on it.  So why would I want an AE version of this (Wind of Tashani).  So that every mob in an area would jump on me? I don't think so.<P>Solution #1a: Reduce taunt/aggro of Tashani line. (mentioned before)<P>Problem #2: The clickable spells on Enchanter items are useless.  I've seen druids, shamans, and clerics all loot items which seriously improved their gaming experience.  Example - Elder Spiritist Bracer - It casts snare.  Snare of all things.  But if you've played a druid, you know that one of the major things you add to a group is snaring mobs.  Having this item, just freed up a spell slot, and Enchanters are in my honest opinion, hurting for spell slots as much if not worse than any other class.<P>Solution to #2:  Give us a clickable item with Tashania, Mem Blur, Color Skew, Clarity 2, or Group Mana Resist on it.  These are the spells we always have loaded.  These are some of the spells we have to cast repeatedly in a group.  Every other class seems to get items which make their gaming experience more enjoyable.  We get Rune 4, and Invis.  These are not spells I'm casting 20 times in a 4 hour dungeon romp.<P>Problem #3: A mob is mezzed, the enchanter knows that mez is going to break in 2 seconds, so he casts an 8 second AE stun(Color Skew).  When mez breaks the Color Skew timer also expires. i.e. Color Skew only lasts 2 seconds instead of 8.  Or realistically it does nothing, cause mez was still in effect for those 2 seconds.<P>Solution to #3: Make Enchanter AE stuns stack with mez.  It was mentioned previously that this was probably a bug, yet it has not been fixed.  Considering the long recast time on these AE stuns, it can be devestating to the Enchanter and the whole party if the timing is missed.<P>Solution to #3: Make single target mez overwrite AE mez.  (Yes this was suggested before, but this needs to be addressed and it can be adddressed either way.)<P>Other than these suggestions, I recommend you go back to page 1 and read the post by Mezzmo.  He summed up the rest of my feelings.<P>Thanks,<P>Helter<BR>55 Enchanter of Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry if im reposting stuff others have stated allready, this thread is very long  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1. Umbra, AC change from the lower spell is little to none, ENCHANTERS needs more AC.<BR>increase the AC to 30 and up the mana a bit even if you have to make it self only. WE get beat on a lot!!! <P>2. Group Clarity is a wasted spell, we get it at 52 and then get C2 at 54. Plese lower group clarity to 44th level to it can be used. There is no reason for this buff to be 52 level. Group C2 is just fine at 58th.<P>3. Id like to see a GROUP speed spells. It doesnt have to be the BEST of our speed spells made into a group buff. Maybe group AQ at 60th.<P>4. Compare the benifits of the gift series to the 60th spells from clerics and shamans, we got shorted. Increase the mana or replace the need to cast clarity2 by adding the regen of clarity2 to the effect of brilliance thus lessening the number of buffs we cast. This spell shud be one of our uber buffs, as is its not even desired. (nor the 2 lower level ones)<P>5. Increase the duration of Clarity2!!!! Why is this spells duration so short for a 54th and 58th level spell? Look at how long other classes buffs last at these levels, some of them are upto near 2 hours, give us an hour at least please. This will help reduce the amount of time we spend buffing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> PLEASE PLEAE PLEASE extend this duration.<P>**PLEASE AT LEAST ADD NUMBER 5 TO THE LIST to be looked at  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">**<P>6. Please dont balance us by adding some illusions. They are nice but wont address balancing.<P>7. This is an idea for helping ease the burden of mobs being super magic resistant. Seperate the mez and charm type spells from saving vs MAGIC. Creat a new category SV MIND. This will allow VI to keep certain mobs immune to charms and mez but allow OTHER casters and enchanters to perhaps land a spell on the uber RM mobs. This could also help enchanters on the PVP servers. <P>Another way to do this is to add or subract a percentage of a mobs(PC) RM save to the save vs "mind" type spells. This would not require a new category of saves. Doing this would allow VI to adjust some mobs RM but keep the "mind" spells from ruining an encounter.<P>thanks<P>oh PS **PLEASE AT LEAST ADD NUMBER 5 TO THE LIST to be looked at  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">**<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>More Stuff<P>NEW spell idea: Is it possible to whipe spells memorized by a player or a mob with a spell? That would be a very useful spell in both PvE and PvP.<P>Direct Damage spells should be Alteration. How enchanter spells work is that it alters the mind to hurt the victim. With this should cause a debuff. When you alter or damage someones mind, there would be side effects. Such as lower INT or WIS.<P>Minor Illusion: No one should be KoS under this illusion. Who would ever attack a camp fire? I don't care how dumb the monster is. But with this, monsters ability to see through illusions should be added (like see invisibility).<P>See Illusion? Enchanters should get a spell that allows them to see through someones illusion. It would be very helpful in PvP.<P>[quote]Right now, I'm not looking at PvP issues. I'm certainly in agreement that there are plenty of issues. But I think we need to look at making the standard game as balanced as we can before moving to the PvP stuff. So, please, hang onto these ideas and give them back to me later.[/quote]<P>We better have a class PVP chat soon.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just want to point out a few bugs I encountered.<P>1. The faction improvement line of spell seems to be bugged in some cases that it will not improve the faction even if you are not kos with them. For example, last time I checked, the faction improvement spell does not work on the froglok NPC which gives out the charasis key quest(swamp of no hope) and the merchant right across the banker in Rivervale. Of course, there are more cases which I just can't recall at the moment.<P>2. The bind sight series of spell will show the bind sight target running into walls or trees if they roams around , and it freeze the frame till you click off the spell, which can get really annoying.<P>Some improvement that might help make the life easier for enchanter..<P>1. Please let the illusions stay on when going Link dead and camping out. As it is currently designed, LD while in hostile city/zone would equal instant death upon relogging.<P>2. Please consider adding some group version spells of the earlier single target spells at higher level. We currently only have two clarity group spells and group resist magic? Please consider adding those spells to lessen the tediousness of repeating buffs. (ex: group invis/see invis, group augment, group rune, group illusion? )<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When SoV came out, I almost quit eq out of anger. Changed our role from being fun to being quite boring due to some of the mobs being unmezable. Fortunately I've found a good guild to join and have fun with and thats mainly why i'm still playing this game. When RoK came out, it actually made this game fun. I Enjoyed chardok because there was nothing there that I could mez except for the obvious high level mobs (Korocust...etc) and I enjoyed pulls of 5+ mobs - it made it fun.<P>One thing about illusions. When enchanters asked for spectre illusions you said that we werent supposed to have undead illusions. *cough*skeleton illusion*cough* I hope you get it. At least make a random illusion spell that would pick a random mob in the zone to turn to and make it so it gives us around 10 mr or something as one of its stats, or give another tic of mana regeneration. since illusions are self only and we can not give mana in any way - except if we cast berz str on shamans - then it wont be a balance issuie<P>I've also heard that Necromancers get a focus item similar ones to the Shovel of Ponz. I think Enchanters should get an item that is similar to that. I got my level 55 pet spell when I was level 54 and I was pretty damn happy until I turned 55 and after 10 summons I got a blue pet. Now that I'm 56, I tried and I tried to get a blue pet but obviously that isnt possible. On another note, how come necromancers need one bone chip to summon their pet and we require 3 daggers? Thats obviously not a balance issue, thats just plain annoying.<P>I'm glad that you guys brought this discussion up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm shocked that so many people mentioned fluff like illusions and nobody mentioned the fact that many many many enchanter debuffs/buffs have HUGE taunts.  I don't have a problem with enchanter buff/debuffs having large taunts because that's sort of a class defining thing that an enchanter has to learn to govern HOWEVER it is sometimes pretty rediculous.  In order to not get beat on by a mob an enchanter sometimes has to wait till a monster is half health to get three debuffs cast on the mob.  Or my favorite lately is we had a bunch of ppl fighting a 100% MR mob.  I knew I couldn't slow/tash/weaken/etc so I waited a minute while the melees beat on the mob and then cast Rune 3 on one of the melees AND the mob instantly jumped on me and killed me in 5 seconds or less.  Rune 3 does not heal hardly anything and I thought this very rediculous.  In some cases it seems to vary by mob how much the taunt is but usually when it varies by mob it's just that a particular mob doesn't agro as much.  In general I enchanter debuffs/buffs have WAY too much taunt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<BR>60 enchanter here. Actually I think the enc class is very ballanced and has almost no real weakness. I think illusions are fun to toy around but are not cruical to the class. Same for the pet. No high enchanter is using a pet anyways and the non-controllable pet is a good idea to go along with charm.<BR>Still there is one thing I am concerned about.<BR>It is Rapture. This spell costs a TON of mana and does NOT last long and I have not found any use for it yet. There is a simple rule of thumb.<BR>Everything above lvl 55 requires Glamor of Kinatz (GoK). If GoK does NOT stick Rapture will not stick either.<BR>To my understanding Rapture is a mez spell that works on everything that is SUPER hard but I always get the message: This NPC cannot be mesmerized (with this spell). What is this?<BR>Either Rapture has to work on everything with the exception of boss mobs, gods and named dragons or we can forget it.<BR>My only suggestion to save the spell as it is would be a 1 or 1.5 sec casting time. Otherwise I se NO advantage for casting Rapture over GoK.<P>Shandrax Illuminis (60 enc Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Quite often (although I don't mem mem blur much anymore because it has proved so ineffective) I have to cast it three or four times to blur the target and probably in fact it's that tanks finally taunting it off me and not that the mem blur ever worked.  Mem blur is one of the class defining spells I think and certainly an important crowd control spell.

The AC is not out of line with other enchanter armor but it just seems weird that they would be wearable by a class that wouldn't wear them but not by the class that would.  I think it was belts that really brought this to my attention.

</FONT><HR>Wondrous Rapidity takes way too much mana.  When on some type of raid requiring 3-4 groups people basically have to live without this buff because to buff 10 melees/pets with this takes 100% of an enchanters mana at lvl 58 which leaves no room for crowd control.  Would it be possible to either get a group version of this spell or decrease the mana cost?  You all say that EVERY enchanter is NOT supposed to get their epic weapon but because of the cost of the speed line of spells you pretty much force high level enchanters to get the epic otherwise group members have to live a lot of the time without a significant increase in speed so that the enchanter still has mana for crowd control.  I'm not mentioning the fact that debuffs take huge amounts of mana because more often than not I don't debuff (other than to slow if a shaman isn't available) because of the HUGE taunt factor already mentioned.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I forgot to mention something....PvP.<BR>When you DoT yourself with a low level spell no enchanter can ever mez you. Awesome.<BR>Now consider this...when you try to melee yourself you get a message 'try to do something more productive'. When you nuke/DoT yourself there is no such message. This allows the PvP exploit.<BR>I find the idea that newbies can nuke themselves pretty funny, but how often does it happen? Once or twice..that's it. It is time to remove that idiotic feature and give the same message 'try to do something more effective' .. at least that way this PvP-exploit has been removed.<BR>Next issue: Save magic. When I boost my save magic to something like 120 I cannot be hit by enchanters anymore. Why? In PvP skills should play a major role and not a plat jacinth wedding ring.<BR>Everyone with no skills at all could beat a lvl 60 enchanter by just putting on some items. This is wrong. I can only point out the mistake since my suggestion to fix the problem might not be welcome with everyone. I suggest this: In duels there should be a spell resist of 50% MAX. That means AT LEAST every second spell will hit even with max save magic. Once again...this should count only for PvP/duels.<P>Shandrax Illuminis (60 enc Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm...am I the last religious enchantress in all Norrath?<P>Ok, you said you were against the mask faith idea because everyone should pay the price for religion.  Uhm, what are we getting out of it?<P>Lets see...I have the exact same faction as an agnostic enchantress (have one of those too for comparison).  I have no specific items (I did not choose Tunare, but Erollissi Marr).<P>BUT, I have died 3 times to in Neriak despite never going to Crushbone specifically to protect that faction.  Invis dropped and Illusion Dark Elf + Benevolence wasn't good enough....about 4 bubs of yellow exp lost over that....<P>FIVE times the trolls have gotten mad at me at bad times...even throu illusion troll....One of those deaths was 2.5 yellow bubs of exp (yes I /petitioned, no it did not help..."EXP loss is part of the game," I was told). So All in all, I have LOST about two levels because of my religion that has done NOTHING ZIP NADA for me.<P>Now, the ONE time I accidentally stroll up to a high elf guard in FV in elemental form, can HE see my religion and say "She's part of the team boys.  Let her through."  <P>Not exactly.  So What EXACTLY is the benifit of my faith that I have paid 2 LEVELS of EXP for (at least one of which was post 40 level)?  Tell me what it is and let me dicide if its worth it.  No one cares if I try to role play it....most don't even notice.<P>The only differences I see between me and other high elfin enchanters is 1) I die in Neriak and Grobb while they walk freely, and 2) I lose more exp on any death than they do (or at least did until 46).

</FONT><HR>At the very least I'd like to see us given the ability to make non-magic weapons magic. Stick a weapon and a vial of viscous mana in our tome of endless enchantments and click combine. If we fail the weapon is returned but not the vial if we succeed the weaponis now magic.<P>Now, to augment this, I'd like to see a series of procs we can cast on those in our group.<P>Either doing damage or a spell effect. Preferably the spell effect.<P>lvl 16 color flux or 4 dmg <P>lvl 24 languid pace or 8 dmg  <P>lvl 34 Mem blur or 20 dmg<P>lvl 44 Curse of the simple mind or 25 dmg<P>lvl 50 two at this lvl. <BR>Insipid weakness or 30 dmg and Disempower or 30 dmg<P>No spells listed that do damage mainly debuffs. Although color flux is a short duration PB AE stun with range about melee distance, and mem blur is a hate list begone spell. And we all know what invigor does.<P>I'd love the ability to *really* enchant weapons adding procs and +stats and clickable effects etc etc ad nauseum.  But a line of procs we can cast on group members would be better then nothing. In fact better then what we have right now. <P>When I started an enchanter I thought "This is great! I'm gonna be able to enchant weapons and armor!"... I was suprised. With this line of procs we can have some of that enchanting back. <P>I thought a lot about the spells and the levels. I think I have it balanced pretty well. Originally, I had 8 as the first lvl but realized that was much too low. Had membur too low lvl b/c people could exploit it to KS. Sorry I "accidentally" proc'd. So moved it up to where it's not an automatic stick and where casters tend to be aggroed on a lot and killed.<P>Nothing here is overpowering. The damage is trivial at the lvl suggested. The spell effects not unbalancing. The only one that might be is the stun in which case switch it to shallow breath our lvl 1 DoT. It does minor dmg +STR and AGI debuff. Short duration.<P>I'm interested in what everyone has to say.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This from Absor bothered me a lot and I believe this is *the* number one problem facing enchanters currently:<P>&lt;&lt;"And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems. But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun… spells that completely change the combat. Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters."&gt;&gt;<P>Yes, and no.  It is totally understandable that certain classes or idividual type critters be immune to mez, and if this were the case I don't believe enchanters would be so concerned.<P>However, Absor, I feel you are overlooking two very large items.<P>1) Many non-sooper critters contain this high resistance to magic.  From critters in Sirens grotto (Coldspine seahorses) who are only slightly more resistant than the equilvent mob to the Icepaw Kobalds in Velks Labby who, if a level 60 mage malos and I manage to live through tashing them I *might* get a mezz to stick.<P>As it was mentioned, from beginning to end of any highlevel activity in Velious, enchanters are simply buff despensers.  Or enchanter, as the case may be since Lag and the need for more useful raid members typically leaves a spot for only ONE enchanter, who can adequeately maintain buffs on the entire raid.<P>2) By making critters highly magic resistant Verant has invalidated every spell line that we have access to except for 3.  Haste, Clarity, and occasionally Rune.<P>Now I don't think anyone will argue that these spells aren't beneficial, infact at least one enchanter will always be welcome in a group/raid because of these spells.  However what about the other 10 spell lines that we *do* have?  They become useless in velious.<P>However I think you are terribly downplaying the moral effect of having such a demeaning and inactive role in situations that on the other two continents would at least have the enchanter doing some sort of activity till the very end when we got to the big wumpas.<P>We are not solo'ers trying to find a new nitch because we discovered that our old nitch wasn't as lucritive xp or loot wise.  We are a class that fought kicking and screaming for 50+ levels so that we could adequately discharge our responsibilities in a rather narrow nitch to begin with.<P>It may be an ego thing, fine if thats what you wish to believe, but I spent 55 levels moving in and out of combat, backing up clerics with timely stuns and mezzes... flowing and moving.<P>Now Verant has essensially told me to sit down, shut up, buff my two good buffs, and make sure I am out of the way so that the real people can get on with day to day fighting... not epics, or dragons, or named critters, just your regular day to day fighting.<P>Velious nurfed the enchanter so much that most of the enchanters I know have either started a pure melee or a cleric, or refuse to go to velious at all.<P>The only other thing that I could wish for:  Decent equipment with a unique look, useful stats, and useful effects.  The insidious robe was that piece once (before the model got farmed out for every damn robe that VI made, even cloning it with the Ishava).<P>As people have mentioned, every other class gets surefire upgrades to their playing experience when they get their right click gear.  They either gain an ability that is really useful for them (warriors), they gain an ability that allows them to free up a frequently used spell slot (Druids, Shammys), or they get their class defining ability (ala' clerics).<P>Enchanter gear falls into none of these three catagories, the buff on the robe is third rate (as expensive as its grown up rune 5, yet not competitive cost/effect wise with Rune 3).  Please make this Rune 3 with 10 second cast time or Rune 5 with the current cast time.<P>Clairty on leggings?  This is a terrible joke, there is no situation that I can think of where I would cast C1 on someone, unless they were too low a level to be able to be buffed with C2 (which is rare in the areas I tend to be in).  Please change this to C2.<P>Reclaim energy on a bracer?  This is contrary to the idea that we are a pet class.  Indeed I have not once cast my 55th level pet.  This is a chance to save me a dearly needed buff slot.  Put a 8 second casting Tash on this thing instead.  I can start casting it and by the time it finishes it might be taunted enough that it won't shred me right away.<P>Invis on the shoes? Actually I kind of like this one, except for one thing:  I balance a lot of my gear based on having Golden efreeti boots which I don't forsee myself forsaking anytime soon.  In the time it takes to switch these out for the slippers I might as well gone and memed the faster casting version.  I'd say halve the casting time on these, but otherwise no changes.<P>In closing, I don't want this to get sidetracked by cosmetic issues that don't really effect the class balance (Illusions) though I think a lot of the ideas are great.<P>I prefer to address what seem to be obvious issues in balance, specifically the (unintentional, I hope) obsolesence of ~12 of our ~15 spell lines when it comes to operating in Velious due to extrodiaraly liberal application of Extreme MR and flat out mob immunity to our CORE spell lines of Mez and charm.  As beneficial as buffing is, it is NOT the core of the class.<P>Enchanters don't want their role to change, they want to be able to effect mobs in day to day romping at the cost of being a buff dispenser at the culmiation of big raids and being mediocre solo'ers.  They aren't asking for solo power or the ability to Mez an event mob... they are asking to be able to do what they were intended to do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to mention one thing.  Yes enchanters are pretty powerful between 30 and 50 and they greatly enhance a groups performance but why in the world do people insist on classifying them as "too powerful" hoping they will get nerfed?  Enchanters are very powerful for crowd control but you know what clerics are very powerful for healing.  I don't see anybody saying they are "too powerful".  Shamans are very powerful for buffing.  Necros are very powerful for dots and in fact have a large number of other class defining spells.  Magicians are very powerful for pets and damage shields.  etc. etc.  Just because a class is tuned for a particular role in EQ and does it well doesn't mean that they are "too powerful" and need to be "reduced" in power.  How come nobody ever complains and says clerics need to not heal so well?  Not that I'm saying that I'm just using it as an illustration.  Yes an enchanters ability to do crowd controll and in some cases buff/debuff makes them a desired element in a group but that doesn't mean they are "too powerful".  Does anybody REALLY want enchanters to be worse at crowd controll, buff/debuff?  Or are they just trying with reverse pyschology to get their own particular favorite class enhanced?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Like wise no other class should be aloud to cast Enchanter illusion even with the help of items and potions.

</FONT><HR>There is currently a bug with enchanter spells of low casting time, namely the Tashan series or Color Flux.  When casting either of those spells immediately after casting ANY other spell, as soon as the icon pops back up, it will go through the casting of the spell, but give the message "Spell recovery time not met," and the spell will not actually go off.<P>Now, as an enchanter, these are two spells that we REALLY need to be able to cast quickly, and having to wait a beat AFTER the icons come up (presumably when the spell SHOULD be ready) is sometimes deadly.

</FONT><HR>I've seen a few mentions about magic resistance in Velios and the incredible taunt on the Tash series of spells, but I have not seen anyone throw out the numbers yet.  I'm not including mana cost/cast time in the little blurb because all of these spells are incredibly mana friendly and have a low cast time.<BR>Here they are:<P>Level  Name       Reduce by<BR>4     Tashan          13<BR> <BR>20    Tashani         23<P>44    Tashania        33 (unresistable) <P>55  Wind of Tishani   23  (AoE)<P>60 Wind of Tishanian  40  (AoE)<P>Sixteen levels between the first and the second with a 10 point increase in maximum effectivness..<P>TWENTY FOUR levels between Tash2 and Tash3 with another 10 point increase in effectivness, along with a quest to get the spell.  The quest is really not that bad, any more than the Stien of Moggok is.<P>The next two spells in the series are AoE.  With the fast cast time on Tash3, I'd much rather target the mobs singly and gain 10 more points than do the AoE, try to mezz them before I am torn to shreds, and lose 10 points in the bargain.  Not that it matters, since I'm dead at this point, and waiting for the battle to be over and my Rezz to come through.  <P>side note: Enchanters spend a great deal of time running from mobs or sitting there getting beat on, hoping the taunt will leave them.  I am unsure if we are modeled after Rincewind in the Pratchett novels, or after a heavy duty punching bag.<P>The second AoE is better, since you get an upgrade to the ammount of resistance lowered, but it will not matter, since after you cast it you will be quickly slain anyhow.<P>I understand that Tashania was changed from its original form. I was not playing an enchanter when this happend, so I can't comment on what it was like before or how unbalancing it might have been.  However, waiting 24 levels for a 10 point increase strikes me as absurd. What we need here is an increase on Tashania's effectiveness. So WHAT if it is unresistable? How often is Tash resisted anyhow?  How much does it hurt our mana if we have to cast it again? Not much.  Granted, with the taunt factor the way it is currently, casting any of the tash series twice will most likely be painful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>&gt;&gt;So keep in mind that by taking a careful look at this class, I may very well be prompted to suggest a reduction in the power of something. This is just as important as the increase in power of things to maintain a balance. I'm not telling you<BR>that this is my intent, just letting you know that it could happen.&lt;&lt;<P>Please keep two facts in mind when you recommend any nerfs to enchanters.  You have said it yourself - (1) they are a *very* difficult class to play.  Juggling mezzes, buffs and debuffs is enormously tricky and potentially lethal leading to (2) enchanters suffer from one of if not *the* highest death rate in the game.  If you make us *less* powerful, we'll be taking this major penalty without the benefits.  One of the primary reasons for this is the incredible mega-taunts built in to practically every spell we have.  If you reduce the power, *please* at least reduce the aggro rates.<P>&gt;&gt;Oh, and I know you want to make magic items. I really, really know that. But doing that is a big task, and takes a lot of looking at. It's not really part of my goals for this, let's level the playing field, then we can look at magic items.&lt;&lt;<P>Please don't take this wrong, but what's the point in balancing a class now if you might add a new spell line later that can unbalance it?  I can almost hear it now further down the line, "we'd love to give you an enchant line, but we already balanced your class and this would tip the scales."<P>But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun… spells that completely change the combat. Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<P>So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited.&lt;&lt;<P>Well...no.  *All* Enchanter spells are vs. magic.  When we can't mez/charm/stun we can't nuke/debuff/dot either.  Even our less effective lines are resisted, so we can contribute in no way to the fight.  Every other class has an alternative line to use against mobs (clerics excepted), and you even *added* a new line for shamans in Velious (poison DDs) apparently to compensate for the high CR in the icelands.<P>&gt;&gt;Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot. Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd control), and it adds a lot to the party. Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools.&lt;&lt;<P>Please try to put this into perspective from the point of view of the enchanter.  By the time we hit level 50 we have the following spells we have used constantly throughout our careers - mez, charm, color line, slow, tash, choke line, DD line, clarity, haste/augment, fear, root.<P>So after having fought our way up to where there's supposed to be even greater challenges, now we're supposed to just clarity and augment.<P>Again, enchanters are hard to play, they die a lot...it's damned *hard* to level an enchanter as compared to many other classes (my warrior and my druid are taking me about half the play time to level since they don't die nearly as much)  <P>Our rewards at the pinnacle of our careers shouldn't be 'ah, now you get a much deserved break!  Kick back, watch TV, read a book, click on those two icons every now and then.'<P>It's not fun, Alan, and that's why folks play games. <P>&gt;&gt;Well, we'd have to look at the total power of stacking all those strength buffs, not just at the convenience of allowing them to stack. But I can add it to the list.&lt;&lt;<P>In case it hasn't been made clear, the big drawback to the rampage line is that when the 'ablative armour' aspect of it goes (which it goes very quickly), it takes the strength with it. <P>&gt;&gt;I am very much against the idea that we do anything further to dilute the classes. I, personally, won't endorse this idea. But I'll add it to the list.&lt;&lt;<P>I would just like to note as has been pointed out in other threads - every spell casting class besides clerics get some form or other of mana regen at some point in their careers. Two thirds of the spell casting classes have some way to heal themselves to some extent (clerics, shamans, druids, rangers, paladins, necros, shadowknights, bards).  I honestly don't think a small speed boost in wolf form is stepping on anyone's toes any more than the mana regenerative capabilities of druids and shamans step on enchanters or the healing abilities of necromances and shadowknights step on clerics.<P>&gt;&gt;Educate me on this. Can't you just click the illusion off?&lt;&lt;<P>Enchanters can, bards with a mask can't.  As the class being discussed &lt;g&gt;, I'm all for the illusions staying up when you cross zone lines.  I've been killed several times because someone trained a guard to the other side of the zone line and that illusion I only had up for five minutes suddenly vanished when I took that step through the tunnel.<P>&gt;&gt;If I'm correct on how mez works (and you all know I might not be), there are just some monsters with a really high resist to it. So it's not checking the same way as a undead only spell (though, somehow, that doesn't sound right, and I'll look into it).&lt;&lt;<P>Well...no.  There is the 'you cannot mez this beastie' message, not a resist message.  As has been pointed out, this is especially frustrating in places like The Hole where the same exact MOB is at times mezzable and other times not due to the level restrictions placed on spells.  I don't want a 'you can give it a shot, but his MR is *really* high' message, but rather a 'that mob is not mezzable' message *before* I throw my life away aggroing it for no reason &lt;g&gt;<P>&gt;&gt;Making the class hard to play by forcing the player to actually know what the heck he or she is doing has always made the good enchanter player much better than the bad enchanter player. With enchanters more so than nearly any other class (though it could be said of bards too).&lt;&lt;<P>Again, I just want to take this time to reiterate my first point - you *force* enchanters to have to play *better* than other classes by the way the spells are designed.  As a result, the *good* enchanter player is the more *powerful* enchanter, yet still also one of the most often killed characters.  Therein lies the key to balancing the class.<P>&gt;&gt;Ok, and your arguments have me convinced. It's not on the list anymore. Someone will have to show me where Forlove is wrong if it's going back on the list.&lt;&lt;<P>Only in the amount of mana given as compared to the level of buffs other classes get at the same level.<P>&gt;&gt;I think the initial idea was that the pet would stand between you and the nearest threat.&lt;&lt;<P>Actually, the enchanter pet always stands to the northwest of the character.  Why, I have no idea &lt;g&gt;<P>Lastly, as someone else brought up in regards to our later illusion (spirit wolf, werewolf), it would be nice if these illusions had some benefit to the enchanter.  Giving us self-only melee buffs as our last illusions is somewhat disappointing.  The higher level the illusion, the more *useful* it should be for the enchanter, not less.  Look at the bear form just added for the shaman - a wis buff.  I think one of the druid higher level wolf forms gives a level of mana regen (Form of the Howler?)<P>If/when higher level illusions are looked at or being given consideration to be added, please examine them in their usefulness to the enchanter.  Either more targetable illusions, new group illusions or self-only illusions with buffs that benefit the enchanter (mana boost, int buff, cha buff, etc)<P>Again, thanks for your time!<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Overall, I am very pleased with the way Enchanters are currently. I have only a few small suggestions.<P>1) Please allow Illusion: Iksar to work as other racial illusions do. I.E., faction adjustment, infravision, and regeneration (like Illusion: Troll). Without the faction adjustment, there is no real incentive to get this spell, other than from a 'fun' aspect. Fun is fine, but I think there should be some utility, here, too.<P>2) Please do NOT let illusions stick when zoning. If I am illusioned as a Dark Elf and wandering through Neriak, and I cast Gate to get out of there, I do not want to arrive at my bind point, say, right next to the guards in Felwithe, still wearing my Dark Elf illusion. Nor do I want to risk turning off my illusion prior to gating while still in Neriak.<P>3) Higher level Mezz spells should overwrite lower-level mezz spells. I.E. If I throw a Mesmerization and follow it up with an Enthrall, the Entrall should take the place of the Mesmerization.<P>Thanks for listening.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi there, here are my thoughts.<P>First, the most annoying aspect of being an enchanter: Spell recovery time not yet met.<BR>This message occurs ALL the time for me.  Every time I try to cast Color Flux or Tashania right after another spell (like a resisted Dazzle, or tashing a previous mob) the spell will not go through, and I get the message.  Then I have to cast it again.  If this is a way to stop chain casting, why does it only happen with fast casting spells?  I can't chain cast Color Flux with itself (recast time) and I could care less if I could chain cast Tashania.  <P>Secondly, the truly important issue is the lack of usefulness of high level mezzes.  I'm only 56, so I don't have experience with Rapture.  But I do know that Glamour of Kintaz is not very useful at all.  In nearly all cases, I use Dazzle (lvl 49 mez).  The advantage of Glamour of Kintaz is that it is a very fast cast time, instant recast, and somewhat lower resistance.  My complaint is that it costs WAY too much mana.  In raid situations where there are high level and tough mobs (Chardok palace, Plane of Hate, shrooms in Sebilis) there is always a big demand on mezzing.  In these situations speed and accuracy is critical and Glamour of Kintaz is very helpful in doing this.  However, after a few casts I'm finding myself low on mana.  Not only that, but the duration is very short, about half that of Dazzle.  There are three ways this can be improved. (one, two, or all three options enabled)<BR>1)	Lower mana cost<BR>2)	Lengthen duration<BR>3)	Make the line interchangeable.  For instance, allow me to get the mob mezzed with GoK but then refresh with Dazzle (I know, probably not possible)  <P>Thirdly, I think it's a shame that high level enchanters have no new illusions.  Let me start off by asking: what is the major unique stat that enchanters are concerned with? Charisma.  Looks are everything.  Our class is all about manipulating/affecting others in many different ways.  Every single aspect of our class is based on this, even our planar armor is named after a related idea (Insidious).  We all understand that illusions are hardly a part of class balance, but this game is about role-playing too.  Enchanters are "Illusionists" but recieve no new illusions when they get that title.  Phantasmists aren't really masters of the "phantom".  Illusions shouldn't stop at 44, there are too many other possibilities: Sarnak, Froglok, Goblin, Orc, Skorpikis, Ghosts, Drolvargs, etc, etc, etc.  The Epic Enchanter Quest involves 5 masters.  One is in a Sarnak illusion, another in a Skorpikis, and another is a Clockwork Guard!  I think it would be so cool to be able to do a flip every time I cast (froglok).  <P>Fourth, Rune.  You have no idea how many times the raid leaders say "Enchanters chain cast rune on Main Tank" and after the first cast, I'm dead.  Or I tash the mob, and I'm dead.  Tash I guess will always be a big taunt, but Rune, like Shrade mentioned, shouldn't be that angering.  After all, Enchanters have very limited abilities to affect big encounters DURING the battle except throwing in a few runes.  It already costs an arm and a leg (mana and plat), at least it could be a bit more useful.   <P>Lastly, I always wondered why lowering a mob’s stats is totally useless.  Cripple seems to be pointless in all but PvP situations.  Our DoT’s lower stats too, but are only useful for the damage.  Not likely this will be addressed, but thought it was worth mentioning.  <P>There are a few other issues, but I don’t think they’re very important: Lull/Wake of Tranquility, Spinning Spells, etc.  Hope some things are changed.<P>Senegar Imakikitsaz<BR>Level 56 Beguiler of Bertoxxulous     <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
