</FONT><HR>No Troll here bro. Just a fair observation.<P>Which your analogy is not.<P>Rangers receive alot of group useful abilities that I as a SK do not. No Sows, no DS, no heals, no tracking, snare over writes darkness and so on.<P>As neither of us are truly good tanks that means we work best in groups with warriors, and in that setting, based on damage and buffs, heals and utility a ranger already has us beat.<P>Rangers are already preferred in groups over SKs so your point is moot.<P>Not that I mind a Rangers superiority in groups. Fear is a nice trade off. Even if it doesnt really allow me to solo effectively post 40.<P>But tell me, what is the trade off for a shaman vs a druid who can kite 4 mobs at a time solo?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hardly moot. I see SK's taken in groups over rangers all the time. Rangers are literally the last choice for dungeon groups.<P>In any case, if you want to argue solo vs group power (which I believe is a very bad argument in a grouping game anyway) I can assure you that a shaman more than makes up for quad-kiting by having far superior straight-up soloing ability combined with cannibalize III. Quad kiting is a very situational technique that only works on mobs with rather low hitpoints.<P>Of course wizards and bards can quad kite too. Maybe we should give manasong to paladins and lures to the mages eh?<P>In any case looking at the test server it appears druids will be getting the better heals out of the two classes. Perfectly sensible as shamans already have Torpor and slow spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Shamen are not better soloers than druids -- and here's why: ports. Porting is really what makes the druid a great soloer, and a great grouper as well; if you can't find a group/good spot in zone a., port over to zone b. (this was really big pre-kunark when I played my druid and norrath was super crowded, but still counts). Evac makes a druid de facto more wanted in deep dungeon groups as well. My view of healing should be 1. Cleric 2. Shamen, a provisional substitute of cleric in most (say 80 percent) of situations 3. Druid -- healer who needs another healing partner to sub effectively for cleric. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, I would rate druids far better soloers than shamans.  A shaman may end up with more mana after the fight (via Cannibalize), but a druid will take far fewer hits due to snare's effectiveness.  And, of course, druids have the option to quad kite and port, which shaman do not have.<P>Now, as to whether druids or shaman should be the better healer/get the new heal spells, I see two lines of argument:<P>1) The role-play argument: Shamans are for the races that don't have clerics, and are the secondary healers of Norrath.<P>2) The game-play argument: Druids need something to help them get groups post-50; better healing would do this.  Also, shaman have Torpor.<P>I don't know that either argument is more "right" than the other.  It just depends on which argument you prefer (or, more realistically, which Verant prefers) in this case.  I play shaman but am still undecided on the issue.<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally there is one thing I've always wondered about... and that is why druids get spells that are destructive to nature. Aren't they supposed to be ONE with nature? so why do they have all the lightning, fire spells? Why do they have panic animal type spells? It seems to me when they designed this game they gave druids one too many sets of spells. In my opinion every casting class should have only 5 different type of spell classes they can use, a druid exceeds this way more than any other class. This to me is not balanced at all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*sigh*<BR>It's not about VI wanting to make druids into better healers than shamen. I'm sure they don't. VI's error from what I'm hearing is that Torpor is not as good as the new 60th druid spell. Look at Torpor instead of saying that VI is playing favorites to druids.<P>I do not think that shamen should have better healing than a druid. I have not heard a valid reason yet as to why druids shouldn't be healers yet many are saying that they shouldn't. VI is basing much of their class design on D&D whether they want to admit to it or not. In D&D, druids are healers and so are shamen. Shamen as the tribal healers are not as well trained because they are more primative. Druids are not as well trained in healing because they are primative. Do you see the similarity? The only philosophical difference is that shamen are the only healers in their respective societies while druids are secondary healers. Does this mean that shamen should be better healers than druids? No. Neither has the formal training that comes from the church and therefore will not be as good as their cleric brothers and sisters. There is no clear "leader" of the primative healers so why not make them equally capable? That's what VI has done pre-expansion, but like much of the post 50 game, things are slightly out of whack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Do you guys even play Everquest? Even with a heal that does 300 more only going to Druids, Shamans are still going to be the better healer.<P>Why? It's simple. Repeat after me, The ability of a Shaman to dramatically slow down a mob's damage dealing ability is what is key.<P>It means, the Shaman has to heal much less than the druid does. Damage shields do NOT come close to equaling the functinality of this line of spells. Which makes Shamans the better of the two by a far margin.<P>What's the point anyhow? 400 mana * 900 healing is still going to have the druid out of mana after full healing one tank. I don't see really how Verant has upgraded the classes here, the quick casting spell is semi useful for when the Cleric is trying to get a ch off but it doesn't heal much better than gheal. 300 points returned is useless at 55.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Surely someone at Verant was mis-informed (OR DRUNK AS HELL) when they designed non-cleric healing past 40.<P>Look at how many HP melee types have at 29. OK. That is when Shaman and Druids get Greater Healing.<P>Now fast forward to level 53. Now look at the HP the melee players have. Wow! Shaman and druids finally get a slightly better heal. Superior Heal.<P>BUZZZ! SOMETHING STINKS HERE!<P>Now, the changes on test have lowered Superior Heal TWO WHOLE LEVELS! I can just imagine that Verant was so happy about this that they gave the entire design team a week off in Hawaii.<P>Superior Heal for Shaman and Druids should be lowered to 44 not 51. Changing it to 51 is a complete and total joke. Then there should be something twice as good as Superior Healing at about 54-55 for both Shaman and druids.<P>As for Topors... The people saying thats a better heal have clearly never looked at what it really does.<P>TOPOR<BR>-----<BR>A) Overwrites any haste spells. (sorry enchanter)<BR>B) Snares the person its cast on for 2 mins. (better hope the next mob doesnt spawn)<BR>C) Does a bit of Healing like a DoT.<P>Why do people ignore A and B?<P>And why is it that when a Shaman finally gets a snare, its why up high in the 50s and its part of a so-called healing spell? <P>Topor is a joke. Players that experience it once ask you NOT to use it on them again. Enchanters HATE it. Their Haste spells cost them LOTS of mana, and for this thing to overwrite it pisses them off big time.<P>Removing Topor from the game, and replacing it with a good 1000 to 1500 point HEAL is what we need.<P>Why is Verant so damned insistant on down time? Snaring someone for a full 2 mins isnt even funny. Even if it is for the purpose of supposedly healing them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Laugh all you want, put a 60 druid in a group and a 60 shaman in another group. The Druid will go out of mana before the Shaman will.<P>Why? Because the Shaman's group will not be taking the same damage the Druid's group mates will.<P>Once again, a 900 point heal at level 60 for 400 mana isn't going to make a Druid or a Shaman a better healer. All you will end up with is still out of mana after full healing one tank, despite the whinings coming from the clerics.<P>What the support healers need is a ph or partial heal that heals 75 to 60 percent of a Tank's total health.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
