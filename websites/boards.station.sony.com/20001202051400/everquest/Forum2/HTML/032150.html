&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I was the first one wanting to back Verant on this...<P>and let me be the first to thank you...<P>We as customers really appreciated what you were trying to do in releasing the update for directX7 and all of the benefits that it was supposed to bring. I also was one of the first to not complain about the problems (mostly because I hadn’t experienced any problems... yet). I also thought that people would encounter problems and possibly that there might have been patch mistakes to accompany them. <P>When the patch was first announced and they began discussions about going to test and trying it out. I was one of the persons who DIDN’T go to test. Surely, I saw the posts the next day from those who had tested it and had problems, as well as those who saw minor enhancements. I assumed that the problems they had were just problems with their drivers, like the Verant reps said would remedy these situations. I seriously assumed that most of this would end up according to system configuration.<P>I figured that when it came time to fix the drivers that it would be something that I could handle. I also figured that I might not even require upgrading because most of my equipment is recent and exceeds the requirements for the game. I work for a Statewide Internet Service Provider in NJ, in tech support, so I know my way around a computer (and I work with the people who don’t). In my opinion this is something that most people WILL NOT be able to do this without the help of someone who knows what they are doing.  <P>When the patch for Dx7 finally arrived I of course checked to see whether I would need to upgrade and found that Dx7 was already in my machine, so I assumed that when I went to play everything should work just fine. I also saw all of the persons on the boards that were complaining, and again I assumed that these people would be the exceptions, and that most people wouldn’t have problems. Of course there are the people who won’t know what they are doing when it comes to drivers, and these would be the ones you’d expect to have problems, but I never thought this would apply to me. <P>When I got home from work, I first logged into game to see if I would indeed need to update my drivers. I downloaded the patch in about 4 minutes (cable modem) and then went into game to see how everything worked…  I was stunned, no visible graphic problems, the colors seemed brighter and the clipping plane seemed to be greatly increased… Wow, I won’t need to mess with the graphics card was all I could think. I heard there were sound problems, but my first impressions were that the graphics seemed fine..<P>I could hear the ambient sounds a little louder than usually, and most of them I hadn’t noticed previously so I figured these were improvements too. I also thought that my sound card drivers would be fine, seeing as there were no real problems here. Then I started playing the game, and this is when I realized there might be a problem. The ambient sounds were way louder than the rest of the sound effects (doors opening were quiet, combat was near muted but footsteps and background noises were too loud). Ok, so I have to look for new sound drivers.<P>So, I logged off for the day, and decided I would find the correct drivers at work the next day.<P>At work the next day, I saw all of the rants and flames on the board, and most of them were people who surely wouldn’t be able to fix their systems (on their own), or whose systems would need to be upgraded before they could get back into EQ.  I also spent ten minutes finding the correct drivers for my sound card, but discovered that most manufacturers don’t warranty the new drivers. Also, while looking for the drivers I had to accept a disclaimer for the generic driver from the sound card company that would work for my sound card. The disclaimer stated that any system problems that occurred as a result of the drivers was not the driver mfg’s fault, and also that the hardware company was responsible for the drivers (even though mine didn’t have the drivers available).<P>Now, again I assumed that this wouldn’t be a problem, because I knew what I was doing. I took the drivers home on a floppy, and then when I got home I checked to see if these drivers were updated from the ones I already had. Windows responded that it would continue using the drivers I already had, so the drivers were not actually updated. This meant I would have to deal with the sound problems, and I figured it could be a problem with the patch and maybe it was something that Verant would remedy. <P>Then I restarted my computer, and the real problems began…..  The OS detected new hardware when the machine restarted, and it continued trying to install the sound card repeatedly… It installed three new sound cards, before I finally got into the OS again. I went in and removed the extra sound cards, and now was not getting any sound at all… So I restarted again….  And it detected new hardware again, and kept installing it over and over, this time I got up to 5 installed before I did a manual shut down.…<P>This is where it gets really interesting…!! When the computer came back up from the manual restart it began installing the sound card again, and again….  It wouldn’t stop installing the sound card. I couldn’t even get to Windows this time, and it wouldn’t let me skip files or cancel out of the installations.  So now I can’t even get in to Windows, and it has installed at least 10 sound cards, and the last time I actually got into windows there was NO sound…. Basically, I’m screwed…<P>So I had to use my Restore CD to restore the Windows OS (non format), and also I had to re-install all of the hardware I’ve added to my machine. I had to re-install the drivers for EVERYTHING, not just the sound card and if it weren’t for my tech support background, I wouldn’t have been connected to the internet, I wouldn’t have known how to restore half of the system, and I probably would have SOL. I can’t even imagine the people who had a problem like this who have no idea what they’re doing, or even the ones that install the incorrect drivers and screw their OS. <P>Needless to say, after an hour of restoring the OS and the devices in my machine, then linking back into my cable modem (2 mins of settings), and then spending another hour downloading  Internet Explorer 5.5, then DirectX7, then drivers for the sound card and video card , I still had to download all the EQ patches since release…..  2 and a half hours after trying to update my drivers I was able to log back into EQ, and believe it or not the sound seemed better, but the ambient was still slightly louder than comat….<P>Now first, I do not blame Verant for this, but mostly blame Windows and their OS with its  problems. The fact that the only drivers available from the sound card mfg came with a disclaimer, should have tipped me off to what could potentially happen. The problem however is that most of the people without computer knowledge might have sound or video problems (God forbid they install the wrong drivers), which might result in OS problems, which can mean they won’t be connected to the internet.<P>This message is for them…. The people who can’t speak up about their problems (because they now can’t get on the internet)…. The people who are computer illiterate, the ones I help at my job, WILL definitely have had problems (if I did), and it was all because of this upgrade…. <P>The real question is why wasn’t this made optional?? <P>Verant upgrading this had a lot to do with the release of Scar of Velious, but still what about those who don’t want/need the upgrade yet? What about the uneducated that Verant has just left out to dry? <P>What about all the helpless tech support persons (like me) whose jobs you just made so much more difficult???<P>Well, I for one would like to thank Verant for helping me clean house on my system, and for leaving so many of your customers in the dark and maybe computerless. I hope that this doesn’t result in a worse customer service rep than the one you already have….<P>My only hope is that this upgrade will have broken the addiction that many of the d00d$ and powerlamers have with the game, so that I can enjoy Roleplaying once again (Role playing server?)…  <P>Bob<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Yes, there is a problem with some of the sounds on our end.  It's annoying, but relatively minor.  It makes the sound volumes screwy, so that close sounds might sound distant while distant soungs are close.<P>There is a potential temporary fix for this.  Crank up your Sound Level in game to maximum and then use your speaker to control the volume (external to the game).  We'll fix this thing soon.<P>I'm sorry about your traumatic experience, taobob.<P>But there is really no way to make an upgrade like this optional.  We'd have to duplicate EVERY server, leaving one with the old version and one with the new.  We know this change was dramatic, but it's a wonderful improvement.  Most people are seeing a great increase in framerate (due almost exclusively to the update for DirectX 7) and better graphics.  To keep EverQuest the best game out there, we needed to make this upgrade.<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bob<BR>Thanks for your information... however now what?<BR>I am one of those computer illiterates that you are feeling sorry for. <P>First I tried to update the drivers and found out that my system locked up. I ended up trying to fix it and then fixing the fixes till the whole system locked up. Not just once but twice. I took it in to Future shop to fix it, got it home and updated it again and it crashed all over again.  It cost me a couple of hundred dollars to have a professional at future shop format my system <BR>( twice ) and then started all over again. <BR>Today I went into the game and I am getting green black white and purple stripes lining NRO tunnel in East Commons and some players have the same design on their clothes and they are faceless. As well some of the NPCs in Freeport were doing that. I didn't encounter it anywhere else. I had just run from SK thru high pass and Kithicor Woods, thru west commons and then when I reached EC I was shocked to find all these carpet paintings of Orcs and stuff on the ground in EC and stripes in the tunnel. I zoned through to NRO and all was back to normal. I went to Freeport Bank and no problem till I went into the bank and it was strange indeed ...carpeting was strange and so were some players and npcs. Stone stairs  and stone tables and stuff. There were shiny wall panels and empty spaces of light.<BR>I headed back to E Gate and the inn by the gate and the inn at the docks is very high tech looking with stone walls and npcs that look like spacemen. Some have no faces.    This was on Cazic Thule.<BR>However, I was on one of the new servers earlier,<BR>Drinal or something like that, as my wood elf newbie in Kelethin and didnt notice anything different cept the new sounds of the wasps and bats.  The guard at the first lift however, ignored my attacker and let me die and let him go without a scratch... I thought that was a little strange.  After a while I decided to play a different character and server and found the stripes very unusual.   <P>THE BIG CONCERN NOW IS THIS:<P>I don't want to spend another $200 crashing the system trying to correct any driver problems. My Tech at Future Shop downloaded the drivers for me this time and burned a copy for me on CD. But I havent got a clue what to do next and am afraid to even try as I am on fixed income and my PC is more important than playing a game that doesnt care what happens to its clients. They are going to have to make it a lot more user friendly before I try to update drivers again !!!!And my account was just renewed on the 15th.  Nice scam Everquest !!!!<BR>HELP !!!!!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan <BR>I have had it updated by a professional and it still doesnt work. In fact I am holding the CD burned by him with the directx 7.a drivers right here in my hand. He claims he has already installed them.  So what is it...my 3dfx? I am terrified to update that one... Every time I do It crashes my system. I also have a Soundblaster sound card ( put it in just for EQ) as you can see I know absolutely nothing about nothing when it comes to computers. I can install a program and that is it...period. I will call tomorrow, but I am not planning on getting through. With all the problems everyone is having I dont expect to get a free line however I am willing to give it my best shot tomorrow. I really love the game and don't want to miss out. Was hoping to get the new addition for my daughter for Christmas. If I crash the computer one more time that is the last of my savings for Christmas money to repair it.<BR>This is serious. We don't even have Television.

</FONT><HR>While I agree I wouldn't take my computer to someone to install drivers for $200, I got to say that I have charged that much to do a resinstall on some computer equipment.<P>Often (unfortunately mor often than not) the problem lies so deep within your system that finding it without know the exact steps you took installing a new program, device, directx, or otherwise, can be quite difficult.<P>My unusually low rate of $35 per hour for this is about $15 - $20 less than industry standard.  Yet it still can climb over $200 to do a reinstall.  My advice to anyone is to write down each step they took, any errors or anomolies they saw while following the directions, or any hangups during each part of any new upgrade.  You'd be amazed at how much the little information can help in these situations.<P>I can only say that I have spent hours finding out what someone did to thier systems, when they supposedly followed directions to the letter and it didn't work.<P>If you don't have experience doing these things, and know how to troubleshoot them, write what you do down, so you can trace it back later.  It saves you time and money in the long run.<P>/rant off<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is a general purpose tip: Invest $50 or so in a copy of PowerQuest Drive Image 4.0 or Norton Ghost 2001.  Any time you do something major like adding new hardware or making serious driver updates, take an image of your Windows partition.  Should a serious error occur, simply boot from floppy and restore the image.  Voila!  Your computer is as good as new...er, as good as old, I guess?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As a side note, these can also be used to keep a "clean" Windows install image, for those of you who like to reinstall every so often.  A 5-minute restore is much faster than a 30+ minute reinstallation.  Also, I usually make a new image at every step in a new install on a new machine as well in case something goes wrong.<P>Skullcraft (using Drive Image 2.0)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Absor I disagree very strongly here.  This is not a minor issue, this is pretty big.  Sounds play a part of how we play, from the sound of a buff spell to a DD.  Most of us have most text messages off because of lag issues and use the sounds to assist in deciding what is going on.  I can tell a shaman is healing by the sound and know we need to stun, or maybe he is nuking and the warrior will save his slow refresh bash or the enchanter will not want to stun since it builds agro.<P>Also it is very disorienting, I stand right on a mob and can't hear a thing but I open a bag and am deafened.<P>Eryl Flynn Levle 51 Wood Elf Minstrel on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Feel a need to tell part of my story in support of this thread.<P>I'm pretty good when it comes to computers, I'm the local "tech support" for everybody around me and I've build and configured half a score of computers from scratch in my lifetime. I had DX 8 and all my latest drivers installed before the patch. OF course things when badly from start : millisecond pauses, crashes, sound problems etc..<P>Well never having let a computer problem stop me I sent out to fix this. Following my knowledge and suggestions on this board, I tried various combinations of DX 8 then 7 then back to 8 (which isnt easy to do) with all possible combinations of latest cutting edge drivers then old stable ones etc... I actually used this as an excuse to flush all my system and do a clean reinstall of the OS. Nothing seemed to fix EQ and in fact after the clean reinstall of everything with all the latest stable drivers my whole system became so unstable that i couldn't do anything for more than a couple of minutes wihtout crashing. This stopped me for about five hours before I luckyly remembered an obscure little patch for my motherboard chipset that stopped it form crashing when used with my video card. I had installed it about a year ago when I bought the video card but ad forgotten it. So system is stable again but EQ problem's persist. <BR>So having already eliminated all background progs I sent out to eliminate all IRQ sharing between my sound card, video card and ethernet card. That wasn't easy to do on a full PnP OS that insisted in putting the latter two in the same IRQ. Well that caused Win 98 to hang on trying to install the sound drivers. So I manually set on Bios the Irq for my PCI slots, after a couple of tries everything seems fine except the system now hangs every ten minutes or so. Somewhat disgusted I gave back control of the IRQ setting to the OS and...<BR>everything works fine...including EQ which is now running smooth as silk.<BR>The funny thing thing is that besides having my sound card in phisically different slot and having a few different IRQ settings (sound/video shared instead of sound/ethernet shared) I have exactly the same system config that i had before the patch.<P>So my heart really goes out to those amongst us that do not know how to switch drivers let alone fix IRQ settings. As for the patch...itlooks great now but I truly believe that more testing under different configs should have been done.<P>Just hoping not many people give up, everything can eventually be fixed in the wonderful world of Windows..and Verant, please release EQ2 for Linux too   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Laochei</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, taobob, sorry to hear of your troubles!  Makes me even gladder I didn't mess with anything!<P>I'm one of those people who's somewhere between Computer God and Mr. My-coffee-cup-holder-is-broken, so I really wasn't looking forward to slogging through a period of upgrades.  Fortunately, my vid was fine post-patch; only the sounds were screwy.<P>I did visit the upgrade download site for my soundcard, but the only upgrade there was a small fix for things totally unrelated to my system, so I didn't bother with it.  Glad I didn't, because now, after several days of telling us all that we were at fault, Verant has finally admitted it's a problem on THEIR end.  (Am I the only one who remembers this happening before?)<P>And I kinda have to disagree with Absor that it's a "minor" issue.  Two examples:<P>Sitting in SRo the other night, the only way I even knew that a suicidal madman was trying to jump me was when my pet chased him down in front of me and put him out of his misery.  Now, if I'd been a level 14 enchantress, I'd most likely have been dead.<P>Taking Hate later the same night, I was having a lot of lag issues and had to spend much of the time facing the wall in order to be able to cast in a timely fashion.  Couldn't see the action, therefore, and as a result of the sound issues, I blew a lot of my precious mana on unnecessary back-up heals simply because I couldn't always hear the primary healer casting.<P>Ah, well, let's hope this gets sorted out this week.  I feel for the people who've had to waste so much time and money trying to meet Verant's new system requirements.  (I appreciate their trying to improve our gaming experience, but I question their changing system requirements mid-stream, so to speak.  But that's a whole 'nother argument there.)<P>--Klutzee Lizziebait<BR>Ogress Shaman of 50 Things Yet to Learn<BR>Ascendant Council<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Legend_Weaver,<P>EverQuest uses your machine much more aggressively than those other programs.<P>I hate to sound like a broken record, but most of the problems we've seen have been fixed by updating video and sound drivers.  I'll admit that for some updating these drivers isn't that easy.  But it's certainly something that any computer user can do with some help, and it's really something that most computer users should learn to do.<P>We're willing to help people get their drivers updated, by tech support on the phone or by e-mail.<P>  Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sadly, this is the problem with an operating system thats trying to be everything to everyone. A business machine to business', a games machine to gamers, a development machine to developers etc... This is nigh on impossible to do flawlessly.<P>Its other problem is the fact that there is very little control over accessory and peripheral hardware. Sure, hardware can get certified by MS, but its still upto the driver company to bring their drivers inline. With the plethera of graphics and sound card manufacturers out there, theres going to be discrepencies and differences in the way they perceive and implement the standards. And the fact that they can be running on 2 different platforms (AMD and Intel) with different companies chipsets (Intel, VIA, RTech etc...) just adds to the compatibility problems. <P>If we had 1 platform, 1 chipset, 1 soundcard and 1 videocard then compatibility problems would be scarce if not non-existant, but then again that would be come exactly like a console system and we'd lose the flexibility and upgradeability of the PC.<P>Basically we don't have much choice in the computer gaming arena, MACs have been getting better and even have reasonable gaming 3D cards now but are still far behind the PC in games company support, and I definitely wouldn't throw a computer newbie or illiterate at Linux (though I do like it myself) and it also suffers from lack of PC gaming support.<P>All-in-all Windows is still our only real choice for PC gaming (even with its problems). Theres usually someway to get around the incompatibility problems many people have but sadly it does usually require some computer knowledge in order to fix them (or the trusty ol reinstall, hehe). <P>For Everquest to survive it had to upgrade to the latest version sooner or later. Microsoft can only support older DX version for so long before it becomes to bulky and inefficient (hmmm, wonder if thats Windows problem? hehe) and if Verant was caught napping then everyone would have to choose between playing EQ or playing the newer games coming out.<P>I know allot of people are going to have problems, and sadly some may not be able to play (old legacy hardware etc...), but the upgrade to DX7 was inevitable and required.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow. Thank you very much. I was not actually looking for a reply but thank you very much for taking the time to post one.<P>Did I mention that I do have the latest updates for my software (I actually have programs running in background that let me know when updates are available). I run disk and system cleanup programs on a monthly basis as well.<P>My machine does not even meet the minimum requirements to run Delta Force II but guess what... it runs fine!<P>Now, I know software manufacturers are loath to take responsiblity for the code they produce. Microsoft blames you and you get to blame microsoft. But from where I sit as a consumer that does push his machine every day that I use it, it is not microsoft's product that is the problem. When 1 program out of 20 or 30 gives me problems, I look to that program as having givin me the problems not to "the other guy".<P>But again, thanks for the reply but do you really have to blame the other guy?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Umm absor there are other 'issues' with this patch other than 'minor sound' problems. There are many posts on the tech boards about EQ freezing graphics on PC's everytime EQ saves the char. I have this problem yet all my drivers are up to date. Yet no one 'official' has yet responded to any of those threads.<P>Will there be any fixes in this patch for these problems?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To Absor,<P>My question is this.  I at first after the patch was getting no sounds.  I have Win2k, directX 8, Soundblaster Live!, and an ATI Rage Fury.  Since I had no sound I reinstalled my sound drivers and everything was okay and I was getting sounds.  Another patch comes along Friday I believe and bang, now all I can hear is the sound of my character jumping.  NO spell sounds, NO monster sounds, NO sounds other than that.  Now try to tell me this is driver and directX and related and I'm going to have a problem believing this.  I personally would like to know when I'll get sound back.  I have no problems with any other games either.  Wouldn't that seem to point at EQ?  Hmmmm.  I'd like a reply please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately, I'm one of the ones for whom the workarounds don't work.  <P>My two fatal crash-to-desktop graphics bugs have been submitted to tech support by email, and I'm hopeful for a response as tech support wades through the weekend backlog over the next few days.<P>But I'm suffering many of the same sound oddities as everyone else, and the "all-sliders-right-and-adjust-your-speaker-volume" fix doesn't help more than a little.<P>I'm also having the problem that changes made to my usercolors aren't being saved, and deleting my eqoption files as recommended didn't help either.<P>Looking forward to these bugs being fixed.  Fortunately, the game is much prettier and framerates much faster since the patch, which is some compensation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another post from Absor.... WOW<P>Absor I also disagree with your observations... Mostly with the part that people should learn how to use their computers... I work in tech support and if people wanted to learn their computers they would have... Most of it is self explanitory, but they for te most part just want to use the system without worry (example: I speak to the same person three times with the same problem at my tech line, and he still needs help doing it). <P>People only learn if they have problems, or in some cases give it to someone else to worry about.. The poepl I speak with in tech don't want to learn how to fix things tehy just want fixed, or they'd learn from what I show them (or at the very least have this make thme curious to learn on their own)... Sadly it doesn't...<P>The point here is that Windows is the part that will cause problems when changing system hardware.. My problem was not even related to changing anything because Windows 'decided' I already had the correct drivers, and still bugged out when my computer restarted...<P>The only reason that I even attempted to change anything in my sound card was because of the sound difference (combat noises muted, ambient larger than life) and this turned out to be something that was on Verant's side...<P>I realize that Verant cannot be responsible for problems that happen in Windows, but it is sure to happen (especially to those who don't know what they are doing). I knew how to repair my machine, but some won't (like Jatoba and others above) who will need a "professional's" help to work the problems out.<P>PS To Absor, Verant legal and anyone who has sytem problems and pays to get them repaired. I suggest all of you review the EULA sections 13 & 14. There may be a loophole because section 13 deosn't mention systems and section 14 provides liability up to $100...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/032150-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/032150-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=032150&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=032150&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
