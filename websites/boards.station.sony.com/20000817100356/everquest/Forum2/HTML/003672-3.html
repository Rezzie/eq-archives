</FONT><HR>/em is a proud rogue!<P>At level 35, right when I'm encountering the most expense in terms of upgrading my equipment, buying rezes, etc, I am using my pickpocket skills less and less and less.<P>And never in groups, unless expressly agreed to by the other members of the group and always suggested by someone other than myself. In Lower Guk it's irrelevant anyway... In Cazic, the loot is primarily words and pocket change. I go to a group with no money in my inventory, and I generally split my loot when I go. I hand words over, generally without even being asked. I don't even roll on items that other people NEED to upgrade their equipment. I'm told I have a good aura =) and people never regret grouping with me.<P>Other than that, I'm a rogue. In the best sense. I'm unpredictable, elusive, and I watch my back. I certainly do my best to acquire loot that is open for claim, or roll for things that I can't personally use if not required by a group member.<P>It is strange that rogues - all of whom I have grouped with, in any rate, which would be most rogues in between level 20 and 50 on Bristlebane - follow a similar set of guidelines. Occasional fits of kleptomania occur, especially when a competing group has a fit of kill-stealing, or someone develops more arrogance than their experience and expertise can justify.<P>I'm tired of people misjudging rogues on the basis of their own greed. One of the first things that happened to me as a rogue midway through her teens, and grouping regularly for the first time with people I didn't know well, was to have my loot stolen, my actions scrutinized, and legitimately won magic loots removed by group members! The excuses offered ranged from <BR>   "How dare a THEIF try and claim loot!"<BR>   "You don't get loot, you get pickpocket only"<BR>   "You're a rogue, you don't get any named loots. In fact, you don't even get to roll."<BR>   "You're pickpocketing instead of fighting, aren't you? You split your money with us or I'll disband you. Including platinum" - and this last was against the Highpass gnolls, who rarely drop more than a few gold, and I was carrying 30pp I made selling scalps...<P>I can understand some people distrusting other players because of their behavior, but not distrusting players simply because they are ROGUES. That's like distrusting a cleric because you cant rely on him / her to melee and save your butt while OOM ... or a warrior to stop fighting and bind your wounds mid-battle. Distrust a player for bad behavior. Don't distrust a player for using his / her inherent skills.<P>Merribelle Stealshearts<BR>Rogue of the 35th<BR>Bristlebane<BR>Proud scion of the Hundred Companions<P>Sorry for the double post, but the end went missing off the first  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The whole loot thing is totaly insane anyway.<P>If a group of 6 fights a hill giant who has 50pp 60gp 240sp 300cp it's ok. The looter gets 2pp more than the others.<P>If a group of 6 fights a ghoul frog who has 5pp 6gp 5sp 4cp the looter gets all but 1gp.<P>The reason for not letting the code divide the loot into a best fit for the group is silly at best.<P>5654cp divided by 6 is 9gp 4sp 2cp and 2cp extra to the looter. Easy?<P>Then to the rogues and pickpocketing.<P>Back to the HG. The fight takes 5 minutes. The rogue can pickpocket once every 10 secs? Thats 5*6 possible tries. If lucky and with high skill he/she could get over 25pp doing this. Totaling his loot from the HG to 4pp plus 25pp.<P>And the frog? The rogue picks it clean and the looter gets 1pp 1gp 1sp 1cp.<P>Solution? Big message to the group every time the rogue picks something from the mob.<P>I'm playing a rogue myself (lvl 40) as a secondary and personaly have never seen this as a problem. But then again, I mostly group with guild members.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Goatweasel, you make it sound as if rogues and wizards are the only ones who can reduce the amount of time a party spends killing a mob and therefore increase the total number of kills. You're not thinking outside the box. <P>Clerics increase the amount of kills by reducing tank downtime. This adds up to a boatload of extra kills in ANY party, and tank-heavy parties especially. <P>Rangers increase the number of kills by dealing a lot of damage and, especially important in dungeons, by snaring and preventing runners and therefore needless party deaths. They can also harmony and split spawns to help with crowd control and thereby increase efficiency.<P>Monks and warriors added to any party will increase productivity. I think this one's a no-brainer.<P>Enchanters have vastly increased party productivity in any group I've seen. Competent Enchanters, at least. But we're assuming sufficient competency in all these examples anyway.<P>I could go on and on, but there isn't a need (I hope). Sheer damage dealing power is not the only thing to consider when you're talking about increasing the number of mobs a party can handle. IN fact, I'd say that rogues are on the bottom of the list if you're talking about efficiency. They can only work on one mob at a time and they have to have a taunting tank to be effective. Classes like cleric, shaman, and enchanter can make a party mow down mobs two or three times as fast as the party could without them. As a tank, I've got a front-line perspective on this sort of thing. <P>While I DO agree that backstabbing is a really nice thing to add to a party, there are lots of other classes I'd take before I took a rogue, even *forgetting* about the pickpocket issue. Rogues are fine for what they do, don't get me wrong. It's just that I don't think you were fair to make it seem like none of the other classes could do what rogues and wizards can do.<P>As an aside... I played a wizard. I don't think they really increase the amount of mobs a party can handle more than any other class. (Please realize that I'm comparing efficiency here.) A ranger or paladin could probably dish the same amount of damage over the long haul as a wizard doze because wizards just have so much damned downtime. Adding an enchanter to a party would really help a wizard, but otherwise they're effectively hamstrung by mana considerations. That's why they ***** a lot.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I can't stress this enough.  Added to this, there needs to be certain elements in the group for the rogue to be of maximum added value.<P>When you eventually group with a truly talented rogue with top of the line weapons, you will be stunned.  at level 40-ish you'll be seeing 200 + hp backstabs every 4-5 seconds (haste + fbss), quadding for 30+ so fast it makes chat unreadable...<P>There's nothing that compares with the rogue's damage .. _in the right circumstances_.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Just press A - 2 - A between attacks, you'd never know I tried to PP.<P>The rogues you're seeing that don't attack for a while are doing it for a reason, to keep their shifty butt from reaching the top of the mobs hate list.  The only way you can do that is to not hit the blasted thing...plus make a hide/evade attempt, which also requires that you stop fighting.  Rogues aren't tanks, if a mob starts laying some smack on them, they'll go down almost as fast as a caster.

</FONT><HR>Lol, silly non-Rogues!  I am currently a 59th season Rogue and I dont even have a Pick-pocket hotkey enabled anymore to use.  I dont think I've even bothered to keep up my Pick-pocket skill since I was in my 30's range.  Ever since I found out it takes from the general loot-pool it became essentially another useless skill to me because I really dont want to rob my groupmates blind.<P>After all, pickpocketing while soloing serves what purpose?  Lol, and since mobs along the lines of gnoll pups are the only mobs I could possibly solo *grin* hmmm I destroy more loot in a day then they could possibly yield me from pick-pocket.<P>So, fear not, to group with a Rogue... Just don't turn your back. *evil grin*<P>Chala (I'll save ya!!)
