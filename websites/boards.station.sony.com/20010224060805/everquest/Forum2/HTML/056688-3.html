</FONT><HR>In the old pictures from the old EQ book you see a picture of a lanky bard playing a lute above the halfling Bristlebane. Is that Fizzlethorp the bard king? Kinda confused. Every image has both those two together. Is Bristlebane the Halfling god and Fizzlethorpe the bard guy? Anyway, since they always seem to be together it would only make sense that Fizzlethorpe or this bard guy plays a big role in Mischief. Especially with all this "humming".. hehe.<P>Perhaps a bard song or a bard effect may be needed here.<P>Also, the book says "Bristlebane made the Halflings, short and stubby folk, agile with the propensity to meddle (and even pilfer) at times..."<P>Have you tried getting a halfling rogue to pickpocket Bristlebane when he spawns for those 5 seconds? Who knows? Maybe youll get a container with which to use those cards... and the story may unfold.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nillipus' March of the Wee<P>Level 52 bard song, kinda fits in, assuming the previous poster's line of thinking is correct.  Good old Nillipus is a pretty mischevious sort, after all. :P  Maybe you play this to Bristlebane, or another NPC in PoM?  Although, it's a group buff, so I'm not sure whether it would trigger an NPC.  Or maybe Nillipus himself is somehow connected?<P>Bah.  I agree with everyone else, I'd be up in PoM in an instant trying to help figure this out, if it were possible.  A shame VI finally put an interesting puzzle in the game (as opposed to NPCs who just flat out tell you how to solve the quests) and then excluded virtually everyone who would get some enjoyment out of solving it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Of all the dumb things ... I have not tried hummmmming to any NPC .. I will try that next.<P>Again if you have any key words you'd like me to try ... please feel free to post them. I will try them and post back results. I only have a Monk and a friend Cleric up there atm .. so I cant try class specific things atm ... ie Bard song, or Rogue PP ... 8-(<P>All other guilds and ppl to my knowledge have given up on this zone thinking it's broken ... so I doubt we will have much help atm, till someone actually says it's working or we figure out what we need to do to activate an NPC. <P>I personally think it's FERJENEROR .. the Sphinx out in the garden. S/He asks DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME?, also says DO YOU HAVE WHAT YOU STOLE FROM ME? .. this is not exact wording .. I will get exact wording tonight for you. but if you say "YES" then s/he says "THEN GIVE IT TO ME"  .. if you say "NO" S/He attacks.<P>So far nothing we give has any effect at all ... heck we handed in almost all our armor and weps and misc items on us that were not No-Drop ... just to test any result. I even handed in my Tranq Staff at one point.<P>No other NPC .. really responds much, except the Black Horse Lilth, but Im pretty sure she is a completely seperate issue .. like for Thurg quests and such.<P>Anyone know a way I could load a dictionary into my hotkeys? ..hehehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I also noted that S/He responds to only acurate sayings not parital ... When she asks "DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME?" and you answer "yesa" or "yesem" you get no response, but if you answer "yes" then she says "GIVE IT TO ME!". This indicates that the text is not parseing when checking the responses. This means we would have to have an exact match (not case) on responses 8-(<P>Oh well .. Im off to work again .. some one has to pay for my EQ habbit 8-)<P>Again .. I do appreciate your checking in from time to time "BLUE" names, specially Ester .. cause she knows what exactly has to be done .. so if we try it and post it and it fails ..

</FONT><HR>Perhaps you have to ask Bristlebane if he would like to play a game of cards.<P>Another possibility would be that there is somewhere inside the zone that the cards are a key to, as in opening a lock or triggering the zone to "come alive" per say.  At the point that it was triggered, you would be able to talk to mobs, get quests, etc. etc.<P>The lack of drops besides cards says to me that the zone you are in is an illusion of some sort, and when you dispell the illusion (however you might do that), the zone will be easier to figure out.<P>Some questions having never been there:<P>1.  Are there any markings on the walls, mobs, etc. that would match up with the cards you are seeing?<P>2.  Is there any pecking order to the mobs in the zone or court in the zone, i.e. somewhere that might match up with the cards you are getting.<P>3.  How hard does Bristlebane hit?  I.e. if he hits for less than GODLY, i would imagine it is an illusion of Bristlebane, and that killing him might trigger something.<P>Keep trying, this is truly an interesting puzzle.<P>Guidar </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is just an idea. But perhaps because the fact that ranger, pally, yada yada armor isnt dropping in PoG, and the faction will screw up their home towns and stuff has something to do with PoM. I was thinking that maybe the cards dropped in PoM need to be turned into someone in PoG. Perhaps? Like, the crown card to Tunare...Knight card to the treant guy. Something. Oh well, just an idea. Would suck if you gave the crown card to Tunare and the only way to get it back would be to kill her, hah. <P><BR>Also, 3 colors of cards, 3 classes <BR>Blue Red Black. <BR>Rangers Pallys Druids.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yes, The King of Thieves. . . and merchants finds it amusing when one [takes his possessions]! <P>You say, 'What possessions did you take?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand 's eyes grow wide with an eager, child-like anticipation. ''Oh yes! Upon one of my several adventures through this great, glorious land of Norrath, I did stumble upon a [lovely treasure], indeed! Great skill and cunning was used, skill that belonged only to Bidils the Quickhand, and has yet to be surpassed within this realm!'' <P>You say, 'What lovely treasure is that?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'A lovely gem, far more beautiful than even the most delicate and fury feet of a halfling lass! It was larger than my face, and sparkled more than the most pure of Jumjum catching the rays of Karana's blessed skies! Indeed, it was a divine treasure to behold. . . but little then did I know that such a treasure truly belonged to the King of Thieves. . . and merchants himself! But no, such truths still would not have [stopped me]! <P>You say, 'So, what did stop you?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahh ha! I was not stopped, and the gem was mine! Right from beneath the arms of Bristlebane himself did I take it! That was when he noticed me. . . and that is when I was taken from the humble life of a merchant and placed within the glorious [realm of heroes]! Of course. . . Bristlebane took back the gem. What a shame. Indeed, quite so. <P>You say, 'What is the realm of heroes?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'The realm of heroes, that is my new home. . . Well, it was. Ahhh, indeed, it is quite lovely! It is where all that catch the eyes of the gods in favor ascend if their deeds be true and worthy enough for note! Perhaps one day, Yaps , you shall rise as well!! Look at Bidils the Quickhand, once a sturdy merchant and now a [humble servant] and rewarder of deeds! <P>You say, 'Who are you a humble servant of?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes! Indeed, a humble servant I am! I complain not for my occupation. . . as I am humble. I collect [deeds and make recognition] of those who have caught the eyes of the gods. Why the gods do it not themselves, I am lost for answers. . . but, I do not complain. They are gods, you know. Quite busy! Indeed, lovely so! <P>You say, 'What deeds will gain me recognition?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods are quite tricky and intelligent you know! They have found a way to mark deeds in the form of a coin! A [coin] in which one who has been so fortunate enough as to accept would give to me. . . or one of the [other Heroes] that have recently come to this land.<P>You say, 'Who are the other heroes?'<BR>You say, 'What other heroes?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'Oh yes! I am not the only one who has returned to Norrath in search of Heroes! There are many others, indeed! Although, as the gods, their colors vary. Some are [kind and gentle] while some are [vile and nasty] beings of which ya should watch ya'r back for.<P>You say, 'Who are the kind and gentle heroes?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand sighs heavily, a twinkle in his eye and warm smile upon his heavy cheeks. ''Yes. . . none so as Ailerina the Gentle, as she was so rightfully named. A lovely lass. Tender as a gentle morning mist. . . Yes. . . Indeed, quite lovely so. An enchanting creature. . . and as pure as Tunare's good grace itself. It is no wonder she caught the Earth Mother's eye.'' <P>You say, 'Who is Ailerina the Gentle?'<BR>You say, 'Where is Ailerina the Gentle?'<BR>You say, 'Who are the vile and nasty heroes?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand glares and spits on the ground beside him. '' I know not why some of these. . . villains are called heroes. It is all part of the fold and plan, I am sure. However, I shall give ya this warning of one of them, perhaps the most vile of all, and that is Kizrak the Tyrant, a brutal creature of the Warlord who has quite the taste for halflings. . . and I mean not in the sense of good grace and kindness!'' <P>You say, 'Who is Kizrak the Tyrant?'<BR>You say, 'What coin?'<BR>You say, 'How do I obtain a coin?'<BR>You say, 'How do I get a coin?'<BR>You say, 'What deeds?'<BR>You say, 'What deeds will gain me recognition?'<P>Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds!

</FONT><HR>I found a bug after 16 hours of testing . 8-(<P>I typed in thousands of words and sayings into my socials ... I started to use them on all NPCs .. in hopes of finding something that might activate one of them .. only to find out after 16 hours that if the sentance or word is not in the first line of the social that the NPC wont react to it .. 8-( .. so I tested thousands of words on NPCs that might have worked but didnt du to this bug ... hehe... I reported it, our VERY VERY nice GM showed up, tested it with me and agreed to report it to Ester. So Im hoping to get a response on it so I can continue my inquiries of the NPCs in this puzzling zone . 8-)<P>Izlegend on Conquest (formally Soul Assassins) .. went up to PoM today with his guild on Lan Server. He and I have been working together to help each other in this strange endevor. He came to my server and we brain stormed .. then when he went up I went to his server to try and help 8-)<P>I like the idea of cooroperation .. 8-)<P>Anyways ...

</FONT><HR>Thank you Esther for verifying that PoM is finished and working, etc!  The main reason my guild will not bother to go there is because they don't think the zone is finished.  And poor Irontail has been living there since it was discovered!  I wonder if he will have a long grey lizzy beard when I finally see him again......<P><BR>Anyways, my earlier posts were NOT to try and get clues or hints about how to figure the zone out.  I was simply trying to verify that it was finished.  It would be extremely frustrating to spend weeks and weeks there trying things only to find out that it wasn't done and then having to start all over again when it was finished.<P><BR>Irontail:  We gotta get some people back up there.  No raids really planned this weekend with the ToTII, so we have the time.  I think the best lead right now is Lithiniath.  Maybe it's way off, but I'm almost certain (thanks to wolfherz's help handing in horns) that Lithiniath's horn given to the right npc (the white horse in the room) will result in the 6th and final crest for the tunarean courts quest.  Once that quest is completed, maybe it will lead to some more information on the PoM.<P>I'll post more on the guild board.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We have tried placing the cards on the ground in many areas, including the chess room area .. in hopes to the Kings Court referances .. but Alas no luck to date.<P>Last night Conquest on Lan server, formally Soul Assasins, led by Itzlegend lead another raid up to PoM and kill BrisleBane again, alas he did not drop anything. He cant really be talked to unless you fight him, because he only is there for 5 seconds!!! ... I do not know that we have tried to PP him b4, but it would b very hard to time it and he's RED to 60, as I think lvl 45 is the PP limit, Im not sure on that.<P>Im a lil burned out at the moment, I spent 16 hours loading text into my socials, to try every thing I could think of saying ... I have many _81.opt files that each have all 120 socials filled with 5 lines of different text each, so basically I run through 36,000 characters of sayings per _81.opt file I have. 5 lines of 60 characters per line x 120 socials=36,000 characters. I was doing this for 16 hours to the main NPC's, when I realized that there is a bug. The bug is that NPC's only react to the first line of text on your socials 8-( ... so that means that I would have to reform my socials into each 1 line vs 5 lines ... that will take me a very very very ong time ... and then I will have 5x as many _81.opt files. THEN ... I will have to start all over again on the NPCs saying all the key phrases again .. this time only 1 line at a time vs 5 lines ata time. Needless to say this is a vast project again. I did report the bug, and POVAR GM .. very very nice person came and Role PLayed my report and verified it is not working and reported it to Ester I believe. Im sort of hoping that Ester might take a look at it and I can send her my _81.opt files and she can maybe do a quick search to see if I had said anything that would have made the NPC react vs. me completely redoing all that time due to what appears to b a bug .... hehe.. 8-)<P>I doubt she has the time for this .. but Alas I thought I would give it a try. 8-)<P>Sooo .. if I did actually activate an NPC .. she might send me back what phrases I needed to say over again on the first line ... hehe. Again I doubt she has time to do a text search through my 30x _81.opt files, but ... hey, cant hurt to ask . 8-)<P>Anyways .. nothing new to report yet. But please still send any thought .. I will try them. I have also tried movie referances to "The Holy Grail", "Spaceballs", "Princess Bride" ... I didnt quote the whole movie .. but tried quite a few main sentences ... <P>Thanks again for all your support on this subject ... we will break PoM .. it just takes HUGE time ehhee. 8-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A well formed puzzle will never submit to simple brute force.  A well formed puzzle asks the player to change his view, to see through new eyes.  A well formed puzzle has a solution that is simple and elegant, yet profoundly subtle.  A well formed puzzle can only be solved by one man in a thousand, yet all men from the simplest to the most sophisticated will note how obvious the solution is once it is revealed.<P>Get some distance from the problem.  Read a page from the Tao Te Ching.  The answer will come when your mind is ready to receive it.
