</FONT><HR>Other things to really really consider changing.<P>1) Every bard song that effects Mobs (except the DoTs) has a random duration. It lasts 1 sec, it lasts 15 sec, whatever, its random. If this was just changed to a normal duration if 3 ticks that would be big.<P>2) Haste staking. I know, but the haste stacking nerf a few months ago was a kick in the crotch to Bard's hasting ability. I'm not suggesting you put that 'bug' back in, but instead make the actual Haste part (instead of just the added +5 str and such) of Bard Hastes stack with the Haste of Enchanter/Shaman Hastes. Bards still can't Haste to max by ourselves like we did because the 'bugfix', but it at leasts gives a large portion of our songs a reason to exist when groups with an Enchanter. Just this would shut up so many other complaints.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I seem to remember that when Haste stacking was brought up a few months ago, someone at Verant indicated that Haste spells did not stack because any item + any haste spell/song got you to max haste. Then when the 'fix' was done the stance seemed to be that Verant was blind to the problem, and it had only just been discovered. I'm guessing with this new 'Monkey see no Evil' attitude Verant has taken up, we'll see no change to the way Haste spells/effects stack. Everything 'works as intended' afterall  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So i started a bard, I mean WoW i thought to my self a new spell every lvl that encreases in power as i lvl so i wont get stuck with constent upgrade spells like other casters. Thats cool to bad so many of our songs are not working to a lvl of them having any usefulness and our ss armor and sss are just a joke. Please dont make me retire my bard as there is know other class i can see me enjoying as much as i enjoy my bard.<P>so i ramble whats your point im a bard call it a work in progress =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Right on...<BR>I agree entirely with all these issues except a couple minor ones:<BR>1) practice lute, scout fifes, etc... Don't really care, these sound like they would be available at low levels and hence I doubt there would be any significant bonus to using them; we already have plenty of redundant instruments(i.e., mino horn vs. flute, you save a fraction of a pound in weight, same with lute vs. mandolin)<BR>2) Drum graphic... The number 1 comment I get after being inspected is "A tambourine! awesome!" ... There's already a percussion instrument in the game with a nice appearance (although it would be great to see the selo's drum updated)<P>Good luck bards<P>- a 49th level bard<BR>also of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor. In case you didn’t see the original post, I’ve updated it and placed it below. A quick summary of what you’ll see:<BR>  1. Easy fixes – graphics & item issues.<BR>  2. Biggest bard issues: lack of any real mez abilities (not functional now) and haste stacking.<BR>3. Class neglect issues: stuff that hasn’t worked in long time or ignored for long time. Broken quests, useless songs, lock picking, disarm traps, instrument pieces, and bugged clients.<BR>  4. FA weapon. Issue for high-level bards.<P>If you need any clarification on any issue, please let us know or post on Concert Hall site and we’ll get you any empirical data you need (test data/logs).<P>Bard Bugs & Issues/Not a Whine (v2000.10.24)<P>BROKEN GRAPHIC ISSUES<BR>* Drums look like flutes when equipped. Strumming a flute looks quite silly. <BR>* Brahm’s Horn has no graphics when equipped.<BR>* Raw bamboo (wind instrument) has no wind animation – should be same as a flute.<BR>* Female bards stab themselves in neck when playing horns (try a mino horn)<P>BROKEN ITEM ISSUES<BR>* Mask of Songbird – Plane of Sky item weighs 5.0. Obvious typo. ALL other POS masks for all other classes weigh 0.5 or less. Not sure if this has been fixed yet.<BR>* Belt of Concordance (POS item) Has AC6. Bards are plate class not chain class (War AC10, Pal AC8, Rng AC6)<BR>* Songweaver’s Mantle (POS item) Has AC9. Bards are plate class not chain class (War AC12, Shd AC10, Rng AC9)<BR>* Imbrued Bracer (Hate item) – has ac9 (chain class), the same as lambent. AC should be plate equivalent.<BR>* Imbrued Gauntlet (Hate item) – has ac12 (chain class), the same as lambent. Also has 5wis. Wis is the one stat not useful to a bard. Change to str/dex/cha/int/sta.<BR>* Imbrued Helm (Hate item) – has 9wis. Wis is the one stat not useful to a bard. Change to str/dex/cha/int/sta.<BR>* Both Lizardman Scout Fife and Froglok Escort Fife are unusable as instruments. Gordon – “not intended to be used as instruments”. Rebuttal – any unusable swords in the game? So few instruments as is (see suggestions below).<BR>* Singing Steel Effects. Single largest problem is that not made with bards in mind.  The stamina regen (arms) and health regen (bp) are inferior to existing bard songs that would provide 2x the effect and would be to entire group (versus 1 target). Eye of Xoom (helm) useless to a class with bind sight, invis, and sneak/hide. Summon food (pants) and water (boots) redundant with foraging, bards can travel to towns quickly to get food, and besides a stack of 20 food and water costs a couple gold at most. UW breathing (even though redundant with a song) and fire damage shield are nice effects – no complaints there.<P>BROKEN SONG ISSUES<BR>* Crission’s Pixie Strike (28) – Mez song that just doesn’t work. Unless a highly resistable, 0.01 nanosecond mez is what was intended. Tons of posts at Concert Hall site with statistics on how poor this song works. VI promised to look into song prior to and then after Kunark, but no answers yet.<BR>*Syvelian’s Anti-Magic Aura (40) – Song appears to dispel magic, but the bard receives no feedback message when used on mobs (e.g. “MobX looks dispelled”). Not sure if this has been fixed yet.<P>BAD TUNES (MOST OVER LEVEL 50)<BR>* Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (15) – Song is essentially unusable due to 80% resist rates. Song also overrides higher-level enchanter mez spells. Bards have done extensive testing of this song at all levels, charisma, and mob levels and have found that: higher charisma increases resists and higher level increases resists. GZ has stated song should have 35% resist rate, but actual numbers are twice this (from what bards believe, bad coding in secondary resist). VI has stated that song was tested and is working as intended, but offers no proof of testing or what was actually tested.  Without this song, the only form of bard “crowd control” is charming or single target mezzing (not that it works either). The amount of evidence of this song not working is enormous and can all be found at Concert Hall site. <BR>* Selo’s Constant Chain (23) One of two songs unintentionally nerfed when 54 song was changed. Song used to stop green mobs in their tracks at 50% health, since patch does not stop mob until down to 20%.  Song also overrides higher level snares of other classes. Song needs to be rebalanced in light of unintended nerf.  Prior balance was based on greater power, at the expense of short duration 0-9 seconds and higher resists. Now, song has short duration, 3 second casting time, and higher resists than snare/root.  If left with same strength, please consider increasing duration, resists, and make lower than higher level snare spells.<BR>* Solon’s Song of the Sirens (27) – Charm song that cannot be refreshed before breaking on non-PvP servers, but is refreshable on PvP servers. Should be refreshable on both. 10/5/00 Hobart “Tested on PvP and non-PVP, there is no difference. You cannot refresh charm.” 10/6/00 Bards on Rallos insist that it is refreshable.  Currently an issue because it is only real form of bard crowd control.<BR>* Denon’s Dissension (35) – Intended to be a mana draining song. Drains mana at an incredibly slow pace. In PvP, a player with breeze or clarity can easily outpace mana drain done by this song. Use against mobs of same level an exercise in futility unless bard has about an hour to drain the mob’s mana.<BR>* Solon’s Bewitching Bravura (39) – Charm song that cannot be refreshed before breaking on non-PvP servers, but is refreshable on PvP servers. Song also lowers magic resistance, which seems to be intented to ease recharming the mob, but on non-PvP servers – a useless debuf. 10/5/00 Hobart “Tested on PvP and non-PVP, there is no difference. You cannot refresh charm.” 10/6/00 Bards on Rallos insist that it is refreshable and that is what MR portion of song is intended for.<BR>* Jonthan’s Provocation (45) – Song is a mix of Str+AC+ damage absorption shield. If shield is used up, all other effects fail. Bards don’t want shield removed (it has uses), but song would be much more useful if other effects could stay up after shield fails.<BR>* Nillipus’ March of the Wee (52) – Song gives ac+agi+ damage absorption shield. All effects fail when shield is used up. The problem is that the shield cancels out from one quarter of one mob hit. Can other effects remain up even if shield fails?<BR>* Song of Twilight (53) –Upgrade to mez song (28), that mezs and reduces magic resistance. If target is struck, the stun is eliminated as well as the magic resistance.  Can magic resistance debuf stay in effect when mez is broken?<BR>* Selo’s Assonaint Strane (54) – An AE slow song intended to be upgrade to level 20 AE slow song. The problem: Instrument has no effect on 54 song, resulting in a 20% slow versus 35% from level 20 song.<BR>* Song of Highsun (56) – Supposed to stun, cancel magic, then self shadow step. Problem is, if target resists the song you don’t get to shadow step. This should happen regardless of target resisting the song. If cannot be separated, perhaps increase the range and change the order to: self shadow step, stun, cancel magic. Low priority, as there are no bards out there using this song.<BR>* McVaxius Rousing Rondo (57) – Haste song intended to be an upgrade to level 50 and level 54 songs. The problem: Instrument has no effect on 57 song resulting in a 22% haste versus level 50 (30% haste) and level 54 (45% haste). Using an instrument should double the effectiveness of this song.<BR>* Jonathan’s Inspiration (58) – Song gives str+ attack speed+ absorb damage shield. Yet another song  <BR>where when damage shield is used up (1/4 of 1 mob hit), all other effects fail.<P>BAD QUEST ISSUES<BR>*Fabian quest. Currently costs more to do quest than reward. You must kill a rare 32 mob in north karana, (~8 hour spawn), take guts to qeynos, pay 50gp, and bring strings to Fabian in FP. He will give: a few sp, increase to faction and an etched silver coin (1/3 of the time). No clues anywhere as to what coin is for.<BR>* Winds of Karana. Kill hermit in SK (level 20+ mob) to get a level 1 song.<BR>* Bard epic quest weapon: many bard threads on this. Biggest issues: (1) use of red AND white dragon scales conflict with warriors, paladins, and casters. (2) affect is a non-stackable proc that is marginally better than songs and worse than enchanter/shaman hastes. (3) includes 10 mana  - should go to different stat (4) bards would have preferred a universal instrument that is better than all other instruments – now that would be an item worth getting.<BR>* Temple of Solusek Ro. NPC has been saying “come back and ask me about a special bardic weapon” for over a year. Not in game. Take out the text if it isn’t going to be added anytime soon.<P>OTHER PROBLEMS<BR>* Stuck songs – bards occasionally get stuck on a song and are unable to stop it. Difficult to replicate, but appears to be associated with lag. Once stuck, the /stopsong command has no effect. The only know cure is to spam the hotkey/gem repeatedly (a few dozen times) or log.<BR>* Start/stop songs – client issue where bards twisting songs have the song stop immediately after it was just started. Looks like: “Your feet begin to slow down” (bard starts selos) “Your feet move faster” then immediately see “Your feet slow down” (and left without any speed effect).<BR>* Songs breaking rogue sneaking. Two issues: bards able to break rogues sneaking even if rogue not in same group and bards singing mana song break rouges sneaking even if rogue a moderate distance away.<BR>* Chords of Dissonance (2) – no animation when playing song and no mobs in range. Low priority, but logically, the bard is playing a song so should be able to see something is going on.<BR>* Disruptive Discord (18) – no animation when playing song and no mobs in range.  Low priority, but logically, the bard is playing a song so should be able to see something is going on.<P>ODD CLASS BALANCING<BR>* Lock picking.  Bards get skill at level 40. Skill is capped so low that bards can only open doors in Befallen (level 20 dungeon) and gate to the Hole (50+). Raising skill would be nice to open Kunark doors – why is a level 40 bard opening doors in newbie dungeon? (check bard count at primetime hours, and you’ll be lucky to see more than 12 45+ bards on any server).<BR>* Disarm Traps. Ok, no traps to disarm. Rogues got new skills (backstab & evade) to make up for this, bards were promised it would be looked into as well, but never got anything.<BR>* Skill caps on singing, percussion, string, brass, and wind still at 200 for bards over level 50. Other casting classes have casting skills up to 250. Gordon said he would look into increasing these.<BR>* Dodge/Parry. Bards get skills at 53 and 58 respectively. Far too high for most players to ever see them and excessively high compared to other classes that get these skills in 20s and 30s. Both parry & riposte capped at 75. Gordon said this is a reward for getting to high levels. Below is summary of all melee/hybrid combat skills to put this into perspective:<BR>  Bard: O1/D3: Dual Wield(17)// Dodge (10), Parry(53), Riposte(58)<BR>  Monk: O6/D3 Round Kick(5), Tiger Claw (10), Dbl Attack(15), Eagle Strike(20), Dragon Punch(25); Flying Kick(30)// Block(12), Disarm(27), Riposte(35)<BR>  Paladin: O2/D4: Bash(6), Double Attack(20)// Dodge(10), Parry(17), Riposte (30), Disarm(40)<BR>  Ranger:O3/D4: Kick(5), Dual Wield(17), Double Attack(20)// Dodge(8), Parry(18), Disarm(35), Riposte(35)<BR>  Rouge:O3/D3: Backstab(10), Dual Wield(13), Double Attack(16)// Dodge(4), Disarm(27), Riposte(30)<BR>  Shadow Knight: O2/D4: Bash(6), Double Attack(20)// Dodge(10), Parry(17), Riposte(30), Disarm(40)<BR>  Warrior: O3/D4: Bash(6), Dual Wield(13), Double Attack(15)// Dodge(6), Parry(10), Riposte(25), Disarm(35)<P>OTHER SUGGESTIONS/OBSERVATIONS<BR>* Denon’s Desperate Dirge (43) – 800 mana for AE 275 damage (including bard if in range). Breeze/Clarity/Mana song have no effect on bards mana regen (takes 45+ minutes to recharge when OOM), making this song the absolute worst in terms of damage/downtime for any class. With 39 charm song now using mana, bards never use this song.  Other classes could easily do 275 damage and recover the mana in a couple minutes at most. Suggestion: compare against other caster’s AE damage spells relative to downtime, remove mana component, and put song on timer (say 3 minutes)?<BR>* Bewitching Bravura (39). Upgraded charm song that requires mana. The biggest problem with mana requirement is that: (1) bards have 0 mana when rezed (2) bards are not affected by clarity/mana song/ or mana stones (3) it can take bards over 45 minutes to get back to full mana. High level bards are extremely constrained for significant amounts of time after a rez.<BR>* More instruments! Huge gap between newbie instruments (~5gp at local bard hall) and stuff found on dragons/gods, and virtually nothing in-between. If planes get upgraded, bards will really be hurting for instruments.<BR>  -Brass – brass horn at local guild OR McVaxius Horn of War (+15% to brass) off Lady Vox. Nothing in between.<BR>  -String – lute/mandolin at guild OR gypsy lute from mistmoore (+5%) OR Kelin’s 7 String Lute off Maestro of Rancor (+22%).  Enormous gaps.<BR>  -Wind – flute OR unicorn horn (0%) OR mino horn (+15%) OR Piccolo off Cazic-Thule (35% to song). <BR>  -Drums – decent mix from newbie to high end. Hand drum OR Mistmoore Battle Drums (+15%) OR Sharkskin Drum (+22%) OR Nostrolo Tamborine (+25%) OR Selo’s Drums of the March (+35%)<BR>* Would also be nice for better instruments to look different in some fashion from newbie stuff. A tuba, bongo, or 3-drum percussion set would be really cool. The tamborine was a nice touch.<BR>* Sing emote. Nice for roleplaying. Low priority though.<BR>* Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input Abashi. Lots of good suggestions out there.<BR>* Could musical instruments (when viewed) contain information on which skill they are for? Percussion/String/Wind/Brass. Not always obvious on wind/brass instruments. Also, would be fantastic to see something like “+10% to some brass” or “+5% to combat wind”. Often, only very high level bards can baseline instrument improvements today (hard to see 5% improvement if song only adds 5 strength).<BR>* Instrument pieces. Lots of bardic instrument pieces at vendors (including one in Kunark), but no way to put them together. Perhaps add to tinkering or put in bard only instrument skill (like research). Low priority, but pieces have been around since beta and still nothing to do with them.<P>CLARIFICATIONS/CLOSED<BR>* Small Brass Trumpet - item listed in patch message over a year ago. No one has ever found item –ever. Gordon – patch message and subsequent confirmation that they are in game incorrect. Not in game.<BR>* Practice Lute - item listed in patch message over a year ago. No one has ever found item – ever. Gordon – patch message and subsequent confirmation that they are in game incorrect. Not in game.<BR>* Psalms of Vitality (29) - Song was updated to do cure on pulse, but does not seem to do so reliably. Many bards have seen message “Your affliction has been cured by a magical enchantment” but the disease/poison icon still present OR continue to lose hit points. 10/5/00 Hobart “The song works. I did not ever have an instance where I was cured and still lost HP's. I did however get the message that I was cured when I was already cured. This should be fixed.”<BR>* Psalms of Purity (37) – Same issues as level 29 song.<BR>* Angstlich’s Appauling Screech (26) – Fear does not interrupt casting. UPDATE: Works as intended. Fear will not stop casting.<BR>* Lyssa’s Solidarity of Vision (34) – Song gets stuck when used on moving targets. If monster moves too far, client forgets where it is, and you can only see the last known position.  UPDATE: Works as intended. Song should be considered to have a max distance, beyond which the song will not update position.<BR>* Special Bardic Weapon from Temple of Solusek Ro. Quest for special weapon still not present. UPDATE: Not in game yet, for future storyline.<BR>* Metala Highfit (quest from SK) not in game. Is this a broken quest from Vhalen or just color to the game? UPDATE: Not in game yet, for future storyline.<BR>* No one has seen a Burnyai Bunt Cake (Firiona Vie quest from Scout Treekill for a bard helm). Can someone confirm that item can be found on a live server? Answer: does not exist.<P>CONCULSION<BR>I will continue to monitor this thread and compile the issues and repost the thread from time to time.<P>Safe Travels,<BR>Brewall, 45 Bard Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It does seem that Verant should reduce the secondary resists on bard songs. Particularly mez. Basically, all the bard songs are already weaker than the corresponding spell of the "real" class. All our lull, mez, debuff songs have combined effects. The AI seems to test each resist independently. The result then seems that some things are resisted at absurdly high rates because 2 or 3 resists got tested, each having a high rate. And as Gordon put it "When one component fails, they all fail. That's the way it was designed."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Verant sure does love bards."<P>Not so. Ibashbards usually ignored us, nerfed us, or said we were broken as intended (to generalize).<P>"I guess the fact that they can solo blues at level 50 with little or NO health loss just isn't enough."<P>With luck, patience, and a willinness to induce carpal-tunnel syndrome, we MAY be able to solo a handful of blues per hour. I don't solo much (1-25 was when I did the lion's share of my solo play), as I picked a support class for a reason.<P>"Go ahead and step them further over the enchanter line by letting them mez."<P>Well, we can't really Mez now. I used to Mez with good results back in Cazic (30-35), but found results to be less than impressive as I moved through the 40s. We are so far from anything remotly resembling Enchanters' wonderful CC abilities that your assertion is simply absurd. Can we park a mob? Yes. We will take an awful  beating but we can park or charm an extra in a pull of two. Our second charm is capped at 51, so don't try this too deep in the toughest dungeons. Bards don't want to step on Enchanters' toes. We simply want our single-target Mez line to work to the degree that maybe 3 mobs can be mezzed at the expense of all other songs.<P>I love to stand playing Clarity song for a few minutes while waiting for Enchanter Mez or Charm to wear off. While I want to see our broken (in my opinion) Mez line fixed, I would prefer to have an Enchanter in 99% of the situations I find myself in at 51, fixed songs or not.<P>A good Cleric saves your life.

</FONT><HR>Just a little response to this mezzing issue.  <P>If anyone knows anything about enchanters, pretty much the only thing we do well is mez mobs as our primary function.  Yes we provide haste buffs and yes we provide mana regen.  Bards on the other hand are supposed to be jack-of-all-trades types, masters of none.  Bards have mana regen, stun, slowing songs, haste, buff songs, DD songs, charm and mez songs, invis song, healing etc etc.  <P>The same argument can say that enchanters have invis spells, slowing spells, DD spells, buff spells, stun spells etc etc.  But, when an enchanter is in a group where crowd control is a major issue, that is ALL we do.  That is our responsibility.  We basically do nothing else.  I for one have nothing but crowd control spells up when I'm crowd control mode.  <P>Making bards better or equal crowd controllers will dimish the usefullness of enchanters in a group.  Sure, there aren't a lot of bards or enchanters around to worry about it too much, but I for one don't want to be ousted by some bard who can do many other helpful things for a group that I couldn't do.  <P>The enchanter is THE difinitive crowd controlling class.  Bards are the jack of all trades class.  I'm pretty tired of hearing about how bards can't mez as good as enchanters etc etc.  You're not supposed to.  It's called game balance.  <P>Let the flames begin...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Fandiwen Kang, 51st lvl Enchanter of Grey Hawke (Karana)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fandiwen, you seem to not understand.  Max a bard would ever be able to mes is 3.  Currently barring summoners or casters a Shaman can do more than that and they don't get mes.  Go to Karnors and watch the shamans park Drolvargs off to the side waiting their turn.  Your job is being stepped on more by root than a functional bard mes could.<P>Eryl Flynn Level 50 Wood Elf Bard on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fandiwen, I'll certainly not flame you, because your response held no flames -- only your sincere concerns as an enchanter. I would like, however, to point out a key factor that seems to have been missed.<P>Bards are not asking to be as good as enchanters at CC. Now, some of the people in this thread have said they'd like to see us able to mez 3 mobs, which may seem to be cutting it a bit close to chanter abilities. However, an important factor to keep in mind is that, with our song pulsing every 3 seconds, a bard attempting to mez these 3 mobs would face a resistance check every 3 seconds. Therefore, even if 3 mob mez were within a bard's capabilities, it would never approach the degree of control that a chanter can achieve, as it would be breaking fairly often (even if the resistance rate were exactly the same for both classes).<P>Now, it may be asked why we ask for CC at all -- well, because VI gave us the songs in the 1st place.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Also, as other bards have pointed out, each class-defining ability in the game has a secondary class that can fill in on that ability, albeit with markedly less proficiency, in a pinch. With the line of songs in place, it simply _seems_ that the intent was for bards to be that second-string CC -- which currently we aren't (more like junior league bench players, hehe).<P>Enchanters will always be the masters of CC, bards will never be their equals -- but we _could_ (&, again, it seems we were meant to) fill in as the cheap seconds. That's all we're asking for on the CC issue.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Snapdragyn Feybaerd &lt;Mystic Alliance&gt;, Bard of the Twenty-Second Song who can't even keep 3 level 1 snakes mezzed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>'I haven't died yet today... but then, I haven't tried to mez anything, either!'  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"I'm pretty tired of hearing about how bards can't mez as good as enchanters etc etc."<P>I have yet to read a post where a Bard asks to Mez as well as an Enchanter. Bards love Enchanters and only want our Mez to work as a distant second to Enchanters' wonderful Mez (we are currently a very, very distant third behing Necros). Currently the Mez line does not work very well. If our Mez worked as well as Enchanter Clarity....  Nah, skip it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fandiwen<BR>  I highly doubt that an Enchanter in a group needing crowd control does not cast any hastes, buffs, debuffs, tashan, or stuns over the course of their night, as well as clarity, resists or anything else they are capable of. With Clarity and Clarity II an Enchanter can easily keep 5 or 6 mobs mezzed indefinitely, whereas a bard could do 3 at most with a single target mez. Right now with an Enchanter in the group the high level bard is delegated to mana song (Since bard haste is so inferior to Enchanter). Without an Enchanter, a bard can't even approach an enchanter half his level with respect to crowd control capabilities. No one wants bards to be AS GOOD AS Enchanters, we just want bards to be a viable second choice. No one expects a Druid to be as good of a healer as a cleric but they DO make a viable second choice right? Same argument...<P>Harliquinn Whiteshadow</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fandiwen if you feel that a bard mezing 3 mobs and doing nothing else is better then what an enchanter can do then you must be a pretty poor enchanter at 51st lvl.

</FONT><HR>Ailadenia,<P>Not trying to upset you, but you are wrong.  The mezz issue has never really been addressed, avoided and procrastinated, yes, but not addressed.  The very fact that we have just been informed that Verant is looking to adjust them is indicator enough that there is a very real problem with them.  It wouldn't take long to see that Bards crowd control was designed to be one of our primary skills for group combat, and that in its current form, to use it absolutely worthless.  In fact, it serves presently to do nothing but taunt and kill the bard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think it is important to keep things on track.  Currently the only negatives I see here about getting mezzed songs working are how it will effect enchanters.  My experience is that enchanters have the one of, if not THE easiest time getting in groups, and are one of the basic, most necessary classes in any high level excursion.  I fully believe that fixxing Bard's mezz can not in any way be considered a threat to their viability and nessecitated participation in many high level groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
