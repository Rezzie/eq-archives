</FONT><HR>I have never seen the triple attack skill at any warrior guild, I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but I doubt it, since I have never heard of it.<P>You loose the damage cap at level 20 by the way. And yes, warriors might have uber AC, uber damage output, but we need our gear. So do any of you hybrids wanna give me the money for it? Do you know how much of the cobalt that does drop that goes to warriors for free? Not much at all. Its usually us buying it from some druid or necro. As for triple attack being capped at 70, my double attack is at 180, and I double attack about 50% of the time. Yeah I can do a lot of damage, when I hit. <P><BR>As for crits, you guys dont have a freaking clue do you? I must crit about 3-5% of the time, I can hit for 87, but most of my crits are 54 damage, so whats the point of bringing crits up? They do pretty much nothing, SOMETIMES they hit for 100. As for raising a Pallies defence to equal (almost) its parents class, why not go ahead and give them all the clerics healing spells then?<P>If they want to give hybrids better melee skills, and remain balanced about it, then put back in the exp penatlies.<P>And was it in this post (or another?) that someone said they see lots of warriors running around in full cobalt? Well, all I to say to them is open your ***king eyes, its full crafted you see, not full cobalt.<P>A few of you guys should actually play a warrior and see what its like. By definition, we are meant to be the masters of melee, ie. kick anythings ass we encounter. But thats not the case, and I can live with that, but what I can't live with are the whining hybrids wanting to become better because we are better than them. We are meant to be clearly superiour in melee, so stop focusing on what you do have instead of what you don't.<P>Klangeddon Grimsmythe<BR>35 Warrior of Southern Sentinals<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A 54 human paladin in my guild has 200 less HP then me (a barbarian warrior) and 12 less AC (yes this is unbuffed). <P>Bull.<BR>My 55 Paladin has 250 less HP than my level 51 warrior. You either have crap gear or the Paladin is lying.<BR>My Paladin has 45 more unbuffed AC due to the fact he has DW BP and Greaves.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go tank a frog in sebelis with that difference in stats and tell me the difference it makes.<P>That level 54 Paladin has damage avoidance skills (dodge/parry/riposte) of a level 35 warrior.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have had Sunderfury for 6 weeks now. I've used it a total of 6 times. I do a lot more damage with it, then dual wielding<P>At level 56, you will do nearly 200 more damage per minute weilding your two jade maces.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"Warriors have Disciplines": Yes we do, most of them are useless. <P>If you don't understand how useful Defensive is, you are beyond clueless.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you increase hybrid offense/defense and don't fix a thing, then things will become unbalanced. <P>At level 60 Paladins and Shadowknights will still have the offensive skills of a level 53 warrior. Their damage avoidance skills will still lag 25-35 points behind warriors. <BR>At level 60, Rangers will still have the defensive skill caps of a level 38 warrior.<BR>Those numbers don't show that hybrids will be more powerful or unbalanced.<P>Do you realise that with the changes, Pal/Shd will have only an additional 16AC at level 55? How does this mess up the class balance?<BR>The suggested changes don't effect 84% of the levels. The improvements will be barely noticeable at level 55.<P>--------------------------------------------<P>Get real.<BR>If you think that at level 60, a warrior will have only 200 more HP than a Paladin, you are WRONG.<BR>If you think a Pal/Shd will do more damage with a 2H weapon than a warrior, you are WRONG. Do you understand the concepts of skill caps?<BR>A level 54 warrior will do more damage weilding the same weapon as a 60 Paladin. <BR>He will higher skill caps in Weapon, Offense and Double Attack. Not including riposte, kick and critical hit damage.<P>------------------------------------------------<P>You really are a sad excuse for a warrior. If you think an extra 20 defensive points will tip the balance in favor of Paladins and Shadowknights, you are even more ignorant than it first appeased.<P>Everyone who thinks a Paladin or Shadowknight is, or will be the 'uber-tank' should grind XP for a week and go on a few raids as a high level Pal/Shd.<BR>I have the experience of Playing both a high level Paladin and Warrior. I can tell you straight up that your post is nothing more than a class envy whine.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mythral:<P>You will never be desired or as effective in epic/uber mob encounters. You are a hybrid. Hybrids will never be as effective as either parent class in these encounters. These encounters require the best of the best and hybrids are not nor ever will be the best at anything (except taunting they way it currently works). Unless Verant suddenly comes up with some amazing insight that has eluded them from day 1 about how to make you effective against uber mobs without overpowering you...this will never change...sooner you reconcile this...the happier you will be.<P>The problem is you cant have 14 classes all of which are the best at something...there is too many classes for that ever to happen so Verant made artificial "best" and tried to balance around that. Problem is players caught on to this pretty quick and figured out who the real damage dealers were...and since this game is about dealing maximum damage in the shortest time possible guess who is gonna get left out? <P>I have no problem with the improvements to hybrids...the problem I have is that they will be a slight improvement which will satisfy no one...hybrids will continue complaining and maybe get a couple more improvements and so on and so on<P>Ill say again, you can have all our disciplines. Frankly i dont know why Verant doesnt just give them to you. They are useless 99% of the time. The other one percent is specialized uses against specialized mobs (reposte against Venril Sathir for ex.). Defensive made us gods for 3 minutes out of every 12...because it was broken...once fixed it WILL NOT be used nearly as much...why?...because the ability to take alot less damage is irrelevant when you are taking NONE because you cant taunt the mob onto you. Triple attack...lol...let hybrids have that puppy to..at level 60 I have about a 20% chance to successfuly dual wield and double attack for 4 attacks..want to take a wild guess what chance i have for triple attack to fire on one hand...lol...almost 5%...both hands-.5%.<P>And the guy comparing sk armor to cobalt...Ive killed 3x as many shrooms as Juggies and have had 1 Cobalt bracer compared to 3 sk helm off Juggies....either Im incredibably unlucky on cobalt and incredibly lucky on BE armor...or maybe one is more common then the other. The Sathir is no harder to get or kill then any other named in Karnor's...but the class drops in karnors seem to drop about the same rate with the exception of a few pieces (cleric gaunts uber friggin rare and bard gloves/boots fall out of the sky).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Lumudan, I'm not buying your point, even if it has the merit of being put forth in a calm and explicit manner.<P>The reason ? I played my SK from day one of the game. I have reached lvl 60 with 200 days played, my interest in the game will die with my character. The day I chose my character, nothing was there to tell me I would become totally useless once I got to the top. Yet I payed for the game as much as your average warrior, rogue or cleric, I put as much effort into him as they have into theirs, if not more. Now that I'm at the top, I'm being told "sorry man, there's nothing else you can do now, drive thro". As it is, my character, and myself by extension, is a total deadweight for the kind of events my guild is doing on a daily basis, raids.<P>So basically, you're telling me that a lvl 60 hybrid should pack it up and quit the game, or farm for stuff in dungeons while the rest of his friends are having all the fun and take on the hardest challenges left in the game ? How can you possibly call that right ???<P>Nope, sorry, again I'm not buying this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

By this i dont mean a  new aoe taunt but somthing that really does help in a fight.<P> Twinking is a problem that faces us all ,a twinked ranger out taunts me all the time and it saddens me.<BR>  To those that go on about double damage ,it shows you have never been a warrior then,Its obvious when fighting that ya get a fair amount of double attacks but crits are rare and give perhaps the odd 100+ (at 45th lvl) but we are still out one by monks  with bare fists! Go figure that one out.<P> More hps,more ac and a much much better taunt is needed here but we all know that warriors are not going to get anything really major in next round of major upgrades/patch.

</FONT><HR>-wither-, do you think that everyone that has a &lt;Fires of Heaven&gt; guildtag is 'uber-twinked' from level one?<P>I played a warrior in the first few months of EQ. Untwinked. I got him to level 50 with no powerleveling and no 'uber' gear. I believe I was wearing silverplated legs and weilding a ykesha and obsidian shard at level 45. My 2H of choice was a silvery two hander.<BR>This was back when warriors didnt have critical hits, innate magic resist, massive HP and better armor. As I leveled that warrior up, some changes were made and at level 50, warriors were a pretty good class. They had similar HP and AC to a Paladin and SK but they had better weapons and enough HP to make them an excellent tank. Do you realise at level 50, Pal/Shd defense is within 5% of a warrior?<P>This is how I took a warrior up from zero plat to 50. That warrior was named Kathar. If you ask someone who plays on Veeshan I'm sure they will remember Kathar. He was a warrior when nobody played warriors. Infact, he was one of only 2-3 Half Elf warriors on Veeshan until he reached about level 45.<P>Don't give me a sob story about how 'hard' it is to be a warrior. You obviously have no clue.<P>By the way, at level 51, my warrior has zero 'spells' (no cobalt). I got my Jboots at level 49 by camping the AC. 90% of my gear is nodrop. A real life friend started a cleric around the same time and we leveled up together. Miir has never been 'powerleveled'. The cleric I leveled with is currently 46. <P>I always get a kick out of 'player haters' like Wither. You need to get a clue, man.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You can invent a convenient back-story; I have no idea if its true or not, and what difference could it make: thats *not* the point. The point is that hybrid classes have a steady stream of spells in their pre 50 existence that renders their live a LOT more convenient than warriors. And now hybrids posting want to pretend that these spells are entirely worthless. And further, these self same hybrids are clamoring for everything that makes the warrior unique: the ability to tank. <P>Wither, my first char, was the 3rd player on rodcet to 50. There was only one warrior I remember in the 40s when I made 50 (dyvim) all the rest were pallys. Not a lot of folks played warriors back then _ why bother. Over the last 2 years they made the warriors into a solid tank class. I dont think that giving pallys/sks our defense is the end of the world. Giving them parry/dodge/etc would simply spell the end of the warrior/pure tank class. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Ehan you're point is valid but what you fail to realize is that it doesn't apply to hybrids.<P>Hybrids, the way they were implemented by Verant, are bastard classes made of a certain percentage of 2 parent classes. When it takes the best abilities of one class to be of any use in the high level game, that wash-out mix of classes simply doesn't cut it.<P>Ideally, hybrids should have been a melee class, close to warrior, but with their own set of spells. Then we could have come close to some sort of true identity. As it is, Verant is simply patching up hybrids here and there, trying to make them viable as a class. Hence the whining from the parent classes, tho, which is really getting on our nerves now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nope, dont remember saying pack it in...hybrids are still quite effective in everyday groups. But in epic encounters...you will not be as effective as a pure class...maybe I was lucky to realize this very early...hybrid means you will not be the best at anything..if you made it to level 60 thinking...whoohoo yippee im awesome in all situations...then you missed alot of things along the way somehow. <P>You are not useless in epic encounters. You can still do some damage, maybe lifetap, maybe do a little back up healing, occasionally uber taunt an unexpected add etc etc. You are not and never will be...best at tanking...best at doing damage...best at healing...best at debuffing...the question seems to be...how much better do you have to be in any one area to be considerate "adequate" enough to be desired for epic encounters.<P>The answer is (and if you didnt know this long before 60 then you either bought your character or were powerleved thru 60) you have to be as good as a warrior at taking damage, a cleric at healing...a necro at dotting..etc etc...to be desired on epic encounters. WHY you ask? Because epic encounters are lag filled ld festivals where you must as efficiently as possible deal out the most damage you can in the shortest time possible. <P>Players know this so will always choose the classes that accomplish this. I have friends who play pally's sk rangers etc...they are never excluded because of their class...THEY feel useless on these raids because they see no role for themselves...thats because there is no role for them...there never was...from level one there was no role for hybrids...the addition of so many epic multi-group encounters has only served to magnify the problem that was already there.<P>Hybrids are fillers...you take one when you cant build the "ideal" group because the pure classes can do 99% of what hybrids do only better. Thats the way the game is designed...Verant knows they screwed it up, but they have no clue how to fix it now that they have 14 classes running around and from day one only half of them were truly useful. Various Verant representatives have said numerous times they consider a class "balanced" if there is a compelling reason to play that class...<P>Other then role-playing or just liking a particular class there never has been a compelling reason to play most hybrids..if there is im open to hearing it. I havnt played every class and i think you really need to take a class to post 50 to get a good feel for it. Ive got a war and enc post 50. Pally 36, shaman 35, and a few others from 5-30. By the time my paladin was 36 I already was pretty certain what was coming in the levels ahead..and didnt like it. Im sorry it took you 60 levels to realize the same thing. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Quit trying to compare the lvls where most people can solo effectively (as long as they know half way what they're doing) to the higher lvls.

</FONT><HR><BR>I agree that hybrids should not be the best at anything, again... But the idea I had when I chose a hybrid was that the sum of my melee abilities + spells would equal to other classes in terms of usefulness. The cruel joke is that against ubermobs is that the Taunt factor of my spells, if I'm stupid enough to try and use them, blatantly knowing they are resisted to boot, only help me die faster. That's the case with Lifetaps for example, since you bring them up.<P>And think a minute, even if we're effective in everyday grouping, warriors are still superior to us in that area. Once you are lvl 60, or even before actually, are you still going to keep grouping for experience and loot you've already acquired ? Nope, the only thing that's left is the big raids. There warriors outclass us again, and by such a margin we count for nothing.<P>What I don't agree with, is that if you currently put 1 warrior against 2, 3, even 4 hybrids to fill slots in a raid, the warrior will be chosen. So adversely, if you set up a raid and it happens not enough warriors show up, the raid is cancelled, because it's doomed to failure. Same goes with clerics, 3 or 4 druids/shamies hardly can replace the cleric efficiency on a raid.<P>Hybrids should be fillers, as you say, I have no problem with that. But at least, 2 SKs/pallies should be as effective at tanking, and I mean only tanking, as 1 warrior is, in order to fill up the slots. That is not the case currently, in Velious especially. And I'm sick of attending raids out of sheer charity, while waiting for hours at times for enough of our warriors and clerics to show up.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>I don't know at what time your pallie reached lvl 36 Lumudan, but when my SK reached lvl 50, it was months before Kunark, and at that time we were doing just fine as tanks. I had well over 100 days played on that character once Kunark got released, and even if I saw what was coming as soon as I reach lvl 54-55, when my guild started taking on the hardest mobs in Kunark, it was already too late for me, I just had already invested myself too much in my character to start over.<P>And frankly, your point of view kinda disturbs me, as you find it normal that the game should segregate players of certain classes from others at a certain point. For a game that focuses on grouping and get as many players as possible to have fun together, that quite defeats the purpose, unless you agree in falling into the cleric/warrior/rogue mold that's currently been forced on us.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

When my Paladin dinged from 29 to 30 while fighting an over-pull of giants, I saw a NOTICABLE increase in the damage I was doing per hit.  I also noticed that the Level 28 Warrior who also had a 2h weapon was STILL hitting more often and hitting harder than I was.  And no, his weapon was not significantly better than my Messenger of the Queen.<P>As for soloing...

</FONT><HR>You forgot about the buffs you can get from the various casters out there that will improve your abilities through the roof.  Your disciplines may need a bit of work, but the only thing you really have to complain about as a warrior is when a rogue can outdamage you.<P>And yes, the warrior class can use a bit of a tune-up, but before saying how your class is broken when you can get into groups fairly easily, look at the classes that are even more broken than yours.  Bards are in serious need of improvement, as are wizards.  Both need to be fixed before the warrior class, since they have many more issues that need attention.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm talking about day to day grouping..<P>Sure, when a group is looking specifically for a tank AND there is one lfg, warriors get picked. BUT when a group is looking for anything OTHER then a tank, warriors NEVER get picked.. hybrids can sorta heal, sorta tank, sorta dd, so if the pure class isn't available a hybrid can get into a group in MANY more situations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Daeyuth, you have the same problem that most warriors that post on this board have... <P>THERE IS NO CLASS CALLED "HYBRID".  THERE ARE FOUR *DIFFERENT* HYBRID CLASSES.  A HYBRID CAN'T "heal, life tap, snare, root, debuff, DoT, nuke, summon pets, fall dead, track summon corpses, invis".  IS ALL_CAPS A NEW WARRIOR LANGUAGE?!  OH NO!  A_HYBRID CAN DO THAT TOO!!!<P>I'm getting pretty annoyed at warriors complaining about all the things a hybrid can do.  As a Paladin, I can only do 4 of the things that you listed.  I'm going to list 5 things (you missed buffs) and SLOWLY explain them to ya:<P>1.)  HEAL - Both you and I know that a Paladin can't play the primary healer for a group, with the exception of a few levels (39 - 43 roughly, thanks to GH).  My healing is limited to downtime, the rare emergency, supplementing a druid/shammy healer or as a taunt.  Of course that's in those rare-ish occasions that you don't have a cleric or enchanter in your group.  I can use a healing spell to pull a mob off of the puller, but since he is a mighty warrior, what's the point?<P>2.)  ROOT - Good for crowd control and manipulating the hate list and aggro.  Too bad that it's either resisted 5 times in a row or it drops after 15 seconds.  Still, it's very useful.<P>3.)  NUKE - Only undead.  Let me repeat that in warrior language...  ONLY UNDEAD!  And only for 100pts of damage a cast.  WHOA!!!  Watch out for that nuking pally!<P>4.)  INVIS - ONLY UNDEAD!  That's so usefull!  Since most undead are in dungeons and you NEED a cleric when you go into a dungeon, he'll already have this spell...<P>5.)  BUFFS - Only good for solo'n and they still don't give us the same AC/HP as a warrior.  They should.  My penalty for lower AC/HP is the fact that I can buff my self, it should atleast give me the same AC/HP as a warrior.<P>Here are some other things I find EXTREMELY wrong with your post:<P>"Hybrids are fine the way they are now as far as their melee stats. They have UNIQUE abilites. " -- HAHAHAHA!!!  You crack me up man!  ALL of my spells are low level cleric spells that have almost no effect on a high level encounter.  UNIQUE!!  HAHAHAHAH!  You're funny.<P>"They aren't totally group dependent like warriors are. "  --  At a point, all classes are group dependent, even Necros.  <P>"They should learn to capitolize on their abilities and spells. 90% of them do not. "  --  Sounds like you are guilty of the same...  I have seen warriors solo at all levels.  Learn to judge what you can kill using only half a bar of hp and bandage.  Since you have higher AC than a Paladin and can kill things THREE times as fast, you are even more effective as a soloer, even with half the hit points.<P>"They are supposed to be a challenge to play. They have already had their xp penalty removed."  --  Where'd you get this from?  The manual?  From the character creation screen?  We were also supposed to have the best weapons, blessed by the Gods.  And what did removing the xp penalty do for us?  We level faster, sure, but still not as fast as a warrior who gets an xp bonus.  Using your same logic, you SHOULD be penalized because you are much easier to level.<P>"You are about to kill the warrior, and make all the sacrifices I made for 56 levels significantly less worth it"  --  You made NO sacrifices.  You started your class so you could kill things.  You do.  I started a paladin so I could be the knight in shining armor wielding a flaming sword.  With the addition of Fine Plate and Epic Weapons, I lost that uniqueness.  And you want to take my only contribution to a group (the way that I can taunt) away?  It's already hard enough to get into a group that is looking for a "tank" (ie. warrior).<P>I use all of my abilities to thier fullest.  It's still not enough to compete for a spot in a group with a warrior.  Warriors should not have a monopoly on a spot in a group.<P>Logancreed<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Daeyuth said:<BR>"Mythral, <BR>A hybrid by DEFINITION, is not defined, they are a combonation of classes, thus they are NOT THE BEST AT ANYTHING!!!<P>A "hybrid" is something that is the culmination of multiple things..."<P>You really have no clue...  Here is the DEFINITION of a hybrid from Websters Dictionary:<P>"something (as a power plant, vehicle, or electronic circuit) that has two different types of components performing essentially the same function"<P>The "function" that players have in EQ is to assist in killing things.  According to this definition, hybrids should be able to perform this function.  NO WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT LESS THAN THE PARENT CLASSES (warrior speech).  Why do you insist that we should?!<P>Logancreed<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, my Barbarian Warrior is only level 19, so I can't comment on higher level disciplines and such, but here are my two coppers...<P>Warriors need a little work. Let's face it, the game was created to encourage grouping, but EVERYONE has to solo some time. Well, I have to solo half the time. Here's how a warrior solos:<P>Attack blue MOB<BR>Bind wound to half health<BR>Sit for fifteen to twenty minutes<BR>Repeat<P>Maybe four fights an hour. I can't even imagine what this will be like at level 30 or 40 when I have ten zillion hit points to heal. I can understand the need to have things occur in somehwat realistic time, but come on...at least let us bandage to three-quarters health or something. Regardless, I can deal with this one.<P>My second gripe and biggest: INABILITY TO BIND EXCEPT IN CITIES. Adventuring gets VERY stale when you are limited to zones surrounding cities. I can't venture to Najena, Lavastorm, or Solusek Ro with my Barbarian Warrior, Guk is a pain in the butt, as is Splitpaw, etc. <P>Too much of a disadvantage. When my party gets in trouble, the spellcasters hardly EVER die. They gate, they teleport. Even when they die, they are bound right there. How is this fair?? Its bad enough we can't bind ourselves. I can understand that. <P>But having to bind only in the handful of (good) cities sprinkled across thwe world is frustrating. It makes the game very limited.<P>C'mon, guys...we want to explore Norrath.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Thurkon expecially on one major point.. <P>The idea of binding in general boggles me.. I'd like very much to have someone explain the whole concept to me. I understand this much, your bind point is the place you get a new body at.. and this definetly seems magical since death in real life doesn't quite work like this so I understand why warriors can't bind.. But I can't seem to figure out why classes who don't get bind can only get bound in cities.. whats the story behind this?<P>If things get nasty, and a warrior is doing their job (IMHO), they'll be the first (and hopefully only) person to die.. deaths don't even phase me anymore.. the worst part about dying for me is the 15 minute walk back to my body..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Effective effective effective --<P>Seems to be the word of the thread.<P>Heres my input - <P>I've played a warrior, love playing a warrior but not as much as I love playing my paladin.<P>I'm not as "effective" as a warrior at tanking, or even dealing damage. I'm certainly not as "effective" as healing as the cleric in my group. I don't want to be. I shouldn't be. But the fact is, I have fun. I have a blast playing my level 46 paladin. I've been playing since the day the game shipped (and arrived at EB). I'm a casual player myself - work full time, have other hobbies, and attend to my family. And it becomes apparent that many of you are missing the point here. That point being, you're just supposed to have fun!<P>What role you play on big raids is only important if you're having fun doing it. And just because you don't do x as well character y doesn't mean you're not as "effective." <P>I like to think i play my Pally well. I am often used for pulling because i understand my ability to "park" mobs during multiple mob pulls. I understand when i need to back off from combat and heal instead of pound on a mob. I switch my arsenal depending on mobs i'm fighting to increase my effeciveness in situations.. i change my tactics depending on who i share a group with. I make a lot of friends, therefore i've almost always got a good group waitin for me wherever I go. Those friends are more than willing to share raids with me. I haven't been to planes just yet, but I get invites all the time - I've never been turned down because i'm a hybrid. I've been accepted because i'm a friend. <P>To the paladins out there -- spend some time to examine your role in a group. Our role varies greatly, step back a moment - use your head, do some planning and do your best to be as effective as possible as a player, not as a "hybrid."<P>To the warriors complaining - You guys do your job (primarily taking damage) well. While requiring less strategy (IMHO) than a hybrid to play you guys certainly have to use your brains as well. Again, try and be more effective player, and you will be a more effective tank. <P>This class envy is silly. I'm not jealous of any other classes ability. I've never posted here asking for "so and so" ability because "soandso class" has it. I've used the tools VI has provided for me and made the best of them. From what i can figure those tools are more than enough to provide effective in any situation i've been in. As long as I continue to play with my head I will continue to be effective, and I highly doubt that just because I am post 50 I will suddenly become somehow obsolete. Before you post here ranting about how unbalanced your class is, and how overpowered so and so class is, take a moment to reflect on how well you perform as a player, and maybe, just maybe you will realize you're not living up to your full potential.<P>Thibbs<BR>Paladin of Brell<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hate to break the news to you... but Warriors SHOULDN'T be the best at both offense and defense. They should be the only class that's exactly balanced between the two.<P>How balance can be reached<BR>----------------------------<BR>Monk - 70%O 30%D<BR>Ranger - 60%O 40%D (spells included)<BR>Warrior - 50%O 50%D<BR>Pally - 30%O 70%D (spells included)<BR>SK - 40%O 60%D (spells included)<P>As it is now, the warrior is the best at Offense and Defense which equates to 70%-70%.  It's no wonder Verant can't keep it balanced, that's obviously more thn 100%. Are Warriors overpowered? No! Are they underpowered? No! Are other classes underpowered in certain areas with reguard to Warriors, Yes.  Are some overpowered in certain areas? Yes.<P>Warriors are the class by which all others are based. The standard.  They should be/are/will always be better at offense then pallys/SKs and always better at defense than monks/Rangers.  But they cannot be the best at everything because why would anyone want to play any other class then?<P>A warrior should NOT be the best tank AND the best damage dealer. You can't have the best of both worlds.  A warrior's role should be based on a balance between the two.  Your true versatility is the ability to fill the role of tank OR damage dealer dependant on need.<P>My $0.02<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
