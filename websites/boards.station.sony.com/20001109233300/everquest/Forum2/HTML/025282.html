</FONT><HR>I've been hearing rumours that the higher levels of jewelcraft were bugged, but I hadn't heard anything about this being true so I settle down this morning to try and increase my skill.<P>At the beginning of my work, I had 1K platinum, a skill of 191 and an Int of 180.  The next thing for me to make if I go in triv order is the BP choker, but I only have 8 BPs.  It's a triv of 193.<P>I fail one in four and get no skill raises.<P>Since I can't buy BPs, I turn to star rubies next.  68P per shot, triv of 199.  I sell the successes back to the merchant for a minor loss of a few gps and take the money I make to buy more gold and star rubies.<P>I averaged a failure rate of approximately 2 in 5, and as I watch the money dwindle away I see no raises in the skill.  Finally I get up to 192 followed by four consecutive failures before the money runs out.<P>1000 platinum pieces, a helluva lot of jewelry attempts (sorry, I didn't count) and a skill add of +1?<P>I'm a master smith (175) and a master baker (142) and in working up all three of my skills I have never seen such a horrendous failure rate or such a ridiculous increase in skill level.<P>I can accept bad luck, but this goes beyond bad luck and into the ridiculous.  <P>What the heck is going on?

You will spend alot more money trying to get to 200. hopefully though, (i havne't tried yet) once you break 200 all that stuff will get easier to make. I have 200 skill in JC and haven't bothered trying to get past 200 yet since JC is a waste of time and money.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>When I was getting my smithing capped before the patch, I was making banded cloaks for that final push from 168 to 175.<P>I was getting a skill increase, on average, for about every 20 to 25 cloaks I made.  When I hit 171 skill, I had to make 94 banded cloaks before I got to skill 172.  After that, I powered out the last 3 skill points at the previous rate of every 20 to 25 cloaks.<P>Hell levels for trade skills, or did the random number generator just decide to bend me over for a while?  Not sure, but as a master in several trade skills, I see this frequently, so I can say that it's (at very worst) a "feature" of the game.<P>As for jewelry, sorry you blew 1Kpp for one skill increase.  I have to agree with Abashi, though.  For the most part, you can make some pretty easy cash off Jewelry once your skill is high.  If you sell 3 plat ruby veils, and have 4 failures (for a total of 7 attempts), you're still going to clear over 1Kpp in profit for a few minutes work.  I can't think of any other ways in the game to make that kind of money for that little time invested, unless you're bound in the frenzied room in guk and the ghoul is waiting there with a sash for you every time you gate in...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The random number generator is the poorest one I've ever encountered.<P>For example, in Ocean of Tears I have been known to "camp" Gornit sometimes for a little while.<P>I can *guarantee* that he will not resist Bonds of Force from between eight and ten "spawns" but that the next *two* "spawns" he will resist it on the first shot.<P>I've had similar experiences with other resist rates.<P>For example, in the Dreadlands there is a myriad different creatures to kill.  I could expect that after six to eight kills, of any creature whatsoever, the very next *drachnid* (widow, webmistress, or what have you; it didn't matter) I attacked would resist Bonds of Force on the first shot, completely resist one damage spell, and partially resist over 50% of the rest of the damage spells.<P>This would happen predictably.<P>That's not even psuedo-random.  It's just crap.<P>I was wondering, whilst practicing blacksmithing with my paladin, if the same random number generator was being used for trade skills.  Because I had the reverse effect: every twenty or thirty attempts at any given thing, I would get a "streak" of six to nine increases with perhaps a single non-increase attempt or two dispersed in the series.<P>It's pathetic, and I think it really should be looked into.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wayward,<P>What Abashi said seemed pretty right on, in my opinion.<P>Jewelry is THE BEST trade skill.  It blows away smithing.  Of course, there is always going to be saturation on older servers, but my Jeweler friend still makes money on Xegony.  Um, that's one of the original servers if you didn't know. <P>You can't sell every piece to a players, but certain pieces sell like hotcakes, and at large margins.  Sometimes when a seller can't find a buyer, it's because people don't like that seller....

</FONT><HR>Anyway, market saturation is a problem with more than just JC. Tailoring, Blacksmithing, Jewelcraft. Any trade skill that produces non 'consumed' items. The issue isn't something that can be directly fixed under this game engine (IMHO). The only real solution is item degredation and/or destruction. Something has to be consistantly removing items from the game. (Not just money)<P>But that's a whole other thread, and doesn't apply to this game, or this topic.<P>Besides, I've already been shot down upon bringing it up in the past.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Swim around until you get a swimming skill increase, and immediately combine your jewelry, if your points really are coming in spurts you'll have a much better chance of getting one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok im a lvl 54 enchanter on Tarew Marr. Everyone that knows me comes to me to do jewelry. I currently have 212 skill which to my knowledge is the highest on the server. True, theres no new jewelry, but it helps the roll when doing rare gems (jacinth/black saphhire/diamond). <P>From 200 to 212 it's cost me about 25k total to raise skill, however that cost is negated by the fact that I had a sellback of successfully made items of about 20k. So in the end it's only roughly 5k lost. <P>As far as there being too many jewelers, I wouldn't agree. People come to me because im fun to talk to, I don't charge to make it, just for platbars, and I'll go out of my way to help. Usually people will give me an extra rare gem here and there for my help. <P>I've done two plat diamond rings in a row before, and just the other day I did a plat jacinth ring, then three plat diamond rings in a row. Now , on Tarew Marr at least, plat diamond rings sell for roughly 5k plat or eqivilent in trade. If you were given a free diamond, or won one in a roll thats basically 105 plat turned into 5k. A VERY good inflation :P<P>Jewelcraft is exspensive at the earlier lvls, but it DOES get more productive at 200 skill. Don't give up! And Abashi, get them to put some more new gems/combo's in game!!!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As it is, jewelry doesnt sale anymore on the rathe. Unless you are selling rare gem (diamond, black sapphire and jacynth) jewelry, which goes for about 2000pp apiece on open market now.. (urgh)<P>Lots of trade skills were "dead". Now blacksmithing is up and running again. And after getting my skills to 196 before getting tired of spending hours upon hours with no raise, I would like to see the same with jewelry. Just a simple idea here..<P>Jewelers bag = 4 slots<P>Make some piece of jewelry on which you can stack more than 1 gem. Lets say 2.<P>Example: <BR>You need 2 plat bars and 2 gems, lets take a sapphire and black sapphire since both make platinum necklaces (gems would have to produce normally same kind of item, necklace with necklace, ring with ring, etc)Combine them and you get a necklace with the proprieties of both gems. Some combinations would be awesome, diamond + fire opal comes to mind. But then again, the success rate on doing platinum multi-gem could be very low in order to limit the number of these in circulation.<P>Personally, I do believe that items dropped from hard monsters should be good, but the best items or most useful ones should be made by players who decide to dedicate the time to making them. Hey make it even harder to reach the 250 skills if needed, but let those that decide to invest both time and money get what they worked for  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't care how old the server is, you can still make a lot of money making jewelry.<P>In fact, the older the server, often the more you can make.  Why?  Twinks with too much cash.  Sure, these people can track down guildmates to make jewelry for them, but many are impatient and want their jewelry NOW.<P>If I want to make money, I can go to East Commons during prime time and make thousands of plat if i want to stay around long enough.  Yes, there are a lot of master jewelers out there, but they are not always so easy to find.  People pay for quick service, and they know that all they have to do is tell me what they want and I will have it ready immediately (I'm a walking jewelry store and always have all metal types and stacks of a dozen different gems).<P>As far as raising jewelry skill, wait till you try it post 200.  I kept track of how many attempts it took me to gain each skill point, and it took over 3000 attempts to raise my skill from 200 to 250.  And, yes, almost all of those were platinum attempts.<P>It has definitely been worth it, however.  Platinum items all the way up to jade are now trivial.  And, most importantly, the failure rates for the rare gems (diamond, black sapphire, jacinth) have dropped off tremendously.  The reduction rate on these items alone should pay for your skill gain with just a few items if you want to market them.<P>So don't believe everything you read here.  The jewelry market is alive and well at least on the two servers I play on regularly (Quellious and E'ci, both fairly old servers)<P>And, as others mentioned,the smithing market has come alive as well.  Fine steel plate is profitable at the moment and I expect the more difficult items to be very profitable in the future (hopefully once Verant modifies drop rate on items for the tempers).<P>As far as I'm concerned the risk vs reward on both jewelry and blacksmithing are very much in line.  Any competent tradesman can recoup their investment in a relatively short period of time and start making some serious profits while having fun making items for their fellow players.<P>Cameleon, the tradeskill addict<P>Jewelcraft(250)<BR>Fletching(200)<BR>Smithing(175)<BR>Pottery(168)<BR>Baking(142)<BR>Brewing(157)<BR>Tailoring(101)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To tell you the truth you all are lucky the buy backs of the jewels is as good ss it is, in no class trade skills have as such good buy backs. And sellable to players, I just made some potions tonite and I spend 2k and raise my skill up only 3 times from a 49 to a 52 with the shops buying them back at 7gp each and not being sellable to players, who in there right mind buys a Greater regen potion for 100pp? That last only 2 mins or so? The major root for this one potion is 56pp not including the the other two and the failures for making the potions. No one is buying my potions and the shops buy back is a 10th of that?<BR>So what if at a skill rating of 190 it only cost you 5k to raise it 1 pt at that level it should I could only wish that Alchemy skill could go so high with a skill limit of your lvl-(24/25)*5 so at lvl 60 it would be 175 AT lvl 60. And what is wroste still I make sow potions still and they are trivial at 52 but my failure rates are still only 50% so out of 20 trys needing 3 roots I can make 10 sometimes I can make it 75% of the time. <BR>And I would hate to see the Tinker skills.

</FONT><HR>In response to the baking question - pies, friend, lots and lots of pies &lt;grin&gt;.  Dough + pie pan + vegetables or berries or chunks of meat.<P>Thanks to all of you who actually answered my question!<P>For some reason Abashi seemed to take this as an "I can't make money off of jewelry" whine.  I wasn't discussing skill profitability but rather screwy random numbers that seemed to begin at a certain skill level.  As I said, I have a 142 in baking, 176 in smithing and 191 in jc.  I'm very familiar with the 'streaks' which annoy the hell out of me.  Nothing for two stacks and then three raises in a row.  A few failures in a row after a stack of successes, etc.<P>However, when I hit this skill level the failures became much more frequent and the skill raises much *less* freqent, and this with having significantly improved my intelligence since my last push with skills.<P>The rest of you answered my question, tho' - the random generator does seem to be screwy after 190.  I used the 1K to show how much it took because I hadn't counted the number of gems I went through and I'm not the type to number crunch (fail 2 out of 5, sell 3 back to merchant for roughly same cost as components, use money to buy new components until the money and components were gone)<P>I'm still not too sure about the overall profitability of JC over the life of the skill, but I do sell and profit off the pieces I've made.  The problem is, it takes so long for me to sell pieces even at a discount rate due to the competition between jewelers on the server that if I tried to sell every single piece I made that was useful it would take months for the skill to go up.<P>Thanks again for those who let me know about the 190+ skill difficulties.  Whether or not this is a bug or 'working as intended' would be nice to know, tho.<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Jewelery is widely considered to be the most profitable trade-skill, well worth the effort, time, and investment if one can generate the business. The price of advancing the skill is appropriate given that profit opportunity.<BR>-Gordon&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>First off. Yes. JC is widely considered the most profitable trade-skill. I will agree with that. However, as I will state below, it is in no way "well worth the effort..." for most of us. And many of us find out too late and a lot poorer. So for gods sake people. If you want to start JC, have a plan. Just don't do it because it seems fun. Because at the higher points. It is very un-fun to spend so much pp to get so little skill gain. I only make things when I loot a gem and have some extra (not planned for use) pp lieing around or when a friend comes to me and hands me the bars and the gems and expects no 100% success rate.<P>Secondly, look at his post. "well worth the ... if one can GENERATE THE BUSINESS." That is the biggest problem as stated in the above posts many times. Generateing the business. There is a guild member that has stated numerous times that he could "make 20k pp easy in a week if he just focused on that". Now. I have never seen his bank account and he aint exactly wearing the finer things on the server so I have no way of confirming this. But he says it is possible. I do know that he has an add on EQTraders for his JC and I would suspect that this would help him "generate the business" needed to make JC profitable. But he is the only one that has stated such a fact. Other jewelers have said "sure, I can make a buck or two if I sell enmass" but none (except the guild member) have said "Yeah dude. I clean up quite nicely."<P>Thirdly. "The price of advancing the skill is appropriate given that profit opportunity." Huh?  But I thought you said things were based on a random number generator.<P>This is where people in the programming business tell the consumer enough to make them walk away, slighty satisfied, but not so much that they would have to spend the next hour or day explaining the exact process. And trust me, unless you are incredibly desperate for someone to talk at you or have an urge to feel what i might be like if your head suddenly exploded...you wouldn't want to know more anyways.<P>In any Rand function, you can add operators to it. (I'm a little rusty, been a while since I even looked at some code, let alone coded anything.) Now, these operators can be specified to interact with the Rand function in a myraid of ways, all giving slighty different results. I think, that at each skill point, the operator changes, or say, if N &lt; 7 do .... then when N &gt; 7 but &lt; 10 and when N =10 reset N. Where N is the number of mobs you have faced or the number of arrows you have shot, or the number of times you have swung, etc... So per level or per spell or per skill or etc..., the operator(s) changes slighty. So it still in essence is a "random number generator" just that the attached operator(s) cause it to function not so randomly as a PURE "random number generator" would. So. They may be useing a random number generating function but the results are in no way "completely" random. If it was "completely" random, things like Int, Str, Dex, etc... would be totally useless cept for finding out how much you can carry or how much mana you have at a given level.<P>Hope this may have cleared some stuff up. And for all those who are saying "Bah! I already knew that!". Well good for you. BTW, this is all based on my theory being correct.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>While we are off the subject. How come (and I could be remembering this incorrectly as I don't have actual data on it) in a post months ago. Abashi posted that the "newbie area" guards would get an upgrade so players would not hunt them for exp and take away protection from blahblahblah... Yet, in a post a little while ago when someone asked why some of the new uber-NPCs were in newbie grounds. Abashi posted that there are no such things as newbie areas, only areas where new players find it more productive to hunt or whatever. Again. I could be totally mistaken. So if anyone can prove me right or wrong. Have fun.<P>Ashtar Thoughtfire<BR>Bristlebane<P>P.S. If I didn't use exactly the correct lingo or the right formulae, sue me. I wasn't about to go pokeing around in my books to find it. :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok everyone, important news on Trade Skills.<P>Do them in Kaladim or Ak'kanon, or any other deserted city.  Lag does affect success rate.<P>My paladin tailors at a 4 out of 5 success rate in kaladim, but a 1 out of 9 in HighPass.  The only difference I see is about 15 percent lag.<P>I also believe this has to deal with hitting mobs.  I'm amazed that my paladin misses so much against green Greater Kobolds during peak hours in Sol B, but on a good day in East Karana, I can solo a blue Hill Giant.<P>Probably because the data feed is read with an IF statement<P>if (Skillcheck &gt; whatIsNeededToSucceed)<BR>(<BR>  Success<BR>)<BR>else<BR>(<BR>  Failure<BR>)<P>If this is how it works, anytime that lag goes up and the server perhaps doesn't receive data, the code would take the route of the else statement.<P>Just a big whopping guess, but it seems to make some sense.<P>NoseSocks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

There are hundreds more like you - who do it for guild members for cost of materials.

</FONT><HR>as a jewelcrafting enchanter I have managed to cap my skill out at 250p It took a lot of time, a lot of money but I think was worth it. It certainly is a tedious process but I kept accurate records of the entire process. Essentially at 190+ skill it takes 100 attempts to gain a skill point. Contrary to popular myth, lag seems to make no difference in failures statistically according to my records,  however I found I psychologically noticed failures more in high lag situations because of the increased time between clicking the combine button and waiting for the message to appear. Statistically there was no discernable increase in failures during high lag.<BR>Just be smart and patient about increasing your skill and it works as intended. I think verant did a good job of implementing the jewelry craft. The places where EQ falls short are in other areas of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
