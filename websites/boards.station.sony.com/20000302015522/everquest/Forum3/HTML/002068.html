</FONT><HR>Hey BootDisk,<P>Looks like I've hit on several of your posts!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Technically there is no "Roleplay" server, however, Fennin Ro is the "Unofficial" RP server.  I would strongly suggest waiting until after they split Fennin Ro before making a character there.  (Like a week or two after the split)  Note I said Unofficial.  There really isn't much RP on any of the servers.  Some yes, in character yes, but true RP, sorry to say no.<P>I'm an old time D&D player so I was looking for some RP when I signed up.  there is some, or at least in character, but I've not seen it en mass.  Good luck!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The best thing to do is find people that enjoy RPing in game, and deal with them almost exclusively. For instance, I know a group of roleplayers on one server, and keep a character there for when I'm in the mood. On another server, I don't really roleplay all that much unless someone walks up to me and is obviously in-character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hell all, Newbie here.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Anyway, I'm an avid MUSHer and love to really roleplay. I know that EQ is more like a MUD than a MUSH, but if there are players willing to RP, then I want to meet them. I had heard that Fennin Ro had more RP, so I joined there right away (sorry, I didn't know about the overcrowding). Anyway, what is this 'in character' thing? I mean, how can you tell when someone is 'in character'?<P>Another question... I had no idea there were so many servers.. is there ANY place I can go that will explain what each server is? What type of players, etc? I have yet to see any explanation anywhere.<P>Thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Coroth,<BR>    You can tell if someone is roleplaying (or at least claiming to be) by the color of their character's name.  If it is purple, they are in character.  You can activate this on your character by typing in "/roleplay", which will toggle this effect.  It makes no changes actually, but rather serves as a way to distinguish roleplayers.<BR>    Unfortunately, however, there are fewer roleplayers than i would've hoped.  Perhaps it gets better in the upper levels when people aren't as concerned with leveling.<BR>    I have nothing against people who don't roleplay.  Just doesn't seem to be as integral a part of the game as i had hoped.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I believe the CORRECT and more ACCURATE question should be:<P>Does roleplaying exist anymore anywhere?<P>This is only my opinion. At present, more than 90 percent of the player base in EverQuest do NOT roleplay. The player base has grown to become a bunch of competitive, rude, obnoxious, and conceited people. I no longer see a good roleplayer like I used to when the game first came out ten months ago. I don't care what ANYBODY says to me, but roleplaying is falling into a lost cause in such an exquisitely beautiful game.<P>I love EverQuest THE GAME. I swear I love it. But I dislike the PLAYER BASE. Sure, Verant can come up with the best fantasy online game ever, but a great game MUST HAVE GREAT PLAYERS AS WELL.<P>In regards to those who turn on the /roleplay command, that has turned into nothing but a means to remain anonymous and display your guild's name. This is because most guild officers require that the guild name be displayed with pride at all times. Other than that, if you come across a player who is in /roleplay "mode", don't expect a true roleplayer.<P>Way too many players SPAM the system. Every damn day I play EverQuest, there are so many players creating USELESS spam. Many of these spammers also use the /shout command. This is creating tremendous imbalance in the game and is by no means roleplaying. There are even many players who if you politely ask them to stop spamming, THE MORE THEY WILL SPAM!! And the more they will use the /shout command to do it! Why? And you know damn well who you are. Why must people talk about things that have NOTHING to do with the game and roleplaying? Why must you constantly spam the system while your fellow players are trying to play as well in peace?<P>Do not tell me that all I have to do is turn off shout and OOC. That is not a solution to end spamming. Why should the non-spammers have to turn off shout and ooc when spammers are NOT supposed to spam in the first place? The /shout and /ooc commands were implemented for necessary gameplay purposes. They were never meant to be tools for spam. If I turn off /shout and /ooc, then I will miss a lot of the players who ARE using /shout and /ooc for the RIGHT things. Think about it. What if someone needs help or assistance? What if I could be the one who could help out that person, but I couldn't because I had to turn off my /shout and /ooc therefore missing that person's request for help? This is my whole point on why spamming creates a TREMENDOUS imbalance in the game. Don't tell ME to turn off my /shout and /ooc. YOU stop spamming so that I can play EverQuest in peace and the way EverQuest was meant to be played.<P>As you can see, the game EverQuest WAS MEANT to be a complete roleplaying experience. Come on guys, don't blame Verant. Blame yourselves for not roleplaying properly.<P>As for myself, I am not perfect as well. I will openly admit that I have shyed away from true roleplaying. This is because the player base is getting out of hand. Honestly, when EverQuest first came out, I gave it my best roleplaying. For months the player base was filled with high-standard roleplayers. Lately, this is no longer the case.<P>I am pessimistic about how the player base will become once Ruins of Kunark will release. I foresee more competition, and less roleplaying. Verant is slowly doing their part. They came out with a spectacular game, and they are updating it and finally upgrading it. But that's all Verant can do. They present the product, we the players must make the most out of the product. If a game is beautiful, user friendly, easy to learn, and presents a vast range of possibilities, that makes it an outstanding PRODUCT. But if the players who use this product refuse to roleplay properly and effectively, then this product will never become an outstanding GAME.<P>Players must stop the useless spamming, players must learn how to group well intelligently and strategically, players must stop scamming and kill stealing one another, and most of all, players have got to stop being so damn competitive and "better than everyone else".<P>This is not an issue of whether your character is "good" or "evil". This is about truly knowing the difference between roleplaying and imbalance.<P>BootDisk, to answer your question in only one sentence...ROFL...<P>ALL the servers were meant to be roleplaying, it is the player base that defies this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002068&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002068&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
