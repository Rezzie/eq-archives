&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Very nice thoughts on everyone's part. I am posting here because this is not a terribly long thread and I hope Absor reads this far. Here is what I think all classes should be (this is my opinion, but after playing EverQuest for a year and a half now, I think I know how it works)<P>Bard: Jack of all trades, Master of none<BR>Cleric: Best Healers without dispute<BR>Druid: Best traveler's/utility class<BR>Enchanter: Best crowd control/speed increasing buffs<BR>Magician: Second Best in Direct Damage, Best Pet<BR>Monk: Best at pulling, Second best in melee damage<BR>Necromancer: Best DoT's, Best at soloing, Unique Lifetaps<BR>Paladin: Good defensive Warrior with heals<BR>Ranger: Good offensive Warrior with utility spells<BR>Rogue: Best melee damage dealer<BR>SK: Good defensive Warrior with DoT's and pulling ability<BR>Shaman: Best Debuffs/Buffs<BR>Warrior: Best at absorbing damage, third best melee damage dealer<BR>Wizard: Best Direct Damage without dispute<P>If you balanced classes according to this, everything would work out imho. For instance, at one point in thier EQ life, mages get a better DD than wizards (level 34). Think how unfair that is considering what wizards have to go through in order to be able to say "We can deal more damage than you in a shorter period of time. Period" At this point, mages take that right away from wizards along with getting the best pets. Another case is that druids and shamans (if the current changes on test go through), are going to infringe on the clerics undisputed ability as the best healer. I personnaly would take a shaman after this change for a few reasons. One, they get slow spells so less damage is actually done to the tanks. Two, they get regeneration along with statistical increasing buffs. Three, they can heal almost as good as a cleric. With these factors combined, the shaman ends up not only being a better healer, but also a better person to have in a group in general. Clerics should get more effective heals to balance this. After all, they have to put up with having basically no utility spells at all (no invis? warriors even get invis!), and very limited soloing ability (face it Verant, some people would rather solo than rely on someone else that may get you killed). Thank you for reading my post, and I apologize if it wasn't about monks specifically, but this seemed as good a place to post it as any.<P>                      Sincerely Concerned,<BR>                       Drakaren Dragonslayer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hello....some of you know me, some of you don't.<P>i am a lv 56 monk on the rathe server, and i have been reading the posts above. in regards to what i would like to see, i would have to say the dmg output should be increased, the defense skills (aka dodge, block, and riposte) should also be increased to the 255 cap before lv 60. <P>i'd also like to not fail fd as much.. let me give an example of this. me and a member of my guild were trying to pull lord dijon (i couldn't say the rest of his name if you spelled it out for me) in velk. we both died at least 3 times each, and this was because every time we pulled, we failed fd. BOTH OF US. how irritating can it be? the skill is 200 for crying out loud. &lt;end rant&gt;<P>i would also like to see a progression on the ac of our high level armor. why is it the rowf has the same exact ac as the rolc, the robe NEEDED for the rowf? shouldn't we get more of an ac bonus for getting the 2nd robe? (and if that was the fact, shiver arms would have 12ac plus stats which would make me wear them instead of the azure i've had for 30+ levels) &lt;end rant again....sorry&gt;<P>seeing as how rogues, warriors, and rangers get crits in one way or another, i think monks should get it on barefisted punches, along with the 1h attacks and such being applied to the offhand. and speaking of rogues, why is it they get a chance for a double backstab at 55, whereas monks don't get anything along those lines, save for thunderkick which is a lame discipline in it's own rights with the refresh time and the amnt of dmg dealt &lt;yeah i love seeing "Posch lands a Thunderous Kick (24)"...c'mon&gt; where's our chance for a double fk based on level, or even triple attack at 55?<P>i do wish we didn't have to be weapon dependant tho. we're monks. if you read the description of your class when you made the char, it basically states that monks go with the bare necessities, that we don't need weapons....that we're our own weapons. that being said, why make us camp uber rare spawns for uber rare weapons? &lt;hence previouis posts on the spawn times of monk quest mobs and such&gt;<P>another thing i would personally like, is different armor graphics for our velious armor. every other class gets new graphics, and yet, the plane of growth monk armor looks just like cured silk or shiver. yeah the monk tunic from western wastes looks damn nice, but again, it's a rare drop off an uber mob &lt;sighs&gt;...granted, this isn't a combat enhancement, but c'mon....<P>i like the idea of fd having a mssg saying that %T sees through your attempt to fd or something like that, and for resisted spells not to break fd. and why not let the monks pull with fd in kunark and beyond? isnt' that something important to our classes? being able to use our skills to help our group? makes sense to me that we should have some advantage to a warrior/pal/sk running throughout a dungeon and bringing a number of npc's back to the group.<P>please Absor, consider what the monks are asking for based on comparisons to what the warriors/rogues have as weapons, their dmg base vs ours, their ac vs ours, and other important factors that should allow us to be the class as intented pre 50. life after 50 is harsh for monks now ):</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lying?  Ooookayyy....<BR>All I really have to say to that post is that the tranquil staff is generally not sought after because of it's damage output.  It's so coveted because of the 100 blows proc, which is an unresistable stun that can affect dragons, giants and gods (unlike normal stuns).  It does _not_ do as much damage at high levels as celestial fists, or even a runed fighter's staff.  Please do not take the tranquil staff's damage output as indicative of what we want, because it is not.  It is desirable because of it's effect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I got a good laugh out of some of the earlier posts about Monks just running out and buying their gear. This boy has never even seen a Monk played. I was a fool to make a Monk as my first character. If I had made a Mage/Necro I'd easily be 60 by now and have a load of cash in the bank, with which to twink out my nice new Monk. "This class is of MODERATE difficulty." Bull, try "EXTREME difficulty." You might want to change that one on the character creation screen.<P>Instead, making a Monk first, now at 45th level, the grand total of all money to ever pass through my character in items and cash is about 10k platinum, and that's just because I have a lot of friends in my guild who see my predicament. I have a /play of 55 days.<P>No way can I loot anything from dungeons. The ac hit makes me into a wet tissue incapable of soloing mid-high greens. This means no fine steel, no nice rare drops, and NO cash. 50pp is enough to take me over my limit right now.<P>Weight reducing bags don't help much when they weigh 3 each. I'm forever stuck in other people's good graces when it comes to loot and cash. There aren't many ppl with good graces on my server, at least that I've grouped with. Greed is a very big factor in this game, and I liked being a monk because I didn't have to give a **** about the loot. People couldn't believe it when I turned down rolls for things. Nevermind that it weighs 10 stone and would hit me with a 30ac penalty that I can't afford if I want to be worth something to my group.<P>Luclin's economy has collapsed to the point where out EC selling spree is nothing but an eternal scam. I couldn't sell a wraithbone hammer there for 400pp, and people want you to pay 10k for a FBSS. Selling items in that kind of environment is enough to make you want to stop playing.<P>I've currently got a mage that I am twinking the hell out of for one reason - to make money for my Monk. Once I get him up to about 40 I'll finally have a cash income so I can afford to make my monk useful again by buying the uber-loot that "anyone can easily afford." Nevermind the fact that I've got to create and level a new character to do it, that's easy, right?<P>I've almost quit playing EQ three times now because of the impossible bull that I have to put up with to get new gear. I've put up with plenty of jibes from group members joking about how sad my damage was between 30-40. The fists at 40 start coming into their own but before that I was pretty much wasted in a group with the single exception of pulling, something Verant doesn't want us to do anymore.<P>Must be nice to have someone over at Verant that "defends" their favorite class. Absor, someone over there must have a Monk. Find out who the heck it is and have a very long talk with him about these issues. You can't possibly understand it unless you've been there yourself. Try out a Monk yourself, you may find you like it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks<BR>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>Servant of the Tranquil<BR>45 Monk, Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I completely support Zadkiel/Bodi's post made earlier, as well as Xaoshaen's post (top of page two of this thread).  I would also like to summarize my own thoughts.<P>1) Flying Kick -- This move demonstrates absolute mastery of a monk's fighting technique.  To connect with a Flying Kick for only 3 damage is a disgrace, and really hurts our ability to deal damage.  Once this skill hits 200, it would be nice to give it a minimum damage equal to our level, just like the Rogue's backstab.<P>2) Spell interrupts -- I've read many suggestions on this subject.  Attatching a stun or interrupt to Flying Kick would be a bad idea.  The attack is already very powerful, and one interrupt every three rounds is not enough, IMO.  Attatching an interrupt to a weaker, faster attack such as Dragon Punch/Tail Rake or Eagle Strike would me more useful, and would give us a reason to keep at least one other attack skill trained.  It would also force us to choose between high damage and spell interrupt in the midst of a combat situation.<P>3) Skills -- All three pure melee classes get a set of disciplines between levels 51 and 60.  In addition, Warriors get Tripple Attack post-50, and Rogues get Double Backstab post-50.  What skills do monks get post-50?  None, as far as I can tell.  An increase to our weight limit does not count as a skill.  It is entirely useless, considering every monk has had to put up with it for 50+ levels and has gotten used to it.  Monks need some new skill beyond 50th level that reflects their mastery of hand-to-hand combat.  I like the idea of chain-linked special attacks, suggested several times on this thread.  It is original enough that we're not just mimicking warriors with our own tripple attack, and it gives us a reason to keep ALL of our specials maxed.<P>4) Armor and Weapons -- We can all stop pretending that monks are supposed to be effective with minimal armor.  This hasn't been true since the opening of the game.  If it were, monks would have a much higher naked AC to make up for the dismal armor selection we have been given.  Our naked AC could be increased to make up for this, or we could be given a larger selection of *good* armor sets.  And no more pieces like that garbage you call Shiverback.  It should be something worth working for.  Also, I am a firm believer that a monk's primary fighting method should be his/her fists, and we should be able to stay competitive in the damage-dealing field with hand-to-hand fighting.  Our fists' base damage should be increased beyond level 50.  If not, then there should be some other benefit to sticking with H2H that late in your character's lifetime.  It isn't right that those who abandon the true nature of a monk be rewarded with increased combat effectiveness.<P>These are my thoughts on the monk class.  I would hope that you and the design team will find them reasonable and give them some consideration when the time comes for class balancing.<P>Thank you<P>Faeandor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Try to remember when you define the monk's role (you the players) as a 'premier puller' that VERANT's view of FD pulling is 'barely this side of an exploit, and we'd really like to eliminate it, if we could figure out a way that wouldn't break FD completely.'<P>Verant isn't likely to enhance this. &lt;grin&gt;<P>Monks need some reason to exist for groups OTHER than pulling.  They should, yes, be roughly like a warrior, but one who avoids damage rather than soaking it up, and does more damage faster.  Otherwise, they're just a mana sink for healers, and one that can't taunt.<P>Perhaps Flying Kick could have a 'taunt' added to it, other than the increase for damage done?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that monks, through their description, should easily do the most melee damage over any other class in the game.  Rogues have a slight advantage over us since at lvl 60 groups would rather have rogues than monks.  To change this I suggest that rogues remain what they were intended to be, high damaging scouts.  Give them internal sow or something, I dont care, but please either decrease their max damage or give monks a better best weapon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
