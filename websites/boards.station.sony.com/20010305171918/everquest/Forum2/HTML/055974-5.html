</FONT><HR>Well After playing a Druid to 50 completely solo (big mistake, i dont recommend it) as well as a necromancer into almost 40 now, i decided to play a cleric. As far as balance for levels 1-30 here's what I see...<P>clerics are master of nothing until superior heal. At level 20 most tanks have 3-500hp, which means 5 casts of healing that both you or a druid or a shaman can do just as well as the other. We get greater heal 5 levels sooner than druids, but how's that gonna help the real noob cleric with 120 wis? maybe two casts and oom? In zones like lake of ill omen there could be over 120 players on and only 5 clerics max. you'd think there'd be tons of folks asking for clerics but they are not - i was once told 'sorry we prefer a druid'<P>heh - where were these folks when my druid was levle 20? :P<P>Anyway if the Vision(tm) as it pertains to clerics means unmatched healing ability, then make it as such. I realize how the models and spell system works so any change would require either removing current spells, adding new spells, or both. clerics should have a healing spell at each spell circle. So between the 100hp healing and 300hp gheal, maybe a 200hp healing spell at 19 that costs 120 mana? then something between gheal and sheal at 29 that does 450hp? add regeneration, chloroplast and something BETTER than chloroplast at 24, 34 and 52?<P>If clerics are to be the masters of healing, make it as such. Certaintly you wouldnt give a cleric group teleports, the ability to turn into an animal, the ability to self illusion, so why spread out our best abilities to other classes only 5 levels apart?<P>My two coppers worth...<P>Narrisse<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Torvonnilous Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a level 35 cleric. I have faught with the same Ranger sense level one. Clerics, IMO have to be one of the most overlooked, boring classes I have ever played. They need drastic improving. Being a walking bandaid is fine, but when a player controlling 2 characters on 2 computers, can take over your job healing and STILL be playing the Ranger (Tank), somthing is despertly wrong. Many nights I go to bed, and my husband plays both characters, and the reason he can is because all a cleric does is "Stand, Heal, Sit, Stand, Heal, Smite, Sit, Stand, Heal". No brainer. Heh I dare say they are so simplistic in playing that Verant could write an AI for them in no time.<P>First of all Clerics need Mana to be handled differently. You realize a cleric spends 95% of their first half of life staring at a spell book? And the other half sitting down staring at everyone else having fun? (I personally think taking the book screen away at 35 is really mean....now we get to watch what we are missing, and will miss for the rest of our play years as a cleric in Norrath). Clerics should have perma mana regen on at all times starting from level 20 or so. Cleric's recieve power from their Deity, not from physically starring at a spellbook or concentrating on the flow of mana from around them (like a mage). Clerics however should be REQUIRED every 2 or so levels to do somthing for the church to "earn" the divine power they are being granted. Quests should be random, and do-able by the cleric SOLO. If the cleric does not do the quest then the mana "regen" they are granted is taken from them, forcing them to "sit". ( programing wise this should be easy to do....a triggerable perma clarity effect that is turned off at a certain level if the clarity effect is not "refreshed" by handing an item to a member of the clerics church, and by programing it like this you could increase the mana regen to handle the increased mana supply a cleric would get as they leveled)<P>Second: Cleric's melee is a joke. Clerics coudn't melee thier way out of a paper bag, unless they have umber weapons and armor. Increase a Cleric's Defense and increase the likly hood of Defense advancment per mob hit on clerical characters. At level 35 (when you lose yer spell book) melee skills should stop advancing and total mana gained per level should be increased.<P>Third: Allow warriors the ability to bandage ALL the way to full health IF a cleric is IN the party. (If your feeling particularly nice, allow them to bandage to full when any healer character is in the party)-this would save ALOT of down time-<P>Fourth- Give Clerics at level 50+ a perma area effect undead life sap ability. A high level cleric should be viewed by undead as a holy luminating person, blinding and painful to be around. All undead in a small area around the Cleric should take damage.....you could even make it a gradual increase -at level 50 creatures are blinded, at 51 they are blinded and take 1dmg, 52 blinded and take 2dmg,- and so on)<P>Fifth- Clerics should be able to get small faction increases if they use a "preach" skill. Preaching could also work as an area effect Lull spell. Preaching done should effect party members of the same religion by slightly increasing stats. At very high levels preaching could possibly lower damage done to tanks in combat ( by lowering the frenzy rate of the mobs) or impart divine help by increasing ac in combat. Preaching could also work like a mez spell. This would spice up the clerical class alot.<P>Well I am sure I could come up with more, but I want to go play =)<P>Lady Eternity</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just an idea about the Donals BP. I have read some of the ideas about changing the effect and I would like to add my 2 cents worth.  I think this is an excelent item for a rescue heal.  If the effect was a quick casting (1 or 2 sec) heal over time that tapered down, like a reverse splurt, say 1000 heal first tick, 800 heal second tick and so on till it was down to 2 or 4 hps per tick.  The effect could be made to last 10 or 15 min, in which time it couldn't be cast again on the same person.  This would give the cleric a heal option for situations where he might not be able to cast a ch or other heal spell fast enough to save a group members life.  It would also give the cleric the ability to heal himself if he agros mobs on himself, without worrying about interuption.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Only a few things i think should be done :<P><BR>- Fix/Change/hax0r the fizzle rate on Divine Light. As you undoubtedly have heard its ridiculous to fizzle a level 53 spell 50% of the time at level 60.<P>- Change/Alter Fortitude : Currently not good for much of anything, as group hero is more effective for an entire group ( more hp/ saved mana for more efficient spell )<P>Change/Alter Mark of Karn : Replace with something closer to the original design, ie no dual wield gimping, no delay/hp ratios. What i think me and most clerics would like is a return to the old style of "x hp per hit". Add more penalties to the old formula, like mana cost, recast time, resist rate<P>Destroy/Overhaul Unswerving Hammer of Faith : This is basically a sick joke to most high level clerics. No one wanted a pet - people would like a usefull spell of some sort though. Either a completly new spell to replace the current one, or a significant revamp ( note : upgrade ) to the old one.<P><BR>As a non-spell request, id like verant to look at the cleric epic quest ; specifically the gigantic bottleneck created in the zordak ragefire part. Making nagafen be down is almost a low blow, considering to actually kill zordak you have to be of significantly higher level than is possible to kill nag. A change of some sort is warranted.<P><BR>Thanks for your time.<P><BR>Valia D`Buh<BR>Level 60 Band-Aid<BR>Legacy of Steel<BR>Nameless<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's another thing that clerics hate about raids and that's the cost of symbols!  I'm expected to keep a bunch of tanks in symbols that cost me 12.5p per tank per hour.  I can spend 300p easily during the course of a raid.  And I may never get a thing from it.<P>What incentive is there for clerics to go to Fear? First off, almost nothing clerical drops there.  Secondly, if I do go to help my friends, I'll be buffing tanks like crazy with symbols because I'll be one of the very few clerics up there.  I'll probably be spending over 100p an hour.  Yet what will I get?  Gee, could this be one reason why clerics don't go to Fear?<P>The cost of symbols is WAY out of whack.  And Fear needs to have more stuff for clerics drop.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see three major balance problems between clerics and other classes...<P>1) You claim we are the best healers, but I say we are not.  Shamens and Druids both get a mana regen rate that allows them to cast more heals over time.  In one battle, we can heal better that the shamens or druids given the same amount of mana.  However, over the period of an hour, they can cast more heals due to the mana regen.  I have not done the numbers, but this would nullify our 10% bonus we are given for heals.  So, given a group that hunts for a couple hours, a druid or shamen healer will heal more hit points in that hour than the cleric counterpart if they use their mana regen spells.<BR>Solution?  Give us a mana regen spell that allows us to keep up.  This would make sense if explained by saying that the Cleric is praying and recieving the extra regen rate from thier diety.<P>2)  The cleric is boring to play compared to other classes.  Heal, med, heal, med... Sound familiar?  Thats all that you do after level 25 in a group, with occassional buffs when needed.  <BR>Solution?  I know I would have fun beating on a mob (even though i don't do much damage.)  Maybe add a med while standing at 40? or 50?  That way we can at least melee ineffectively on a mob and have some fun.  The other suggestion would be to make clerics able to solo undead.  That way we have another option than the heal/med routine in a group.  To do this you could possibly add a undead only snare and/or undead only dots?<P>3) Cleric symbol line costs way to much money to cast.  Compared to other casting classes that have spells with a reagent, Clerics are shelling out the most money.  <BR>Solution?  Either make the reagent cost less money, or make the buff last longer.<P>Other problems that aren't necessarily balance issues:<BR>- Summoned hammers line is useless<BR>- Yaulp line is useless since we never melee</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please give Clerics some kind of ability to stop casting a spell mid cast. I think it fits into roleplaying as well as just a smart thing to do. I know there are few things I hate worse than starting a CH on a tank only to have the mobs attention turn to a caster in the group and have the caster beaten to death before the end of the CH cast time. If I could see "Hey my tank is not being attacked anymore but my enchanter is" then I should be able to cancel my cast on the tank and turn my attention to the enchanter. I think it stinks to have to wait 8 or 9 seconds for the CH to finish casting only to watch my enchanter die becuase I could not heal him. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics need something worth doing besides Resing people on our spare time, we need some kind of trade skill worth training in. My cleric has 63 training points but there isn't anything good to put them on. I'm not sure what the new trade skill could be but perhaps it could be a new ability as well.<P>Clerics should get some kind of caster oriented disipline like faster mana regen, no fizzle, or cast while running disipline. That would help out for tough situations like not having mana for healing when your group is dying. There could be like a "mend skill for mana" giving you 25% mana every 5 mins. That would be really helpful.<P>Invisibility for Clerics would be a definite plus. Resurrections are hard to do in zones with live mobs then they are with zones with lots of undead. It would help clerics with corpse retrievals as well as getting our buts kicked trying to make a break for it when we think mobs aren't looking.<P>Bash would be nice, it would help us do a tad more dmg. it could be something else worth dumping some points to. <P>We need higher defense/dodging. That would at least give our tanks more time to taunt before we die in 5 seconds by being mauled by monsters.<P>That is my input for a cleric looking for something with puting skill points to.<P>-Ramadin Belmont<BR>52 Cleric (Vicar)<BR>Fennin Ro </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have played a cleric from day one in EQ.  I  think the cleric is a fairly balanced class in the game.  Alot of the problems arise for a cleric from level 19 to 48.  The biggest problem I see is our spells need some fixes.  So here goes.  Flash of light and Yaulp lines are a waste.  Give these to the Pali's and replace them for us.  The reckless strenght line has never been used by me.  Maybe you should drop the negative effect and just make it a strenght buff that decreases 1 ever tick back to the characters original strength.  Would be nice for the group when them shamans are not around.  At low level we kick ass verses undead at high level we do not fix this.  The velious undead dot increase the damage and add a couple more.  An undead snare or lull series would be nice.  The hammer line (LOL) drop all after the first one or increase the stats.  There is nothing wrong with a 29 or 34 level spell Boon of the gods  a hammer with a wis add.  Get rid of the summoned dd's and sense summoned what a waate.  A 39 ranger has the same spell as a 39 cleric.  Lets replace these with something more useful. The symbol components for from about 1pp to 14pp?  This should be fixed since we are generally the poorest class to 49.  Atone should have a time component so I can go by the mob I cast it on or get away from the mob.  We would not need invis if atone had the time component. Move greater heal to 19.  Give a regen type spell at 29 similar to divine purpose only not self only.  If you fix what we currently have then the need is less for some of the silly adds people are requesting.  Please do not use the argument not all spells can be "A" list spells.  We only have heals and buffs that are "A" list spells as it is.  If you seriously look at these spell changes I have suggested then you will see we still have plenty of "B" and "C" list spells.<P>Quist of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, you guys at verant are really missing the point of playing a cleric. At higher levels alll we really do is sit on our ass med and rez which is quite frankly boring as hell. The reason people play clerics at all over 50 is because we, well we used to be, absolutely needed for any high level function. Guys, being indispensible was all our class really had and you have taken it away. Dont tellme we have better heals and that should make us happy-- yippe i can heal more , so what! oh i forgot i get to buff people, hmmm, 500pp a week on symbols good deal. Given the diversity of group and solo options most classes have i dont see the point of playing a cleric anymore. As a test may i suggest you go to any server and do a who all 50 60 cleric and your handy work will become evident. Given the prospect of having to beg for groups now i think ill retire my cleric. <P>p.s. no additions to this class will really make a diffrence since the only real point of playing this class has been taken away.

</FONT><HR>I wish Verant would widen their scope of what a higher level cleric does. There are alot of neat ideas in this thread but I'm afraid they will be brushed aside because in Verant's eyes the cleric is only there to heal, buff, and rez.<P>Ther cleric is the #1 class that you don't want to have 2 of in your group because of its very narrow yet specialized abilities. I think the only other class that groups wouldn't want 2 of is the enchanter (but that can be debated at least).<P>It would be nice if Verant would at least acknowledge the severe boredom of the class and help make it a little more diverse. Why do I play a cleric? Well, someone had to do it when my friends and I started up because Verant has made it so you can't play the high level game without one. And I drew the short straw :P<P>If I didn't have a TV to watch I never would have made it.<P><BR>Zurians<BR>55th Templar<BR>Tholuxe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm....i'd like to put some perspective on this.  Verant will most likely NOT add anything to any class that other classes have as a charesteristic of that class.  Clerics will NEVER get the regen lline of spells.....druids/shamys do.<P>Also clerics are better at heals, as well as getting them before shamys/druids.  Cleric spells cost less mana and heal more compared with the druid/shamy spell of the same name (20% i believe).<P>Saying a druid 51 would replace a cleric is laughable.  As the arguement at torvonillous.net is going CH is the best heal spell in the game.  The higher in level you get the better it gets.  /shrug it can be hard to time, but it is still the most efficent and largest heal in the game.<P>This is how i look at it, healing wise.  If a group needs someone to mes i'd prefer a chanter.  Yet i can make due with a necro/bard/root parker.  Would i rather have a chanter? yep, but i make do with what i got.  Same with healing.  Group needs someone to heal i'd prefer a cleric.  Yet (with changes) i can make due with a shamy/druid.  It simply makes group more viable post 50.<P>Really the best idea I have heard so far is to have casters med regardless of what bodily position they in after a certain level.  One of the things that makes the game so boring for ANY caster (after melee viability) is that its cast, then sit back down.  To do anything else is robbing the group out of effectiveness.  However it is quite boring.  I do understand the need for downtime but this wouldnt reduce downtime, it would simply make melee more viable for casters, and make the game less boring.<P>Clerics, if you want to solo make a druid, necro, mage or other soloing class.  Same as warriors/rogues its not worth the effort.<P>BTW for this guy, <BR>&lt;i&gt;5000 minutes.. that's how long it would take me to solo my way through lvl 30.

</FONT><HR>I know you said you were looking for ideas that would make being a cleric more fun.  What about...<P><BR>---------- Holy Water ----------<BR>At some level clerics should get the ability (or a spell) to enchant pods of water and turn them into pods of holy water.  These pods could then be hurled at undead creatures causing a certain amount of UNRESISTABLE DD (and possibly stun) if hit.  The higher lvl the cleric that blesses the water, the greater the effect.  In addition, possibly these pods could be consumed to eliminate poison and disease.  Anyway you get the idea.<P><BR>--------- Prayer -----------<BR>Clerics should have the ability (skill) to pray to their respective gods and be granted a slight boost to mana regenteration if successful (spell type effect like breeze).  self only....<P><BR>--------- Holy Touch -----------<BR>Like the Shadow Knight ability Harm touch, and Paladin's Lay Hands.  Causes Harm to undead, grants a buff to PC's.<P><BR>Anyway, just a few possible ideas.... <P>                            -Kzanol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Giving the cleric class a desent pet or letting us bring back to life a critter we killed and making that our pet.  Celestial Healing = Make it work when you are poisoned or diseased or dotted.<BR>Clerics should have some spell like others for mana regen, and Should be able to recieve mana from our gods like medding but we should not need to sit for it (Being we look at 6 people and the mob).  Yes we need invis.  Yes we need see invis. We are Clerics we need to see and be not seen from who ever needed.  I dont really care about doing much dmg with our weapons.  And yes give us DMF or similar spell.  Port to our temples or area is good with evac.... being we save lifes !<BR>Do something with the summond hammer spells make them pets and a hammer to use,  We sux at solo make it a little more fun for clerics  Druids can port everywhere then port others everywhere they can run fast snare dot have a pet HEAL (fun) Shamans can be a bear run fast have a pet Heal (fun) Cleric Heal !  ZZZZzzzzz.  if they can heal let us have a pet and invis then we can be a team !   /shout lvl xx cleric LFG     and sit there cause nobody wants to come get u or ehh we have a druid or shammy for heals   who needs a cleric :: ((   NO NO NO   DO SOMETHING PLZ !  ok we get a cool res at 49  but MANA then cause we our grouped res him her him her and and   then ur stuck no pp no exp and then u got to buff peeps for 10 to 13pp each  hehehe  thats BS !

Clerics will NEVER get the regen lline of spells.....druids/shamys do.  &lt;&lt;<P><BR>Hmmm.  Clerics considered Superior Healing and Remedy as part of their class defining spells.  Notice, those are going away.  So obviously healing is a shared ability.<P>If one wants to consider class defining spells for druids and shaman, it would not be the healing regeneration line, rather the Spirit of Wolf.  At least in my opinion.<P>If the druid and shaman professions are unbalanced at uber levels due to lack of healing, then that needs to be changed.  However, when a shaman nearly doubles the healing ability of a cleric at 33rd level, then the balance is clearly swung entirely over to the shaman's side.<P>Levels 19 - 33 are utterly imbalanced when considering clerics vs other healing professions.  This is a legitimate balance issue.<P><BR>Riffi Gemstone<BR>gnomish vicar<BR>Bertoxxulous server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well. I'll be brief on this one:<P>1) undead only damage shield. If anyone should be able to get one, a cleric should.<BR>2) invis. Man, have you ever died in a zone where you were camping the big spawn of the zone (ie: Cazic Thule and the Avatar of Fear) and the group had to run back to a safe place and run back through to the spot they were at, taking time and possibly dying again because you were "naked" and without any armor on, but since you were keeping your group healed, they attack you (oh yes, this includes if you tried memming the Divines but the time it takes for recast didn't appear) and you got destroyed AGAIN, losing more exp?<P>3) I know we are the only wis based casters that can't get mana back quicky (ie: shamans and cannibalize) and I'm pretty sure most if not all int based casters have a way of replenishing mana..... why not clerics? Before someone commented on something that stuns you and gives you back 30% of mana, thinking of most cases I've been in, that might stun might happen too long and someone dies.<P>4) self only TPs to different diety stations would help alot, how these would work I dunno. But I guess you could try having a "shrine" at each of the dieties' temples or what have you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics really just need something to alleviate the boredome, because in reality we follow the same kind of med/heal/buff pattern our entire EQ lives, and if anyone tries to play different from that they get shot down. <P>Not to mention people are so demanding of clerics sometimes, that + tedium has made many clerics quit outright. At least give us something to make it all worthwhile.<P>some things I'd like to comment on<P>Magic resist: from what I hear, the higher you get the more useless you stuns/roots will be vs some mobs.. <P>Also, playing on a pvp server, clerics are the absolute bottom of the food chain, offensive wise. Sure, I can run that higher lvl wizard OOM but the 60-70% mana I have left wont be able to kill him, if he knows what hes doing. If clerics were to get some kind of debuff, like a curse type spell I would be very pleased, in both PvE and PvP.<P>Of course, this is infringing upon the enchanter spell line, but enchanters have a very wide assortment of spells to chose from, so I'm sure it wouldn't be imbalancing. Hell, your giving druids our heals anyways.<P>Self only invis? Well, that would be nice. Allthough there are items that give invis, which are more of a clerical moneysink tho.<P>Spell Components - Lower prices would be nice.<P>Oh well.<P>Jaige<BR>Dark Elf Cleric, Tallon Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The one thing that made my cleric 5 times as fun as before was when I hit 35th level and never had to look at my spell book again.  I mean, I sat through 35 levels of not feeling involved in any of the battles my group was partaking in, because I couldn't see what was going on.<P>I saw this suggestion up above and I think it would go along way to make people very happy about playing thier characters.  Allow casters (clerics and wizzies especially, but all casters included) to meditate while standing/fighting.  With our low skill caps and far inferior weapons, we don't add all that much damage in a fight.  At least we could then get in on the action some of the time and "feel" more involved.  <P>Obviously it should be only at higher levels, maybe 45 or 50, when our weapon caps are so low compared to mob defenses that we don't really do a heck of a lot.. some but not much.  I am not sure if this change should be included for hybrids as well, that might be over balancing.  However it might go some way towards making them feel more useful in plane raids and such.  If they never had to waste time sitting down while the warriors/rogue/monks were ready to go at all times, it would certainly make them feel more useful instead of being a burden on the group.<P>I also think that Clerics equiped with a shield should be able to bash or if you find that too overpowering, then give them the slam ability when sheild is equiped (1 point of damage and stun).  It should be a lower skill cap than melee types for sure, but almost every cleric uses a sheild in thier off hand... you'd think that they'd know how to use them in combat at least somewhat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Assume a naked cleric with max WIS during creation.  Our hammers are a joke, at 45+ we can't even out-melee a creature 25 levels below us.  At this point we have no armor.  Our DD spells are okay, except that you won't be able to kill a high green with them.  We have no ability to give us faster running, so we can't out-run 'em.<P>Invisibility and see invisibility is the least you can do for the cleric.<P>I like many of the other ideas as well, but I'm going to vote with my dollars for invisibility above anything else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are a few ideas for us clerics (Primarily Evil, since I play a DE :P)<P>1.  I have noticed how similar our line of undead spells are to a necromancer.  We get our undead bashing spells at about the same rate as necros and necros and evil clerics even share a few spells through their Symbols of Innoruuk.  Well, I figured that since clerics will never get a decent pet, which is fine, I don't think we should even have that summoned hammer, we should be able to charm undead creatures.  Perhaps make this available to evil clerics only, through a clickable effect on an item such as their symbol line.  Or just a new spell will be nice as well  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2.  I LOVE our Symbol of Innoruuk jewlrey.  I did not know of it until I was level 45, and the quest was FUN.  It was the first quest I enjoyed doing and you didn't have to camp something for 10 hours.  The clinging darkness effect on the Reagent Symbol is very nice, but I think very shortlived for the long casting time.  Perhaps another add-on quest could be created that will have the effect of the lvl 12 necro spell Englufing Darkness.  It has a much longer duration than clinging darkness.  It is still a low level snare/dot and I think it will give us clerics a new toy to play with and will help further balance our classes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Sendaven Shadowhealer<BR>49 Cleric<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have heard some good ideas and some not so good ideas.  So here is my opinion.<P>The dark elf talisman quests, for dark elf clerics is a real good idea.  I would like to see more implemented for all other cleric races that have useful abilities.<P>The big thing i kept hearing about is how druids/shamans are infringing on the clerics healing ability.  As long as we have Cheal this will never be true.  Maybe a slight increase in all our other healing ablities like a slight lower cast time or mana usuage.  Like mentioned previously i also heard clerics get a bonus to there heal spells, maybe increase the bonus a little more.<P>Maybe an upgrade to complete heal post 50, i was thinking like lvl 57 or later myself.  Lower the casting time, or lower the mana usuage.<P>Abolish poison, great idea.  Abolish disease, why dont clerics get this spell.  We are, atleast i consider us this, the masters of healing.  We should get this spell.<P>A series of debuffing spells would also be nice, I think we should have the ability to help out and buff our friends and allies, as well as hindering our enemies without having to use our stuns or DDs.  Something alongs the line of a AC or ATK debuff.  Either a line of spells, or a single spell that increases in power every 4 lvls(or something like that) the way the damage on our stuns keeps going up with lvl, that we get at a lower lvl.<P>I would like to see an increase in defense skills, and maybe adding a skill like block.  A small increase in offense just so we can fight off the low greens would be nice.<P>Kaldaur Goldheart<BR>49th cleric of Brell<BR>Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think that like necros get our best ressurection spell, we should also have the ability to summon corpses at high levels, using the tiny coffins that they use, or to make up for the fact that they have to sacrifice someone, make us use the larget non-stackable coffins.<P>I know as a cleric, I would love to be able to summon a corpse to like a necro, and would in many situations save me considerable amounts of time.  And If a necromancer can find the skills to ressurect using our most valued res spell, I think a cleric should easily be able to learn to summon a corpse  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have read many posts in my 6 months of playing.  Honsetly, most of them disgust me.  People whining about what everyone else got and they didn't.  But for once I have to say it is my turn to whine about the playability of my character.  <P>I play a 32nd level cleric.  I have almost exactly the same amount of playing time as a r/l friend of mine who is a druid.....  53rd level.<BR>53rd level.  I am 32nd.  They need help?  I have a problem with a druid complaining about their role in groups, because they simply should NOT be group characters.  I begged my r/l friend to gorup with me early in our careers.  His answer was "I am quad kiting, I'll see you after I hit 30th level, then 35th, 40th etc.".  Quad kiting?  Doesn't sound like much of a group character.  It's not the cleric's fault that they decided to play a druid so they could reach 53rd level before I reach 33rd.  <BR>After reading all the previos posts, this is my take...  A shaman IS a group character, give them increased healing.  A druid is NOT a group character, if it's no fun for them to play in a group, let them oct kite some wasps like they did the previous 53 levels.  The only way to balance a cleric is to allow them to solo a little more effectively.  I don't know/care how to do it, you just need to do it.  I can start a druid today and reach 53rd level before my 32nd level cleric can.<P>After reading all the previous posts, I am seriously considering moth balling my cleric and starting a new character if I decide to keep playing at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am TOTALLY against giving other classes better heals.<P>The trend of giving other classes the main power of a class is what causes imbalance in the first place. Druids get nukes, sow, heals, regen, HP/AC buffs, damage shield, teleports, snare, DOTs and a pet. (probably forgot some things too). These type of classes are what causes imbalance.<P>If you take other classes, which are very specialized: Wizard, Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, etc... they all need each other. Why? Because they are specialists (read extremely good at what they do) in their domain and suck in other domains (read they can't do it).<P>Wizard needs enchanter needs warrior needs cleric, etc... Classes like Druids who are jack of all trades cause deep imbalance.<P>Now since the reality is that these "can do it all" classes are a part of EQ, we can't get rid of them.<P>Well, ok, but let's not make them even better at a main ability of another class!!<P>"A Cleric is still a better healer". Yes, but it's now not as better as it was... and it can't do anything more than it did...<P>If you want to continue the trend of giving main abilities to other classes, at least Verant have the balls to follow it thru. You should then give cleric that classes main ability (like Teleports or Sow).<P>We will then say "A Druid is still better at xxx" ourselves.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, let me say one thing that everyone else has said. Clerics are the SINGLE MOST BORING CLASS in EQ. Period. We trade this boringness for being required in groups. If you are going to take away this requirement, then you need to make us not so boring. We do NOT need better melee skills. We are not tanks. We are priests. We do not need better nukes either. We are not wizards. We are supporters. We are healers and buffers. What we do need is:<P>1) Mark of Karn to go back to how it originally was. There was absolutely no reason for it to have been nerfed. Paladins and SKs are not wanted in groups over a dual-wielder anyway. You could totally remove MoK from the game and they still wouldn't be wanted. All the nerfing of MoK did was punish clerics, it did not solve any problems for SKs or Pallys. It is the only 50+ spell that is really different from what we had before the expansions came out. And what do you do? you make it virtually useless. What a great sign to send to clerics!<P>2)If you are going to give remedy/divine light to druids and shaman, give us something better. We have *no* upgrades to these spells. If druids and shaman get them, they are basically now in posession of 2 of our most used spells. Oh, but they dont get group heals? Well guess what. Group Heals are USELESS unless you are fighting a monster with a large AE. If you are forced to use a group heal in a single group situation, then your group is already in trouble.<P>3)Stop nerfing everything we get. You say the donal's BP is overpowering because a cleric and a warrior can kill anything that doesnt kill the warrior in 30 seconds. Well, at the level you can get the donal's BP (55+) almost everything you are killing can absolutely own a warrior in under 30 seconds. Why arent cleric/warrior teams out killing dragons all the time? Hmm?<P>4)Bind wound is totally useless to a cleric. We do not need any upgrading to this at all, no cleric in their right mind should be using bind wound to heal someone.<P>Please, please think of the impact that giving the best clerical heal spells to a druid and shaman is going to do. You WILL be making an entire class obsolete. Thats right. There will be 0 reason to play a cleric. Think about this. Giving divine light to a druid will mean that druids can heal for 1k and nuke for 1k. That is NOT balance. <P>--Shadowtorch--<BR>58th cleric of Tunare<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a lvl 50 Cleric. <P>I liked adding the Undead DOT and Armor of Protection!  I now have enough buffs to make me have 1600-1700 hp during 45-50.  I successfully leveled myself from 44 to 49/50 hunting undead.  I did it like a druid - hunt low blues/greens that give xps - and I was successful!  I did have to spend more mana and hp to do it but that may be the difference between clerics and druids.<P>Here are my suggestions for balancing the Cleric.  Hopefully I have brought up the balancing issue and then addressed it rather than asking Santa for gifts.<P>1.  Heals.  I know Druids/Shamans already get Superior Heal and Clerics have CHeal/Remedy.  Just make sure Clerics have the best heals in the entire game.  This is both for Complete Heals, One Shot Heals, and anot Heal over Time spells.  I would like some HOTs - even if they took a gem (cheap 1pp ones).  Also, re-examine the healing spells at all levels to make sure Clerics always win out on healing.<P>2.  Debuff DOTs.  I think Clerics should be able to counter DOTs with a debuff or a counter HOT.  Mark of Karn is good - any chance of a lower level spell?  It just plays into the Clerics area of healing the group.  You could also make the cleric 'transfer' the DOT to themselves  (See 5. below) so that the cleric needs to be able to survive the process.<P>3.  I would like to see the Fear spells changed a little.  If I Fear and Root a mob, then the mob, if I am not mistaken, can still cast on me.  If I could Fear a mob and it runs away from me, then rooted and feared mobs should not be able to cast.  Maybe a feared mob would have less of a chance to cast a spell?  Making Fear spells useful in a group would be fun.<P>4.  Druids and Snare vs. Clerics and _____?  It is nice that Druids get to use a lvl 1 spell effectively when they are level 60.  Let's find something for Clerics as well.  How about a) faster turn around for the Divine Aura series as we get higher level? b) Stuns that work for all level mobs but might have a shorter duration on higher level mobs.  The stun, however, should aggro the mob on the cleric as punishment.  The purpose is to stop casters by making the cleric use a stun on a mob instead of a heal on the tank.  c) <P>5.  A discipline.  Dont have any ideas on what it would be but having a discipline would offer more flexibility.  I thought of one called 'Sacrifice'.  If a group member is in trouble, a cleric can 'Sacrifice' themselves and take all the damage from the other group member upon themselves.  The cleric would end up with 1 hp after its over.  It might need to take some transfer time.   I would effectively trade my life for the life of another.  Some may see this more as a Paladin discipline but it could be both.  This could be the counter to using hp to mana conversion like a Shaman or a mana transfer from a Necro.  This is HP to HP - what a cleric is supposed to do and it has a downside - I would be VERY hurt and might die.  Shamans and Druids with their Superior Heal in the group might even need to heal me!  This may not be fully right but it does address the issue of wanting to have a discipline.<P>6.  Make one time items like a Mage/Shaman.  How about a 'bless' item a Warrior would carry - maybe it would allow the holder to 'Cure Poisons/Blindness/Disease'?  Clerics should have some way to give a 'blessing' to objects with minor but useful abilities.<P>7.  Resists.  I think Clerics would also be very good at helping people resist effects.  We should continue the line of resist spells with group resists like Druids and Shamans - maybe at higher levels.  Just makes sense on the 'protection' attribute a Cleric.  Maybe our resists give more proctection from Disease and Poison than the others?  <P>8.  Resist Undead.  Ever think of having a Life/Undead resistance category?  It would be neat to need a resist from Undead in order prevent a Vampire from draining mana/hp!  This goes along with 7.  It seems that having Undead in the game would make this important.<P>9.  Check on the 50 - 60 line of spells with respect to stacking and mana/time/protection costs.  Some people find the higher level spells to not be as effective as lower level spells cast multiple times.  Fortitude versue Heroic Bond come to mind (friends tell me).<P>10. If Clerics are not going to be meleeing, how about more nonweapon items to hold for clerics?  Cone of Mystics is a great idea - make more of these for all levels of clerics.   You can also do this for more quests too.<P>11.  Study how many clerics actually use any of the Hammer spells.  I only use a Hammer spell when I die and it just because I am sitting there waiting for a rez!  Replace the spells with something that I can use.<P>I hopefully tried to be positive on my suggestions.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know we are talking about idea's to better balance the cleric class, but i would like to touch on something that would unbalance the class. Please do not give Paladin's our level 56 Rez spell. I can stomach Paladin's getting our level 49 rez but no way should they EVER get our level 56 rez spell period. Paladin's should obtain our level 49 rez at level 59 or 60.<P>Anyway, Cleric's are supposed to be the master's of Undead. I was in Hate plane today and im watching a lower level wizard than I out nuke me against the undead foes in hate. i know my level 55 DD against undead does a very nice damage/mana ratio, but when the level 51 wizard is out nuking me with his ice comet, thats BS. I dont care if you raise the mana used, but our DD vs undead needs to be boosted up. If the wizard at level 51 can do 1,000 damage vs any foe, we should be able to do that much vs undead.<P>Please increase the undead dungeons cleric's can enjoy post level 50. Unrest, Befallen, Najena, and lower Guk come to mind but those are not post level 50 dungeons.<P>Give us AOE spells vs undead. As you can see most of my comments are tailoring towards cleric's becoming more powerful towards undead creature's. I could care less about our word of pain line of spells or upheaval, i would trade those in for more powerful AOE spells that work only against undead.<P>PLease examine the Hammer line. except for the first hammer, the rest suck. For higher level spells the do not provide noticeable increases. Slightly higher damage and lower deley's should be afforded. I nice bonus at level 50 would be to provide a hammer that has a proc ve undead. the proc does not have to be high, maybe 50-75 would be nice.<P>The fizzle rate of divine light needs to be addressed. It is far to common to fizzle regardless of your increased level and usage of the spell.<P>I would like to see an increase in our defense/dodge skills. We are taking a beating at the post 50 Era. When the game stopped at level 50 we were fine. But with these new additions over the past 12 months, we need to upgraded. In no way ami saying it needs to be as high as a Melee character, but increased non the less. I have seen many changes to the Hybrids and Warrior type class regarding their defense, its time you addressed the cleric. We wear armor and are the most defensive caster in the game. Post level 50 needs to afford us an increase in this issue.<P>The unswerving Hammer spell/pet spell is a joke. Cleric's rarely get anything and when we do, you give us a useless spell. Please increase the stats on this spell, change it completely or remove it all together. An idea on changing it would be to allow us to target a creature, cast the spell, but instead of a useless pet that attacks, make it a weapon that we then use to strike the creature in melee combat. When the creature dies, the hammer disappears. This kind of hammer should have near epic type stats. The reason it should have these type of stats is that it would only last during the mobs life. The weapon should have a very good damage/deley ratio added stats to Str and attack plus increased Hp's and AC. example: 1 handed blunt 18/28 +20str +50 attack +50 Hp's AC10. Thats just one idea.<P>We REALLY NEED group buffing spells like Heroic bond. I was so happy when you guys came up with heroic Bond. It was an outstadning spell. Now add that wonderful idea and give us a group AC buff. The group AC buff should be slighly better than shield of words and we should have it around level 54. We also need Group Resist poison and resist disease. These spells should be provided post 50 also.<P>Please adjust the cost's for our symbols. I am going broke with its current cost.(Peridot)<P>To compensate for this increase you are going to make to druid/shaman on their healing abilities, i would like to see the cleric's increased as well. If there seemed to be a wide gap in the healing between these 2 classes and a cleric that is because there should be. Some of the greatest things those 2 classes can do a cleric cannot. example: spirit of wolf, damage shields, regen, all the stat buffs, teleporting, wolf form etc, etc, etc. WOW thats alot they can do. These 2 classes can also give HP and AC buffs like we can. Our bread and butter should be the damage we do against undead and our healing/rezing spells. Well we fall far short in the undead damage part cause a wizard/mage can damage any foe with their arsenal better than we can DD an undead. The gap in healing is closing by the proposed changes in healing and your thinking of giving Paladin's our level 56 REZ.<P>Please increase our healing powers so there is no doubt who the best healers in that game are.<P>Level 55 cleric<BR>Tunare server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Clerics group dependence and lack of transportation means you are stuck finding zones like Lake of Ill Omen where you can go 10 levels hunting in groups there.  Of course the people you group with the first week will be working with higher clerics next week.<P>It is slow grinding work and the only way to do it swiftly is to get in that "optimum xp group" and with only a few zones to choose from and room for maybe 5 such group in each zone that means that only 10 to 15 clerics of any level range on a server are not LFG or doing something else.<P>Yes clerics are wanted in groups at high levels but I am seeing tank shortages not healing shortages in the mid levels.<P>Tfodthog Tmfof<BR>27 cleric<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i hear alot about changing stuff tobetter balance thepost 50 clerics. were you all born at 50th? i wasnt. Shamans and druid healing as well as me? thats bogus. its pointless tobe a cleric. between the expense of spells, armor, and regents we spend most of our career looking for cash to pay for it all. anyone know where i can make good money sitting on my butt? seeing as thats all i do because thats "a clerics job". add on top of that im a de and have most of the high wis items unavailable and cant do quests. when finally at 29th i got revive and ppl actually think its my duty to pass out free rezzcause theres no exp.<P>i have a few suggestions.<P>1.increase 1hb ability.i mean come on what sense does it make to have 200 in hand to hand and 175 in 1hb.<P>2if you cant increase skill how bout better weapons for our class. or religeon specific weapons.<P>3.increase soloability. not sure how to accomplish this but its sad we are the only class in the game who only solo a few blues and only if they dont cast. i cant tell you how many times a green critter has killed me (and i lose a whole bub from it?) all it woulda taken was one heal but try to cast lengthy heals when theres nore than one monster.<P>4decrease gate casting time. clerics are alwaysthelast to find out the group zoned. and there we are dying because our only means of escape is taking almost 15 secs to cast gate. worked one time in 30 lvls.<P>the real problem here is that clerics are primarily healers by default. its the only thing we are allowed to do well. every other aspect of our characters are nerfed to make it pointless to do anything else then verant comes along and says ok well let druids and shamans heal just as well. WHY? they can already do 5 times the things we can including melee. so i have a question, why play a cleric? at this point the only thing they can do that makes them unique is rezz. ya lie i can get exp from doing that all day (which is what i would do if i didnt sayno half thetime) i reallyloved this game and my character a year ago when i started playing,now i just wanna throw up and tell verant what they can do with theirgame<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off I would like to say that invis is not out of character for a cleric. I cannot imagine a cleric NOT being able to pray to his god and say please hide me from the eyes of mine enemies! I don't have a problem with it being self-only, after all the cleric is the one the god really wants to protect. Along the same lines asking for see invis and even a night vision spell would certainly not unbalance the game OR steal anyone else's thunder. <P>I also agree that some sort of mana regen is needed. We are the only class who's primary ability is spell casting that doesn't have some sort of mana regen. <P>Bash would be nice, but without the mana regen we'd never have time to use it. Better melee skills would be nice, but again, only useful if we're not sitting down medding.<P>Self-only gate spells, that is an idea I've dreamed of since I started playing in Kunark. As a pre-50 cleric if I want to buy spells I either have to pay 30-50pp for a port or spend an hour or more waiting on the boats to train or buy new spells. Not sure how hard it would be to code a point inside the appropriate temple for this, but it should be doable. <P>Two spells that I think would be a great addition to the cleric would be Call of the Hero and Translocate. While both magician spells, they are NOT the class defining spells for magicians and would make a cleric much more valuable to groups that want to explore dungeons. And again, these would not be out of the realm of a cleric's powers and would not unbalance the class. <P>I've also never understood why clerics can't cast enduring breath.
