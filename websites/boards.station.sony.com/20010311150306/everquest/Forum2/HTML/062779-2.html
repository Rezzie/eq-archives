</FONT><HR>I am really curious why anyone would play EQ if they were not having fun.  It is ONLY a game.  <P>A better use of one's time is pursuing something enjoyable. If you are waiting for the next big thing then do something else.<P>I have friends who have told me they have too much time invested in EQ so they won't stop playing.<P>I have as much time, and more in most cases, invested in EQ than most people.  Whenever I stopped having fun I stopped playing.  I have come back to it several times, but it absolutely makes no sense playing a game that is not fun for you.  Time invested is irrelevant.<P>You don't capture magic in a bottle by keeping your character online. Nothing good is going to happen in your life because you pushed through and played when it was not fun.<P>If you asked people at Verant if they expected people to play the game who are not having fun, I think they would say no as well.<P>Admittedly EQ can be adictive but one has to be aware and sometimes step back and evaluate how they are living their life to get a clearer perspective.  If you are not sure you are having fun, stop playing for a week.  Then ask yourself if you want to play again?  If you answer yes, then ask yourself why you want to play again?  Is it because it will be fun for you?  Or is it because you just need to fill a big chunk of time in your life that EQ used to occupy.<P>Unfortunately EQ's frustration is one reason why people keep playing it.  I can't explain it, but it is.  And I see people go through all phases of EQ enjoyment.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm EQ2.. <P>Considering right now EQ is making ungodly sums of money off of selling expansions and still has a strong player base, I don't forsee EQ2 until EQ is in the position that Ultima Online was in when EQ came out.<P>And even with the new MMORPGs coming out, you really have to be in awe of EQ technically.  Look how long it took other companies to even come close to having a beta to compete with it.<P>As a programmer myself, you really have to be in awe of something like EQ and that it managed to "emerge" the way it did.  That the creators of it went out on a limb and just did it. <P>And that's what I expect the next true "innovator" will garner the same success as EQ and take a subsantial player base into it from EQ and other games.  What's not clear is whether any other new games are innovating enough to cause that migration.<P>I do think EQ is making it easier for the innovators to take over with the current post 50 gameplay.  It's not really as fun as 1 - 50 was.  If only the ill fated decision for 10 more levels had been for 50 more levels and a reasonable content set accompanied it...  But they decided not to go this route.  I think each expansion adding 50 more levels would have given EQ another 5-6 year lifespawn of adding players minimum.<P>Regardless of what it is "now" EQ was an incredible game "Then".. when the world was new and undiscovered by individuals and their friends.. not 6 groups of level 50+s playing /Gems to wait to get to Point A to buff for 30 minutes to kill a MOB, do CR for 2 hours.. <P>EQ has become a game of patience.  And patience quickly becomes tedium.  All the /Gems won't save EQ if it doesn't fight "tedium".  <P>But EQ2 might give it all back to us again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Who knows..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In DAOC the whole point of restricting communication between realms is to heavily reinforce the view of other realm characters as the enemy - to make their presence so foreign as to incite an assured defense of your castles to any other-realm invasions.  There won't be any of the EQ style dark-elves grouping with high elves.  This lack of communication means that each realm will actually have a real use for their rogues and scouts - they can silently move ahead of the army, spy on the enemy realm, then they have to make it alive back to their camp to report on what they found - it also means that realms can ambush enemy scouts to protect the secrecy of their movements - you will also have no-man's lands patrolled by scouts and infiltrators, maybe some invisible mages to add fire-support til a bunch of players can rally to delay the invaders etc - there will be runners needed to relay info and people to man border posts and the various strongholds/chokepoints connecting  the realms.. That said you could concievably play the entire time without involving yourself in pvp - but the design of the game will ensure that the pvp will be structured - no random pking or noob slaughters - you wont really be in the areas where pvp battles will take place until you are ready for it - plus the fact that there will be bonuses for what you accomplish in realm battles..  I am a beta-tester in the phase 2 beta of DAOC and I can't wait til the other realms are added when the next phase comes out  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DAoC sounds interesting, but frankly there's no way I'm going to commit limited playing time to something that (a) requires pvp to really explore the game, and (b) requires such extensive involvement in an entire realm as a community.<P>I think the problem with the design process for the current MMORPG industry is that the games are basically being designed by devout, virtually fanatical gamers, who have very strong personal opinions about HOW these kind of games "should" be played.  They bring a lot of conceptual baggage in from various other RPG formats, along with prejudices about how other people "ruin" the game, and are determined their game be played the way it's SUPPOSED to be played.<P>I think that this kind of virtually fanatical devotion to the genre, when one is in charge of conceptualizing and designing a MMORPG world and its rules, is innately problematical, because if the game truly is successful, then 90% of your client base isn't going to BE fanatical gamers devoted to the genre.<P>Their veiwpoint of what is enjoyable and fun, and what is important to the structure of the game, is going to be radically different than the designer's.<P>I appreciate the heads-up that EQ2, if there is such a thing, will continue the same PvP/PvE policy as EQ does.  I've played EQ since it went live, and frankly I still haven't explored roughly 75% of it.  Frankly, I'm pretty sure I'll never get beyond level 51 or 52, and will probably devote more time to sheer exploration in the future than anything else.<P>I do hope that Verant continues to expand EQ, and in those expansions create lots of content for the 40-60 crowd and quit worrying about creating Ubermobs for Uberguild consumption.<P>The only way to really improve EQ in GENERAL, IMO, is to work out the "mini" dungeon concept that creates alternate space dungeons or zones for each group that enters them, limiting the event to a single group that could progress linearly through the dungeon without interfering with, or getting interference from, anyone else.<P>IF the best content in the game were tied into SINGLE group successes in mini-zones (where you can't just throw more bodies at a creature or chain-rez armies of the dead), then I'd say EQ had the perfect game for just about every style of play and didn't arbitrarily code casual players out of the end-game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rigadoon,<P>I think it would be very easy for verant to go to a 100-level system .. .however, I think that the nature of levels should be changed after level 60.<P>I think that it would be nice if they could code it so that Players could elect from a variety of permanent stat increases (via quests or special trainers), or choose certain avenues of special skills only available after level 60, it would generate a lot of interest.<P>For example ... no new spells available, no automatic HP or Mana pool increases at each level.  Instead:<P>At 60 perhaps each class could choose to learn a new skill from a set of options.  At 70 that skill branched off to 2 exclusive variations of that skill.  At 80 it again branched off to 2 further specialized, exculsive variations.  At 90 it did so again.  At 100 you would be the master of a very specialized version of that skill.<P>An example:<P>At 60 a Cleric can learn the skill "Prayer", among other exclusive choices (let's say then can also elect to learn advanced 1hb or 2hb combat skills, but must choose BETWEEN "prayer" and "blunt weapons").  This allows the cleric the ability to regen mana faster than normal meditation.<P>At 70 the cleric must choose between "Devotion" and "Clergy" forms of prayer.  One a self-only furtherance of that skill, the other turns the prayer into a form of "group clarity".<P><BR>Let's say that the cleric chose "Clergy".  At 80 the cleric must then choose between "Ministry of Healing" and "Ministry of Protection".  Ministry of Healing adds a constant group healing to the clarity effect, while slightly increasing the power of the "group clarity".  So now the cleric is increasing mana regen and group HP regeneration at the same time.<P>The other route, Ministry of Protection, would create generate an group AC bonus as well as increasing the group clarity effect.<P>Let's say the choice is to train in Ministry of Protection.  At 90 the cleric must choose Congregation of Purity, which adds across the board resistances to the Ministry of Protection effect, or Congregation of Defiance, which adds group HP buff to the Ministry of Protection effect.<P>Let's say the choice here is Congregation of Purity.  At 100 you max out your CoP skill.  When you press it, you group gets a mana free 30 minute mana regen boost, AC and across the board resistance buffs.  The re-use time is, let's say,  once an EQ day.<P>Remember, the Cleric COULD have elected to learn blunt combat skills INSTEAD, and that choice would have led to equal specializations (perhaps choice of procs on weapons, ability to double attack with a blunt weapon, etc.).<P>This would provide a real reason to advance into the 60+ levels without dramatically having to alter gameplay.  Verant could simply make higher-level content ... but anyone moving into the 60-100 range SHOULD experience an "easier" game.  They should just be relationally more powerful.<P>This way would allow for real, solid diversity in the game and a whole new reason to advance your character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As far as I know they haven't actually put in any of the PvP code into DAoC. Beta 2 was just one realm and they are adding the Norse realm for beta 3 (I assume that is when PvP will get it's first real testing). Things should get really interesting when they get all three realms in. =)<P>So I am holding my breath waiting on reports from beta on how the actual PvP system is shaping up and what they are doing balance-wise and plugging exploits-wise. For a quick example, what stops two friends or someone with two accounts from going into a PvP area and killing eachother repeatedly for realm points to make them stronger in PvP? (kinda like deleveling but different) I suppose they could make you lose more points than you gain when you are defeated subject to some kind of level restraints...? Just things that I want to see addressed before I throw my whole support in with the game...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062779-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062779.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062779&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062779&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
