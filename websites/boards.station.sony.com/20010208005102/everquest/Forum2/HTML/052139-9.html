</FONT><HR>It was commented that debuffs seem to have little or no effect, this is not completely true when they are stacked. HOWEVER it takes too long to stack them. This is true throughout the entire level range. To be usefull you need to stack the Cripple line with the Weakness line and the Suffocation line. Debuffs are effective if they act over time, however it takes so long to cast them all that they are almost never used, the amount of time they have to act on the mob after they are finally all cast is not enough to justify the cost. The mana cost of debuffs should be the limiting factor on their use in play, not the fact that you can't finish casting them before your target is mostly dead.<BR>Assuming your unlucky enough not to have a shaman in the group the typical debuff casting goes<BR>Tash 4 seconds<BR>Slow 9 seconds<BR>Suffocate 9 seconds<BR>Incapacitate 6 seconds<BR>Weakness 6 seconds<P>so by the time you've finished casting you are 34 seconds into the fight already. It's no wonder that you end up forgetting the debuffs at the end and just throw a DD in to shorten the fight because it's more efficient.<BR>I would really like there to be some way for debuffs to be usefull in gameplay as an alternative to just nuking. This may entail reducing the casting time on the slows,DoT, and debuffs. Maybe also reducing the mana cost on the debuffs to make them more attractive.<P>Dyn's Dizzying Draught - this spell is currently useless, my only guess is that the very long recast time was put on the spell because the 2 tick spin was supposed to be unbreakable. At the level this is attained the rate of incoming blows on the mob is so high that it breaks within one or two seconds. Because of the long recast time the mana drain aspect is essentially useless, you only get to cast this once on a mob. The brief debuff can be had with Listless power for only 60% the mana cost and it will last the entire fight, not 2 ticks. Whirl Till You Hurl is more usefull than this spell because although it breaks as quickly it's 1/3 the mana and can be recast 4 times in the same time as DDD can be cast once. If you want to make DDD an upgrade just make it the same as WTYH in effect, time, and cost and then reduce the resist rate so it's tougher to break out. Or make it an unbreakable stun and keep the recast delay (you can drop the mana drain and debuff, it's pointless). Or just get rid of the spell all together, useless spells are just a source of disappointment and frustration. Note that at lvl 56 I'd never be using this spell now, but at the appropriate level I was really disappointed with DDD and the supposed fix when it came along.<P>PLEASE fix the fact that you can't cast some buffs such as clarity when a bard is singing their songs. These normally stack but you have to cast them before the bard starts singing. I can't stress enough how annoying this is to the point where I get to hate having a bard in the group. Bards have enough problems without this.<P>In a raid situation we cannot use either our DoT's or Debuffs because of the shaman and necro's present. The concept of a mana expensive one shot targetted pet for boss mob situations would let us feel like we could at least do something. This also can address the inability to do anything with the high MR of velious mobs, at least we'd be able to cast a damage spell.<P>It was mentioned the taunt on the Tashani spell line was too high, this isn't quite true as both Tashan and Tashani seem appropriate, Tashania however is a huge step up in agro that seems way out of proportion. Tashania needs to be closer to Tashani in taunt. I am not sure about Tashanian as I haven't used it yet.<P>Epic Quest - What a bloody great quest ;-), long and difficult and ranging all over. However as one needs to kill a shissar spirit that spawns after Cazic is killed and Cazic is a 7 day spawn that is essentially farmed this precludes those enchanters not in the farming guild to have a chance to complete this quest. This aspect should be reconsidered. As it is those people who do not play at peak times are also at a severe disadvantage because the raids are all held around peak times.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see the 'gift of' line increase an individual's mana in addition to enlarging the total mana pool.  This would allow the spell to be used as a poor-man's nec conversion line the way paladins chain-cast valor to heal people.<P>There is no incentive to having more than one enchanter in zones where mobs cannot be mezed.  I am level 58 and often raid with a lvl 59 enchanter -- when raiding Skyshrine the only way I can contribute right now is to chain-cast rune, and with the high component cost I am reluctant to do so on every battle.  So I sit and watch the raid until I get bored and decide to go do something else.  This change would allow me to contribute to the raid even though I am *only* level 58.

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to clarify what I think others mean by giving us a message stating that we cannot mez something BEFORE we cast.  The inherent problem is actually in the level of things and/or level caps.  <P>As an example, I'll use mushrooms in Sebilis.  The majority of these mushrooms are below 56 and able to be mezed by Dazzle.  A select few of them are 56th and only able to be mezed by Glamour of Kintaz.  When you are 55th or 56th level, this is the ONLY time you can properly guage which spell to use by using /con.  So, after 56th, you become LESS EFFECTIVE in determining this, making you less effective as an enchanter (you waste 125 mana to determine if you can mez something, then proceed to get beat on because of it).<P>What I would prefer to see is the same message we get after casting the spell applied BEFORE casting it.  "Target cannot be mesmerized with this spell".  This at least gives the enchanters that cannot detect the level (those not of 55/56th level) the ability to be just as effective.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, first off, some things where I think enchanters have a bit too much power:<P>Charm in mid levels is a very, very powerful tool. At the low levels it's pretty useless, at the high levels it gets you killed a lot, but in the mid level range it's quite powerful (at level 32 I was capable of soloing about 4 spectres at once).<P>Enchanters also shine with their AE stuns at around levels 44-50. Past level 50, you head to Kunark, where resist rates increase greatly...But from 44-50 the ability to keep almost an unlimited number of mobs permanently stunned for a great length of time is also very powerful. I'm not sure if it's deserving of a nerf, just thought I'd mention it.<P>Mesmerize spells below level 46 are also quite powerful. Past level 46, once an enchanter begins to head off to Kunark/Velious/Planes, they change dramatically (for the worse, with increased resist rates), and are more balanced.<P>That's pretty much my take on where the enchanter has too much power. Now for some fixes:<P>Argument FOR changing Gift of Brilliance:<P>2 points of mana per tick is NOTHING. Really. For a cost of 450 mana, that means every 10 minutes (which is 100 ticks) you get 200 mana. That's ALMOST enough to cast ONE extra slow spell every 10 minutes. I'm pretty sure any percieved increase in mana regen from the spell is just because enchanters have been told that the spell increases their mana regen.<P>I would say the way to go with this spell is either making it a mana transfer over time, or to make it a larger +mana buff and simply remove the mana regen (and I mean a large +mana buff....Absor, maybe you could get the live team to make sure they're really aware of how much mana high level players have). Alternatively, make it a larger mana regen buff and remove the +mana component. As it is, both of the bonuses are too insignificant to make casting this spell valid.<P>Also, please take a look at Dictate. 750 mana for 48 seconds of charm is in-line; a 5 minute recast is not.<P>Also, I thought I'd clarify something - the reasons enchanters want a cleric/wizard type pet is because it ATTACKS without you being hit. Our current pet doesn't do this. That means that in an epic battle, we have to get hit by the mob for our pet to attack...I think you can see how highly unsafe that is.<P>Please take a look at Forlorn Deeds. The casting time on this (6.0 seconds) could really use some lowering...Perhaps just to 4.0 seconds (so that shamans are still superior to us, both in casting time and slow effectiveness).<P>Please change Wind of Tishani/Wind of Tishanian to more useful spells. Currently no level 55 or 60 enchanter who values his life will cast these spells in any situation where they'd be useful. Maybe you could keep their current resist debuff values (-23 and -40) but make them single target and add a mem blur component to them (applied hopefully AFTER the resist debuff)?<P>Another clarification: We want monsters that are above the level limit on charm and mez to be flagged that way. High resist/immune to magic monsters don't need to be flagged - just ones that are specifically exempt from our mez/charm spells (for instance, vendors cannot be charmed...neither can most guards...And lots of rock golems in the Hole are immune to mesmerize). I understand your desire to keep enchanters a 'challenging' class to play, but, well...Inane death because I can't tell whether something is mezzable or not is...Stupid.<P>In regards to your suggestion of a single target, able to hit just about anything, mez spell influencing the old world (IE, trivializing a Vox fight because you could hold her mezzed while the clerics ressed tanks back in): It won't work. There is a level cap on the old world at which mesmerize/stun spells work. I BELIEVE the level is 52, but don't quote me on that...Either way, past ~level 52, NO mesmerize/stun spells work - not even our higher level ones (glamour of kintaz, rapture), that are specifically designed to work. The only zone this is really problematic for us in is the Hole. So I fully back your suggestion of a new mez spell...It would only really change our power in the old world in the Hole, and it'd be a great boon in Velious. If you are THAT worried about it changing the balance of things, flag it as only useable in Velious zones.<P>Okay, I'm winding down, but I feel this is important...Enchanter effectiveness in Velious. I think anyone who plays a 53+ enchanter or who has any insight into the class whatsoever will agree that they are, in many parts of Velious, completely ineffective. However, saying that 'But they have buffs!' is NOT a good counter argument. This is like making a zone where clerics can't heal and telling them that they're still useful because they have buffs. However useful those buffs may be, the zones where that's all we do are boring as hell. I don't want to count for 10 people on a raid, but I WOULD like to be able to influence the combat once it's begun.../shrug, I leave the solution to this problem for wiser men than I to ponder  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Lastly, our suffocate&gt;gasping embrace&gt;asphyxiate line does not stack with the necromancer splurt spell. Could this be looked at?<P><BR>Sorry for repeating a few.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen this touched on, but no one has gone into depth on it, nor explained the bigger picture as it relates to the other issues brought up.<P>I play an enchanter full time and my life in Norrath is very unique.  I like that about my charactor, I can jump in and pretty much run my husband's ranger while he goes to the bathroom, but he has a difficult time running my enchanter at times.<P>Why is this?  There is no margin for error, I'm either God to those around me, or I'm dead.  I'm the poor frail little girl standing up front waiting for the puller to return trailing all kinds of beasties behind him.  If I suceed in my task of using my charm and wit to distract these beasts every one lives, and I get my exp cut.  If I make a mistake.... Loading Please Wait.  It is rare that I have a second chance, and rare that a heal can go off in time to save me.<P>What this means to me in Norrath is interesting.  I have been playing with a pool of people for quite a while now, usually the same people and now have all of them in my guild.  I have learned that pick up groups usually mean death.  If I don't know how a person plays, I can't adjust tactics to compensate quick enough.<P>It also means I have leveled slower than the rest  of the people I play with regularly.  More deaths, less accumulated experience, even with rezes it adds up.  At my low to mid 40's the rest of my stead group were high 40's to low 50's, and at the point that I could no longer join them in the really fun stuff.<P>If we are in an area that I have time and space to relax and make a mistake or two with out a death, I am nothing but extra baggage, and could be easily replaced with a higher damage giver.<P>At this point I spend a good 80% of my time soloing low blues with my trusty animated dot.  It gives me more exp in the time then grouping with the people who I can trust to watch my back and keep me alive.<P>For me personally the challenges to the class is forcing me to group with an ever diminishing number of people out of sheer survival, rather than interact with an increasingly larger pool of players.<P>It has been stated before and is the truth that I can not avoid being hit on.  My mantra has become "No one can aggro a mob like an enchanter" and it is very true.  I love my charactor, and it's class, but I implore the powers to be to give me some way to defend myself.<P>It is my opinion that the charactor classes are too often viewed to fit into 4 catagories of casters.  You have your tanks, your hybrids, your int casters and your wis casters.  It is very disconcerting to me to view the classes this way as you effectively reduce the variety of classes to 4 classes with minor sub-categories.  If we look at each class as unique and individual with the challenges that enchanters are presented with, would it be too unbalancing to possible raise the cap on our dodge ability?  This would give us a bit more of a chance without changing spells and such which if not done carefully might have a domino effect on balance.<P>In my perfect world I would like a lot of things done to our spells as far as casting time, duration and mana useage, but that would completely unbalance the situation.  As enchanters we can do a lot of things in a bind if we had too, such as buff, debuff, and blast, but we should never be the most effective at those things, it's not our jobs.  We are great for our crowd control and good as back up to others.  I personally enjoy the challenges to the class as much as the specialties.  All I want is to be able to join my guild mates for an hour without making sure I have a 49 cleric in tow where ever I go.  So I implore you to look at ways, whether they be ac equiptment or skills that could allow me to face that mob one on one for a few more seconds before the dreaded...<P>Loading Please Wait...<BR>YOU have lost a level!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please hear me out.<P>Illusions are a class defining part of being an enchanter.  I decided to be a Dark Elf based on the fact that I could still walk in Rivervale non-invis.  I accepted that I cannot even kill a single green mob at level 48 without wasting a whole bar of mana, I know give me 2 mobs and I come out great, but when I am traveling and nothing else is around, I mez and run.  So my damage output is almost nil.<P>So I say that the other things I can do makes up for it.  Then I see Bards and rogues with illusions.  I can see rogues, being masters of deception, but I do not see why bards.  A woodelf bard can walk freely among Darkelf's in Neriak.  That is wrong, they are singers, no deception at all.  But I didn't complain to loudly.  Then last night I find that clerics can get a Mask of the Halfling?  Sure it is a one charge quest item, but still now DE Clerics can walk around places normally KOS to DE's and be fine.<P>I understand your point of Dead things should remain to Sk's and Necro's.  I can see Rogues getting some Race illusions, as being assasins they should, but now DE Clerics?<P>I personally feel that this should never have made it to the game.  Also most people don't know about it yet.<P>I am only level 48, but I have in all my time never seen where an enchanter is over powered.  I have relitively no damage output.  Dueling someone if I use my most powerful spells, charm, they can lose exp and then I get a warning on my account(this is what I am told, I haven't had the displeasure of finding out yet)<P>So I feel my illusions are belittled by giving them to almost every other class in the game, I am constantly finding new mobs that can't be mezzed or charmed, and I see bards getting more powerful.  I am not saying to Nerf bards, what I am saying is that they are unbalancing enchanters.  With Velious I see groups that would rather a bard then an enchanter.  I have witnessed in Karnors a Bard completely and effectively replacing an enchanter.  I feel less needed by a group now with velious since my mana inefficient DD's won't even hit anything.<P>At low levels, like 1-10 maybe I can see enchanters having it kinda easy.  But after that unless you are twinked, which I completely am not, this is my first high level character, Mez and charm won't even stick for more then a couple seconds.<P>I hate to sound so negative about my class, but I accepted all these things, no dmg output etc, because of the other things I do get, but now the only thing that I get noone else does is enchanting metals.  Which is great, but the low AC, low HP, no dmg output, is extremely frustrating at times.  <P>I would like to see these other illusions in game, and I would like to see the ability to mezz giants, even if just one at a time.  Having a high recast is not an option because if it resists and we can not recast, we are dead.  Maybe the giant mez should be like a charm, only one at a time, but it immobilizes the giant so he just stands there, not an actual charm, and longer more reliable duration than a charm.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love the enchanter class above all the classes I've played.  So far, that's necro, warrior, mage, cleric, enchanter, ranger, and monk. I'm curently lvl 52, and have been playing since Dec 9, 1999<P>1. Tashan series.  The amount of MR it does just isn't enough, specially when considering the Malo series does 71% more(39 vs 67, single target version), and taunts way less.  Needs to reduce MR more and taunt way less.<P>2. Charm.  There is a gap after lvl 50.  I can't charm lvl 51+ mobs till I reach lvl 53.  Charm is sometimes the only means of crowd control I have, specially since mobs tend to summon at this lvl.<P>3. Religion renders most of my race illusions useless, and many of the others seriously crippled.  I did not know about the religion issues, or I would have chosen agnostic.  But at lvl 25 when I found out, I didn't want to start over and watch my friends out level me.  This has been the most largest single thorn in my side.<P>4. Debuffs.  Only usefull debuff, other than Tashan, is our Tepid Deeds series.  And that doesnt get used if a shaman is in the group.  Strength debuffs just don't make enough of a difference (if any) to be worth the mana costs.  That leaves us with casting clarity and hastes.  The lvl 34 Mana Sieve should scale with levels to give us a debuff that is usefull.<P>5. Single target mez series should overwrite lower lvl single target mez.  This gives chanters the ability to work together in raid situations.  As it is now, one does the mezzing, the rest cast clarity and augment.<P>6. Pets.  Don't use them unless soloing greens for cash.  Most chanters I see with pets are twinks trying to lvl to fast by soloing, or really should be playing a mage (lvls 1-15 excluded).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Solved mostly by the xp patch of the other week. Making soloing not as much of a neccecity. But its still nice to solo for abit when you dont have the time to find a group/get to spawn etc.<P>Using charm in combat endurs a massive xp for a pet kill doing more then 50% damage. This exists to a point where Its actually better xp to solo with just pure nukes (if you take in risk vs xp vs downtime)<P>Charming in combat while solo just isnt worth it due to this xp penalty when you take into account the risk of two mobs on you at any time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Leveling, especially 20-24 and maybe a little higher, is terribly hard to find hunting spots and the ones you do find you die in... A LOT making you lose tons of exp! Since leveling is hard on the enchnater I have an idea to help balance this. Illusion Human: Set modifiers for exp so it doesnt take away as much after killing a mob(Not exactly like Humans who get no modifiers only half as good). Illusion Halfling: Get a slight exp gain after killing a mob (About half as good as being a halfling).<BR>I believe this is fare after being through the long life of an enchanter.

</FONT><HR>Gift of Brilliance in its current form is NOT a useful spell. It provides almost no extra mana regen, its impossible to notice. Heres my suggestion for how to improve it, keep the mana cost and duration the same, but make it like a cleric's aego and shaman focus. It should be a combination of the old GoB, clarity 2, and enlightenment all in 1, much like aegolism is heroism, marzin and aegis all in 1.<P>Also, I agree that the effects on items from pog needs to be looked at. I actually use the invis slippers for the effect a lot, but I dont use any of the other effects ever. Rune 5 and clarity 2 would be much better for the robe and legs imo.<P>About us being useless on "uber mobs", well if we could land our debuffs on them, they wouldnt be so uber anymore, so that kinda defeats the purpose. =P<P>What I wouldnt mind seeing would be like a small unresistable dd or something at lvl 60, I know that wont happen, but it would be pretty neat.<P>Haltsorn<BR>level 60 enchanter, Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've played an enchanter for 44 levels, and I'm very happy with the class.  There are only a handful of things I'd like to change, and only two of those are balance issues.<P>  Armor Class<P>Others before me have already said what I intended to write here.  I have nothing to add.<P>  Religion<P>Religion has a large impact on an enchanter.  Our illusions hide our race, but not our religion, which makes entering cities of opposite alignment very dangerous.  Some spells are available only in Erudin.  Some spells are available only in Neriak 3rd Gate.  We also have a quest (Coin of Tash) that requires us to enter 10 cities across Norrath.  We tell young enchanters to restart their character as agnostic because those who worship a deity incur a much larger risk.  Yet the reward is the same.<P>Possible solutions:  1) Reduce risk.  Make illusions agnostic, or give us a Mask Faith spell that stacks with racial illusions.  2) Increase reward.  Tunare-worshipping High Elves can wear imbued mithril chain.  Innoruuk-worshipping Dark Elves have imbued adamantite chain.  All race/deity combinations should have some benefit over agnosticism to justify the increased risk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mid level nerfing!?<P>Yes enchanters are very powerful at mid levels, when in a solid group with mostly tanks and healers, in situations where you are fighting large quantities of mobs that are well below you in level (so easily mezzed).  Now let us look at some other situations.<P>Outdoor hunting: We increase other classes efficiency with haste/clarity as we always do, as well as use slow (if there's no shamen), our one dot (that works very slowly and who's debuff does nothing noticable on mobs) and usually end up using our DD's because we have an overabundance of mana and often no spells to cast.<P>Solo: It is possible only at very low level, then it becomes highly dangerous and difficult around level 20.  I've heard about the wonderous charm tactics that allow us to efficiently solo 4 spectres at once, keep in mind that is at a single place in the game and only doable because there is a zone line close by; that is how unreliable this technique is.<P>In a solid group in a dungeon slightly high for the enchanter: Extremely dangerous, but damn exciting!  We're still able to do croud control on a lesser scale, but a single resist can mean our death, or at least alot of wasted mana for the healer, and the resists are plenty due to your targets often being higher level.<P>The godlike nature of an enchanter comes at a high price, if the conditions are not ideal we are far from godlike unless played extremely well.  I would compare us to rogues in that we are the icing on a group, never a foundation, and in many group situations (even good groups) we aren't doing anything spectacular.  For all this, we can really shine under ideal conditions and sometimes save the day when the crap hits the fan.  Before making any mid level changes, please ask yourselves if this is truly overpowered.<P>-Todd (Tallon Zek)<P>Also~ I'm also discouraged that illusions for others do not seem to be considered as a possibility.  I'd be happy to just get racial illusions for others (at much, much higher level) and forget any new self only ones.  We can turn people into WEREWOLVES at 44th but not into a standard Human!?  Perhaps make the duration and recast the same as BotG so we are unable to bring in an entire entourage but only assist a single individual.  This unique ability would clearly define enchanters as illusionists.  As for faction balence issues, I realize that people (not enchaters) are forced to deal with their faction for reasons, this is why these spells would be given only at very high level and perhaps only used on a single target at once.  Even then it's not as if the character itself gets around the faction, it does so with the assistance of an enchanter, as it is the enchanter's domain.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gift series:<P>I may be alone in this, but I do not see this series being used in the way many of us are invisioning it.  I've never been the type to not worry about having an insanely high INT score as I feel most situations come down to mana regeneration, not how much you have when full.  Having a higher mana pool is useful almost only when doing a "break in" and can expect a rough, drawn out, fight.  Once in, it's a matter of mana regeneration to hold your position, not maximum mana.<P>This makes me think the gift series is best used only in distinct situations where there is some chance of having a huge fight, or when there is a chance of otherwise getting full mana (having the extra can never hurt).  So far I only have gift of magic, but I feel even it is worth casting under the right circumstance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Since I wasn't playing EQ for a few months around when Velious came out, I wasn't there at Velious launch. But since I came back to EQ an odd three weeks after Velious, I have never hunted there. Every enchanter in my guild advises me against it- way, way too many unmezzables.<BR>In a typical high level group there are two classes that really matter. Enchanter and Cleric. Sure, a druid or shaman can heal to some extent, and pretty much any class with Root can do some sloppy crowd control, but none come close to the power a well played enchanter or cleric has. <P>Now, to the point of this: Velious,unmezzables were either intended as A: A way to make the place tougher, or B: A way to lower enchanter power. Probably a combination of the two. If it was mostly A, well, you really didn't have to screw a class to make Velious tougher, there are other ways to make a place difficult without screwing an entire class that, quite frankly, has given up the solo ability of five of the seven casters for group power. If it was mostly B, then why are clerics even more important now? No mezzing means more healing means less places where you can live without a cleric. I ask Absor and Verant to look over this and see if you think that is balanced or not. <P>The second point: religion. I guess this might be as you intended it, but I'll bring it up anyways. As an enchanter you really don't have the choice of religion. Your spells are scattered all about the the opposing factions, your quests- from the lowly Stein of Moggok to the mid level Temple of Solusek Ro quests to the epic Staff of the Serpent- involve you going into pretty much every different faction imaginable for certain components. And, quite frankly, a high elf enchanter worshiping Tunare would have a much, much, MUCH tougher time doing these quests- and it would probably be impossible for him to do some of these- then an agnostic high elf enchanter. I'd also like Verant to look over this point: a Mask Faith spell would really be the perfect solution.<P>I'm going to digress slightly to talk about a related issue. Now, I have no problems being agnostic instead of worshiping Tunare, but in a zone such as the Plane of Growth, you either worship Tunare and do quests or go KoS to elvish cities. If I was a different race enchanter I would be hunting there, but I don't want to go KoS in my home town, not to mention the neighboring one. Plane of Hate doesn't cost you faction with any place but the Plane of Hate. Same with the Plane of Fear. I'm not sure about Mischief, but I know Air costs no faction. However, Growth does not make you KoS in one but two- two!- cities. Would changing the PoG faction to only affect Tunarean Court, thus preventing those who worship Tunare from doing quests there but allowing others to hunt in this plane without going KoS in Felwithe and Kelethin, like Hate and Fear, really be such a bad idea? <P>Third point, enchanter nerfs. If you do decide to nerf enchanters, just remember that we, along with clerics, really can't solo worth much and are relegated to Clarifiers on large raids, since our nukes are all magic based and with a very high resistance rate. So we don't have much to fall back on if you nerf our grouping abilities.<P>And I'd just like to say I support new illusions 100%. They arn't a balance issue, just a cool thing enchanters have and we feel has been taken from us when Verant said "No more illusions, we don't have room" repeatedly and suddenly necromancers are becoming spectres and you have not one, but three different species of bears in global files. Especially Gender and Size illusions.<P>I hope you find some good points here, Absor.<BR>-Kelarniv Mistweb, 54th Enchanter of Lanys T'vyl.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They aren't big mana spells, but if I use any mana, I would like to see something for it.<P>Ideas that have been proposed that I would like to out a vote in for are: Quest to change religion, better armor.<P>One last completely unrealistic suggestion for our pets: Give us a way to get or pets to do the looting and hold a certain amount of items/weight until they are dispelled, when the pet would drop the lootings. I would gladly buy more expensive tiny daggers for the casting if it would save me from having to leave the group to sell loot every 20 minutes.

</FONT><HR>Hi there,<P>I just wanted to point out that one of the key things is weapon enchantment and creation.  Now many of us realize how difficult it would be to create permanent weapons ... but perhaps an option would be to provide spells that can be cast on tank weapons, similar to the spells that Rangers, SK's and Pally's received in the Velious expansion.  I just thought this might be a helpful idea, sorry if it is a repeat of a previous post in the *9* pages of complaints.<P>Syran</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've two suggestion.<P>1. Give us SOMETHING that can land on high MR, you won't see many enchanter post 50+ set foot in an arena or accept a duel.  If the opponent has over 100 MR (which most do at that level) there's not a spell other than tash you can land on him.  Perhaps the higher level Tash spells can have a bit more affect, or give us at least one or two NON-magic based spells.  Anything that uses a different resist would be helpful.<BR>2. The Velious planar robe (beguiler, resplendant, etc...depending where you get it) casts Rune 4.  It DOES require a component and takes 12 seconds to cast.  The component is the same as Rune 5.  Why on earth would anyone ever use this?  For a robe that high level (basically the best in the game for an enchanter) it should either cast Rune 5 with component and long cast time.  Or Rune 4 WITHOUT component.  Either solution might actually give it some use.<P>Thanks.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, thank you for this chance to talk about our problems and to be heared.<P>I a have a level 44 erudite enchanter on Tallon Zek and like surely ALL enchanters playing an a PvP Server I am very unhappy with my class. I know you said, we should talk about PvP later, I understand this , I dont want to talk in details about PvP at this place, but some very important issues have to do with it and EverQuest is for me a PvP Game.(I play since 1 year only on Tallon Zek, no more blue server for me, never again.)<P>I just would like to say you, that enchanters are one of the weakest classes because the very high Magic Resistances of another Players. We can simply not cast on our enemies (especially at higher levels).<BR>Many other people in this thread talked about the problem, that in Velious the MOBS have a too high magic resistance and it make us there unable to play without frustration and countless deads. Imagine, for us poor enchanter on PvP servers is overall Velious with enemies with nearly unbaetable magic resistances. It can be very frustrating to be beaten by a lower level enemy and not be able to hit back, because the enemy is resisting all of my damaging or debuffing spells (except tashani,but it does not helps anything)<P><BR>Ok, now a short list of the problems with the enchanters, non PvP and some PvP:<BR>(I know, many of this was mentioned in another posts, but I want to show you, I am thinking the same)<P><BR>- LULL LINE<BR>is completly useless. It could be a good and important spell, but it does not works in 95% of the time. To solve this problem, please change the lull spells like the level 1 druid spell harmony works.<P>- DEBUFFS ON NPCS<BR>the strength debuffs are useless on monsters. Please change it so, that it really effects the abilities of the MOBs, weaker attacks and slower movement.<P>- WIRL TILL YOU HURL<BR>this could be a nice spell, but it does not works, because it wears off after 1 or 2 seconds, any weak single hit seems to be enough , to break the stun effect. Please make the stun effect nearly unbreakable for a few seconds.<P>- Do not let us harm our group members and his pets on PvP servers<P>- WE HAVE ONLY MAGIC BASED SPELLS<BR>this makes us in many situations completly useless. Plaese give us at least on higher levels ( above 24 ) a Fire (or Poison?) based line of spell. It could be less powerfull than our magic spells.<BR>An idea: Level 24 spell, "Suggestion of heat", fire based DD, 110 Damage. It suggests the MOB it would be burn, a form of hypnosis, a hurting illusion of flames.<P>- TASHANI LINE<BR>This is the most important part of my posting !<BR>The Tashani Line of spells is simply too weak!<BR>Any enchanter spells are magic based and the enchanters REALLY NEED this spell, but (like on the MOBS in Velious) it don`t decreases the magic resistance enough.<BR>Let me explain this:<P>Enchanters get:<BR>At Level 4 : TASHAN   (-13 MR)<BR>At Level 20: TASHANI  (-23 MR)<BR>At Level 44: TASHANIA (-33 MR) !!!!<P>Shamans get:<BR>At Level 19: MALISE     (-20 MR)<BR>At Level 34: MALISEMENT (-40 MR)<BR>At Level 49: MALOSI     (-60 MR) !!!!<P>Why get the shamans much better magic resistance debuffs than the enchanters? I tought Enchanter is the class, specialized on magic, any enchanter spells are magic based!<P>You dont need to change the magic resitances of several mobs in Velious or somewhere else, you just should please (please, please, please!) make the tashani spells better! If tashani is a little bit more effective, than the shaman magic debuffs, we can decrease the MR of the MOBs in velious by ourselfs.<BR>Another possibility would be to give the enchanters at level 49 an upgrade to Tashania. Why we dont get at level 49 an upgrade spell?<BR>Idea: Level 49 Spell Tashans, decrease MR 65 points.<P><BR>Absor, please help us, the problem with the too high magic resistances is horrible. Please make Tashani better ! Please!<P>Thank You,<BR>Amenoron Mezzingu, Level 44 Enchanter<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have't read the whole thread, but I read a recap on caster's realm.<P>I think the whole problem with Gift of Brillance for people is its a huge mana cost for very little added effect. It might not be so bad for your 'typical' sebilis group of cleric/enchanter/shaman/warrior/warrior/rouge where you only have three people who'd want it, but what about in all these multi group raids? Velious is awful for this as its not uncommon to have 4 groups, and since mez is so nerfed there (everything is magic/mez immune for the most part) you'd only be taking one or two enchanters for clarity and speed. Figure two thirds of the people are mana users, that'd be around 6500-7000 mana to cast. Um.. that's a lot. (its 450 mana, right?)<P>I don't know if the engine could support this or not, but I know every enchanter in norrath would kiss you if you could double the mem slots. Perhaps a little arrow at the top of the 8 spell gems that when clicked will pop out a second row of spell gems? I don't know. =( Probably wouldn't be able to hot key or quick cast (Alt 1-8) from those, but would save a TON of spell swapping.<P>Pets:<BR>I've always seens enchanter pets as a defence, not an offence. The problem is, they suck at defence. To me, they've always been around pull a mob off the enchanter and 'take one for the team.' Its my opinion they ought to have a HUGE taunt skill at all levels so there is pretty much no way the mob will ignore them. Of course, they'd die pretty quick, but I think that was the intent. Sort of like a Rune spell but in the form of a pet.<P>There's a nasty tree in PoG that casts a silence spell to prevent spellcasting. Any chance enchanters can get a single target equivilate style for all those damn mobs that gate? Something that would render gate spells ineffective for 10-15 seconds?<P>Taper Enchantment: I'm a bit unclear on how this spell works exactly. From what I can tell, it causes your targets buffs to wear off quicker. Sort of a useless spell, since from what I can tell it only knocks about 5% off the duration and can't be cast over and over for increased effect. Perhaps its just diminishing returns. Its a nice idea, but maybe some upgrade/expansion of this spell line?<BR>Reenforce enchantment: refreshs the duration of buffs by x%.<BR>Disrupt enchantment: upgrade to taper.<P>Another nice spell would be something that overwrites damage shields. Perhaps not for enchanters, but a case could be made for them. Whatever the spell would be called, the effect would be it overwrites damage sheilds to render them 'dispelled' without dispelling the mob. I recall a long time ago when wizards asked for an upgrade to Okeil's they were told something like, "The truth is, I don't think wizards shouldn't have had this spell in the first place, but it wasn't taken out in beta so we can't take it out now. We just won't expand the line further." Then in Velious wizards got an upgrade! Not that I have anything against player wizards, but its the NPC wizards that make this suck. EVERY mob you find in most zones has an anoying 2pt (now 5 pt! *sigh*) damage shield. It would be nice if there was a counter for this type of spell that doesn't get the group's shaman complaining that someone dispelled his Turgors.<P>On that whole "illusion: wolf" issue to grant Sow. I agree, no SoW for wolf form. The part I want to ask here is, Why can't enchanter's wolf illusion be cast indoors? I suspect someone who didn't understand the spell THOUGHT it had a SoW on it and flagged it outdoor only. It doesn't have SoW, it has cold resist, and there's lots of times it would be nice to use.<P>Now, on the whole SoW issue... I could understand if a spell like Augmentation had a SLIGHT sow effect on it as it's already augmenting your arms to swing a little faster, why not legs to run a little faster. IF I were going to ask for it to have speed on it, I'd only ask for about half of the speed as jboots. But at the same time, I really doubt it would stack with SoW (nice if it could!) In fact, if it worked indoors too and still stacked with SoW that'd be nice. I don't think a slight movement increase in indoor dungeons is so bad. But again, I doubt this will happen, but I'll leave it in the discussion.<P>Lastly: on enchanter WITH a religion...<BR>Why not add some spells or items just for them? I know you're not looking for more spells or items suggestions, but its something to at least sit in the back of your mind. =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor<P>Perhaps this won't be addressed.  Perhaps you even have it on file.  But this needs to be looked into.<P>In PvP:<BR>*sigh<BR>Verant has failed to get rid of the Mez bug completely.  AE mez while illusioned targeting a near by npc or pet can mez a close by player for the complete duration of mez inwhich that player can be hit by weapons/spells and can not become free.  Certainly, I do not expect Verant employees to talk about active bugs.  But I just want this to be heard and fix.  <P>The Mez bug still effects enchanters that are illusioned doing a quest.  It has happened many times to me.  A necro/enchanter of an opposite race notices the illusioned enchanter doing the quest and then proceeds to mez/screaming terror them.  Instant mez bug to the enchanter doing the quest.<P>Several times I end up just sitting and die to the player for if I ever get a chance to respond with an offensive spell I lose my life and exp to the quest npc if I drop my illusion.  Calling a GM to watch me do the quest is a hour job minium for a response.<P>I am not asking for Verant to give us anything back in pvp.  I don't even mind my Direct Damage spells being resisted by players all the time.  I just do not want any quick half fixes like that with mez, charm, fear.<P>Still bothers me a little when an enchanter cast charm on a player's pet and after charm wears off the pet has a chance of going rogue or becoming the enchanter's pet.  <P>Fear/blind cannot effect players but can effect a players pet causing a huge aggro list in dungeons.<P>Another thing, I went LD the other day in nek forest and happened to have charm up in one of my Jem slots.  I had been attacked by a warrior Dark elf and was running for my life.  After being drop by my internet provider and becoming LD and then reloging back on I was spammed with a 100 tells or  so of how I had charmed the attacking Warrior DE player into killing a bunch of young players at the pyramid in nek.  8(  very bad  8(  made me not want to play again for a bit.<P>Sorry about my English and my grammar.<P>Look I know none of this is high priority but I sure hope it is on the list to get fixed 8(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hi, i tried playing an enchanter and actually got him to level 8, but now starts my problem with the lull and mez line of spells, i was camping orc 2 with a group and for a while, my lull and soothe and mez spells were doing their jobs, i would lull 3 and tell our puller to pull a mob, there were 4 in the camp<P>first point, i lull 3 out of 4, why is it that when that happens 2 orcs always jump in when pulled? is it because of the lull range? i tried mez still the same result<P>second point, and this is really what ticks me off...after a little while, my spells were always resisted and all 4 or 5 orcs would just rape me, needless to say i died 5 times lost a lot of xp and the sheer frustration just made me want to quit.<P>is there something i am doing wrong here?<P>in my oppinion, enchanters cant do jack with melee so when lull (and others) is resisted, we die.  it is just utterly frustrating that you die and die on end. can you change this? maybe make mez and lull more potent, or maybe the mob wont aggro when it fails, i was thinking that the spell was like just suggesting to the mob that it should just calm down and stay there, if it fails, the mob just ignores the suggestion and not get hyper about a little voice in its head telling it to calm down.  <P>also, i mezzed a centurion since the group pulled a lego and a cent, the group cant seem to kill the lego so i decided to cast invis on me after spending about 3 or 4 mezzes on the centurion so that when the mob gets out of the mez, it doesnt go out and hunt me, but then, the orc attacks me like he sees me, i know my invis succeeded so why was he able to attack me? orcs dont see invis right?<P>please fix the enchanter class, i dont care if people say enchanters are too powerful I JUST DONT THINK SO, if they were then why would i die 5 times just trying to lull, also countless times that i almost died because i was crowd controlling with mez.<P>another point, people always say, tashan then mez...i just dont get it, how the hell can you tashan and mez when after casting tashan you cant pull off another spell because the mob's just too fast that after you cast tashan its all over you in a few seconds.  i might just be ignorant of the ways so show me.....but i still say fix the enchanters, theyre too hard to play and i wouldnt be surprised if people wont play them.  i mean wizards can kill with their nukes, magicians and necros have very strong pets, enchanters seem to be getting the scraps here.<P>please dont flame me alright, im a newbie and you were once too....just remember that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
