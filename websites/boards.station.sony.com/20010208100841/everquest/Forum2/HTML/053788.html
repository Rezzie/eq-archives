Not a good thing. Imagine Uber-MOB raid with several rogues. After the MOB is killed it is found to contain no loot? Hmmmmmm. I don't think rogues ever want to be put in this position. Imagine the level of distrust.<P>"Instill doubt...we need more of a chance for it to work..."<BR>-Instill doubt (i.e. Instill Train) Not that useful a skill but could use some improvement to help soloing ability I guess.<P>"Sence Traps/Disarm Traps...Just get rid of it all together or find a purpose for it."<BR>-These have some use in Vellious now.<P>"Evade...Having to stand perfectly still to evade kind of makes me wonder if we are trying to evade or stand there to get hit.

Not a lot of Role Playing sense but understandable for game balance.<P>"Backstab...its the missing thing Rogues miss too much."<BR>-Lost me on this one. Decreased misses=Increased damage.

</FONT><HR>I agree with most of what Cravin suggested except the stealing of magic items.  I also play a druid and I would think twice about grouping with a rogue if I thought that the items I was camping  could potentially be "stolen".  Also, since you don't need to be engaged in combat to steal, it would make it possible to loot steal from other groups thus making Rogues a hated class.  No thanks.<P>Let's talk poison making.<BR>This has got to be one of, if not the most, annoying trade skills.  It's expensive in the extreme, second only to jewlcraft (and just trying selling your made poisons).  You have to travel all of Norrath to get the components which are located on creatures never happy with the method of collection.  On top of that you fail left and right at making the poisons, fail at applying them, get resisted when using or zone/log and lose them.  And don't forget that we can only apply one poison at a time and have to use it before applying another.  Not to mention we do this while SITTING.  (Just try to apply a poison during combat)<BR>I can actually live with all of this.  But PLEASE let us combine the finished product in a potion bag!!  Does it really matter that I have a 5 or 10 shot poison that I can still only apply one at a time??<P>I just love pickpocketing something nice just to find out that I am out of inventory space due to the single shot poisons I am lugging around.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heh I am not sure what level rogue you play but any notion of improving rogues in anyway in the endgame is kinda silly, they are amazingly powerful. Don't get me wrong as a warrior I love grouping with rogues and would hate to see them get nerfed. But when they do I will not be surprised. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;AC and Hitpoints of a rogue-Need to stay the same&lt;&lt;<BR>-Agreed. Its what we pay for...<P>&gt;&gt;Damage output is NOT a problem.&lt;&lt;<BR>-Agreed, except for...<P>&gt;&gt;Rogues miss too much.&lt;&lt;<P>This is SO TRUE. I think that there is a flat 'chance to completely miss' on backstab. You really have to actually PLAY a Rogue to see this. Get your Rogue and fight something green. REALLY green. Like orc pawns @25, ghouls@50, etc... <P>Regardless of what your ATK is, you will FLAT OUT MISS your backstabs against these enemies with much higher consistency than regular attacks. For example- mobs this green you will probably connect on 90+% of your regular melee hits, but only 60-70% of your backstabs.<P>Personally, Id rather have my average backstab do that %less damage then miss that %more often, but thats just my opinion...<P>&gt;&gt;Pickpocketing...I don't see why we can't pickpocket magical items with an even less chance of than normal items...for example if you had 30% chance of pickpocketing some words...why not 10% chance of pickpocketing a majical item.&lt;&lt;<BR>-I disagree. Can you say farming?<P>&gt;&gt;Sneak and hide...Great except for the miss cons&lt;&lt;<BR>-See invis is weird with sneak. I fail to see how seeing invisible lets you see something behind you...<P>Also the mis-cons effect lots of people. Can you say deepwater caimans?<P>&gt;&gt;Evade...Having to stand perfectly still to evade kind of makes me wonder if we are trying to evade or stand there to get hit. Other than that the skill works wonderful.&lt;&lt;<BR>-If you have a faster machine and a slower machine, evades are A LOT HARDER to pull off on the slower machine. Theres a whole 'drift' effect that happens on slower machines when you get hit that makes casting and evading much more difficult. Fix that and evade will be working right.<P>&gt;&gt;Instill doubt...we need more of a chance for it to work...&lt;&lt;<BR>-Actually the chance is fine IMHO. What is broken is that, after a successful ID, your first backstab FAILS. Not misses, not reg. pierce (like bs hits from front) you hit the button and NOTHING happens.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It will increase as fast as your sneak does now.  It don't till after 53 I think of 55 not sure &lt;my rogue is only 51 atm&gt;<P>Magical items being pickpocketed (I was wrong in the original post)  I agree with you all...  they should not be pickpocketable.  <P>Poisons stackable...that is a wonderful idea...I don't touch poisons...ATM the way they are they are a real waste of time and effort for the results of single poisons to carry.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>In a nutshell(from a pre-fifty rogue's view):<P>AC and Hit Points: okay- as a majority, we rogues agree we are not tanks, we are damage specialists.<P>Damage output: iffy- its fine as long as we're not missing, but unfortunately(I'm not sure about others) I miss quite a bit for max skill cap for lvl(offense, piercing, double attack), this includes backstab(all of which are at 200,except for dual wield which is at 209 I think).(Btw, this is from behind, I'm pretty sure our misses are way more from infront, atleast mines are)<P>Pickpocketing: so-so- we're okay about the not being able to pick magic items considering the temptation of the dishonest folk(not all rogues) that would take advanatage of it. Of course I'd think a cap of 200 would limit it's uses on mobs post 50.<BR>*/e shrugs* I wouldn't know yet....<P>Instill doubt: needs work- Although dangerous indoors(causes trains), its a very useful skill outdoors when your dealing with more than one mob or trying to get away from one. Only problem is you it fails as much on a green mob(i.e. orc mid teens mob) as it does on a blue mob(i.e. wan ghoul knight 40's ish mob). I think for near lvl cap it should atleast work more on one than the other. My personal gripe about it is(feel free to explain to me whether or not my complaint is valid) that the speed of Instill doubt is pretty slow, allowing a mob to kick the crap out of you as attempt it(and very often miss on the first few attempts), I think they should make the time the equivalent as a regular fear spell.<P>Sense Trap/Disarm Traps: okay- since kunark and SoV have dungeons where these skills are of use, its not use-less, although I have had one situation where it said you sense no traps when a guantlet was swinging left and right before me(In Sol A near the entrance) <P>Evade: okay- gives rogues a reverse taunt, can't move while doing it and doesn't always work, but it helps quite a bit.<P>Backstab: okay...- delay fine, damage good, missing on blue mobs as well as green mobs(yes I miss green mobs) a little more than more than what seems right.<P>Throwing: okay- don't really mind losing the knives we throw, think the range could be improved a bit to make pulling with them not as painful. (if you've hunted giants in fm you know what I'm talking about)<P>Safefall: needs work- Right off the bat I ask why do monks have a higher safefall skill then we do? The primary use of safefall is to keep the user from taking damage A. As they fall while running in hilly terrains(most likely trying to escape from a mob) or B.dropping threw pit falls in dungeons. Backing up A.- After lvl 17 monks don't have to run from mobs, they can just Feign Death, thus eliminating their need to run(atleast far or hastily enough to fall down a steep decline) B. Rogues are mostly likely sent to scout dungeons and most likely to drop down pitfalls not monks.<BR>Would be nice if our skill cap would be increased.<P>Alright I've gotten that safefall gripe off my chest. Now, an area that really needs a revamping, Poison Making.......<P>Ups: Some good dd, snare, and dot poisons<P>Downs: 1.EXPENSIVE(can't really do anything about this)<P>2.Only good for one shot per fight- In a fight, after the first injection of poison, your not goona want to sit down and reapply because <BR>A. your not goona want to be taking away from the amount of time you could be attacking and bsing the mob<BR>B. you risk the chance of a pop or wandering mob walking by and start smacking the hell out of you(Lower Guk comes to mind). To fix this we should be able to stand while applying and have the testers at verant figure a timing that won't kill us or prove inefficient.<P>3. A hassle to carry around- its sad that 4 bags of successfully made poisons(atleast 92pp worth of work, not including failures, and this is if you have high cha, I don't so it costs me about 5pp an attempt, you do the math on that) won't last a little more than half an hour. Being able to stack them would be nice.<P>Less important:<BR>Disarm: */e shrugs*- not the most useful skill when mobs hit you for 72's armed and 68's when unarmed, have know idea what to do with this.....<P>Anyhow this is pretty much what I've read and think. I'm sure there may have been stuff that I have missed as well too, but if I missed it I'm also sure someone else will add it in another post.
