I know, your first question is going to be, how did I decide to pick druids to be next? Well, honestly, it just came up in conversation today with a co-worker. There’s no trick to it. I would certainly address the ones most in need first, but until I’ve actually done all these posts, I won’t know which is most in need… (let’s not make that the topic of this post, please)<BR>So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a ‘balanced’ class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that’s a valid question for any class –<P>This time I’m starting this post with very little information to lead with, so I feel like I’m at a bit of a disadvantage. I do know that, like many other classes, some druids feel that they don’t have enough to do while at the final encounter of the big raid. One of the suggestions to change that falls along the same lines as one proposed by the shaman community, changing/improving their healing abilities post 50.<P>I want you to understand that I think druids are pretty well balanced all around, and I really see little that needs to be changed (and that’s partially why I picked them to be the topic today…). So you’ll have to be convincing, logical and articulate to convince me. <P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor-<BR>    First I'll say that I am a level 40 Druid and I really do not think we need better healing spells.  To do so would be, in my opinion, "nerfing the Clerics".  Clerics are designed to be primary healers and Druids/Shamans are secondary healers that's  the way it is.  Looking at fizzle rates and maybe reducing casting time is would be a good idea or maybe even a self only heal that is equal to a Clerics (given out at level 49+)  That way a Cleric wont have to worry about Druids as much during epic battles and can concentrate on the Tanks.  If you do increase Druid/Shaman healing powers...be ready for a bunch of angry Clerics and happy Druids/Shamans (some of which are probaly unhappy with me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> right now).  As for the end of a battle, I have plenty to do and still feel important with my heals and I am still a valuable member of that party.  Thats my 2cp worth!<P>Saunter<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>                      One thing that really hurts a druid &lt;more so than the majority of casters&gt; is the lack of a mana restoring<BR>                      spell. Hell, we're Druids we glean our powers from nature. Give us a canablize/dark pact/clarity/breeze<BR>                      type spell. I play w/ necro's and Shaman's all the time.

</FONT><HR>Now.  One player says making druids have better heals will be nerfing the clerics.<P>Magicians have almost same blasts as wizards and even have a pet.<P>It wouldn't be much different then that.  Clerics still have better HP/AC buffs and a spell no one else will ever get (except by clickable item)  Resurrect.<P>In my opinion, Druids have ports, have dang good damage shields, competable HP buffs, walking speed buffs, heals, blasts, dots, snares, roots, summon killing spells (hail the Hole), STR spells regens.  They're already powerful, this healing increase is all they need.  They don't need a mana regening spell, Sorry guy who suggested that.  The only thing they'd need, is a pet that does more then just make big trains, or to have it removed completely.<P>Quantuma Starfury - Lvl 51 Wizard on E'ci and<BR>Lvl 51 HONEST druid E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well first off I spent over an hour typing, went to the restroom, came back and POOF "the blue screen of death", fatal exception, had to restart...so now you're gonna get just a summary.<P>Then I try to post and it's closed, I was ready to drive off a cliff, but alas PART IV<P>First off, I read part 3 page one then skipped to 6 and read it, Absor or Alan, whoever reads all these posts are underpaid, wear glasses and have tylenol/advil always handy...I didn't have another week just to read all this druid stuff<P>I'm a 35 wood elf druid, my main character, only other character is 5 Ogre shaman, been playing for over 4 months, so I'm not as keen on other classes...enuf talking, on to solutions<P>***Idea 1 - Mana Regen - Outdoors only<BR>1. Commune w/ Nature - Group - lvl 24 (1/2Breeze)<BR>2. Commune w/ Nature II - Group - lvl 34 (1/2Clarity)<BR>3. One w/ Nature - Target - lvl 44 or 49 (clarity)<P>***Idea 2 - Lower Group Spell Levels<BR>Our soloing prowess is lost after 34, don't have enuf mana to kill big things with lots of HP unless you're a twink due to mana/dmg ratio and melee is extremely unbalanced (in the game period NPC to PC dmg is unreal)and this would help with the new "Please Group" policy.<P>***Idea 3 - appearance (not a priority)<BR>Only difference between me wearing what I have and being naked is the gnoll hide gloves that i wear are black...otherwise I ALWAYS have a frigin tree on my chest<P>***Idea 4 - Teleport to Plane of Growth<BR>I've seen mentioned that druids don't have a tp there, but wizzies have 2 planar tp's? I'm nowhere close to any planes but it seems reasonable for Growth tp.<P>***Idea 5 - Increase the HP/AC of shield spells<BR>I don't know how you figure dmg but getting smacked for 50-90 doesn't seem like I have any AC, so an HP and AC boost would be real nice<P>***Idea 6 - Increase/Decrease in Attack<BR>Natural weapons or non-metal get a 10% increase to attack, non natural weapons get 10% decrease to attack - seems fair. <P>***Idea 7 - Exp penalty<BR>I don't think druids are the best but I believe they are the safest at soloing, perhaps a slight penalty as such 10% soloing, none grouping? I don't know how feasible that is, but if you want groups then there should be none while grouping (by your example the old hybrids would take more exp cause they needed more, correct?)<P>***Idea 9 - Group Damage Shield<BR>I'm not realistic about this, but druids might need that 500mana and time it takes to cast it on all people. <P>Conclusion - I'd take a 15% exp penalty if you implement all my ideas...before everyone yells at me for the penalty, if they would rather solo and sit for 5min to get full mana or lower downtime, might even out actually, kill faster - same experience - less downtime... COME ON VI!!!!<P>My other post had some more explaination but my computer had to go an aggravate me and so you get a summary which is probably better for you with all these posts. I have other comments but they are game specific not druid specific so I won't waste your time with them here. <P>Bottom line is that any group can be good, i'll grp with 5 clerics, i don't care...i hate the people that look for specific classes. Druids are great, if not best, all around class and great for groups...a penalty would be rational to keep them that way.<P>MORE EVENTS ON INNORUUK SERVER PLZ!!! :&gt; )<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello all,<P>First, I'd like to say that all in all, I find my Druid very fun to play.  He is if anything the master of verstility in the outdoors.  And I'm not one to advocate making him more "dungeon friendly".<P>So basically as far as game mechanics, I'm fine with him.<P>I do have an issue with playability in general, and actually I guess I'll be making a similar post about most of the classes.<P>It's about quests and content.  Specifically for the Under 30+ crowd.  With the release of RoK and SoV, there are a HUGE number of things for the 30+ crowd to do, plus the recent free expansion The Hole is also for the higher levels.  The result is, I having played Everquest for over a calendar year, and having spent a fair amount of time (one character has over 32 played days time) and having yet to have a single 30+ level character, have found that there is less and less to do, I'm concidered worthless as I am untwinked.  Basically it feels as if the game growth has turned into a feeding freenzy for high levels, and thier friends.  Actually I've found that on Nameless where I play that most new character I meet are decked out better than I can hope to achieve in another years play because of 'twinking'.<P>Here's my summary, after some two years in release, and maybe a million adjustments, I sincerely doubt that there are any real tangible changes that need to be or should be made to any of the classes, much less Druids (aka the masters of Kiting, as I so enjoy doing).<P>I mean, think about it, what other game out there has under gone the shear number of changes this one has?  Don't most game designers create thier game worlds and the players have to adapt to it?  Here it seems as if the players always want a new edge handed to them.<P>Mostly when I come to these boards all I see are people wanting more raw power, and more powerful items.  The result is, outside of moving to a brand new server, I, and I suspect many non-power gamers out there see nothing but a world filled with twinks on a mad rush to 60th level.<P>Maybe, just maybe it's time to put the classes to rest, and either put EQ itself to rest in favor of developing a better game world were the idea of earned prestige has more value, or some serious thinking should be done on how to make it so that having a Flowing Black Robe (not a casual item for an under 30 group to obtain) is of value to someone other than the 2nd level twink.<P>Come on guys, aren't there any old times out there who really did earn everything from the outset?  What about the guys from the very first servers during beta?  I can't be a lone voice here, surely some others feel more than a little sad that some how the only purpose for levels 1 through 50 is some job you do were others twink you and power level you up so that you can "finally" play the game...  I mean, if that's the case, why not just start all new characters at 50?<P>Just my 2cp. sorry if I offended anyone.<P>- Elemer<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mainly, I see Druids as masters (if of anything) of transportation.  I know Wiz have TP's too - but Druids also can Sow and travel from point A to B faster then any other class (if it is a long journey).  That is basically why I think SCALE OF WOLF is so useLESS and could be so useFULL!<P>What I propose is to INCREASE the speed of Scale of Wolf to that of Cheetah.  It would make traveling a tad bit easier, yet still have the dangers.  Scale is hardly used currently - IF at all - It just plain SUCKS!  You get casted on, you lost your speed, and it is hardly faster then SoW.  Therefore not worth using.  Ask any druid where they have it, i am guessing 90% of them have it buried in their books (probably next to cheetah, hehe).  I never even memmed Spirt of Scale (always traded it in or traded it away), as I would NEVER use it in it's current form.  I think increasing it to Cheetah speed and maybe increasing the casting time to maybe 7+, something so as not to replace Cheetah (A fast cast, self-only spell that we already do NOT use ever since it's nerf, err.. excuse me, it's fix.)<P>Another item - Druids have no way of regaining Mana faster.  Shaman's have Cannibalize and are a priest, with us a nature's priests it (to me) would make sense for us to have a way to regen mana in some way, even if it was minor.<P>*My proposal* - SLN was toyed around with before, why not try again.  Change the little bit of regen from HPs to mana.  Make druids WANTED (not needed) in large raids.  Casters would want SLN, not Heroic bond or other cleric ac/hp buff.  It would also stay in line with the level 60 spell that is group and does add mana regen.  SLN might only add two points or so Mana regen, but better then nothing.<P>PLEASE!!  That is all I ask.  Make Scale of Wolf Usefull and give us a wanted status in large raids. I have actually be turned away from raids SPECIFICALLY because I was a druid and I was told they were useless.  Please help us define a roll in high level (post 50) groups.<P>Oh, and the healing changes would be sweet too!<P>Thanks for hearing us, Absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heals 50+ need a bit of work, superior heal just doesn't cut it for grouping past 55. I'd like to see superior heal lowered to late 40's and another heal put in place at 55.<P>Complete Healing and Res will still give clerics a monopoly on groups as Shamans and Druids even with a better heal can not compete with a clerics complete healing ability or their buffing ability.<P>Example to remember is a tank at 55 with the right buffs can have 4000 hps. A cleric uses 400 mana to fully heal that tank the druid or shaman will use 1500 mana 6 * 250 and that is assuming you can get 6 superior heals off without a fizzle, which just doesn't happen.<P>As for the 55 pet I really don't know what Verant was thinking here. A pet that maxes for 28 but can barely hit anything, only has 400 hps and costs 600 mana just to summon? I'd love to know how they expected a druid to put this to use. Ripostes will kill it, fully buffed it will last 3-4 seconds against anything blue to a 55 druid and at best maybe doing 100 damage.<P>Why couldn't the pet have given a wisdom bonus or a regeneration bonus to the druid instead? It's impossible to keep the thing alive as it is why not reward druids for doing this?<P>Lastly to the person who felt Snare should be fragile, I assume you don't hunt in dungeons or never have. Snare is one of the most critical spells for a group to have to prevent a mob from fleeing and bringing back 10 friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A couple reminders/requests.<BR>This is a FlameGuard(R) post, Guaranteed to put any flamer to sleep out of sheer length.<P>The following spells are broken/bugged/notworkingastheyshouldbe<P>Succor/Egress They don't clear agro. --This is a bad thing -- You cast it, and a 51+ mob is agro on you and you DIE. You get summoned back.  <BR>Egress is ODO. An outdoor escape spell.  The wizard version isn't odo. Why ours?  Why should we take the huge mana sink off of succor just to get out of a dungeon.<BR>Succor sucks a ton of mana. I understand that it was intended to be able to be cast if you're low on mana but the drain is insane, It also doesn't appear to be a fixed ammount. I lose about 2.2 bubbles from casting. that's about 1200 of my mana. 900 sucked out, and 300 for casting it, but I've had high level hybrids complain about being sucked from fm to 0m from it, and clerics losing over 1500 mana.  This spell sits at the back of my spell book.  <BR>Finally, these spells are inappropriate as evacs in many zones because they dump you places that aren't safe.  Chardok for instance.<P>Tunare's Request<BR>Not sure if it's not membluring at all now, doesn't memblur very often now, or doesn't erase agro on kos mobs, but after several attempts to make a nice little panther pet in velious last week I gave up and switched to Call of Karana, since it was coming at me with a vengence every time it broke.  IF THIS SPELL DOESN"T STOP AGRO IT IS JUST A HIGHER COST, EASIER BREAKING, LONGER RECAST, LOWER LEVEL CAP VERSION OF A LOWER LEVEL SPELL!<P>Wake of Karana<BR>why why why does it take 400 mana, an opal, and 6 minutes to turn of the rain?<P>Druid Skin line<BR>Why does the mana cost have to be so high that no one will even consider casting them unless solo?  If you're group with a cleric (ie. 'if you're in a group') you never bother.  nearly 3x the cost of reso/hero on sln/ns for 2 and 4hp/tick respectivly.  The tanks want skin instead of hero, but I can't justify giving it to them, and even if I could the cleric breathes down my neck because then he can't use heroic bond as a group heal (far more efficient than the other cleric group heals)Resoloution is 110, skin like nature is 300.  Heroism 140 Natureskin 400.  Protection of the Glades is nice, I look forward to it in 2 levels, it's a hp buff my group will let me cast, for 1200 mana could I maybe get 6hp/tick too? I don't think that's going to overpower the MOST EXPENSIVE SPELL IN THE GAME.<P>Healing:  <BR>Ok, Sheal to 49. Lets druids/shamen at least fulfill their role on vox/nag raids as secondary healers.  Assuming of course you kill the offensive fizzle rate.  The suggestion was what? Remedy to 55 and divine light to 60?  Isn't Divine light the best "instant" healing spell that clerics get? Should druids/shamen get that?  Granted I haven't seen divine light cast alot since it is also plagued by fizzles, and is rarely more efficient than cheal, but still, a druid really shouldn't heal equivelantly to a cleric in any respect.  We are secondary healers. <BR>Before kunark, and pre 50 until velious, what advantage druids/shamen had in healing was the regen line of spells. Now comes kunark and suddenly clerics have regen spells that put ours to shame.  Now comes velious and clerics a pre 50 regen spell that puts ours to shame.  Instead of Infringing upon cleric instant heal rights, why not give druids/shamen a celestial healing clone at 55, then at 60, where shamen get torpor, give druids a *group* celestial healing clone.  Since druids have always gotten the group regens.  Bigger and Faster heals aren't really the problem. The problem is efficiency.  A fast heal would be nice, but won't solve the problem. The problem is, Sup heal does 530hp. for 250 mana. Barely a 2:1 ratio.  2400 mana, is 5088hp, little more than 1 cheal on a high 50's buffed warrior.  Slow, but efficient dot heals (but not so slow and efficient as the regen line) Would augment cleric healing, speed recovery time, and allow Clericless groups to handle slightly bigger game by dot healing, then chain sup healing.  Give the same spells to clerics, at lower levels! But don't just repeat the same 2:1 mana -&gt; hp heals.  cheal is 10:1 on a 60 ogre warrior, can't druids get a 3:1 on the same player?  Don't forget that these heals you're giving us do considerably less than their cleric equivelants.  My sup heal does 530, a level 40 cleric's does 583, with a much lower fizzle rate. Our remedy will do 398, and our Divine light will do 800 (if we get it at 60), again, barely breaking the 2:1 ratio.  <BR>Fixing the fizzle problem on sup heal would allow even a druid to keep a tank alive on a single mob, that however is not the problem. The problem is, a group with a druid as primary healer is going to get less xp than a druid soloing, even with xp buffs for groups and zones.  Why spend an hour lfg in karnors or sebilis when you can get better xp in burning wood soloing low blues?  Druids solo because we have winged death. Winged death, 143/tick for 9 ticks. If you put that in a heal for the same 350 mana would it be overpowered?  Just my suggestion.  Level 55, 143hp/tick 350 mana.  If you've read this far and still have the energy to flame, I commend you.  Some of my points may be vague or ludicrous in your views.  Just remember, I've been up all night, It's late, and I'm about to go to sleep, I'm not thinking altogether clearly, what's your excuse?<BR>    50+ is a specialist's game.  Nothing is going to change that.  A cleric is always going to be preferable in a group over a druid or shamam.  I don't know about shaman, but someone said that clerics don't stack, but druids do.  Druids do not stack. Two druids in the same group end up with one being constantly oom, and the other sitting around nuking, just like when you have 2 clerics in a group.  We don't want to replace clerics, we just want abilities that compliment clerics, and allow us gain more xp in a group without a cleric than we would soloing.  <BR>                Sincerly<BR>         Raenya Lupine 58th Preservative of Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have one question about druids that has been on my mind since I started playing a druid and another that is more of a general question:<P>1. In regards to teleporting, why is there no tp spell for the ring near kelethin? Arguably, wood elves are one of the 2 most popular race choices for druids (the other halfling, of course) yet we have no way of tping close to our home town. We do get a tp spell near the halflings' hometown (misty thicket). I know there are other rings in the game that druids do not utilize, but it always seemed strange that we could not use this particular one.<P>2. When going on a big raid, such as a naggy raid, that requires more than one group of people to win, who gets xp for the kill? I have yet gotten a character to the level required to join a raid like this so I am jumping the gun a little but I have been wondering about this for some time. Can anyone answer this post, either Absor or someone who has been a some raids?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I play a 11th druid on Vazelle and find that the class is fun and intresting to play, but I am a little worried about the lack of any mid level druid quests. I know that this has been raised, but some mid level quest items/armor/weapons would be nice. Nothing fancy, maybe just a nice scimitar with a couple of wis points, maybe some mana giving armor, you know.<P>Also, I would like to see the magician like pet idea put in. The idea that you charm an animal and then it agros on you after a certain amount of time is silly. Hey, shawmen get a pet spell with unlimited time, shouldent we?<P>Thanks for letting me vent,<P>Leggas (11th season druid)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Not a druid here, but I think that balancing druids for healing at higher levels is a definate must.  I think the choice of Remedy at 55 and lowering level of Superior heal to 49 is a good thought, but Divine Light might be a bit much.  I think a high density regen-type spell that functions similarly to Celestial Healing is the perfect extension of a druids healing capabilities.  Making a new regen spell that could stack with the effects of Celestial healing / torpor would be perfect.   Giving it Divine Light total healing over 30 seconds with a reasonably fast cast time would be good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been kind of following this thread for a little bit, alternately excited about the changes, and annoyed with some who gripe about druids being overpowered.<P>My primary character is a level 51 druid...I have never quad-kited, but I will admit that I have soloed through several levels.  Yes, there is a high population of druid players on every server.....pre-level 40.  Why?  Because after level 40, the druids ability to be a significant addition to a group severely takes a nosedive.  Alternatively, the opportunities (especially post 50) for soloing go down, as the mobs just resist too much and have too many health points.<P>All of the examples that people have given here as for why druids are OVERPOWERED are examples of their soloing ability.  We are not asking for more solo power, people!  /bonk  We are asking to be made a more viable addition to a group.  Yes, we can do a lot of things to solo, but every time I have ever joined a group (pickup group, guild group, whatever), I have been brought on board as healer/snarer/evacer.  Especially if we don't have a cleric.  Our AC/HP buff is great (not as good as the cleric's), our strength buff is great (not as good as the shaman's), our resists are on par with the other classes who have resists, however ours (and the shaman's) heal is horrid.  I have walked into Karnor's before, and offered to join a group of 5 in the Courtyard who didn't have a healer period and I was told that they were going to hold out for a cleric.  Class envy?  Possibly. :P  However when my guild is short on clerics for a plane raid, then who gets to play primary healer for a group?  Me!  I think we need the tools to make our jobs as healers easier, and quite frankly I don't think getting superior heal 4 levels before we were already getting it will infringe any on the cleric's importance in a group.  As for any other heals that we can get post 50, that would be nice, however I'm not holding my breath.  All rambling aside, clerics will always be desired for raids and dungeons because they can rez fallen party members.  Even if a druid had the same healing capabilities of a cleric, that guaranteed experience recovery is enough of a bonus that would still make clerics the primary choice.<P>Just as a test, any clerics who are keeping up with this thread, go to Karnor's and try to keep your group alive using only greater heal.  ONLY.  And you think we can do everything.....in the post 50 game, druids CAN'T do everything.<P>Now, please don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against clerics in general.  I love clerics!  When we have one around, it means I don't have to pretend that I am a good healer.  I just want to give you guys an idea of why you see so many druids camping for other classes' quest armor...it's because we're tired of hanging out in dungeons with the LFG tag on listening to the crickets chirp and we're making a new character that will actually be useful.<P>My 2cp anyway.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's my two cents on things that might be appropriate for druids.<P>Cent 1: Our healing powers are of very little value at higher levels. The previous suggestions of making Superior Heal a level 49 spell and adding Remedy post 50 would help, but I agree - the big healing spells should always belong to clerics. The healing power of druids and shaman should be more regnerative in nature, as opposed to clerics who are more direct healing in nature. My proposal would be to give Celestial Healing/Elixer to druids and shaman. These two spells should have been given to druids and shaman rather than clerics in the first place.<P>Cent 2: Actually this applies to all spell casting classes. Given the fact that it is nearly impossible to sit to med during high level encounters, and the increased length of such encounters especially in Velious due to higher mob hit points, it should become unnecessary to sit to med at say level 55.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ohh, UBER raid = '7 people killing fire beetles in south ro'  I like that  !!  Wonder what kind of high lvl group that takes?  <P>Here is something you should think about.<BR>You in your own words could EASILY heal an experience group.  But for Icewell keep, you need a cleric.  I honestly don't see a problem with this.  Of course you need a cleric.  Clerics are a class that were designed to be needed in groups, otherwise they'd have been made with SOME solo abilities.  Just because there are more druids than clerics doesn't mean that clerics should be any less needed.  What it means is that there is a class balance issue.  I'll leave it to you to figure out who is in need of getting added abilities.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok to start off post 50 druids suck in epic/even just reg high lvl dungeon raids.  I know this cause I'm a lvl 58 druid.<P>I think the main reason behind this is cause verant has given us no niche in the everquest community besides good soloers.  Well, I hate soloing but I love my druid....<P>Few things I'd like to see....<P>1.  Coat series castable on others besides self only.<P>2.  Make winged death check resist like wizard lure series giving us a function in epic raids.  Its a 45 second long dot does alittle over 1k damage and only one dot can be on the mob at any time...<P>3.  We are back up healers.  (NOT CLERIC WANNABES) Make us more effiecent in this duty.  Sheal to 44/49 and another heal at 55.  Do not and I repeat do not give us remedy/divine light this is encroachment on clerics in my oppinion.  We should get a spell near divine light say at 55 that does 800 pts healing to 1000 pts at 60 that takes 7 seconds to cast.  Which is 2.5 seconds longer then divine light, 3 seconds faster then cheal.  As well, make this spell alittle mroe mana efficient.<P>These 3 things in my belief would define our place in everquest.<P>We'd have ac/ds shield to cast on group mates that stacks with cleric buffs, a dot that we could use in epic battles, and serve our secondary purpose as back up healer as we are suppose to and not at the lvl a paladin should beable to heal.<P><BR>I also have a wish kind of list that I don't see as unbalancing but want to put it out there anyway.<P>I pretty much play my druid as a battle druid.  I forgo wisdom for other stats/resist/hp.  I was pretty effective pre50 in this role and obtained respect in my efforts as a druid.  Post 50 I suck... plain and simple.  Now I'm no tank and don't desire to be one but I do desire better/more skills post 50 as a melee priest.<P>To give a better idea I'll give a slight run down on way I see it.  Clerics are pure defensive class with little offensive power.  Druids are a pure offensive class with little defensive power.  Finally, Shamans are a mix of offensive/defensive.<P>I think like Bards (note I'm not trying to compare priests to bards) we should get an increase to our melee or defensive capabilities.<P>I'll start with Druids since I am one.  Druids at say 58 getting dual wield to max at 50 pts.  Not alot to be overbalancing but also at same time offering a grouping function to them as well some risk since we are basically damage dealers. =)<P>Clerics get parry at 58 to max at 50 pts skill since as I stated they are basically a defensive class.<P>Shamans since they are a mixture recieving bash at lvl 58 to max at 50 skill.  Bash is a mixture of offensive/defensive doing damage as well stunning spell casters which in turn is a way of defense.<P>The last part was a wish list type thing for priests.  I do think we deserve at least an increase in dodge post 50 shesh....give us a break...with sov stuff hits HARD!<P>Baur L'Ruab<BR>58 Druid <BR>7th Hammer<BR>The Dark Exile</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've played a druid as my primary character for over a year and a half, and I really like many of the ideas Absor suggests.<P>First and foremost I absolutely agree that druids should be given Superior Heal at 49. I've grouped rather than soloed for most of my time in EQ, and having a better heal at my level (I'm 51 now) would make a world of difference. I don't believe it would detract at all from a cleric's role -- clerics will always be hugely in demand for resurrect abilities, buffs, and complete heal.<P>However I often have to group without a cleric, and thus the role of healer falls to me. If a shaman is in the group, his dot/debuff spells are so important that I am often designated healer instead of the shaman. And at 51 this means that I have to chain-cast my healing spell constantly once a fight starts, which barely heals a bubble of damage to a buffed tank my level. At lower levels, I was confident in my ability to heal a group effectively in tight situations. At 51, I don't feel my abilities allow me to adequately fill a healing role in a group.<P>Obviously many folks choose to play druids; if druids had sufficient high-level healing abilities, this would mean more healers to go around in general. This would make it easier for everyone to form groups and possibly encourage more druids to group rather than solo.<P>I also think more teleport locations is a great idea, as it would make travel easier for everyone, resulting in less downtime for all players (not just us taxis). <P>Thanks for opening up this discussion of the druid class!<P>Ardynn Silentfall<BR>Treehuggin' Druid of Xev<BR>Grey Council<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>KarmaTalica -<P>Along with the vast majority of post-50 druids posting, I don't think any of us wish to replace clerics...or we would have played a cleric, which I do as a second. I get really tired of being called overpowered because I can solo. I don't play this game to solo...if I solo, it's because I can't spend four hours hanging around high level dungeons wearing the "LFG" tag because I'm a relatively casual player who took an ungodly number of hours to get my first character, my druid, to 51. So I check to see if there is ANYTHING I can help my relatively small guild with, not large enough or high enough yet to field Plane or high level dungeon raids in 50+ zones. If I didn't have a 52 bard as my ingame husband, I would never have been invited on a dragon or plane raid, because I can't usually get into groups quickly enough to be able to gain the kind of connections that are crucial for a druid to get into a high level raid. I'm not asking for anything other than usefulness past level 50. Why do I have a new enchanter and a 21 cleric? Because the writing has been on the wall about my post 50 chances for doing anything as a person who can't play 8 hours a day for a while...I've been level 51 since about a month after Kunark opened, if that tells you how often I can play, considering my druid was started three weeks after Everquest was available in stores. While I'm sure there are clerics out there who go anon, for obvious reasons, doing a who all for 49+ on any server will almost always show you that EVERY CLERIC WHO WANTS TO CAN BE IN AN UBER OR PLANE RAID ALL THE TIME. YES, they should be and are necessary, how would that change? Who wants to go lose xp from lack of res with a druid if they could possibly avoid it? I'm not asking to be a godling. Just for some little something that will elevate me above the level of backup evaccer and third-string buffer, because druids are really nonessential in groups past 50. Not just nonessential, either. Virtually useless. And as for your argument about being able to heal where we can get experience, does that mean that druids should be content with complete inability to get any higher level items, including the Velious quest armor that finally looks like it might be worth my rare time? No Sebilis, no Chardok, no Thurgadin or Skyfire dragons or uber mob raids = no high level items or items to complete high level quests. Balance is the issue...so I think I deserve after all the time I've spent, MOST of it grouping in places like Cazic or Guk or Sol, where I was STILL a second choice after a cleric, may I say, to at least be a valuable enough addition to a group post 50 that I might be chosen, not OVER a cleric, but in addition to, rather than being dispensed with entirely unless they need a group evaccer. I won't suggest things, because that has been done beautifully and in great length by many fellow druids. I just wanted to address this assumption that druids are the most powerful class in the game. Versatility does not equal power when almost any group, even at level 30+ now, prefers a pure caster, pure healer, or better buffer than a druid. My cleric has never had trouble finding groups.<P>Just a note to add, that I haven't seen mentioned at all...my bard hubby is by far the best damn soloist I have ever seen. He can solo kite mobs I wouldn't touch, because I haven't the mana to take them. Takes him ages, true...but I could sure not have kited a griffon in NK at level 29, as he did....not while naked &lt;smile&gt; Maybe bards are overpowered &lt;laugh&gt;<P>Ashlian Silkenfyre, 51st Druid, Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
