</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>Back - Get ahold of Lizzy Scale cloak from Cazic.  Or even cloak of the ice bear from Karg / Martar in everfrost.<P>Earings - Check out the sarnak fort in lake of ill omen and try for earings of station, ac 5 / 5 str no drop.<P>Face - Lose the costume jewelry.  Dented mask from perma, and even bloodstained eyepatch (not sure where)<P>Neck - Lose the costume jewelry.  Etched Ivory Charm from Perma - Jailer is nice, or Lava pendant from Solusek A.  Etched ivory charm is a very nice item not many know about, and perma is alwasy empty.<P>Arms: - get the ivy. all rangers should get the ivy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Get some help in North K for grimfeather, people are always killing him and the rune often rots.  Griffons are the placeholder, but be careful, Grim is faster than sow and will kill you easy.  The heart of fire will take a good crew of friends in solusek a.  Head to the reckless efreeti area and look for inferno wizzies.  You'll have to save money for gems, but its not that much.<P>Belt: I don't know stats on strawspun, but the belt from mistmoore (name?) is ac 8, no stats.  I had that until FBSS.  Or get a crew into lower guk and camp the supplier for TBB.  Very nice item.<P>Legs: Take the time and get the ivy.  It is an extremely satisfying quest to achieve.  When rangers get into the 40s they will kill Wiltin when they spot him while hunting seafuries, so ask around if a friendly ranger has a quiver sitting in the bank for no reason.  I know I've given away 2 full quivers myself.<P>Feet: You gots to have magic kick.  Kobald is not magical as I recall.  Get Black iron for the cheap for now, and after doing the above, head to unrest and camp the ghost.  Dwarven is the best you'll see until Thorny.<P>Hands: I'm unfamiliar with iksar gloves, but check out the stats on dark mail from lower guk and plan accordingly.<P>Shouder: I recommend crested spaulders from avenging caitliff in MM.  YOu are a nice level to camp him and the shoulders are Common.<P>I'm not up on midrange stuff in Kunark so there may be better stuff there for your level for some of things things, but Get the Ivy.  Every ranger REJOICED the day that patch gave us a rubicite alternative, its your birthrite to achieve all you can  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>If you were on the Rathe, I would be glad to help you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>good luck,<P>Zaron - Ranger of Silver Blade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hehehe, I guess I can give Dranthor a chance to criteque my possessions. But here is what I have.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Ear: Diamondine Earring<BR>Ear: Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring<BR>Head: Crown of the Frogluk Kings<BR>Face: Forsaken Priah Mask<BR>Neck: Collar of Undead Protection<BR>Shoulders: Tattered Mantle<BR>Arms: Sleeves of the Ancients<BR>Chest: Tree Weave tunic<BR>Wrist: Hero Bracer<BR>Wrist: Bracer of Scavenging<BR>Hands: Tolan's Darkwood Gaunlets<BR>Finger: Gem Encrusted Ring<BR>Finger: Jagged Band<BR>Waist: Flowing Black Silk Sash<BR>Legs: Ivy Etched Leggings<BR>Feet: Ivy Etched Boots<BR>Main Hand: Silver Swiftblade/EBW/SSoY/Ropey Tendril<BR>Off Hand: SSoY/Jagged Chokidia Spine<BR>Range slot: Rain Caller Longbow/Rune Bone Fork<P>---------------------------------------------<BR>Now, on to suggestion for you, Jesseb. Here goes.<P>Ears: Forest loops are very good. If you do get a chance, pick up a Sarnak Earring of Station. But those items are very rare and hard to obtain.<P>Head: Ivy helm is very good for you level. This item will last you for a long while. Later, you can look into getting a Crown of Frogluk Kings, Kedge Helm, Throny Vine Helm, or even a Tolan's Darkwood Helm. But for now, ivy is fine.<P>Neck: Black Pearl Choker (BPC) is lousy. Get ride of it. In fact, check out your AC difference with it on versus nothing on this slot. I believe you will find that your AC is the same if you have your Kitty Feet buff up. As Zaron suggested, look for a Lava Rune Pendet or a etched ivy charm. You may also be able to find a Collar of Undead Protection from the Frogluk Squire in Upper Guk while camping for a Rune Bone Fork.<P>Face: Get rid of it. Same reasons as the BPC. Get a Dented Goblin Mask or go kill a iksar priah in Warsilk Woods or something. A Forsaken Priah Mask (AC 5, Cha -25) drops off of them every time and can just be removed prior to buying/selling things.<P>Wrist: Your wrist are good, although you can easily get a Bracer of Scaveringing in Warsilk Woods while you get the priah mask. It has the same AC, but better stats. A Hero Bracer is also possible if you have a good group to kill the Minotaur Hero. It has the same AC as ivy but better stats.<P>Arms: Quest for Ivy or head to Lower Guk and get some Azure sleeves. Both are better then Barbed if I remember corectly. Lower Guk may be just a bit tough, but you can do a zone group on live side at that level. In a couple level (around 35) you will do fine down there.<P>Hands: Iksar gloves are great gloves. Keep them until you get Throny Vine or Tolans.<P>Rings: Jagged Band is a great ring. Save up some money though and eventually replace these with a Platium Ruby ring.<P>Waist: The straw belt is great. A little heavy but still a great belt. You may decide down the road to replace it with an FBSS for your haste item.<P>Chest: Ivy tunic is good. I do not know if you high enough to go to Burning Woods and kill giants there. When you are, replace the ivy tunic with the Tree Weave tunic (AC 25, Str 10).<P>Back: Get rid of banded, but do not be to upset. I did not get rid of my banded cloak until I was level 43. As Zaron stated, get the Lizardscale Cloak or the Cloak of the Ice Bear. <P>Legs: Long camp I know, but the ivy leggings are good (although recent rumors of brownie scouts in LF may make getting these a bit more dangerous). Another option is the Silver Plated Leggings. You can most likely hunt these in about 5-8 more levels or so.<P>Feet: I do not know the Kobald Hide Boots. Are they as good as the Ivy boots. If not, consider buying some Ronin from a paladin and go to MM and get some granite to get some Ivy boots.<P>Shoulders: Ok, this is an interesting one. Place the Bloodstain Mantle in a backpack for when you need magic resist items. Go get some Crested Spaulders from MM. They are AC 11 Sta 6 compaired to the BSM's AC 5. Big difference in AC.<P>Weapons: Your weapons are fine at that level. In fact, the SSoY will not proc for you for another 6 levels for so. Trueshot is fine, but you may want to get a Runed Bone Fork for its magic resistance. It is another item that you can swap in when resisting magic is more important then bow damage.<P>As for weapon skills, Tsk Tsk Tsk. You should attempt to keep up all of your skills as much as possible. There are some high level weapons that rangers can use that are very nice. Woodsman staff will beat out most DW combinations. It is a 2HB weapon. Nature's Wrath, Silver Swiftblade, and Swarmcaller are all 2handed weapons that are very nice then many 1handed weapons. Lupine Dagger is a nice piercer. Jade Mace (9/18) is a 1handed blunt weapon that is consided one of the best weapons. There are many fine options available in all catagories in the upper levels for rangers. It would be very said if you would not be able to use one that you are lucky enough to come across just because you never trained in them at lower levels.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers, Guild Master</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gloves:<BR>Iksar (and Dark Mail gaunlets) are better then Ivy gaunlets, IMO. So those are fine.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Belts:<BR>Straw Spun Belt is good if you do not have a haste item. TBB is better but is extremely difficult to obtain. So having the SSP, you can currently focus on other items to replace. <P>Boots:<BR>If the Kolbald boots are AC 5, you may want to look into getting the Dwarven Work Boots (AC 8, Str 3, Dex 5) or the Ivy Boots (AC 10, Sta 5). <P>The Ivy boots require a piece of Ronin plus some other items. In order to get Ronin, you have to get Fairy Dust from killing fairies in LF. This is not necessarily a wise thing to do if you plan to adventially complete your Rain Caller Longbow quest. That was why I bought my piece of Ronin from a paladin who has to collect it for most of their armor. It cost me 1k pp, so you may have to save up for it. But the 5 raw AC increase is well worth the cost of the item. <P>Or you can go camp the ghost in Unrest basement for the Dwarven Workboots. At level 31, this area is excelent XP for a good group. If you have experience with Harmony, this area become very easy for you to safely pull mobs for a group. My guild and I had a lot of fun camping this area from levels 31-38. These boots cost about 1-1.5k pp.<P>Range Slot:<BR>The Rune Bone Fork is a piercing weapon with the stats of Dmg 5, Delay 29, Fire 10, Cold 10, Magic 10. It is not a great weapon for the level you can get it and most people do not use it as one. It is desired mainly for the Fire, Cold, and Magic resists and the fact that it can go in the range slot. It is the rare drop off the Froglok Squire in Upper Guk. He spawn very close to the zone in point of Guk so the camp is extremely easy. He is approximately a level 23 mob. His common drop is the Collar of Undead Protection (AC 5, Poison 7, Disease 7). He was green to me at level 35 and I soloed him then for my fork. The maps at Eqlizer show where the Squire spawns in Upper Guk.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>In order to get the Ronium you need the following:<P>1. (1)Sands of Ro. Come off of Sand Giants.<P>2. (1)MM Granite. Comes off Flouting Gargoyles only.<P>3. (1) Soil of Underfoot. To get this you must acquire (4) Fairy Dusts not Pixie Dust and turn them into the Head Cleric Priestest in Kaladim. In order to get the small quest from the Priestest your faction has to be high amiable/kindly. 1 way to get it up there if your is not, you must go to the Paladin Guild right behind the Cleric Guild and give one of the guys in there around 300 bone chips. I forget his name but just hail everyone. Once your faction is high enough just turn in the 4 Fairy Dusts to get Soil of Underfoot.<P>4. (1)Melatite. From the Clockworks in Sol A. I forget which model, doh.<P>5. Purchase (2) Enchanted Bars of platinum. Cost around 120pp for each. If ya buy the bars they cost about 100pp or so depending on ur charisma. Find an Enchanter friend lvl 34 or higher and they can do their stuff.<P>6. Combine (2)Enchant Bars, (1)Melatite, (1)MM Granite, (1)Sand of Ro and (1)Soil of Underfoot in the cauldron. Which Cauldron hehe, go to Temple of Solusek Ro. Anyways get the cauldron and combine all of these and you will get (1)Ronium.

</FONT><HR>A Pumice Stone was a item that you could use to debuff a mob. I believe it used the spell Nullify Magic which would strip 4 buffs off the target. It was purchased at any NPC merchant that sold potions. It looked like a Light Stone. Recently, they nerfed the Pumice Stones into what they called a Pumice Crystal, I believe. The difference between the two is the casting time. I believe the Stones were instanous cast time while the crystals have some casting on them. I am unfortunately not completely versed on the details of the item, old and new, to really give you a lot of details other then the fact it was bought from merchants and used to debuff targets.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Rangers are often considered hunters, and pullers, but if the pull goes bad your might as well curl up and die. Monks are far better pullers than rangers. Monks tank better, Monks fight harder. (Consider all the other classes, and you'll probably find a better class than rangers, and one that suites your play style).<P>Rangers still need considerably work to make them good, and seeing the responce from Paladins/SK's about the small upgrade rangers recieved recently, its plainly obvious that Rangers are finished now.<P>Tanthalar.<BR>Warder of Mithanial Marr (Considering retirement)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Tanthalar,<P>While I respect much of your work that I have seen at the Ranger Glade and other places, I have to say that I disagree with you here. Plus, I feel that your recent post is not in the nature of what was being asked in this thread. I feel that some recent events, including a couple other post on this board, may be shading your comments here. I ask you to reconsider you thoughts posted here before you detour young rangers from a path that they present enjoy. This is a game, it should be enjoyed. If they are enjoying it, we should not detour then from that enjoyment.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000236&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000236&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
