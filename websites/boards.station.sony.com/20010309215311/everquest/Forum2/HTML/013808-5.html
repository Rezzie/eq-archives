</FONT><HR>With all due respect Abashi, you're either changed your view 180 degrees on the value of player opinion on these boards, or you're playing the political middle road.<P>You said this today, "The sheer involvement and passion on this board is a testement to the fact that we do listen to the players."  <P>I agree with the involvement and passion expressed on this board, and it is indicative of the types of gamers that cruise this board.  A positive thing to be sure.<P>Your old view of this board was, and I'll parapharase, "Most of the poster's here are unhappy players, that find fault in the game, and in no way are their opinion are a majority view.  The majority are not here posting, they are playing everquest.  That's the nature of public boards"<P>Well, if you've changed your opinion of the posters here, I'm glad for it.  We do in fact make up a passionate cross section of the player base.  A perfect sampling for opionion of the playing environment and future design decisions.  It would be crazy to ignore the board.  <P>Yes, I'm glad you've changed your"public" view of this board now.  This is good.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Of course you don't agree with Lum's "rant".  It says VI should fire you! I'd disagree with it too in your position!<P>But I think it holds a lot of truth that you need to examine very very closely for yourself. I'm sure you're making a killing on money and on stock options and what have you - but really, if people are as upset with you as Lum leads to believe (and I believe for that matter) then you have to consider what it is you're doing to piss them off.<P>I think your largest consideration should be to TALK to us again.  Not just post once on a single thread, but continue the discussion as much as possible.  Most people here, I'd venture, are here to LISTEN to what you have to say officially and have a chance to debate with you on it.  When you guys make a decision, sometimes it's just the WRONG one and we want a chance to let you know why. Having you come in and give us some rhetoric and the whole "We're only human" speech is tiresome and frustrating. Frankly, you're pissing us off!<P>Evaluate why you're here again and evaluate what good you've done the game in the past month or two.  Think about it.  Look at the number of questions on problems in the game. Look how damn long it took you guys to get your head out of the sand to fix rangers.  SIX months!  It wasn't until a huge massive, overly bloated, emotionally charged, ranger retirement threat that you decided act to save your bottom line.  Oh, I'm sure you'd LOVE to tell us that it's all just a coincidence that the very day Sunmoon threatened to leave, you "fix" rangers.<P>Com'on. How transparent is that? How can you tell us that you LISTEN to us when the Ranger issues had been brought up MONTHS before. You've even responded officially to say that they were "A-OK" and that nothing was going to be done about them. And now this?  Obviously you're protecting your pocket book and your public image as much as you can. That is a noble thing, except you could have done this A LONG TIME AGO and made everyone VERY happy with you. Instead, you drag out a huge battle and helped create this gigantic issue that you end up having to give in on, anyway!<P>Abashi, I'm sure you're a nice guy. I'm sure you mean well. Everyone in their job wants to do a good one. I know this.  But you are NOT doing a good job in relating to us. Yes, you are the RELATIONS person, so RELATE to us.  Don't go into a thread just to pick apart someone's argument. Don't go into a thread assuming stupid things (like Sit-Med at level 32.. Even I knew it was level 35 and I'm a BARD).  Learn about the game and give yourself credibility by actually READING the hot issues.  Too often your policy of "ignoring the hot issues" flies right back in your face and this Ranger one is proof of that.<P>Aradune,<P>If people don't flame you here, they will flame you on message boards you don't own.  If you close this message board down, all you're doing is tell your customers, good/bad/ugly that you Don't Care.  You do not want to do that.  Sure, the flames suck - but pause for a moment. Sometimes, no matter how awful and emotional they are - they have a point. <P>Additionally... I have a full time job. Occasionally during breaks, I have time to write messages and read posts. Even I get a chance to read some very good posts that are more often than not - ignored by Abashi.  Basically, the idea that "We try to read all the good ones" is false. If you are trying - try harder. <P>Some people poor a lot of energy and thought into their message threads. To have them completely ignored, or answered in a flippant manner that Abashi has become acustomed to is DISHEARTENING. A lot of these new posters come in with a lot of enthusiasm, hoping thier message will somehow be heard and will make a difference.<P>Now, you and I both know this isn't the case. If you listened to every post, we'd have Flying Purple Elephant Necros in Full Plate.  So yah, there are some you just don't need to listen to. But there are others, which demand a response because of the sheer nature of the topic and the intensity at which people are debating them.  They need someone official to come in and DEBATE WITH THEM. Not announce some decree from the gods on high. BUT TO DEBATE the Whys, the Hows, the reasoning, the rationale. What is so secret about your rationale that you can't share with the people who have spent MONEY and TIME and ENERGY on your game?  They're the ones making it a success, TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.<P>They want to know what you're thinking. Not what you want to do, but rather WHY you're doing it.  More often than not, the "why" is transparent - MONEY.  But you try to hide it behind this facade of noble gamer ideal (whatever that may be) and it just pisses people off because you're trying to pull a fast one by them. We know why you're here - to make oodles of money and retire before your 40.  Fine. That's great. But if you're doing something to this game FOR THAT REASON, let us know. Then we can truthfully evaluate whether or not we like your company. We'll like your company LESS if you LIE about wanting to make money with this latest "change" or "policy".  At least we'll respect you for honesty if you just come out and say it.<P>Pentar Steelstring<BR>Apotheosis<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Aspell,<P>  The maxim that "The Customer is Always Right" has gone out the window in the general business community and especially with businesses deaing with large numbers of people. (This is a general statement not specifically about Verant). With client databases and the information that they track, companies are taking a closer look at their customers. They're finding that not everyone is worth keeping. Some people are just "too expensive" or "not profitable" enough to keep, so corps are looking at "firing" customers, i.e. getting them to go away somehow -- perhaps to a competitor. Consider the rule of thumb about how 10% of the people are 90% of the work (feel free to substitute your own numbers - they're just made up anyway - I think the point is made). Businesses are now cluing in to this fact and they've got the tracking info on customer purchases, complaints, etc. to figure out who is profitable to sell to and who isn't. <P>  Now, as for Verant, I don't think they've necessarily gone draconian on this, but I do think that they've been straightforward about their philosophy: people will be warned, suspended or banned based on their behaviour's impact on the game. If "the customer is always right" there wouldn't be any bans for bug exploits, selling accounts or inappropriate posts.<P>  New world order time (sounds vaguely X-Files conspiracy put that way) our actions are far easier to track these days and life is changing. We all pay ~$10US/month. Consider how much it costs to handle problems and it doesn't take much for someone requiring personalized attention to quickly eat up a year or two's worth of dues, i.e. to become unprofitable to do business with. Everyone here can draw their own interpretation of the implications of that situation -- I chalk it up to the reality of living in a free market economy. <P>  Instead of "The Customer is Always Right" I think the reality is that most customers are reasonable and hassle-free, a minority are wrong, and a subset of the "wrong people" are actually right and mislabeled. At $10US per person per month, figure out how much a _for profit_ business is able and willing to do to figure out which of the latter two categories an individual person belongs. <P>To The Question of "Is My Post Going to Get Me Banned?"<P>  Place yourself on the other side of the virtual customer service counter and consider: if Person A walks up threatening to have you fired, calling you an incompetent &lt;insert adjectives and nouns&gt;, etc. etc. while Person B calmly and clearly articulates a problem and solution, who would you be predisposed to believe? Another aspect is how quickly (and therefore cheaply) can each of these concerns be handled?<P>  I guess what I don't understand is how some posts have been made in this thread that people (and do I think they are sincere) don't understand how to evaluate whether a post would be inappropriately offensive or derogatory. First off, you're posting to other people you don't know and (with I'm sure a few exceptions) Abashi/Gordon Wrynn is one of them. Show people on these forums the same civility you would show someone you met at work. Look at your post and (Golden Rule Time) really consider if what you wrote would be considered offensive if it was directed at yourself. If you want an acid test, consider whether you'd say what you type to Abashi's face if your Grandmother was standing next to you.

</FONT><HR>I believe part of the reason why people feel upset with the communication is due to the fact that Verant has stated and acted like they are engaging their customers in a dialog, which sometimes is quite true, but sometimes it simply is not.  As has been mentioned, part of the resentment comes from the feeling that Verant's reasons for doing certain things (or not doing) do not make sense, and when we attempt to engage Verant in a dialog to explain why, using the many THOUSANDS of combined hours of playtime we have, out arguments and reasoning are ignored.  Sometimes the responses we get are dismissive, sometimes they are rude, sometimes they miss the point, but most often they just aren't there.<P>As was pointed out in another thread (thanks dwchu) the approach Verant has taken on this is not standard PR. They have made an effort to be more engaged with their customers, but it does not seem that they have invested enough into the process to make it really work. Maybe this means attempting to have this kind of dialog is not a good idea when dealing with such a large customer base, maybe it means the customer relations budget needs to be increased. I can't say that I have the answer to that.  I can say that way things are now does not seem to improve your image as much as you might think. I know that I have seen a variety of issues that I felt very strongly were not properly addressed by Verant.<P>It some areas the level of communication has improved recently - the new employees that are part of the dialog, the weekly discussions; these are both steps in the right direction. The next step would be to make sure that communication coming from Verant looses the dismissive, condescending, arrogant tone that it has sometimes taken on. I am sorry to say that I do blame Gordon for this aspect of things. I have seen to many posts that I have to describe as 'clever' - which divert people from the issue, confuse it, or attempt to make it go away with casual threats. I realize that this may only be my perception - but Verant must realize that perception can carry a lot of weight. The 'blunt' style of communication still needs to be handled with some care if you do not want to ostracize a good sized segment of your customers, which is something that, if you are reading carefully, you should see you have already done.<P>-tera<P><BR>(please note - I am NOT saying that this represents the entire customer base, just that the number of people on these boards that feel this way can be taken as an indication of a larger sentiment. The majority of us do not post simply because we are angry about some petty little thing, we post because we care about the game and want to make it better.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok. For nearly two straight hours I've been reading through various Abashi-bashing posts on this board as well as LUM's and also read some content (a lot) in his defense. I have come to the conclusion that Abashi a: - cares about his job. b: - cares about the customers but c: - does not have the proper perspective to perform his job description as it was given to us, "the middle man, the voice of the people, and the voice of Verant". He improvises instead and his 'encyclopidic' knowledge of EverQuest often makes him out to be 'a liar' when he really IS NOT.  The fact is, it doesn't matter how many books you read on the way things were DESIGNED to work, if you dont play that character 20 hours a week for a year like everybody else, then you DO NOT know what they know, and thusly cannot be a good voice for the customer base of EverQuest, because HUMAN COMMUNICATION (text, vocal, whatever) is NOT intricate enough to do anything more than start arguements when it comes to something more complex than "please pass me the mayonaise".  What Verant NEEDS to do is hire a PLAYER. A person who, for 16 hours a day, everyday, plays EverQuest (and dont pretend you couldn't find someone to do it in a heartbeat for cheap). This person should have no special knowledge other than reading webpages like the majority of us. This person needs to play ALL the classes and keep detailed logs on events that transpire. This person needs to play the game fully, which means roleplaying, joining guilds, interacting with Guides/GM's when there is a problem. THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. Then *THAT* person needs to be the person in here responding to posts that REAL PLAYERS have about the game. That person needs to be the one going to Verant explaining HOW he/she sees things and HOW he/she feels about things, then Verant will be IN TOUCH with the customer base and be able to make their decisions about things based on significant data and how it affects their clients rather than borg like statistics which insist things must be going right simply because they are getting richer everyday.<P>"You will be assimilated, resistance is futile"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The customer is not always right.<P>The customer is always THE CUSTOMER.<P>That means you treat him with respect, even while you're ushering a customer you no longer want out the door.<P>Why?  Because when I see you: swearing at a customer, insulting a customer, being rude, condescending, or smarmy to a customer, as a customer myself, I relate not with you, but with that other customer.  It reflects negatively on YOU, no matter what that other customer did to earn your wrath.  And beyond all that, it's the mark of professionalism.  <P>EQ is a product.  Verant is a company.  Here's a clue, Brad, Smed, Gordon: you're not producing some amateur MUD out of Smed's basement, you're producing a multi-million dollar game, and that being the case, your treatment of your customers up until now is NOT acceptable.  It's NOT satisfactory.  And you can make up whatever nonsense excuses for that you want ("oh, we're just trying to be honest with our customers") but it doesn't change this simple set of facts.  And sooner or later, your level of sheer contempt for the people writing your cheques is going to override the enjoyability level of your game.  And then, like UO, your game will slowly start to die.<P>And the worst part is, you'll probably blame it on dated technology rather than your own simply atrocious attitudes toward your customers.

</FONT><HR>I'm just so sick and tired of all the baseless claims and meritless allegations against Verant.  I'd love to go through and point out all of the errors and illogical claims strewn throughout all these posts since Brad's comments, but it'd take me an hour to go through all the misinformation and misunderstandings.<P>Snowman:  I've read Lum.  His rants are occasionally entertaining, although always pure garbage.  That doesn't take away from his motivation from making his site controversial.  After his most recent attacks on Verant, I'd be surprised if Brad & Co. gave him any more publicity.  He had a following so there was a reason to allow him publicity.  Now he's just being spiteful and vindictive, and that's at an end.<P>Meorah:  "If people think there's a problem with the way Internet CS is being handled, then there is."  Not necessarily.  I don't think there's a problem, so does that mean there isn't?  The reasoning just doesn't hold true.  There will always be people that think there is a problem because Verant isn't catering to their every whim.  As you can see from a bunch of these posts, people still claim Verant doesn't "listen" to them, just because they haven't conceded every point ever raised by a poster on this board.<P>More than one mouthpiece simply opens things up to more controversy.  If there is any "perceived" contradiction between one of them, then everyone will jump all over them.  More "abashi's" won't help.<P>Letholas:  They understand the difference between civil and antagonistic.  That's not the problem.  Most of the posters here don't understand the difference between civilly posting a complaint and simply ranting/venting.  Sure, Gordon overreacted because he's been under such unrelenting and baseless attack lately.  Except for that one example, I'm not aware of another error like that on their part.  Yet there are hundreds of posts on this board a day, and several dozen of them are inflammatory and ridiculous.<P>Philth:  Nope.  Most players don't think it's gone downhill since Gordon came around.  Would you rather that all the positive changes that have taken place be eliminated?<P><BR>I'm done.

</FONT><HR>What can I say.<P>I fully Endorse Lum's Arguments.<P>Well before this fiasco I QUIT Everquest.  Why? Because of my total disappointment in the administration of the game.<P>I find Gordon Wrinn's performace totally sub-standard, and I find it the fault of You, Brad and Smedly for encouraging it and promoting it.<P>I can understand how you value frankness, but frankness is not what you are getting from Gordon.  I found his posts insulting,  condecending, threatening, and often innacurrate or poorly researched.  <P>I am stating my opinion, but if you look at other boards, where posters are not living in fear of having their accounts taken away for disagreeing with you, you will find a similar sentiment from a  significant portion of other people.<P>I found the game was rather enjoyable.  I could not support a corporate culture thats actions show such a lack of respect for its patrons.<P>I'm sorry if this offends you Brad, but you really need a dose of reality.  You created a game that is very popular.  Kudos.  You and yours however have no clue how to run it though - IMHO.  Since my opinion is what guides my checkbook I voted and quit. <P>Speaking of quitting, I got my final confirmation of how little regard your company has for its customers at that exact same time.<P>Your form for quitting HAS NO PLACE TO SAY WHY YOU ARE CANCELLING YOUR SERVICE. (please forgive my caps.) This is just about the most important bit of information you will ever get from any customer, and it is not even being gathered.  <P>Over and over we have heard about the flaunted 70%  retention rating.  Don't you realize that is a 30% loss rating?  At least 30% of you past customer base has been so dissatisfied with your product that they quit purchasing use of your service... and because you have no place to collect the information you have no idea (that can be backed by evidence) why.<P>As you have had at least 84 Thousand, 84000 disatified customers leaving your game, (280k * .30 = 84000 disasisfied customers = $840k lost income monthly) maybe, instead of patting yourself on your back and concocting self-afirming  notions of why this is, you should listen when they tell you.<P>While their may be as many reasons for quitting as there are those who go (84k+), my reason was your companys attitudes as expressed by Gordon Wrinn and the lack of proffesionalism his continued employment in his current role reflects back on his employers.<P>Would I come back to Everquest if Gordon resigned or was appointed to a different position?  No.  I probably won't ever buy another product created by  Verant as long as the current management is in place, but I might stop advising others not purchase your products.<P>Gordon may be giving your company a bad name, or maybe your company is rotten all the way through, but while I see his continued employment in his current role I can have any hope that your behavior will improve.<P>So, as a non-player why the heck do I feel compelled to tell you this? For the following reasons.<P>1. I would hate to see any other new company in ths industry make the same mistakes.<P>2. While I suspect the current corporate culture being cultivated at Verant is pernicious, I do believe you started out with some good if over idealisic goals and would love to be proven wrong by future changes mitigating the damage that has already been done.<P>3. You said you value frankness. So I wanted to tell you, Frankly, how I feel.<P>4. To speak what I heard many times in game and on  other boards - since now in the current witch-hunt environment many fear to speak up lest the wrath of Wrinn fall upon them and they lose their accounts. I am no longer your customer so have nothing to fear. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I like Lum's suggestion.<P>Thoughts about a reorg of the position:<P>People who need to be at the front of the company, who need to be known and speak *with* the players:<P>1) Company spokesman. This guy announces actions such as new releases, patches, changes. He can answer the questions about how the changes are intended to work. He understands the game. He understands the company's objectives.<P>2) Player ombudsman. This person collects feedback, considers it, and presents it to the development team where warranted. This person engages in discussions with players about what benefits the game and what doesn't. He plays the game anonymously, and has no in-game powers. He has no authority to change the game, but can eloquently present design issues.<P>3) Product support lead. This is the ultimate person to whom to address all customer support issues. The uber-GM, who enforces the rules and makes sure the game is working as intended. Not a game designer, although he may present game design issues to the development team, as they affect customer satisfaction. <P>Kind of like: Mayor, City Council, and Chief of Police/Superintendent.

</FONT><HR>You know I keep reading posts about how great Verant is for even having a board for folks to post on. Er, people, this ISN'T unique, and it sure as heck isn't worthy of any awards to Verant!<P>A decade ago I was playing Air Warrior, one of the first online games of any size. Kesmai had an entire section of the GEnie BBS's dedicated to their customers...Rant sections, story areas, in-game issues, etc etc. And every day they read it and responded, from the top dog on down. <P>And surprise, I've seen countless companies do the exact same thing since then! Boards like this are hardly unique, contrary to what Verant would like you to believe. Verant is FAR from special in this case. Dozens of companies before them have provided similar venues for their customers, and it's done because the company does benefit from it. <P>The fact that Brad has considered canning this place speaks volumes for the underlying problems. It isn't the customers fault, or rogue posters, or the fact that Verant is somehow providing anything unique in this board...they're not, far from it. It's all been done 100 times before. So if there's a perceived need to can these boards, that need is solely the result of actions taken and improper polices made within Verant. There's no two ways about it.<P>But lets just be clear here, providing a message boards is nothing special. It does benefit Verant and it does benefit the customer. Provided, of course, it's properly run in the first place. You draw your own conclusions insofar as the latter is concerned.<P>Sophist  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad-<P>I doubt you're still reading this thread, but in case you are...<P>My observation about Abashi is that he is trying very hard to do a job that I think most people realize is too big for him to keep up with. This leads to a behavior of his that is my main objection to the way this boards is handled. Like a trial judge with an overloaded document, he seems to approach even the most valid and carefully thought out issues with an eye toward finding some technicality, no matter how minor, to which he can respond and claim to have dealt with the issue. I think this behavior is more unconscious than intentional, and is likely the result of his genuine desire to do a good job and respond to as many concerns as possible, but it clearly demonstrates, to me anyway, that he is spread too thin to be effective any longer.<P>To quote a post I made on another board after contemplating the situation with Abashi:<P>I don't think it's fair to criticize without advancing a solution, so here's mine. Abashi's job needs to be handled by a staff of people, say 10 or so to begin with, who are responsible for accounting for each and every thread on Whineplay. New threads would accumulate in a shared queue from which the mini-Abashis would take ownership of them on a first-come, first-served basis, then categorize them. Some threads are incoherent, whiny, or offensive, and should be categorized under "No Response". Some have already been answered and could be categorized under "FAQ", perhaps resulting in an auto-reply to the thread indicating that the answer can be found by reviewing the FAQ. The rest would comprise the "Response Required" threads. It would be the responsibility of these individuals to communicate with the appropriate parties, to test the issue themselves when possible, to formulate a truly responsive reply taking into account both the player's perspective and Verant's original intention or worldview related to the matter at hand, and finally to update the FAQ with their conclusions to allow future inquiries along the same lines to be referred there.<P>Hopefully food for thought. I realize this would be a big investment, but my guess is that these people could be rolled into a similar role with your next project and result in a vastly better perception of support from the word go.<P>Thanks for having these boards- despite these suggestions, I do appreciate you having them at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Negative, pointless, flaming drives away players with constructive criticism (negative and positive) - of that I am certain."<P> Frankly Aradune, as far as open flaming with insulting drivel is concerned, I see more directed at other players (which you guys at VI seem to wink at with a shrug) than I do at VI employees.   BUT... someone that, without profanity or insult states something that Abashi is tired of seeing, he has a warning stamped on his account.  Yeah, that is definitely positive there. <P> No, it isn't about regulating signal to noise, its about regulating and filtering posts so that only the insipid "yay Verant" and "You other players that complain suck" remain.  You aren't filtering flames, the example shows that you are filtering people that express opinions you are "tired of seeing."  <P> If it were about flames and profanity, the players that, on a daily basis, trash other posters here would have warnings slapped on their accounts as well, and that just isn't happening; so, pull the other one, please. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Anathir, I'm avoiding the temptation to say what I think of your abilities to reason in English.  I don't want it mistaken for a personal flame, because it's not.  You're hardly alone in being like this.  You have lots of company.<P>There was nothing out of context about Lum's  excerpted quotes.  You're free to reread them on Lum's own site, where the post they're from is reproduced intact and complete.  Your gratuitous legal opinions may sound good to you, but they don't work in the real world.  If his leaps of reason are too difficult for you to follow, whose problem is that?  I've never had trouble following them.  If you wish to dismiss the notion that someone in a store ever talked someone else out of buying EQ, and that Lum actually witnessed this, go ahead and dismiss it.  Unless you're doing police work or archeology, I'd say the mere fact that he "testified" to it on his web site is sufficient grounds for credibility.  I've seen it happen, myself.  Why should I think he made it up?<P>I'm glad to see you're trying to contribute some rational analysis, but I think your analysis needs a lot of revision.<P>As for Lum saying Abashi needs a different job...I think he's perfectly entitled to share his opinions on his web site.  As people in Gameplay often point out to each other about EQ, "if you don't enjoy it or have fun at it, go somewhere else."<P>As for whether Abashi should stay in his current  position...I think he'd be much happier in a more design-oriented position within the company.  He's been preparing to move up for a long time; give him a promotion.  I also think that relations between the EQ community and Verant--particularly Abashi--are pretty strained right now.  A move might be salutary for all concerned.<P>-talan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Gordon spends about 3/4 of his time trying to make bad things out to be good things.<P>I don't think you read his messages from the point of view of a player.

Don't just take my word for it, go to one of these RL gatherings, take people into a corner, and quietly ask them how they perceive his responses to player concerns.<P>There's some saying about Caesar's wife, that she must be above even the *suspicion* of wrongdoing, and that's why she ceased to be Caesar's wife.  Her actual intents were irrelevent, it was (in modern terms) the bad vibes she gave off that got her terminated.<P>The problem here is, regardless of intent, Gordon *appears* to be spiteful, snotty, holier-than-thou, and *appears* to hold the player base in very, very low regard.<P>It just doesn't sit well to have things seem that way.<P>ag<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My opinion on EQ.<P>It's a business:<P>VI is a business, I owned an ISP and I hated chronic whining users just as much as VI does.  At the ISP I threw them off my system because they were trouble makers and generally wasted more of my time because they'd hose their system every 2 days and we'd have to spend 3 hours a day listening to them complain that they didn't like something while we were trying to help them.  After a point in time I asked them to find another ISP and on several occassions did more than ask them to leave.  This was &lt; 1% of the subscriber population and in any business you need to deal with it.  If I was at VI and someone started spamming me every other day with "you suck" I'd refund your $10 and tell you to buzz off.  (nerfed for the younger viewers)<P>The ISP I owned was the most successful in the area and because nobody could compete with me a national ISP decided to give me double what it was worth to get me out.  I know how to run a business, I owned 4 and sold 2.  Making good decisions based on the good of the whole user population is what makes a good business, not making a rash decision based on the level of crying done in the forum about a particular topic.<P>Gameplay:<P>It's a game, same as PacMan or Starcraft.  If you play more than you do any other activity then you need to reflect on your life.  I play EQ daily but I also have a job and a family, some people like gardening for fun, I mez monsters.  Don't make this game your life, it's just a game.<P>Like life, there are parts of EQ that are less than great.<P>Like life, there are things that are unfair.  <P>Like life, there are classes (ie careers in life) I would never be.  (I had a Wiz ask me last night why I would ever plan an Enchanter because it looked "boring", I just look at him with amazement and pity but I kept my comments to myself trying to be nice.  If you gave me an oracle robe at lvl 1 on a brand new server I still wouldn't play a Wizard. My .02)  <P>Like life, dying sucks, deal with it.  If I couldn't die I wouldn't play the game.  This is what separates newbies from the smart people and adds excitement to the game.  <P>I hate getting nerfed, 3 of my favorite characters were necros a year ago and then VI started making things "better" because other people complained that we were too powerful.  I'll probably never play a necro again.<P>You're not forced to play:<P>It is your choice if you want to play.  VI will listen to your comments but after spending a good amount of time this morning trying to weed through the "you suck" messages I just chuckled as streams of people whine while they're licking their envelope (metaphorically speaking) to send their money to Verant.  I thought I had a good racket when I owned ISP.<P>Does Verant realize that people are mad at them?  Probably.  What can VI do to help it, the same thing I did at the ISP.  Get 5 more people to help Abashi do his job.  Respond honestly to people's posts, don't sugar coat it and explain in minor detail your response.  If someone posts "My Bard Sucks" don't ignore it, post a message from VI that says, "We think your bard is fine so we're not going to do anything about it.  Have a nice day."  At least people will get a response, even if they don't like it.  If someone intelligent posts "My Bard Sucks because of these 512 reasons" then read it and post, "We think that your bard is fine for right now but we appreciate the detail you went into and we will talk about it at our Bard strategy meetings."<P>Economy, or lack of:<P>The economy system needs major consideration.  There is no player run economy besides the /auction type random shouting.  This is not economy.  An Economy is supposed to run itself, even if you're logged off.  I'm not talking about a UO type economy where there are houses popping up all over the place, which is irritating and stupid but that's not EQ so I won't ramble on about UO.  I used to play a MUD called Moral Decay where we had a simple economic system that went like this.  A player would kill a monster and pick up the corpse.  They would sell the corpse to a guild owned corpse processor for cash (the cash had to be supplied by the guild so it was important that people actually logged on to do guild business).  The corpse processor would then sell processed corpses to a guild owned distiller.  The distiller would then make barrels of alcohol of different strengths and sell them to guild run bars.  The bars would then sell different strength drinks (basically healing potions) to the players. <P>This is a perfect example of a player run economy that had nothing to do with the GMs.  Prices were set independently based on competition and capitalism was encouraged.  With the money the guilds made they could purchase items for their guild, like a guild teleporter.  I knew people who would log on for hours and never fight a single monster.  They would just build their guild standing in the economy and because of the integration of the economy with the fighting system (via the sale of healing potions) the players depended on this guild businesses to function in order for the game to be more playable.  I can go into more detail if anyone cares but my point is that it is possible to integrate a real working economy into a game like EQ.  <P>Balance:<P>I believe that trying to balance the game always ends up in nerfing and that trying to make each class equal is detrimental to the game.  Classes are supposed to excel in their own way.  Complaining because a class can kill a monster solo when you can't is dumb because odds are that other class that solod the mob can't heal themselves.  It's a group game.  My latest character is an enchanter and that class is not a soloing character.  I've read time after time how the mightly enchanters charm one mob and and kill another and then kill the charmed mob all nice and solo.  What that person forgot to tell you was the 4 times they died that night because the charm wore off and both of them turned you into a pile of goo.  That or they fight 3' from the zone point.  Either way Verant don't "fix" the enchanter because our DD spells are bad or because we can't heal.  That's what other classes are for.<P>Overall:<P>I started playing this game pretty much since the first day it was released in the stores.  I quit back in April for a few months because a few new games came out and I grew bored of EQ.  I came back again a few weeks ago because there is nothing out there that is currently better than EQ.  EQ will be obsolete eventually but for now it is the best game out there.  <P>-Bilan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think the obvious flaw with this issue is that Abashi more often than not posts the answer to be a definate "no" stating that Verant knows more about the issue or it is working as intended or whatnot, then later, VI will do a complete 180 on the issue.<P>This leads to bad sentements on the side of players. We feel as if we are being ignored, and only through constant pleading can we get anything across. The concept that the players do not know as much about the game as VI. In fact I would say that players as a whole know much more about the game than Verant. Not individual players, but each player specializing in certain things taken with many many players means that several people out there know a lot about each subject. VI doesn't seem to acknowlege this.<P>I could name several instances but I won't. We don't need to rehash specifics.<P>And this topic is not about specifics. It is not about who gets what or how something works, and playrs being upset. It is how CS handles these issues, to the detrement of players or not. We want reasons, explainations, not just because we said so responses, that seem so common. We want to be trusted, respected, acknowleged. That is all. This is not about anything but that.<P>I don't want Abashi fired. I think he needs to rethink his strategy, and to be MUCH MUCH better informed about the game (or do more reasearch before posting), but I believe in second and third chances. People have said that he might be a great guy in rl. Well, I can say that I don't care what he's like in rl.

</FONT><HR>Pentar2:  Boy did you misread my statements.  I stated my opinion that the claims of Meo and Philth were inaccurate.  Meo's generalization that because some people think there is a problem means that there is one, was in error.  Philth's claim that EVERYONE thinks the game has gone downhill since Abashi came around was also in error.  My experience is that most people think the game has improved.  Big difference from what you claimed I said.  <P>I'm hardly Rah Rah Verant (I guess this is the new version of VAK, huh?).  I criticize their actions all the time.  As I've stated, their GM events suck, the Tweety thing was very poorly handled, and the time its taken to upgrade Rangers was unacceptable (among others).  Again, there is a difference between critiquing a posters anti-Verant rant and actually defending Verant.  Someone who is opposed to the death penalty, is not in favor of crime.  Your leap of logic is faulty.<P>I hate being pigeon-holed, for it detracts from the content of an argument.  It's like being labeled a conservative or a liberal.  Everyone automatically think they know your position on one issue, simply because they know it on another.  That is a mistake.  I am neither a VAK nor a Whiner.  I take each issue as it comes.  There are certain methods of complaining that I take issue with, and go after.  I do not have a conditioned response to always defend Verant.  I rarely heep scorn, but I don't always defend.<P>Leth:  I think the problem is in your definitions.  "Civil" and "antagonistic" are not mutually exclusive.  As seen above, Pentar2 and I are antagonistic, but civil.  The mistake that Abashi made was in overreacting when he believed someone inferred he played with GM hacks.  There was no confusion between your two terms.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
