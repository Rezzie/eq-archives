</FONT><HR>This past weekend i decided to pull yet another Faydedar camp. When the servers came up Friday morning, i logged in at the firepots in Timerous Deep and sat there for 37 1/2 hours straight waiting for him. He finally decided to show. We had a ranger flawlessly kiting him in the area of the firepots as to avoid the Iksar Master from killing Fay. A great friend brought the whole Plane of Growth raid he was leading to Timerous to kill him. Numerous individuals also came to lend a hand. While preparing for the kill, the zone crashes and Faydedar poofs. Imagine my disappointment, as this has been the second time i have waiting for him for 36+ hours straight only to have him disappear both times. I am ashamed to say, but i did shed a tear or two. <P>I petitioned to speak with a guide or GM. Everyone there waited until i heard from a GM, we were hoping for a respawn. I was told it was against policy to respawn a mob after a zone crash. I asked that my petition be escalated, and when finally answered was told the same thing. Yes, this was disappointing news in itself. But my great disappointment was the fact that BOTH my first petition and the escalated petition were removed from the que without having been acknowledged. I had to repetition both times before i was acknowledged. <P>It is quite sad when someone who has never caused any trouble in game and is known to be an honest player to guides should they bother to check my account, is ignored. <P>What i mean by being known to be an honest player is, i was once told by a GM that my account was being marked with a praise. Not that long ago, after a sudden server failure i came back to find that i had TWO corpses in full gear. People were telling me to loot the things i could and sell them, etc. The only thing i looted from my corpse was the misc. coins that are automatically taken when checking a corpse and it didnt amount to much at all. Instead, I petitioned and had the second fully equiped corpse removed. <P>What i wished to have addressed here is, Why when a honest player has something such as this happen, can nothing be done about it? It is a known problem and has been addressed previously as to being looked into. When will it be fixed? What about all those other honest players that have spent countless hours as i have? Do we not deserve a bit of compensation for the time and efforts spent? What harm would be caused by simply respawning Faydedar when he poofs like that because of a failure of technology? What is the policy on having a petition acknowledged? Why were both of my first petitions ignored? Are the customers of Verant of so little importance they they can be ignored on a whim of a GM and their problems not solved to the satisfactory of the majority of those involved? <P>It is obvious that this problem with Faydedar needs to be address a bit more indepth and a temporary solution in place until a more permanent one can be implimented. <P>Below is a link to the post i made on our more active server boards on EQVault. <P><BR>http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=9635300&replies=26<P>Thank you in advance for your time and impending response to this matter. <P>Faldile Baren<BR>56 Druid of E'ci <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's sad when customer service is as lacking as it is.  Verant needs to take a SERIOUS look at their customer service policies.  I understand some of the policies and how you try and discourage doing anything in case people take advantage of it.  <BR>Why can't you rez me? Soandso got a rez for this exact same thing! Why can't I?  I'm sure instances like this are the impetus behind some of your policies.<P>True you are preventing abuse of petitions but you are ALSO preventing legitimate problems from being solved.  By having such a timid stance on customer service you frustrate the players as well as the Guides who become frustrated because they want to help but are restricted by Verant policy.  Why do you think the guide program has so many drop outs?  Many guides are unhappy with many of the policies.  They grin and bear it but eventually enough is enough and they leave the program and go on their way.  So you lose both ways.  You have both parties disatisfied.  You lose with the paying customers and your guides.<P>Verant stands behind the idea that this is a group/social game where group and player interaction is needed to accomplish many tasks in the game.  It is sad indeed that when this group/player interaction occurs on a tremendous scale and is then scoffed at as another attempt to "dupe" the GM's.<P>NUMEROUS people dropped what they were doing to assist Faldile in killing Faydedar.  I was leading a raid in the Plane of Growth, it wasn't going very well for the first few hours.  However, things picked up near the end of the raid.  Just as things were picking up and we were finally getting some drops I recieve a tell that Faldile needed assistance with Faydedar.  I had 6 full groups with me at the time.  I asked them all if they would be willing to abandon the last few hours of the raid to assist Faldile on her epic mob.  Every singly person agreed.  They had nothing to gain out of assisting her.  They were not guildmates with her and some did not even know who Faldile was.  But regardless they showed a lot of class, honor, kindness and comraderie in leaving the Plane of Growth to help someone who has been a great asset to the E'ci community.<P>We had roughly 70 players in the zone ready to take down a dragon.  The ZONE crashed.  How can you say there is nothing you can do when it's a problem with your hardware and it's inability to handle mass gatherings of people?  Verant's inability to be fexible and understanding as well as their inability to glean the facts and investigate the situation is why Verant's customer service is so poor.  I would not be surprised if the GM's did not even check to see if the zone crashed.  They have it drilled in to them to not rock the boat and thus do as little as possible to try and resolve an issue and instead give the macroed "I'm sorry there is nothing we can do".<P>I'm not upset with the Guides or GM's.  I'm upset with the policies that Verant has set forth and drilled into their customer service representatives.  I realize this will be another futile effort and this post will get lost in the other spam of this board.  But I hope that by some chance someone does read this and bring this matter to someone who can implement some changes to Verant's policies.  They DO need to change.<P>/comfort Faldile<BR>/glare Verant<P>Dharkbaine Draagenborne<BR>Level 52 Troll Mystic of E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Faldile and Dark have pretty much said it all.  All I can say is I completely agree. When something happens because of VERANT's problems (zones crashing, mass LD's, corpses poofing because a LD player got the final hit, etc...), Verant should be much more willing and able to help their customers get back to their status before Verant's problem.<P>Wulfbane<BR>54 Ranger of E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Welcome to the world of customer service in EverQuest.  Unfortunately, Verant Interactive has taken a hard-nosed, adversarial stance against the players.  Because 5% of the EQ gaming population *might* be tempted to cheat and try to sneak something by a customer service rep, we are all cheaters by default and get no help.  That is a bass-ackwards policy that frankly does more to hurt us normal folks than deter the exploiters.<P>Let me tell you a story about a guy I used to work with, we'll call him Jeff. (his real name)  Jeff was a guy with no morals.  Back in the day, he liked to buy new computer products and then wrap an old or defective one in the box and take it back to the store for a refund.  Well one day the guy at the store caught on.  Jeff had put an old, outdated tape drive in the box of a brand new DAT and the clerk just couldn't believe that's what was in there.  He called the store manager over, who couldn't believe it either.  But Jeff kept insiting that this crummy little tape drive came in the shiny new box.  Ya know what?  He got his money back.  <P>Even though the store clerk and the manage were *sure* that he was wrong, they gave it to him anyway.  They didn't want to take the chance that he might be a customer with a legitimate complaint and not some sort of scam artist.  So the store ate the $400 cost of the new tape drive to make him happy.  That's customer service.<P>$400 is a drop in the bucket to a big national chain like Office Depot, but it still affects their bottom line.  What would respawning the dragon have cost VI if it turned out that someone was trying to scam them?  Not a damn thing.  It's all just bits and bytes in a computer.  Instead, they choose to tick off their customers on the off chance that one of them might be a cheater.<P>Verant, we are not the enemy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There definitely needs to be something done about the customer service.  Being forced to camp something for 37+ hours 2 times is ludicrous.  There is no harm done to Verant by respawning a mob.  There was proof that Faydedar was up, I was there, I helped kite the beast for a short period of time, I have a full log and pictures of the encounter.  There is no doubt that Faydedar was up.  What is wrong with spawning a mob again because of a technology failure?  We had no control over the despawning of the dragon, so why should Faldile have to camp it for a 3rd time?  When we were kiting Faydedar, conditions were perfect, everyone was on the same side, people were gathering for one person.  There was no doubt that we would slay him.  But I suppose now that VI's technology can't handle a raid, that there should be no respawn of the dragon.  Comepletely ludicrous.  We do pay you people money monthly, why can't you show us that our money is going towards something besides pixils on a screen?  Try to have a little empathy here, if you were camping something for 37+ hours and have had it taken away after it spawned by technology failure, how would you feel?  I'm sure you would feel horrified and completely crushed by a waste of 37+ hours of your life.<P>To Scirocco_:<BR>We had 70+ people in the zone because it was her second time camping Faydedar and 2nd time almost getting him too.  By having that many people it would be a sure kill on the first try, a second try at him is nearly impossible because of the iksar master.<P><BR>Ristael Rainbringer<BR>52 Druid<BR>E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think it is time for an open, honest discussions with the players and Verant about Customer Service.  The rules must be consistant between GM's, guides, servers, etc.  If another GM had been on at the time I bet the decision could have been different.  Also I think Sony should get involved.  It is time the parent company listen to the complaints also.<P>It has to be an open, honest non flame discussion.  You must listen to the customer base or you will lose them.  Sadly, most games I have played online operate in the same manner.  It is always assumed that the customer is trying to get something for nothing.  It is automatically assumed they are a scam artist.<P>I am not talking about nerf issues or anything else and yes I do know that all decisions are not black and white.  Take the above instance for example.  The zone crashed.  I assume all in the zone crashed but let's say half of the zone got booted but the other half did not.  Should you repop in that case?  Suppose it was 90 percent that did but 10 percent did not?  As you can see not always an easy call but even with the difficult decisions it is time that those that really care about the game get together somehow with the decision makers to have a real dialog about the issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Sadly, most games I have played online operate in the same manner.  It is always assumed that the customer is trying to get something for nothing.  It is automatically assumed they are a scam artist.<P>I am not talking about nerf issues or anything else and yes I do know that all decisions are not black and white.  Take the above instance for example.  The zone crashed.  I assume all in the zone crashed but let's say half of the zone got booted but the other half did not.  Should you repop in that case?  Suppose it was 90 percent that did but 10 percent did not?  As you can see not always an easy call but even with the difficult decisions it is time that those that really care about the game get together somehow with the decision makers to have a real dialog about the issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What kinda crap is that? No acknowlagment to petitions!!?? If you VI insist on making people camp for things for UNGODLY hours then you need some form of back up for things like this! No one should have to WASTE that much time to only get screwed because of a server crash, that is just not right. I for one will never sit in one spot looking for a MOB for just this reason. I for one would quit the game over something like this. Customer relations is very important to me and hopefully to a lot of other people out there. This guy sounds like a ROLE MODEL player. To have a corpse duplicated and petition so the extra is removed and not loot it is almost unheard of. I don't know if GM's can see players stats / good / bad marks on account easily but I think they should and be able to take that into account. I for 1 hope this never happens to me, i have had only good experiences with GM's on the EC'I server and this is a policy issue and not a personal choise by a GM so it IS something VI can take care of. I'm sure that VI has posted why they have this policy in place at some point but please refreash our memory on why someone should camp for 40 hours and then loose the spawn because of server crash....<P>Kilroth 52 Vicar EC'I<BR>Banewolf 52 Champion EC'I<BR>Praetorian 50 Ranger EC'I<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The problems seem to occur during all those hours when Therdar isn't around to keep things in check.   Twice now I've had to file formal complaints against guides for either deleting my petitions or for refusing to escalate a petition to a GM. <P>This problem with Faydedar is way out of hand, Verant needs to rethink the way this mob spawns, or change the component elements for the Druid epic quest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the general sentiment that Verant's CS is sorely in need of a revamp, and the E'Ci server needs particular attention. I play on a couple of servers, and when I'm on one of them, there are almost always at least one or two guides in evidence. However, on E'Ci, I rarely see even one, and when I do see Guides on E'Ci, they are usually anonymous. This strikes me as unacceptable, as the Guides are supposed to be visible, there to help the players with issues that arise in game.<BR>I can understand some of the limitations that seem to be placed on what Guides are allowed to do, but in other areas, there is no justifiable reason that I can think of for not allowing them to do what is stated as their job- helping players resolve issues. Even if that help consists solely of bringing the issue to the attention of a GM. <BR>It's time, and past time, for VI and Sony to take a good, hard look at their customer service policies, and revamp them to address the actual needs of their paying customers.<P>Felini Solanaceae, The Lost Bard of E'Ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> The funny thing about all this is that Verant stated a while back that they were changing their stance in regards to whether or not a player was trying to cheat them.  They switched to innocent until proven guilty instead of the other way around.<P> Of course, this was in regards to item reimbursals, and was not implemented without a backup plan.  They had just put in their new logging features that can track items.  However, these same logs can also track mobs. The evidence needed to respawn Faydedar was obviously there, but the policy prohibited it.<P> One would think that if Verant is going to trust the customer on item reimbursals, they could do the same with mob spawns and every other policy.  It's hypocritical if you ask me.<P><BR>Sinvin Heartfang<BR>-----------------<BR>Tier'dal Cleric<BR>53rd Season, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Their answer was:<BR>You travel on the boats at your own risk. Thanks, bye.<P>So we have him ask if the guide can check the log to see WHAT he died to, and the answer was Nope, Thanks bye.<P>I am infuriated, as the ECI customer support has SUCKED lately, and send a tell to Therdar who is on, but at the event.  He has tells off.  I send it to the Senior GM who says he's busy and that we should petition.  So i reply saying we did, and his people gave us a pisspoor excuse of an answer and remind me how important Customer Service is to Verant and Sony when NWN comes out.<P>Sorry Folks, but the GM's on ECI have become more and more rude, and less and less helpful.  I still stand behind Dezus because he was SUPER helpful to me when I died during a server crash and didnt get the GM exp res after he ressed me.<P>Their flippant attitude and "We cant help with  That" on EVERYTHING lately is more and more annoying.<P>We all know this thread will go no where, nothing will happen, and nothing will change.

</FONT><HR>I've had my share of good and bad experiences with GMs.<P>The good:  Last night, someone decided to see how much weight a boat could handle - by having Quag Maelstrom (level 45 cyclops) board while I was on it!  I got away only because I had Spirit of Wolf up at the time.  I got an almost immediate response - my trip was interrupted, but at least I survived.  I was told that the MOB "had been killed".<P>The bad:  I was booted from the Maidens Voyage due to a lag spike - I wound up on ogre island (near where the evil boat to Kunark docks).  After a long wait, the GM teleports me to the point where the barge coming from Oasis stops - despite the fact I was going to Faydwer!  It would have been faster for me to levitate and SoW myself, and run to the ranger outpost to catch the island shuttle!<P>It's unfortunate that Verant has taken the attitude that 110% proof is required before they'll fix the problem (whether by compensation of items lost, teleporting, repopping, etc).  Since screenshots or logs can be doctored, Verant assumes that they are - and won't accept them as "proof".  The impression I get is unless their logs show that the problem was 100% caused by them (and not by a router, ISP, act of God, or anything else but), they probably won't do anything but say "Sorry, bud".<P>If there is a problem in that a sudden influx of people into a usually little-utilized zone causes a crash, they need to address that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

When we all logged off one of my friends had lost much of the experience he had gained and all of his equipment.  We were all playing at the same house (Using Windows 98se internet sharing), so I walked over to his computer immediately and saw that he was a lower level and naked.  Next day he petitioned and after about two hours of waiting he was told that they couldn't help him and that they didn't believe him.  The worst part is that based on past experience we expected that response.

</FONT><HR>This reminds me of a time I was on a Kedge raid, and the server went down right after we killed Phinny, who dropped crappy loot. The server was down for 30-60 minutes or so. There had been numerous lag spikes that night, slowing our raid, and it was getting pretty late. I was dead at the time the server went down. However, when the server came back up, Phinny was up again, and we decided to take him again. Numerous people saw him cast. Then, some guides appeared in the zone. A little later, when we had everyone rezed and we were ready to kill Phinny again, we went to pull him, and he was no longer up. The raid leader and others petitioned about it. The answer was that there was no one on at the time who could despawn a mob, and that they couldnt/wouldnt bring him back up. In any case.. some of the people who were comunicating with the guides got black marks against their accounts. We KNOW that Phinny was up. Telling us that since we just killed Phinny its not 'in the vision' to kill him again would have been acceptable. But to LIE to your customers is not acceptable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was horrified by the sheer lack of concern and customer service on the part of Veneant in this situation.<BR>It was gratifying to see so many people just drop what they were doing to rush off to help with the epic of a truly good person who waited there for so many hours, only to have the zone crash and have Verant refuse to help. It wasn't as if WE the players screwed up. Verant screwed up and refused to help.<BR>Faldile, best of luck to you. It seems that a large potion of the server was willing and able to help. It is a pity that the people we pay to engage in this activity were not as helpful.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a comment to make here too.<P>We keep getting told that this is a game of co-operation and that is why some of the mobs are hard.<P>Well when we do co-operate the zone gets Laggy and we get a zone crash or 50-75 percent of the folk go link dead causing the failure of the raid.<P>I've done many raids and this happens so often that I'm sure that ALL the GM's guides know this to be true. Having said that can you imagine how frustrated the GM's must feel telling some raid that nothing can be done.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been disqusted with the customer service on ECi.  The GM's never help, the guides are worthless and on more than one occasion I have had to repetition becuase my petition got wiped without a response.  A huge money saveing idea for sony which would provide the same amount of customer service that we currently get is to FIRE the GM's on our server.  I hate to say it, but unfortunately the customer service is a JOKE that just isnt funny anymore.  I am sick and tired of stupid bugs, crashes etc. <P>PS.  Could someone post why we have GM's please and maybe what guides are for, because it isn't to help out in the game apparently.  I would also like to know where the policies that Verant have that make it so they can't help a player out are.<P>CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT EXIST it is a MYTH</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My experiences with Verant CS have been neutral to positive, but rarely would I call it "professional," even when the outcome is in my favor.<P>This does seem to me a good example of the poor service that plagues Verant and EQ.  The only positive I can see is that all these people left their groups and raids to lend you a hand.  I find that exceptionally cool.<P>Good luck in the completion of your quest.<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
