</FONT><HR>Ok i did not read through all the other posts because of a lack of time = ( well anyways here is what I hope will be changed for bards. <P>1. Ok bards, like monks, have low hp and that is understandable since we are hybrids. Then I dont know if it is me but I am missing the mob half the time. So If i have 1000 hp at lvl 37 and I hit only half the time what good is that? I die VERY fast(heh i have only a few hundred more hp then casters what a joke huh?). Well thats not too apealing huh? Get the melee buffed up a little bit.<P>2. Our songs. They are great and all but it isnt as easy for a bard to get a group as it should be. Bards are like every class combined but with each buff kinda weaker. For haste Chanter, Healing Cleric, Tank warrior, stats Druid/Shaman. So why would a group want a bard if they can have the BEST of each buff? Make songs somewhat better.<P>3. Seleo's Accelerondo. For druids/shammys/rangers they get SoW. Sure they cannot cast SoW in dungeons but they just go outside cast it and come back where as bards lose speed once they enter the dungeon. That limits the use of a bard in a dungeon. (i have been kicked out of groups in Lguk plenty of times because i wasnt as usefull as a cleric or a mage). <P>Well thats just my 2cp just work on one of these or something I know i complain a lot but hey u asked so i replied.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings, Absor.  Thankyou for reading this far, and for doing these class talks.  I imagine this must be somewhat of an arse-whipping for you.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I have played a bard since beta IV.<P>Please allow us to see how much damage our damage songs are doing.  Only Bellow and damage shield songs return the amounts.  Other classes have this information, so should we.<P>Please fix the drum animation.<P>I liked the "slide" animation that Selo's Accelerando had through the first year of the game... made me feel as though I was the Silver Surver.  The waddle needs to go.<P>Please allow Mask illusions to be off-clickable instead of requiring zoning.  Please allow the effect to remain on even after zoning.<P>Damage Shield songs, in general, would be used more if the shield provided more damage, or were scaled to rise more appropriately.  I am aware they provide resistance benefits.  But in ordinary situation, I never use these.<P>Please test changes to bards thouroughly.<P>Thankyou for your time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Part of what intrigues me about being a bard is that a bard is an extremely challenging class to play. I enjoy being one of the few that can do it. Although carpal tunnel is peeking its head around the corner, I do not mind twisting songs, and can accept the fact that I am not the most effective tank, and simply "enhance" my party with my songs.<P>I guess I do not want to lose this aspect, and have the bard class be similar to the dr00d class, where you see millions running around.<P>I have profoundly enjoyed playing my bard, but it just has to be the *least* understood class. Why else are there so few bards? Why must I prove to my friends that bards are beneficial in groups after they tell me bards are one of the last classes they'll choose to group with? Why are upper level bards telling me that bards at upper levels are less and less desirable? Hmmm...<P>What really alarms me, is this talk that the higher level bards have of being pretty much useless especially in later levels if there is an enchanter or shaman present, in which their better crowd-control abilities make us obsolete. What this reduces us to is simply a mana-battery, and takes away the challenge from the game. If there are any other bards like me who play a bard because of its diversity and flexibility, then the very thing that draws me to a bard is taken away.<P>Equally alarming are the depiction of the charts on Bard Power Curves (which urls have been posted on this thread). Where as other classes follow the same curve in their damage/healing abilities, a bard's curve tapers off. Does my ability to be effective in a group go downhill from here?<P>Here is a summary of everything I've read thus far on what I would like to see:<BR>Have our haste songs stack (perhaps somewhat) with the better shaman/enchanter buffs<BR>If not stack, have the better spell override ours, instead of ours cancel the better one<BR>Have our damage/regeneration ability rise proportionately with other classes<BR>Increase our picklock skill to 200 so we are more useful in Velious<BR>Get Feign Death skill, due to many a times a bard gets aggroed on<BR>Give us Parry and Riposte at slightly lower levels than what they're at now<BR>Introduce a few weapons that give instrumental effects as to utilize a song's full effects<BR>Decrease the time to memorize new songs... A bard has to adapt to the situation quickly, give us the ability to switch to a new song quickly. Please increase the cap on our Meditation to be over 0.<BR>Give us more of a charisma boost in our weapons/armor, or maybe a charisma song earlier<P>My mission is to save the bard. I do not want everyone to be a bard - a bard's life isn't easy nor is it heroic. But what I want is a just a few things that would balance us out a bit more. Make us a little more desirable to play and to group with.<P>With that, all bards check out my new bard site that launches this Thursday.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>http://www.eqdiva.com<P>~ Kocho Divah 35th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One thing that is being debated here is melee/defensive skills.  I think that if we are supposed to be a defensive class, we really need to have more defense.  If we are going to be pushed up on melee, we should have either a low level double attack, or a raise in our melee skills in general.  I also think that a low level backstab (as we are supposed to be rogue/enchanter?) is a good idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This is a post about Balancing the bard class and in some case suggestions.<P><BR>First...<P>I would really LOVE and think it would make sense to have an instrument specialization. let me explain my point. Bard has the ability to use all instruments But if you look everywhere every musician is specialized in a precise instrument. Sure he can know a lot of them about many. But hes always better in a precise one. I would like to see a specialization for bard when they use their instrument. For example if i use my lute to sing cantana of replishment and im specialized in string. The effect would be a tad better.<BR>To not make this overpowering i think the specialization should begin at 35 and progressively going up to 60. Casters have specialization. You keep giving more and more stuff to all other hybrids while bard remains with nothing. off course i dont want a 100% effect increase on specialization and lowering the casting time of the song could be done or effect increased or duration of the song increased.  <P><BR>parry at level 53 and riposte at 58 is just stupid in my mind its way too high and cap very low we get it 20-30 lvls or so after all other hybrids and cap 2 times lower.<P>I wont compare when warriors get the skill Because We arent warriors, tought on the other hand we are hybrids...and most hybrids get it around (paladins get parry at 17 and riposte at 30(they cap at 200 or so i believe)<P>I dont want to riposte like a warrior, off course not. <BR>but either raise the cap. so only 58 + bards benefit from it.<P>59 bard reach (70 skill in riposte max) and 60 bard reach 100)<BR>or make it progressive from a lower level with a little higher cap.<P>Having riposte as a bard isnt that big off a bonus since the mob is not on us *most* of the time. Tought it isnt a reason to give us so low level cap if we look at other hybrids.<P>As for our effect on our bard armor. Being a bard means using no mana at all for our songs. IN this mind I believe verant should understand make effects that are actually useful for bards. NOT IN ALL CASES like some ubber 70 str buff, thats not what i want.<P>Verant has to understand having a huge casting time for a bard means he cant twist or even sing while he waits for effect to go.<P>Tought on the other side we can move while casting those items. So i dont believe we should see any dd, dot or stuff like this on bard armor.<P>So it keeps us up with either buffs...or minor effects.<P>Eye of zoom...bleh comon please.<BR>Summon drink and food on our ss legs and boots.<BR>(Make it at least 10 per casting and with a 3 sec casting time. At the level we get the only advantage we get out of this is never going to buy food again. but taking 3 mins each time i log to summon 50 food and 50 drink is totally stupid. I have both of those and i often just go with asking other ppl for food because i feel its a disavantage to take my time to summon those than to sing for my group.)<P>Melodic bp<P>Oh please comon....THE purpose of song of travel is to travel safely, Its totally stupid to have this on a bp since each time you cast the effect goes off and u fall on ground and gotta cast it again.<P>I would like to see maybe some lesser shielding buff or fix the song to be 3 sec casting time like our song and being continous till you click it again. Just like BoH(as for being possible to hotkey it).<P>As for singing steel bp.<P>BLeh!!!. please we have a 100 hp heal that takes around 15-18 sec casting time, and self only also.<P>With my level 6 song(Hymm of restoration) or level 55 song(cantana of replishment I can double or nearly this heal for the WHOLE group not just myself in the same time. with not even a decent lute( Used MM lute).<P>I believe ss arms effect casting time should be lowered to 3 seconds. as being targettable it could free us a slot to invigor someone. But anyway we have few songs that we sing regularly and that gives us more than this would. Using arms would prolly penalise more the group than anything else.<P>I would really love to see more instruments in game.<P>So far theres around 5 for each of the following skils(wind,brass,percussion and string)<P>But they are either VERY RARE (POA ONES)<BR>or very common.<BR>Some low level (20-40) and more 40-60 instruments should be seen. With all these new zones in kunark and Velious i havent seen many of these.<P>How about some Kinda epic quest for those? off course those would be rare and hard to get by. But it would bring more dynamic in the bard world.<P>Would be neat also to introduce a skill to make instruments. Getting a tanned pelt off a rare wolf in sleeper dungeon could be a piece to get make by a tailor and be a piece to make an instrument. etc<P><BR>-Make our Haste stackable with other hastes.<BR>THERES no advantage or verry little in having a bard(50-60 guilds) in their raids.<P>Cleric epic, take us out of the cr groups to help clerics getting people rezed.<P>Resists buffs songs...with all the new items for resists and all this. someone can get their Resist magic to 190-220 easily with only buffs and decent equip and buffs.(only advantage in having a bard for resists would be because invites of the guild or quil members have no resist equip(which cost very little in jewelry...could make that much money in not even one night at level 45)<P>Now all buffs last way longer than they were in the past. buffs passing from 45 mins to 2 hours duration is a huge mana boost for the buffing classes.So clerics, shamans and enchanters(dont really need us with their epic as well for haste).<P><BR>With the stats cap at 255. lots classes with decent equip when buffed reach this cap or only need very litte to get to it.<P>So far the only new role of the bard is to ditch mana before a raid for buffs and to use occlusion of sound to reduce resists. <P>As for mezzing we have a 55 cap. If u wander any deep in most dungeons you will see right away that bard isnt useful here as for the mez or charm.<P>then about our AE 800 mana  song (lvl 43 dirge song).<BR>The mana is way too high to have a use and the dmg is just lousy vs 50+ mobs.<BR>and anyway it would break the mez of enchanters or urself when using it.<P>I suggest to give a 15 minutes timer at level 43 reducing it by on this song and whipping the 800 mana back to 0 like most of our songs.<BR>Also from level 50+ upgrade the dmg with the level to a more decent damage.<P>with each level the timer takes 30 seconds less bringing a bard to 7 min and half for level 60 duration.<P>as for psalm of vitality isnt it suppose to actually cure disease like psalm of purity? just a question...<P>Could we have FINALLY a animation when running with an actual drum graphic? <BR>....around 1 year ago, shamans couldnt see certains shields when weilding them and verant fixed it right away. altought we all know bards have reported the graphic bug on their drums since beta phase 3 and it never have been fixed.<P>Is it that hard to do an animation?<P>you guys made around 30 in 1 week for the emote upgrade like blush shrug etc...<P>anyway we only have lets say big top...5 different drums. shouldnt be too hard to switch them all to the same model or make special ones for nagafen whos the best drum i know (maybe sleeper and pom have better or POA not resolved bard quest).<P><BR>Wishes...<P><BR>Lot of classes had a quest to get a spell, i would love to see the next songs added depending on lvl having a quest for them.<P>Old ministrel will learn you how to play a mana sieve unresistable for level 59  if you bring a message of his health state to his lost daughter kept by a dragon in VT. and so on. He needs his instruments to sing it to you so you can hear the song once and learn it.So he sends you to a thief to kill in some zone etc and so on. <P>The song should be continuous and having a kinda longer casting timethan 3 seconds(6 probably) OR it would make ur mana decrease as u get mana out of the mob, not drasticly please Verant :P.<P>I would love to see more illusions for bard only (sing a song with a 15 sec casting time  to morph into a mob with Minus and Increase stats. for example<P>Being in seb with a chanter the bard doesnt need to mez and he happends to melee in this group.<BR>Use this song and get ur charisma drop by 70 and resist fire by 40 while resist ice goes up by 30 and str goes up by 30 and stamina by 10. You could morph into a mini Ice golem( like in skyshrine) being only usable in kunark, velious zones. <P>Off course not everyone bard would happend to have this song etc.<P><BR>well thats about it, i would love to see feedbacks and suggestion.<P>Aledark WillowVoice<BR>60 Virtuoso of Knights of Eternal Good<BR>Rathe Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some ideas....<P>Blacksmithed Enchanted Weapons - to make up for lack of and/or ineffective mid level insturments. Make them require Enchanted Bars of Metal and other dropped or bought items. Perhaps something line a Gold Etched Steel Lute..wt 3.0..Sc vs Fire +5 and adds 10% to stringed songs...etc<P>Someone mentioned an EVADE type skill. Give us a "THROW VOICE" skill similar to evade. Since it is based on the Hide skill, I believe that the cap for Bards is already low which would make it less effective than the Rogue version.<P>Additional Songs (Like ITU) the could be quested for or use a new skill called "COMPOSE". Have it structured like the casters research concept; whereby one would have to obtain multiple items to combine in a Composer's Trunk, along with ink and a staffed sheet. More utility type songs could be added to the game. A mid level nice AC/STA Buff might be nice.<P>Perhaps Helms might be made to add the effect of cetain instruments. Example, Helm of the Crystal Flute..AC X, effect: Wind Instrument. Allows Wind songs to be sung but with Instrument effects. Seems that only Brass and Wind would make any sense with Helm slot. Horned Helm of xxxx..AC X, effect: Brass Instrument...etc<P>As many have suggested, a higher level STUN type song would be quite helpful. Perhaps a "xxxxx's Cacophony" with a short Stun and MR debuff.<P>I love playing the bard class but so many have listed problems greater than the minor suggestions I have listed. I don't want to detract one whit from these greater problems. I only wanted to add to the fun factor that some of these ideas might bring to the class.<P>Raelyn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My two biggest problem are the level caps on mez, charm and fear and the loss of value of being a generalist in the high level game.<P>As I get higher in level I should not lose my best abilities. My bard was only 42 when I retired her, nowhere near those mid-50's level caps on charm and mez, but I could see the handwriting on the wall. I never minded having the lowest damage output of any class and crappy defense, I had charm and mez, they made up for it. Take away those abilites and I'm a ranger that never trained double attack.<P>The game you designed: mobs increasing in power exponentially that only small armies of players can kill. That game only favors specialists, a jack of all trades just can't cut the mustard. <P>For a class designed from the ground up to be a grouping class you just didn't quite succeed.<BR>Enchanters outclass us in all the important areas: mez, haste, slow, mana regen.  Shamans outclass us in haste, slow and proabaly regen. Unless we can equal enchanters and shamans or stack with them in those areas then bards will always fall short of being a grouping class. <P>Maximum efficiency and the specialization necessary to achieve that efficiency are what counts in this game. It's how you designed things, especially at higher levels. Unless the jack of all trades can stack with and enhance the specialists then he will be passed over. Because if you're only 'ok' at doing something people don't want you, they'll wait on the guy who's the best at doing that something.<P>Other, minor issues:<BR>The timing bug where an effect will disappear if you refresh a buff as it's wearing off happens ALOT. For the entire evening we're refreshing a song every 3 ticks, just as it's wearing off.<P>I would never ever use dirge. Mana is much better spent on charm.<P>Having bards come back from a rez with zero mana is a big huge penalty. It robs us of charm, one of our best abilities for quite a long time.<P>Also, why does our level 39 charm debuff the magic resist of our pet? Some thought it was because the song was meant to be refreshable, currently it isn't, confirmed as intended by Abashi. Abashi did not know why the mr debuff was there. The only guess was that it helped prevent early breaks. Does it? Is the charm duration determined by resist checks every so often or is it a fixed, predetermined random number? <P>I liked the character of a bard. I liked twisting and casting on the run. The mix of melee and magic. But my bard is still retired. I just didn't see myself being useful. Not only that I saw myself getting weaker as core abilities were tossed to the side by arbitrary level caps. Hopefully one day you'll adjust these things so that my bard will be useful through all her life, until then I have my enchanter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, if you do anything read Thott's haste/slow stacking link.<BR>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html<P>This is the single most unbalancing issue.  By fixing haste stacking, bards may actually be welcome in higher-level encounters, and become a more viable group asset in mid-levels.<P>The problem with bards once they become planar (46+) is that their usefulness in a group decreases as level increases.  In addition, you are forced into more balanced groups at higher levels due to the difficulty of the encounters as you get higher level.  It is a very rare situation for me to be in a group without a shaman or enchanter.  Usually, there are both.  When this is the case, I KNOW that the group would be better off with a rogue, or warrior in my stead, and the only reason I am still there is because of the relationships I have built with those group members in the past.<BR> <BR>It is hard to believe that some of you are spending your final shot at balance on items, AC, and animations.  I'll dig food out of my singing shorts all day long if they will just make us group desireable at higher levels.  For the mid-level bards: if you plan on playing your bard as your main, you will no longer be the fun swiss army knife you were once you level up.  By the time you get to 55, you will not be desired in groups because of the haste/efficiency issue, Charm is capped at 51, Fear at 53 and your Mez is capped at 55.  You are a one trick pony (Mez), and not even that if you are in a group that has a good enchanter and/or good puller (which is almost always).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Biggest bard issues in my opinion:<BR> 1. Scaling of song power post 50 (chants, bellow, ae dmg, healing, etc).<BR> 2. Resists. The #1 reason why bards needed for raids pre-50, but when resists get over 150 with equipment (easy to do by velious), high resists from bard songs do very little.<BR> 3. Kae's post is a great recap of discussions going on from the concert hall.<P>Detail on picklock issue:<BR>*Bard get skill at 40 and capped at 100. That means a bard can pick: Befallen (level 20 dungeon), 2 exits from tower of frozen shadow (level 30 dungeon), and entrance to the Hole (easy to just swim around boulder).<BR>*Unpickable: Najena, Howling Stones, Karnor, Charasis, Seblis, City of Mist, and other miscellaneous locks. Nothing where a level 40+ bard would actually go.<BR>*Bards don't want to pick everything, but maybe increase skill to 200. Make regular locks in dungeon 200, and boss-mob locks (venril, nobles, reaver door in com) a skill of 201. Bards could get you into parts, but only rogues can get you to great spots. Alternative is to drop level to 15 when it may be useful to a bard in befallen. As is, locks seem to be designed with only rogue/rogue twinks in mind and not bards.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had intended to read every one of these posts, but I only made it to the top of page 3.<P>Most of my concerns and suggestions were covered excellently on page 1, so I'll just add those that I don't recall seeing there. Apologies if they have already been mentioned later in the thread.<P>1) Apart from the level 20 and 23 songs, our other slow songs have a snare component. I find it almost impossible to persuade snarers not to snare and almost every group has a snarer. This means that the only slow songs usually available, stacking issues aside, are the level 20 and 23 ones. We really need snare removed from all but one of the higher level slow songs, or high level upgrades to the 20 and 23 songs.<P>2) *this is a BIG issue for me at the moment*!!<BR>I've seen the problems with stuck songs mentioned, but a far greater problem for me is the effect of songs cancelling as soon as they are re-started. It effectively penalises me for "perfect" weaving and totally messes up the weaving cycle. I have recently switched to hot keys for weaving to save some of the strain inherent in playing a bard for long periods and the problem is now worse than ever. I would estimate that individual songs cancel about 1 in 3 times.<BR>I've seen this problem mentioned in the past and know that it's a game mechanics problem that affects all spells. Something REALLY needs to be done about it. If it can't be fixed, then the way that songs are weaved/woven  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> needs to be changed (plenty on that in other posts).<P>3) Oddly, I don't recall seeing much on this on the first couple of pages, but bards desparately need continual upgrades to the AE mez song. Song of Twilight is about right now - useful but no threat to enchanters. However, when the ubiquitous lag spikes coincide with the need to keep 3 mobs mezzed, everything falls apart, usually resulting in a wipeout or evacuation.<P>4) Minor song suggestion - invisibility to undead, preferably fairly on (say mid-30's). One of the bards strengths before the fixed duration invisibility of higher levels is their reliable invisibility song. It would be great if this advantage could be used in places like Lower Guk too.<P>Of the things already mentioned, I'd like to stress the following as being of most concern to me:<BR>a) song/spell stacking issues<BR>b) the RSI/carpel tunnel vision dangers of playing a bard <P>Two of the ideas that I particuarly liked are beer summoning (this should have been on SS boots instead of water) and tavern teleport. What better way to finish an adventure than having the bard whisk you off to your favorite tavern to sing songs of your heroic deeds?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Three big beefs that I have that others will probably have already posted is that:<P>1.  Whenever a "fix" is put in place for a hybrid, caster or melee, bards are never included because they are commented to not be part of whatever group is getting enhancements.  When a "nerf" is put in, bards are included because they are considered to be part of that group.<P>2.  Bards for some reason are Plate capable, but can't wear new types of plate, or their new armour is equal or lower in AC to chain classes.  Actually I don't melee much so it doesn't bother me, but it certainly shows to the Bard players that the design team just does not know Bards at all.  This is further enhanced by the lack of a Bard trainer in Kunark (all the others were accidentally left from play testing, if there was none there, then it seems likely that no one was play testing a bard) and the useless effects on the armour that actually are less efficient than playing songs or using skills that bards get (stamina regen song for group being more efficient for one person let alone many vs stamina regen spell of target only with hideous casting time, food summoning from pants and water summoning from boots instead of forage, especially as the locations they come from is particularly disgusting in concept, brownies and funny smelling/tasting water...)<P>3.  Being brushed off on every request for balance or bug fix because "bards are unique and complex", not from you on this thread, but from many posts before when Bards asked about ambiguous patch messages or problems that have occured due to patches.<P>I'm sure that I can come up with more specifics later, but those three really bug me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Class balance.<P>Bards are not balanced. Level 60 is the most important consideration because Everquest is directional, and it is the level every character will hit, assuming he continues to perservere in the dynamics of the game. Level 60 Bards and the leaders of these 'peak' Guilds will tell you that it is almost unnecessary to have a bard in large scale raids of that level, the fact that many relevent crowd control skills become unusable at 55, and many other factors already mentioned in this thread.<P>You give us the point that we share our songs with a full group of 6 for free? Our haste song is shared with a full group, therefore the damage we deal when twisting haste and damage buffs for our tanks will be large, and therefore we are compensated for in our melee skills. Please note that firstly, groups are very seldom formed when each of our song will beneficially affect every member of the group. A haste song will only give relevant haste to the 1-2 offensive tanks in the group, a mana song to the 1-2 offensive casters and maybe a rune song to the 1-2 defensive tanks? This being compared to casters who can share their 'buffs' or bonuses they bring to the party. A shaman or enchanter can share buffs OUTSIDE the group to the relevant members who need it, since most large hunts are composed of many groups with many classes. Add on the fact that our most important 'buff' songs (haste) does not stack with that of the other classes?<P>If you want a simple analytical example consider this. A group of 6 rogues doing backstabbing will do MORE damage than a group of 5 rogues and 1 bard doing backstabbing and haste + buffs songs. This is because Haste song is generally weak and bard melee does not scale up to the melee classes. What this example shows is a hypothethical situation where the bard is providing his BEST to EVERY member of the group (they may not be rogues, but any other class too), yet he still does not scale in efficiency as would be swapping him out for another rogue. Add on to this fact that in a normal group, each of his songs only affect one/two members of the group beneficially, the bard is seriously underpowered and is being a liability in raids. He is there not to provide, but be a liability. The class is not balanced.<P>We are given many songs that remain useful throughout our lives as bards. But should that not be granted to bards given the fact that we can only do three songs at a time, and only at best to 5 other persons? Add on the fact that our best songs do not stack with those of other classes? Why should we be allowed to only pick three of the best songs to do from a big list, and have these three best songs unstackable and inferior to that of the other classes?<P><BR>Please do not dismiss us as being whiners as many of these little details we bards have brought up here may just be considered 'annoyances' by your team, but for the manual work that is put into playing a bard, we certainly deserve more than this. The main conclusion of this post is this:<P>Given the working restrictions of a bard (to sing three songs at most to 5 other group members) <BR>1. our songs are not potent enough, and are overwhelmed by that of other classes.<BR>2. our songs do not stack (forcing bards to sing their 'second best' song; and why should we, given the tight restrictions in which we do our thing?)<P>The fix? melee compensation, song scaling, stacking, and removing the little annoyances we have to face, given the manual effort we put into as bards. Acknowledge the restrictions we face as bards and compensate us as your team would consider sufficient. Gather feedback from the level 60 bards. The bard class needs a lot of trial and testing. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't envy you for having to read all of this Alan.  Here's for hoping you've made it this far (took me a long time).<P>One of the things that I enjoy as a bard is the ability to get people to locations quickly - not as quickly as a porter mind you but nevertheless rather quickly with Selo's.<P>Unfortunately, with the release of Kunark, this ability was diminished severely.  When Kunark came out we had all these wonderful new zones with some fabulous geometry.  New trees and all kinds of other great stuff.<P>Again, unfortunately, many times when going through these zones with people, I need to get them SOW and meet on the other side of the zone.<P>Why?<P>There are several reasons.<P>The first is probably something that you cannot fix.  Lag.  If they lag at any point while in a hilly area, they won't see which way I went.<P>The second problem is the range of our songs.  Let me clarify a bit.  Let's say that I've got a group of people I'm leading through the Dreadlands.  When I go from the tunnel on one side to FV tunnel, I run straight across.  Now, let's assume for a moment that we're all using Selo's...<P>As we run up and down the hills, I'll either get most of my party killed from the drops or lose them somewhere along the way due to lag.  <P>Ok.  No problem.  Bards have levitate...or do they? ;P  Let's talk in feet for a sec.  I'm pulling numbers out of my head purely for illustration purposes.  Also, when i say range of a song I mean the distance where it will affect other players in my group.  Let's say the range of Selo's is 100 feet.  The range of levitate is 50 feet.  I'm using Levitate and Selo's to get across the zone.  If at any point, I get too far ahead of my party OR too high or low of my party levitate wears off!  Result?  A party member falls hundreds of feet to their death and we have a long corpse recovery mission.<P>This is probably my biggest gripe with the bard.  Honestly, I've never gotten past level 47 so I don't know how the bard scales past that point.  I do know that I can't dish out the damage as well as a warrior nor take it (even with a really high ac).<P>I do find that people typically want me to just play mana song but I've also come to realize that it's typically because it's the one song everyone knows about.  Many people just need to be trained about the values of a bard.<P>I do agree with the previous posts about the mana drain (useless imho) and our mez line.  Heh - as far as the mana drain goes, I mean, let's think about it for a second.  In a group of 4 (cleric, mage, bard and paladin - real life example) we can take out a level 32ish caster (all of us 34) in about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  How much mana am I going to drain from the target during this time?  24 mana per 6 seconds...maybe 100 mana - 200 if lucky?  And that's equipping the instrument and not getting any melee damage in there...<P>I don't expect our power to be increased to the point of enchanters but it would be nice for our songs to work a bit better than they currently do.<P>I read all of the other class posts as well so far and in each one you started you may nerf as well as increase in power.  Personally, I don't think it's necessary to nerf the bard class.  We're a VERY small minority of players out there which - to me - means that we're a difficult class to play and not overpowered.  If we were overpowered there'd be many more playing bards.<P>G'luck</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor I notice that you mentioned requesting for the Lute of the howler to be removed. In my opinion, this would be a mistake. Enchanters have been asking for more illusions, and using this lute as an example of their abilities being given away. There are two problems with this argument - <BR>Firstly, they are forgetting that this is not given to us in the form of a spell, but a very VERY hard to get item, 55+ encounter I beleive.<BR>Secondly, and a direct parallel, bards *were* the only class with mana-regen spells. Chorus of clarity was in the game waaay before Breeze/Clarity. I do not think it reasonable to give ALL enchanters a very MAJOR ability of bards, that was unique to them, and then to say that it is stepping on enchanter's toes to allow a very SMALL proportion of bards the CHANCE to get an item that gives an illusion, one that is no longer unique even as it can be cast upon others (different buff effects, but the issue is the illusion itself). I hope this (what I consider to be) rational post has convinced you to leave the Howler Lute alone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>***BUG***<P>sorry, I haven't the time to wade through all the posts to see if this is listed.<P>Clarity songs sometimes report the mana gained incorrectly on the client.  Often too much mana is being reported on the client resulting in the playing thinking they may be at full mana when they are not.<P>Method of testing.  I have often started meditating at 0 mana.  When i get to FM, i get up and cast a spell and duch to interupt it.  This normally costs no mana.  If the bard song has been playing the entire time, I will usually have mana drop one bub.<P>To factor out that it might be loss of mana due to the spell interupt, I have tested on my shaman with canabalize.  This spell redults in mana gained, and yet when cast after a full med on a bard song I loose mana on my mana bar.<P>Note, this test only works if you test immediatly after you get to full mana.  Aafter you are at full mana, if you continue to med the main server will keep adding mana till it sees you at full.<P>Here is the thing, hit points are always checked with the server so that the player knows how much they have.  Mana is only checked every time a spell is cast or attempted to be cast.  If the client gets an inaccurate report of the mana it stays, while any innacurate reports in HPs are immediatly corrected.  I have noticed when using bind wound and such that the HP returned per bind are double for a split second and then dropped back to what they should be. (at 100 skill I get a 50 hp jump then it drops 25 hp)  Perhaps this is a bug and is related.<P><BR>***Suggestion***<P><BR>Increase the duration of enduring breath, levitate and invis songs.<P>Bard effects seem to be held client side, but they can not be refreshed unless the server grants the info.  When the server goes into a lag (server, not internet) the spell does not get refreshed and can wear off.<P>With these three spells, to have them wear off durring a server lag fit can have deadly results.  I have heard of one case where the lag lasted so long that a person with the bard drowned to death before the song could be refreshed.  Giveing extended duration to these spells might buy the player some time.  If the spell is incresed enough, perhaps the about to fall, about to breath again message might be allowed to come back as a warning.<P>And for the record, I you can tell that this is the server lagging due to the fact that timed spawns will often be off by the same time as the lag.  (if the lag lasts 30 seconds, a 20 minute spawn will spawn 20 minutes and 30 secs after it was last killed)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I love playing a bard, I have a few thoughts that I would like to be heard.<P>1.) Singing Steel Armor effects are ineffective and inefficient. I need to turn my song off in order to cast them, they real lvl 10 spells at the highest and most just don't make me any better of a player. Eye of Zoom? Nice party trick but it doesn't really help the group in anyway. Why not make our armor at least a low level GROUP buff or something to that effect. Since bards live to be grouped, this would make sense to me. Or, as Pistov recommended, design them more like the Breath of Harmony and make them an instant song. A Meleer's limitation is hit points, a caster's limitation is mana, and a bard's limitation is time. Being able to mix in a forth song would be an incredible improvement to our abilities. <BR>2.) If I'm grouped with a shaman or an enchanter, I feel pretty much useless because all of my buffs/debuffs are basically scaled down versions of what they have so having them in the group really hurts my usefullness other than a mana battery.<BR>3.) While the idea of Double attack brings a smile to my face, I would much rather prefer more hit points. 1300hps at level 52? Not exactly fair since a lvl 52 mob has at least 3 times that. Probably far more.<BR>4.) And almost as important as hit points, I am kindly requesting that bards get something more than dodge before lvl 53! Come on! I understand we are a hybrid class but let's see...give us just dodge and the hit points of a caster and the armor and the weapons of a meleer. The worst of both worlds. I don't think that is fair.<BR>5.) I remember a long time ago, when bards wore the same armor as warriors. The game was designed that way initially. We were a plate class and could have the same armor of a meleer but somewhere, we lost that role and now we just get beaten. Warriors have 3 times as many options for armor than we do, not saying they don't deserve it, I just want a fair shake at AC.<BR>6.) Songs having problems- this has been mentioned before but I just wanted to back the problems. The charm saying successful and then use /pet and it says I have no pet and then is says charm has worn off. Also the songs starting and stopping immediately after has been something that I have been running into a lot also. And songs not stopping so I can sing a different one is another problem that I have had happen to me somewhat frequently.<BR>7.) The flaws with the songs have been listed above in far more detail than I could list  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Thanks guys<BR>8.) The final thing that I am requested is a slight revamp of the Bard FA weapon. The white dragon scale is incredibly hard to get, especially after lvl 52. I went on 7 consecutive Vox raids, but lost the roll everytime to a caster that wanted it to make the cloak. I haven't even thought about Gore.... I am not asking for the mob to be easier, I am requesting that the quest be slightly altured to either give us a white dragon scale (bard only, not for cloak) or modify the quest to where we can make the mob pop like the clerics can with the big elemental. The red scale is considerably more abtainable with Ragefire spawning in Naggy's lair. I really don't think this is too much to ask.<BR>Thank you for asking for our opinions, and I hope that you get some needed information and you can help us be what we were designed for: being the favored group class.<P>Concerto G.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thank for taking the time to evaluate the bard.  I don't know if you will even get to this post, it took me three hours to get to the end of the thread, but I just had a couple of comments. <P>I am currently lvl 52 and feeling more and more "unwanted" or "unneeded".  Any of the higher lvl camps, Sebilis, Chardok, The hole, Howling Stones, etc.  pretty much require that an enchanter is present.  Once I group with an enchanter, the majority of my usefullness is dramatically decreased.  I no longer haste, I no longer crowd control (not that I'm very good at it compared to a chanter anyhow).  I don't deal damage at a lvl that really makes much of a difference in a group with warriors, and I refuse to just stand there and be a mana pump for everyone.  <P>My suggestions are geared toward making the bards more desirable in a group besides just for mana song.  <P>1.  If we can't get the damage increase with weapons, then at least lower the resistance rates we get when using instrument attacks.  I was in Chardok the other night and gave up on using weapons and pulled out my drums and started twisting my DOTs.  I am maxed on drum skill, and was fighting blues.  For a solid hour, I only had 3 mobs that I actually got 2 of the three songs to stick in a single twist.  If bard songs, when used with an instrument, resisted less then the melee issue would be less of an issue.  If bards are masters of the instrument, then let them gain the benefits of it and encourage more instrument usage.  If bards want to melee, the current melee dmg isn't great, but it is enough to get by. <P>2.  Stacking has been hashed, rehashed over and over.  I won't readdress that issue other than with the issue of one song that I didn't see addressed.  If you have made it so Root doesn't overwrite Snare any longer, then why can't you make it so Selos Consonant Chains doesn't overwrite snare.  Chains has a slow component that is nice, especially for mid lvl bards, as there aren't a lot of other songs they sing.  <P>3.  The lack of any kind of better mana recovery is REALLY annoying, especially after death.  I have been the primary "enchanter" in my guild for 15 levels.  I enjoy the challenge.  However, it is just not fair that if I should die, it takes an hour to get mana back, during which time we have no ability to use our only "higher lvl chanter skill" charm.  From lvl 45 on up, the only way a bard can realistically crowd control is through charm kiting.  Pixie strike fails way too much and we won't even discuss the effectiveness of our 15th lvl aoe mez.  I don't have a problem with the resists I get, I deal with them.  A bards AC helps make up for the difficulty in charming a Fire Giant.  I just want to be able to, for the duration of a raid, function as the "enchanter" without running out of mana.  One solution I may propose is one similar to the wizard "harvest" spell, either a song or ability that renders the bard unable to sing or be interrupted for a 30 second period of time during which they rapidly gain back mana.  It could be "recast" every 5 min or so.<P>3.  In looking at the game in general, you have generally tried to make sure that all classes have no hard monopoly on a spell or skill that would make them overly important..i.e.  SOW is avail to druids, rangers and shamans, MEZ is available to chanters, necros and to some degree bards, snare is avail to druids, sk's, and necros.  I think you get my point.  The only other class in the game that gets any rogue abilities is a bard.  Increasing lockpick and dodge, at the very least, would not unbalance things at all. <P>Thanks for your time,<P>Jess</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"3. Song instance creation at the same point that old instance fades erases both old and<BR>new instance of the song.

But I'll add it to the list.<BR>________________________<P>Actually this bug exist with all casters.  If you cast your spell in an attempt to rebuff, a rare matter of timing will cause both the old buff that is fading and the new buff that is casting to both dissappear.<P>It could be that bards notice it more since they "recast" or twist songs every few seconds.  Therefore, they get affected by the bug more often than anybody else.<P>As a magician, I get affected by LD's more than any other classs.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, here are some observations made by someone who has played a bard into the high lvl's and has played consistently for two years.  My bard is my primary and really my only character.<P>1) Seeing the idea that you want to take the werewolf lute out scared me so I am going to address it first.  There are several reasons this spell does not make us unbalanced.  First, the spell is self only.  Second, by the time any bard would get this spell, they would be well into their 50's, and by then Enchanters have a much better group werewolf spell which adds a much greater effect then their self only werewolf spell did--This would simply be a fun item to have, hardly threatening to the Enchanter population.<P>2)I absolutely love the changes you made to the lvl 53 mezmerize.  Thank you Verant.  However, please make it stack with enchanter mezmerize so that I can be a help in a group with an enchanter. I think most people would like to see Pixie strike work more effectively as well.  As far as lullaby or a new song like it, I do feel that a AE mez would make us unbalanced past the low lvls.  Mezmerize is the enchanter monopoly and the screaming from enchanters if we got something like this would be heard across norath and cause too many headaches to make it worth it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>3)Make our new, single target fear slow movement rather then increase it.  We dont get this spell untill lvl 55, and it is single target so it would make AE kiting an unlikelihood.  Making it slow the target would simply allow us to use different songs, such as our dots and cut down on the carpul tunnel syndrome we will all surely have.<P>4) Make Haste and slow stack.  You pointed out that the bard class was intended to be a group supplement.  Yet when you make our songs unstackable with other classes, you basically take away a lot of our effectiveness in group.  Being relegated to a mana battery, is not fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>5) Allow chains to have a set duration.  If for no other reason than that we can twist chains efectively when we have to be the group snare.  Often I cant play anything but snare when I do snare because the resists are so high, and the duration is just so random.  BTW this is my lvl 51 song.  Just make it last the full 12 twisting seconds.  I dont feel this would be unbalancing in any way, it would just make our song reliable..<P>6)Armor Class.  You stated that we are not necessarily a plate class, jsut that we have the ability to wear plate.  However, our taunt on mobs is incredible, up there with rangers and I dont have a taunt button.  Rangers have a higher base AC to kind of compensate for their taunt value, Bards get to wear plate armor.  If you are going to say we arent a plate wearing class, then please look at our taunt, because we have to have some way to surrvive.  <P>7) Hp's.  I feel that as a fighting, and battle armor class character, I should really have a few more Hp's than an enchanter.  I am not saying we should have ranger or even rogue HP's, but something more would be nice.  At the higher lvl's, a mob hitting for dual 100's (which they freqently do) can rip through my base Hp's in very little time.  I don't want to be a tank, but i would like to at least be able to stand a little longer than a caster.  I am after all considered a fighting class.<P>7) Bard's defense and offense are, pathetic.  We are called the jack of all trades.  You don't like to give other classes a class identifying skill, but when you designed bards, you made us a character which does exactly that.  I feel that perhaps perry and riposte at maybe 45 and 50 respectively would help to increase our defense.  Keep the cap at 75, because after all we arent tanks.  Either backstab or double attack around 45 would be nice as well, and again keep the cap low.  And probably only give us one or the other.<P>8) Mana.  I dont have a problem with us unable to use mana regen songs.  However, I think you should increase our meditate skill slightly, so that memorization of songs would take a lot less time, and we could regen mana at a slightly higher rate than we do now.  Our lvl 39 charm does take mana, and is utilized often by a bard smart enough to play crowd control.  Simply raising our meditate skill by 10 points would alleviate the mana woes.  <P>9)Bombastic Bellow is worthless.  I have used it once in the time since i got it (over a year ago) and that was simply to see my mana bar go down.  I think making it single target, 100 pt dmg, and 100 pt mana ( almost a full bubble for bards) with a recast time of about 1 min would make it a useful spell, and not out of line with the type of damage our dot's do around that lvl.<P>10)SS Armor.  Just like everyone else, I love the bracer and the gauntlets.  The other effects are silly.  Boots that summon water, ok thats fine, i can forage but sometimes water is scarce.  If you guys REALLY love this spell jsut make it summon 5 at a time.  A helm that summons an eye.  I have bind sight.  Perhaps a self only charisma buff, something a low lvl shaman or enchanter would have?  Vembrancers that regen stamina...hip hip...blah.  What about a low lvl self only buff for dexterity?  Greaves that are probably the second hardest item in the game to obtain pre velious and it summons food.  Can I contain my excitement?!?  Maybe a levitate spell instead?  Finally a BP that heals slower than my regen with a kleins lute.  How about simply a regen component.  Perhaps 8 hp's a tick.<P>11) Selos song of travel.  Take out the invis effect its annoying and it dosent do anything useful with the song.  In fact, if your seen by  a mob and hit the whole song cancells.  Just get rid of the invis part all together.<P>12) We have two songs that only work at specific times of day.  Lets be real, who on earth is concious of what time of day it is in game unless pulling in an outdoor zone?  Can that be changed so they just work like any other song or spell?  Also, curious to know if there are any other spells that work around the time of day?  <P>13) Our disciplines are silly.  The evade one os ok, but the one we get that makes our song work like we are using the best instrument.  Well at 55, most of us are so...  I dont really have a solution for this, i mean you guys tried to stay within the bard theme but, the discipline dosent really help us be a better class.<P>14) ok Finally, this is simply a wish but I would love for there to be some way that post 51, our songs had a longer duration, perhaps lasting 4 ticks instead of 3.  This would make us more effective in groups (especially if our songs stack!!! gotta throw that plug in).  Other classes have their key abilities improve.  A warrior's melee and tanking gets better, a wizards nukes get stronger, a clerics healing ability is made greater.  Well our songs are our innate ability...how about they improve a bit?<P>Well, thats all I can come up with right now, Hopefully it was coherent and valid.  Thanks for at least taking the time to do this Absor.<P>Shyelok Chanson<BR>Level 54 Minsterel<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok...<P>Please please don't remove the twist stuff that the bard has. Like someone else mentioned, this is what differs the good bard and the bad bard. Also it gives us something to go on for. If a system is made, that lets bards easily twist 3-4 songs, then the "Wow that was some twist" be lost forever. If everyone can twist, then it's no longer as valued. It would also make the work of a bard too easy. Especially if we were able to wield more than one instrument. Then I could for instance put the lute and the drum in each slot, set the auto-twist-thing on Chant of Battle, Hymn of Restoration and Purifying Rhythms, then go watch tv or something. Heh I even find it boring to twist three songs that either only use singing or the same instrument ;-)<P>Regarding the pain that so many are talking about... I have been playing the piano for years, also used computers since I was about 6 years old heh, and must admit I've *never* had any pain in my hands due to bard twisting. But I can understand that other people can find this difficult. My suggestion to this: to avoid that twisting does not become a thing everyone can do, let the stop and start work together. Now when we twist we start song 1, then stop song 1 by clicking any song, then starts song 2 and so on.. how about making a click both stop and start? So that we click song 1 starts, then click song 2 starts.. 12233112233 and so on, against 123123. This would make far less pressing of hot buttons but yet not making twisting overly easy. If the bard looses a note, then he will have to start over again just like today.<P>Also, melee... We are musicians, not fighters in my opinion. Giving bard better fighting abilities will just make yet another hybrid fighter, though with constant minor healing and clarity. I almost never use weapons anymore, only when I really really have to. I rather use instruments and twist three songs to help the group.<P>What we need is something that gives us more value to groups. We are a group-based class, and sacrifice quite a few things to become this way. But yet, from level 10 (below 10 it doesn't matter much except caster/melee) and up I've *always* had problems finding a group. People don't want bards because the value is not easily seen. I have more than once tried to let my group know what I am capable of, but either they say "Just keep the healing song going please", or just "Up to you, you're the expert :-)".<P>I also put my vote in for stackable slow/haste, I don't think one single bard would cry over such an enhancement.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Curufinn said:<BR>"I dont know how to go about this for bards, because all the good bards I talk to dont group, all the bad ones never get to 20th lvl.. "<P>A bard that doesn't group is not a good bard! Musicians doesn't play for themselves, but for others. And kiting is just plain silly. What fun is it to fight with no risk involved? You obviously consider a good player to be one who get to level 60 fastest possible. I think (and hope) that most people consider a good player one who is able to use the variations every hybrid class gives, and takes advantage of that.<P>Bards - In the history/tales, Bards/Minstrels are (in)famous for their ability to charm.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Erilin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor,<P>A couple brief points..<P>1) If a song has multiple components and can use an instrument to enhance its effects, please make it increase every effect (ie. catana of replenishment - increase hp AND mana regen when lute is equipped.....rousing rondo - increase damage shield, str, atk, AND haste when horn is equipped)<P>2) The effects on our armor are pretty useless save 1 possibly 2 pieces.  Im sure even you would admit that.  I understand that not every piece is supposed to have a great effect, but in comparison to the armor for the other classes the overall usefulness is pretty weak.  <P>If you want to put a song effect on our armor...take a look at how the Breath of Harmony is designed.  This has a useful, insta cast song, that u can add into your twist.<P>If you dont want to put something like that on our armor...please give us some type of buff, so we can cast it, then go about our business of twisting.  BTW, if u want to take the lute of the howler out of the game...a GREAT place to put illusion werewolf would be on our Plane of Growth BP.  This would make sense since it is an animal illustion (the shaman bear form spell and druid pet spell also drop in PoG) it would fit in with the whole scheme of the plane.<P>Ok, I promised I would be brief, so thats it )<P>Take care,<P>Polonious<P>Officer of Legacy of Steel<BR>Virtuoso of the Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hi there Absor, <BR>I and my roommates(2 of them)all have eq accounts.  We play a bard, shaman, and SK and swap characters when we play together on a regular basis.  Anyway, i would just like to put in a word of support for some of the suggestions put in.  First the nonstacking of haste from shamans and enchanters is a major hassle.  Second parry and riposte should really be given to bards at lower lvls if they are truelly defensive hybrids.  Although i would personally give up parry and riposte for double attack (double attack would really rock) these 2 skills are useless since a bard is definitly not the tank in a group.  Third since when should a bard not be able to outbuff a caster?  We have to be in a group to buff those individuals only for the duration of the song. Bard buffs should definitly be more powerful than any other because of this. This coming from the guy that usually plays the shaman.  Fourth a /swap command was brought up earlier awesome idea i see no reason not to implement it (reduce a little of that carpel tunnel).  50+ concerns really dont bother me as i will likely never reach those levels (grad school is taking up too much of my time *sigh*)  I know we wont get it but it never hurts to beg.  PLease Please Please double attack at like level 30 you can take away parry and riposte bye the time we get those we arent tanking anyway.  <P>Thank you Absor for your time, and good luck with the rest of the reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
