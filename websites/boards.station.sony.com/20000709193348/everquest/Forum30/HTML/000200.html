</FONT><HR>Hail all:<P>My characters name is Dakibus Spiritsong and I am a Bard of the 33rd Level.<P>I logged on tonight and search for a group in Cazic Thule.  I was finally accepted into a group of adventures (some I knew some I did not) that were keeping the Throne Room clean.  After all the socials were complete we went to work.  Over the sourse of the next few battles I learned that a few of my comrades had been there for well over two hours and doing quite well.<P>Well after about an 30 minutes someone asked who the doggie (druid in wolfie form) was sitting in the middle of the TR.  Well I went to ask him if we could help him.  I being a very social bard and also being the group list keeper and always interested in finding replacements spoke with him.  His name was Hantle and he conned red to me.  He said he was here before us and he wanted only the named spawns.  Well we said that we wanted to share cause many of us wanted some of these Lizzards and the loot they carried.  We had to rouges in our group that needed the Ravenscale.<P>We he didnt share with us so our leader petitioned.  A GM came and spoke with our leader then with the druid and then just left.  He never told us the outcome.  It later came out that he told the GM that he was there first and that he was sharing which was not true.<P>About 1 hour later I was tired of all the KSing.  And yes i consider it that.  Especially when I found out that Hantle was level 49 or 50.  I petitioned again cause he was not sharing also cause I had thought that if you could not get exp from a kill and that there were others there that could that you had to move along.<P>The GM came again and pulled us all into a corner including Hantle.  Regier The Mortis was the GMs name. (I think thats how he spelled it)  And turned around and said we must come to an agreement.  Then he said that it was HANTLE'S Camp and he should decide.  After some argueing hantle made this comment that blew my top.  "Why dont you stop bothering MY GM FRIENDS..."  Now there is not suppost to be favorism in the game but maybe I am wrong.  The GM said we had to work it out with Hantle not with him.  Then Hantle said forget it and that he would leave told all us "greenies" that he hopes to see us in the areana some day and the made rude gestures at us all and left.<P>I have never had a problem like this before,  And this is the first time I had a GM act this way before.  Lets just say it killed my playing mode.<P>I wish you all well and I hope that PLAY NICE actually work someday.<P>Be well and safe travels.<P>Thanks for listening to me rant!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Play nice is a joke. many high lvl quest require you to camp and kill green mobs (not the case here). Been KSed on a named spawn witch i was camping for hours and was green to me by a wizzie that could get exp of it and he puled that play nice joke on me. PN policy can only work for wery low lvls that go in to a fight over an orc camp but can never work on higher lvls. Specialy can not work on rare named spawns. Heh imagine the joke with 2 grups sharing lets say magi spawn or something like that. Frikin monster shows up every 5h or so and usualy drops a junk drop. Yea i realy wona play nice and share it and make my camp last 200h insted of just 100.<P>I could be wrong but thats how i see PN policy. The only good thing is that most of high lvls took it as i did good for newbies joke at high lvls</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I got called by a GM for fihgting in spec cave while a group of 6 was trying topull. They kept sayin was KSing them. Utter crap unless on accident and then never /t'd me to let me know i was on one of theres. GM came invis, watched, couldnt prove a damn thing said we had to work it out, i told him i have been /oocing everytime i pulled a spec fromthe cave so they would know what i was doing and thats all i need to do. They were not communicating with me. He left, group left, i slaughtered whole cave by myself cause im a 50th necro who does get xp from it (full xp anyway doesnt matter) but more importantly was helping a mid 30's out of hell levels by grouping with him. He in turn was getting experience fighting them for his solo career  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>That group of rude children used the Play nice policy against me when i was being polite! and communcicating my actions.<BR>Alls i have to say is if your farming items screw you get out! if your helping someone just share and talk, there plenty to go around.<P>I also had a xp with a 50th monk in CT who was doing the same thing as that druid. I petitioned him cause he told me to Get lost when i tried to pull past him and stole my kills. He then trained 4 mobs on us by FDing near our group. Real nice. His name was ShadowPunch on Tunare...if it was PVP my 50th level necro would have taken his HP away before he knew what happend..jerk.<P>I am more than happy to give items to higher level guys when playing for XP if they let me kill for them! sheesh try talking you KSing bastards if items is what you want give the XP to the little fish they will let you have the items for helping them out with pulls!<P>Only time i had a GM help me was at spec cave. I was like mid 40's and pulling from cave. A group had camped the first room. I asked them to move so i could safely pull past them. They didnt. they stole every specter i pulled..GM made them level...Now that was the Play Nice Policy at work for a good reason. These guys could have easily camped outside and let me pull but chose not to even though i was nice....i got to stop being nice no one ever listens!!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think it shows a lot of ignorance on the part of Verant to "Ordain" a play nice policy when the very design of Everquest pits players against eachother. For one, I can't think of another role playing game that was more dependent on items, most character classes in this game are utterly defenseless against most mobs without their nice gear. And in order to get that nice gear you have to camp ONE mob for hours and even then he might not have what you were looking for. I think it's clear that the camping isn't going to stop, and it's understandable how frustrating it can be to want something that you can never get because it's always being camped, especially if you're a melee class competing with blasters who can do more damage in one cast than you can do the whole fight. In that respect which is a clear design decision by Verant you can see how animosity would build between two players, in many ways these design choices are pulling people apart more than bringing them together and it's damned irresponsible of verant to have let it go on his long. The only clear solution is to randomize the spawns and the drops somehow, so that everyone has an equal chance of finding that great item in their travels. This is an idea which actually encourages travel, instead of encouraging people to sit on their butts for hours on end which they're going to do no matter how long Verant nerfs the item spawns. I mean, wouldn't it be nice to be surprised by something instead of laboring for hours camping a spawn you know will eventually have what you were looking for? And if you should happen across a lore item you already have one of, then to someone else's utter delight, you could leave it on the body and auction it's location. Verant's answer to camping has been to remove items from a particular spawn and break up the camping in the form of a quest. J boots being an example, well if you've ever done the quest you know the camping part hasn't changed, it's become 3 times worse! Since now you have to compete with countless others for the Ring of the ancients and camp the cyclops, then you have to camp the Shadowed Rapier, then you have to Camp Hasten Bootstrutter who, due to a bug that Verant seems very reluctant to fix, may not spawn for days. And of course if you fail to see him and log off you have to camp that Rapier all over again. I know I speak for a lot of people when I say that I'm looking warily forward to the Kunark expansion, when Verant will show us how they've dealt with some of their fundamental flaws the second time around. I know that as this program stands, I certainly wouldn't invest in another Verant program. The subtle design errors and lack of foresite that I've mentioned here is pretty unforgiveable in light of what other software developers have achieved, and I expect just a little better for my money.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Verant's problem is that they aren't making enough money. With only $2 million per month coming in, they can't afford to spend $30,000 to add another 10 servers and reduce the overcrowding.<P>Yeah, right.<P>Figure it out, people.  Verant is pulling in $24 million per year from monthly fees alone (this doesn't take into account royalties on CD sales with the initial program at all).  Now, assume only 1,000 players per server, and assume a paid full-time staff of 4 "GMs" (aka "admins") per server, to give 24/7 coverage.  Assume each GM is paid $60K/yr.<P>Staff expenses: $480,000/year (always double salary to find personnel expense due to benefits, taxes, etc.)<BR>Hardware expenses: $10,000 will buy 3 reasonable servers (one primary, 2 backups). Let's assume $100,000/year just to be safe.<BR>Network expenses: A full T-1 is between $1,500 and $3,000 per month.  We'll assume $3,000, which is $36,000/year.<P>So, annual expense directly related to the server operation is $616,000.  Player subscription fees (at a rate of 1,000 players per server) total $117,600/year.  Obviously Verant isn't going to do that.<P>Now let's look at how it really seems to us players:<P>Verant loads the servers up to 2,000 players each; assigns one GM per 5 servers and has them on only 40 hours per week (and probably pays less than $40k/year), and spends probably $3,000 per year on hardware.  The T-1 is still $36,000 annually.<P>That's $235,200 income per year per server versus expenses of $55,000 annually.<P>The turth is probably somewhere in between.  However, it's obvioust that Verant's "vision" has nothing whatsoever to do with RPG, and everything to do with maximizing profits.<P>No wonder they don't want anyone to write an emulator! Imagine what would happen to their obscene incomes if every "old time RPG DM" could run his own server for a few close friends, who didn't have to pay Verant any more.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Never heard of Hantle but PnP are ajoke on named mobs since they are so rare. You should have petition'd and reported him for saying he had GM friends, that is a suspendable offense. <P>Everytime I've had a run in with PnP the GM's always say we must share. The players have to work it out among themselves. I have also heard on other servers that people can get blacklisted for invoking the PnP which is out right crap IMO<P>Poppa, your figures are way off. Since each server is a collection of machines, your price should be like $50,000-$75,000. You don't think that they run 70+ zones on one machine do you? Don't forget all the other expenses, like power, building rent, server rack space, Dev team, etc... People always claim Verant is pulling in $2 million a month but I serious doubt that they make much more than $100k in profit after all the expenses probably much less than that</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
