</FONT><HR>I am the guild leader of the Sentinels of Chaos on the Tribunal server and I wish to submit a formal complaint on the way GM “Cattiky” handled a petition against a member in  my guild (Neridine). The player who originally filed the petition is named Pirate.<P>What resulted is a warning being placed on Neridine’s account. I feel this action was uncalled for and frivolous. Further, they way other guild members in the zone were treated was also unwarranted. According to Cattiky, only Neridine and myself were involved, yet she chose to make all members of the guild in the area leave. Additionally there was another guild present with us and nothing was said to them regarding this matter although we had been fighting together in that dungeon for more than 3 hours.<P>I have enclosed an edited (emotes. personal conversation, and other non essential data was removed) log of what occurred just after the alleged incident had occurred as well as the conversation with GM Cattiky:<P>(Section 1)<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:11:30 2000] Neridine tells the guild, 'bastard reported me for stealing his Ice goblin'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:11:49 2000] Neridine tells the guild, 'Cattiky is *****in at me over an ICE GOBLIN!'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:11:58 2000] Neridine apologizes to Pirate whole-heartedly.<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:07 2000] Neridine says, 'I am SOOOO sorry I stole your Ice GOblin'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:11 2000] Pirate says, 'just stop KS and everything is fine'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:23 2000] Neridine says, 'I know that ice goblin was so much EXP and loot to overcome'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:26 2000] You say, 'foolish barbarian...'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:31 2000] Neridine makes a rude gesture at Pirate.<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:34 2000] Pirate says, 'is not about exp, is about justice'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:41 2000] Pirate says, 'you guys train and KOS'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:50 2000] Animaetrix says, 'what about sympathy Pirate?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:50 2000] Neridine says, 'interesting'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:52 2000] You say, 'justice eh?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:56 2000] You say, 'you want justice?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:12:58 2000] Animaetrix says, 'Your entire guild didnt just bite the dust'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:13:02 2000] You say, 'we can give you justice'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:13:11 2000] Pirate says, 'how ?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:13:24 2000] You say, 'wait

'Not worth it'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:14:17 2000] Cattiky shouts, 'Attention this is Guide Cattiky speaking i will ask all people of Sentinels of chaos to leave the place at once'<BR>(Section 3)<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:14:18 2000] Neridine tells the guild, 'Grrrr...'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:14:44 2000] You shout, 'Why?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:14:57 2000] Neridine tells the guild, 'because Pirate is a coward'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:15:17 2000] You shout, 'you are a coward Pirate, we shall all meet again under more favorable circumstances...'<BR>(Section 4)<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:15:49 2000] Neridine tells the guild, 'she

Cattiky'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:18:05 2000] You say to your guild, 'I am'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:18:16 2000] Lanadwen says, 'Are you talking to this guide?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:18:20 2000] You say, 'yes'<BR>[Sat

area, i dont want you in there'<BR>(Section 6)<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:20:20 2000] Neridine says, 'I am going to go threaten him to a DUEL!'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:20:29 2000] Neridine says, 'he shall die for putting a warning on my account!!!!'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:20:42 2000] Lanadwen says, 'On all your accounts?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:20:49 2000] Neridine says, 'not sure...but on mine for sure'<BR>[Sat Sep 16

2000] You told Cattiky, 'well thank you for that...but I still don't appeciate you telling us to leave like that...you never even asked us our side of the stroy'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:24:15 2000] Diefaust says, 'Just because he wants to PL his little friend, pah...'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:24:43 2000] Blutrache says, 'we got whooped big time and he complains about ONE FRIGGIN GOB'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:24:48

fair that he has a warning..'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:30:52 2000] Cattiky tells you, 'why not?'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:31:56 2000] You told Cattiky, 'everyone in the zone was clearing trains...he gained nothing from killing that gob...he was not trying to steal their kills, they could not handle the trains as it was...we were keeping the area clear...what do we have to gain from taking '<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:32:29 2000] You told Cattiky, 'from taking those low level mobs...nothing'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:32:52 2000] You say, 'bah!'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:32:59 2000] You say, 'I am through with this childishness'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:33:06 2000] Cattiky tells you, 'is friend was getting exp, there was 1 monster only and he killed it'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:33:59 2000] You told Cattiky, 'sigh...okay...you win...you saw it all...there is no source to my outrage for your handling of this...'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:34:14 2000] You are now roleplaying.<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:34:27 2000] Cattiky tells you, 'what can you had more, it was plain KS, it was meant to be'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:34:46 2000] Cattiky tells you, 'he was warned about this then he been rude to the player...that didnt help'<BR>[Sat Sep 16 15:35:10 2000] You told Cattiky, 'hehe okay...there is nothing else to say to you...how long does that stay on his account'<P>Prior to the alleged incident, two parties lost their lives and we were in the middle of corpse retrieval (CR). Several times during the CR, inadvertent trains were caused by one of our members. The train was brought to the zone and was dealt with by members of both parties. This happened again twice and the player named Pirate complained to our members about the train. Animaetrix then shouted that we would be continuing our CR and that more trains were likely. Neridine was accused of calling a false train (Section 6), although I saw the incident. Only one mob followed him and was quickly dispatched. Animaetrix again called that another train was heading to the zone and the mobs were quickly dispatched. During that time, Neridine did not notice that Pirate and his friend pulled the single mob he was attacking. Apparently that is when the GM chose to make herself known and ask every one of our members in the zone to leave (Section 2).<P>Your rules of GM conduct state the following: “Guides gather all of the information on ALL parties involved. They get the character name, race, level, and account name of both the accusers and the accused, as well as the zone and situation and document it.” Yet this never occurred. She witnessed an act and made her decision. Then proceeded to blanket accuse all in the zone of the same transgression by asking them to leave. As I was leaving I cursed Pirate, in character, but the GM chose to see it differently. Never once did she ask me what the situation was, she instead insisted on making the entire matter worse by treating all poorly and threatening me with a warning on my account.<P>Your play nice rules on kill stealing state the following: “You may not steal kills. Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission. The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy.”<P>There was one alleged incident that Cattiky mentioned (Section 8) . She did not continually witness this happening, nor did she care to find out if it was done on purpose.<P>Your play nice rules on Zone Disruption state the following: “You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area. Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes things such as:<P>Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area. <BR>Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past. <BR>Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. Making excessive and inappropriate use of zone-wide communications (/shout, /ooc, /auction).”<P>Our guild was not guilty of this rule either and there was no mention of it by GM Cattiky, however being forced to leave punished the guild members in the zone. Again, the actions of GM Cattiky were based on one single incident, which I will argue, was not purposely intended. However she had made up her mind that it was purposely done despite having no evidence of such (Section 8) . GM Cattiky accused the “guild” as being contributors (Section 5), yet she presented no evidence or verbal reasoning to back it up. In fact, she addressed only Neridine and myself. After alleged incident takes place, you can see even though Neridine apologized for what was done, Pirate remained argumentative (Section 1).<P><BR>Your play nice rules state: “"Roleplaying" does not grant license to violate these rules. <BR>Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of "Role-play" will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) allowed to "Train" a guard onto an enemy in protection of your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed to steal someone's corpse under the guise of role-playing a thief. By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just cannot allow that role-play to be done at another's out-of-game expense.”<P>My alleged threat (Section 3 and 6) did not in any way harm, or by means of being said, causes any harm, personal loss (real or otherwise), to player Pirate. It was a curse said to the player in character. In fact, I made a comment (Section 1) referring to his character race, which cannot be misinterpreted as anything else but in character. But according to your GM Cattiky, roleplaying can only considered valid if the roleplaying flag is present (Section 7). It is not stated in your play nice rules though, and I consider her claim to such erroneous. GM Cattiky stated (Section 5) that the guild threatened a player. The guild did not. Never at any time was anyone else involved in the matter other than Neridine and myself.<P>It is my opinion that this incident was handled poorly. Two full parties sitting at a zone entrance recovering from the effects of a revive; causing inadvertent trains from the CR; dealing with said trains; and one character who did not notice in the commotion, that the mob he was attacking belonged to another player, does not constitute and entire guild being guilty of kill stealing. Nor does this one, non-purposeful act of a single player (Neridine) constitute a warning being placed on his account. He was not doing it on purpose. The GM did not bother to find out this fact, nor did she care to listen to reason. Instead GM Cattiky chose to react to what she perceived as a “bully” guild stealing kills from a lower level player, regardless of the fact that is was not in their interest to do so. Nor was there any purposeful participation on behalf of the guild, however, all which were present were submitted to the indignity of being told to leave. There is simply no logic to the outcome of this petition and I am angered that the essential job of providing assistance to players from a GM is being handled in such a fashion. We are, after all, your customers too and we do not appreciate being treated, as we were this day.<P>I petition that this warning be stricken from Neridine’s account. It was not issued fairly and he was not given a chance to explain the situation. I can produce the testimony of all who were there who will swear that his intentions were not as stated.

</FONT><HR>When accusations of kill stealing and training are flying, comments are typically made out of character. It's not really reasonable to expect someone to automatically recognize your abrupt decision to switch from ooc to roleplaying(assuming that was genuinely your intent), particularly when the first "in character" comment out of your mouth is threatening in nature. To be clear, the old "I'll be back" line, especially with an implied "with something you won't like" IS a threat. It does sound like you stepped a bit across the line here.<P>Further, it's been said that GMs have the ability to observe events invisibly. It's likely that Catikky witnessed more of the circumstances than you realize. Bear in mind that the same events can appear totally different from alternate perspectives.<P>With all that out of the way, it isn't difficult to have some sympathy for your plight. Being stuck with the aggravation of a mass corpse retrieval while under fire would definitely make me a little curt, and I know I'd appreciate some understanding.<P>There's not much to be done about it at this point except learn and move on. If you didn't actually make it clear to the whole zone that you were engaged in CR and might accidentally pull trains or be forced to kill mobs that were attacking defenseless group members, I'd recommend publicizing those facts via shouts or oocs. Generally people are more willing to be accommodating when they have some details of the situation ahead of time. Ditching the sarcasm and being forthright can help your case a lot.<P>Good luck to you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Riggen,<P>Thanks for your comments, however I will say that my comments were made in character. The threats were not made to me personally and I was not upset with this character for that reason. <P>I am fully aware that the GM's "hide" and observe which is why this whole thing is puzzling. Her interpretation of what went on was wrong (in my opinion) and she should have gathered more facts before ordering my guild out of the zone.<P>Bottom line, killing one mob by accident is not kill stealing. The key word being "accident". This warning needs to be removed from the account. In my opinion, a verbal warning should have been issued and Neridine should have been asked to leave the zone. While that would have still been harsh given the circumstances, it would have been understandable. And we as a guild would have most likely left with him. To handle it the way she did is unexcusable.<P>Verant still has not contacted me about this.<P>Grixx Bonesnapper<BR>Sentinels of Chaos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
