</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;For example, the 10 things you have to do could be made so that they have to be done in a certain order, not just randomly do part 8, then part 4, then part 7 etc...<P>Doesn't change it though.  You still end up with an assembly line.  A goes to camp B.  You now get a new A.  B moves on to C.  A moves to B, new A.  The max that the quest could be completed is the spawn time of its longest component.  With an item like J-boots, if it was 20 1-hour camps, everyone would do it.  Everyone.  Because the time commitment wouldn't be there to discourage.<P>Is it fair to casuals?  Not really.  Are there solutions?  Sure, but all have problems of their own.  <P>Having the AC spawn anywhere (as in any zone) is one.  However, this does remove the "questing" from the quest.  Instead of you doing a quest, you now rely upon luck.  Basically, instead of going out to get the parts so you can complete the quest, you get the parts and then decide to complete the quest to get the loot.  It's a subtle difference, but there.  Think about the warrior that goes to permafrost to get his crafted... as opposed to a ranger that happens to be hunting in perma that gets the quest comp and just decides to complete it.  The one is a goal, the goal of the quest.  The other is just something that happens.  Perfectly acceptable for some items, but not so for others.<P>Having the results be subpar (compared to the best item of that type) is another.  If you can get an item that is better with some camping, that is what those with bigger time commitments will go for.  This works for quite a few quests, like langseax and short sword of morin.  Both are weapons regularly weilded by more casual warriors/rangers.<P>A third option is to offer both a camp and a quest.  For instance, if you could camp the SMR or get lucky with 5 random drop items from 5 different zones... well, then the casual player could eventually end up with an SMR just due to hunting in those zones.<P>But when they want to limit the number of items that enter the game, it'll be reduced down to a simple thing like the AC.  1 element is easier to control.  And as for casuals not having a shot, considering the SRO AC is considered free-for-all, you've got the exact same chance as anyone else in the zone.  Just because you have to do it 2 hours per night as opposed to them doing it in 8 hour stints, the end chance is pretty much the same.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In a free-for-all atmosphere, melee's often don't stand a chance, which is another by-product of the way many quests are setup.<P>I guess what gets my goat the most was the arrogant attitude that was taken by Abashi about this, not that I'm surprised, and since its not a surprise, I suppose I shouldn't have taken so much offence.<P>There is SOME way to do these things so that BOTH camps are happy, one group because items are only getting into the game at a certain rate, and the other group, because the time chunks required are small enough to be accomplished by a casual player.<P>What I think needs to be changed first is the mentality that an item should only enter the game at a certain rate.  Say, 5 of the items a day, and instead, the focus should be on how long a player spends on a quest, 20 hours, 25 hours, etc...<P>You might end up with an assembly line, but so what?  Its still 20 hours (or however long) of that persons time to do the quest.<P>Rotgut<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey, its not our job to figure out how to make this work. It's VI's job. I bet if you gave me a week to just think about this problem, I had nothing else to do, and got paid, I could solve the problem very well. Isn't that YOUR JOB???<P>*sigh* Guess its up to the players to make your game work. Not that I'm surprised. Just a little dissapointed.<P>How about this? (note: many things changed from what they are really like in actual quest, some names have been 'borrowed' from other sources *cough* *cough*) (another note: I designed this to be started at lower levels and worked on as the player gains levels. I truly like those types of quests)<P>============<BR>For J-boots<BR>============<P>1) Hail Hasten, a gnome who is running very fast in  South Karanas, a very large zone. He tells you that he has discovered a secret of speed, but doesn't quite trust you. He says he will reveal some of his secrets to you, if you kill a minotaur around his homeland and bring proof.<P>2) Go to Ak'anon and the mino caves and either kill a few minos and get a horn or something or buy one off of people already there. (This quest can even be started at levels where you would get xp there, as a bonus.)<P>3) Giving him any loot from the mino caves that are only found there (horns being common, but axes also working, etc), he tells you that he has devised a way to imbue boots with the power to make you run faster. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the skills necessary to craft them, only the knowlege of what to do, and he's not willing to give you the recipee for money alone. Enter quest 2.<P>4) He is in debt to a man from High Pass Hold. Being too scared to got there himself, he asks you to do it for him. (I use high pass because it is a fairly neutral town, and I think everyone can get faction up with the people there. If not, maybe Freeport would be a better place. I've never played an evil race, so I'm not sure about this. But, you get the idea.) Immidiately bringing up Hasten's name might not be a good idea, so he says it would be a good idea to give him a few drinks first. He likes _____ (brewery skill needed here). After getting him drunk, bring up the debt Hasten has and give him a note and this 'gold bar' (different from bought kind), oops, Hasten seems to have lost it, I wonder if some RANDOM NPC might have picked it up somewhere in South Karana. hmmm<P>5) Kill in South Karana (which is good from about level 17 to 34 or so actually) and eventually you will get a 'gold bar'. Once you have it, bring it and the note to Highpass, give him the drinks, then give him the note and gold bar. He reads the note, and makes a reply note, telling Hasten he is off the hook... for now... but don't come back to his establishment for a while.<P>6) Bring the note back to Hasten. He is very grateful, and gives you the recepie for the J-boots. He says that a tailor is needed to craft many of the items together, and it is fairly hard.<P>7) Reading the ingredients, you find that you need (all in [] in case further information is needed): skin of a shaman, fur of a werewolf, high quality wolf pelt, pure water, a crushed gem, and enchanted nails.<P>8) Fur of a werewolf and wolf pelt are fairly straight forward<P>9) Shaman in EQ can be good or evil, as I recall. Frogloks may be hunted for such skin, or kobolds, or barbarians for that matter. A new item that is a rare drop off of all shamen in the game would be created. This would mean that areas would have to be hunted where shaman NPCs exsist, no camping, yet still questing.<P>10) Pure water is a bit ambiguous. He refers you to a person who might know where such water is. This could lead to another sub quest altogether or maybe branching out into multiple quests with multiple xp gains and multiple rewards.<P>11) A crushed gem. This could be any gem, and the speed of the boots would be determined by the rarity/quality of the gem. For example, a ruby could be used, but that esscense emerald is going to be faster.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Not by too much, but enough so that some might want to go the gusto (This could be used as a device that limits how often they come into the world, since many people will wait out until they can get that rare dropped gem or esscese emerald *yikes*, but it isn't necessary.)<P>12) Enchanted nails? Well, you have to put it together somehow. Not hard, just a type of metal enchanted and the smithing skill used to make them into nails. The speed of the boots would also be determined by this, as well as the gem's quality.<P>13) Once all the ingredients are collected, the person has to tailor the boots from the assembled collection. Woe be to the person who misses their role.<P>WHAT DOES THIS HAVE GOING FOR IT?<P>It can be completed over an adventuring career. I personally like quests that start when you are in the teens and end in the 30s, but they are few and far between. Ever heard of the Gator Smash Maul. VERY good ogre quest item that is FUN to get that follows this over time procedure. (my brother did it with no spoiler info, and had a great time). If there were many more quests like this, then we could spend much more time questing working on multiple quests at once and adventuring at the same time.<P>Time. Time. Time. This quest takes time. BUT, doesn't involve any camping. First off there are the minos. I did this so that people would do some traveling at low levels (when people actually love to travel around) and find new places to hunt. Two or three level 17s can have a great time in the mino caves. South Karana rare drop of a gold bar. Since S. Karana has such a very large level range, I thought it would be a good place to put the drop. You could spend a long time there, fighting many things and as long as it wasn't *too* rare, have fun while waiting so see it. (That's why I put Hasten in South Karana.) Of course S. K. is already packed so maybe there would be a better place. Maybe it could be found in Runnyeye also, or any Karana for that matter. Lastly, the shaman skin. Since there are many shamen MOBs in the game in multiple areas, this just means you have to hang out in those areas a while. Since you would probibly be there anyway, this is no big deal, I think.<BR>Because all these things are looted and on drop tables, they can be dropped according to that. IE instead of camping one rare spawn, you are fighting in a general area. The skin may only drop once every 10 hours still, but it doesn't matter, because you arn't there *just* for the skin. You are also making xp and other loot!!!<P>TRADE SKILLS!! This is an important part of my quest. The player has to spend time working up trade skills. Not too high, though. For example, for this, tailoring would have to be high, but smithing (for nails) and brewery (for the beers) wouldn't have to be very high. Of course you can always get others to make it for you, but I'd be sure they were someone I trusted, and don't forget J-boots are no drop, so you have to work tailoring up in any case.<BR>I would like to see trade sills worked on and encorporated into more quests, so that you wouldn't be getting tailoring (for example) up for just one particular quest, but for a broad range of quests, making trade skills more important, and not merely for 'flavor'.<P>End result? Better not fail the attempt. This is another way to keep them from appearing too fast. Some people will just be unlucky. But, you know what? Its not the end of the world. The items don't involve one long camp, so you can work over a few weeks and get everything back for another attempt (after getting your tailoring skill up).<BR>note: I am in support of certain items not being missable if it is trivial (or whatever it is now); this for one<P>Came up with that one on the fly (well I do have many years of DMing experience to my name...). You'd think Verant could do many many quests that are fun to do and that can be done as you level.<P>Camping is not needed. Quests should be able to be done without long camps. I have proved it. Is my quest perfect. NO WAY. Is it better than the current J-boots quest? I think so.<P>Comments?<P>-Thain Champion of Kaladim<BR>of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The items don't involve one long camp, so you can work over a few weeks and get everything back for another attempt (after getting your tailoring skill up).<BR>note: I am in support of certain items not being missable if it is trivial (or whatever it is now); this for one<P>Came up with that one on the fly (well I do have many years of DMing experience to my name...). You'd think Verant could do many many quests that are fun to do and that can be done as you level.<P>Camping is not needed. Quests should be able to be done without long camps. I have proved it. Is my quest perfect. NO WAY. Is it better than the current J-boots quest? I think so.<P>Comments?<P>-Thain Champion of Kaladim<BR>of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Total randomizing isn't the answer because (as someone else pointed out) a quest involves: Finding monster A, defeating Monster A, getting item B from Monster A (which may be the prize)/or returning item B to NPC C to gain the prize.<P>For "roleplaying" purposes, Quests and quest monsters need to be there.<P>However, the need to "limit" how often something comes into the world is a poor design that punishes the players for playing.<P>This broken philosophy is what has led to "rare" spawns that "rarely" drop the "rare" item needed to complete a quest.<P>The Glacier Bear, or Grimrot, Bilge Farfathom, for instance are all symptoms of this incredibly broken notion.<P>Let me remake the JBoots "quest," in order to make it a (1) "workable" quest that rewards the player for undertaking the quest, (2)allows the player to make progress on the quest in his limited amount of "casual player" hours, (3) reduces Twinking and (4) negates camping.<P>Hasten Bootstrutter, who roams around Rathe Mountains gives the quest information.  He says that he needs 2 items to make the boots.  (1) 3250 gold pieces (2) Magically endowed leather.  To help, he gives an "Idol of Wolves."<P>Now, remember the boneheaded Vox/Naggy cap?  No one over a certain level can attack now?  That means the means is in place to check player level.  Hasten, when asked about the boots, says: "The Journeyman boots are only for those brave enough to travel the land and obtain the items.  If ye do not have yer surname, you be not able to wear the boots!"<P>If they already have boots (or the Idol, or the Essence of Wolf), then he says "Bah! Ye have a pair!  Be not wasting my time!"  And he does NOT give them his assistance, or the Idol.<P>I didn't get my Jboots from Drelzna until I was 29th level.  So a 20th level minimum on obtaining the Jboots is not bad.  Whatever the minimum might be is irrelevant.  The point is that by building such a restriction -- twinking is eliminated.  By refusing to help them if they *have* boots, the Idol or the Essence, means that they can't get a powerful person to go get the items for them, nor can that person go get them for one of his alts.  Again -- twinking is defeated. <P>To make the magic leather, the player must go to a magician guild and buy a "Combine Kit", he then puts in the kit (1)A Shadowed Rapier (2)The Ring of the Ancients (3)A High Quality Lion Pelt (4)an Essence of Wolf Potion.<P>The Combine Kit, key, and all the items needed are, of course, Lore and No-Drop.  The Magically Endowed Leather is too.  This means (1)no twinking (2) the character *must be on hand during the battle* to get the items.<P>Here are some ways, when hunting for the items, to have the items always be available, without stupid camping or ultra-rare spawn / ultra-rare drops.<P>(1) Shadow Rapier.  This is mini-camp, just like now.  But, you see, there are about a dozen Shadowmen camps throughout Norrath.  So you spend some time there and eventually you'll get your rapier.  Of course, the problem with it being no-rent etc., remains, but that's ok<P>(2) High Quality Lion Pelt.  Well, this comes from lions in the Karanas.  About level 20 is when people start exploring in Karanas, so that's ok.  A little nerve-wracking, but not too bad.  And it introduces the young character to the Aviak house and Paw.  The lions roam around and are constantly being spawned.  Since the lions are constant, it's OK to have the High Quality be a semi-rare drop.  Few players will complain that they have to run around hunting, chasing, killing monsters if they know that eventually they'll get what they need.  We *DO* complain when we sit on our asses for 45 minutes at one spot...kill a stupid placeholder...sit for 45 minutes...kill a placeholder...sit for 45 minutes...kill the mob but find something OTHER than what we're after...sit for 45 minutes...kill a placeholder.<P>(3) Essense of Wolf.  This comes from the wolf pit in Najena.  The player must fight his way to the pit which is in the back where the goblins and stuff are.  There will be many battles with the elementals, guards, goblins, and spiders as he works his way to the spot.  Most likely, he'll need a party to help him---but if he's high enough *HE ISN'T FORCED INTO A PARTY* by the Vision (tm).  The party descends into "The Pit" where they are confronted with an altar.  Using the Idol, that they click on the door which teleports them (much like the TP pads in Sky or Howling Stones to a "mini dungeon" within the same zone.  Again, because they must have the Idol to get in, and because it's a Teleport and not a door, no high level can come in and help or KS them.<P>  Here, they may have to defeat a few more monsters (or not).  When they are finished, the see a statue or gargoyle (neutral faction...it's merely a prop NPC).  They give him the Idol, he gives them the Essence of Wolf.<P>There is a teleport pad (ala Howling Stones) that they step out to be teleported out of The Pit or Najena entirely.  Once someone steps on the pad, however, the room instantly repops.  So if a group is working together, they'd better all have their Essence of Wolf and they'd all better hit the pad and get out....or fight the wolves again.<P>Of course, the Idol is "soul-bound" like the keys to Sebilis or Charsis, so if they do die, they're not locked away from their bodies.  Because they gave the Idol to the gargoyle -- *THEY CAN'T GO BACK for potential twinking.<P>Furthermore, because the room repops when they leave means that someone WILL have to fight again to get to the Gargoyle.  The room can't be "held" clear because as soon as someone leaves, the room repops.  There will be fighting going on.  Most likely a group "on deck" will set up lines of communication with a group "going in."  When the first group zones out, they'll likely be asked to send a TELL letting the 2nd group know.  The 2nd group TP's in..and the fight is on!<P>The beauty of this, you see, is that they don't sit down and wait for something to appear, only to be disappointed.  They fight to the spot, they fight the guards -- THEN THEY GET THE PRIZE AND MOVE ON!<P>(4)Ring of the Ancients.  What a great idea to have it come from the Ancient Cyclops.  Really it was.  What a great idea to have the Cyclops spawn in different zones.  Really it was.  What *STUPID* idea to make people have to wait 20+ hours to hope to see him!  Really, it was.  Solution?  Look above.  Either put him somewhere and make him always there and always with the Ring--but guarded(like the gargoyle for the Essence), make him always up with the Ring (even if in different zones), make him frequently up but only occasionally with the Ring (like lion hide)<P>Finally, it's all done.  They've gone to the Mage guild and bought the Combine Kit.  They've gathered all four items, they hit the Combine button and presto!  They have Magical Leather.  Now they go to the Bank, get their gold pieces.<P>Now the player lugs the new gold and the Magic Leather back to Rathe Mountains, hunts down Hasten (who is *always* up)...(unless you want him to say "Bother me not at night." and despawn him at night when you spawn the undead in Kithicor).  Once they find him, he turns in the items to Hasten and...they get Journeyman boots!<P>Now it is possible that someone without boots might do all the quest stuff and turn in the Magic Leather while letting the other fellow just turn in gold.  This is not *great* but it's ok.  Most likely, however, this won't happen because (a) the high level probably has boots of his own..so can't and (b)the quest is a LOT OF WORK to do for a reward that you're just going to give to someone else.<P><BR>But look at what has been accomplished.  The quest is long and not exactly easy.  All the components are available at all times...just not simple to get in hand.  Twinking is gone.  EverCamping is gone.  More importantly, the "casual" player, who only has an hour or two a night can log on and *MAKE PROGRESS* toward the goal.  He may not get the entire thing from start to finish.  He may not get half of them. He may not even get ONE of them.  but he can end his session having made some progress in the quest instead of another "EverCamp the NeverSpawn" that is the norm now.  Some things he can do solo..some things he does with a group.  Because the quest is so long the Boots won't "flood" the world....but if they do *SO WHAT*?  It's one set of boots per peson and not transferrable.<P>----------------------------------<BR>Want another example?  Here's how you can put decent Class-specific armor in the game, still prevent twinking, camping, waiting.<P>Since I play a Cleric, this will be done from his perspective.  With a bit of imagination (a challenge on your end, I know), it can be done similarly for all classes.<P>By battling, etc., etc. we finally come up with a set of bronze armor in our single-digit levels.  As we hit our teens, we're given "quests" by our guilds.  If we bring a bronze armor item, a regular iron weapon (not rusty and not Fine Steel), and Cistern Asp skin, it can be crafted into ... Steel Armor!  Better AC for our upcoming battles. (Verant..Clue:  New armor should prepare us and offer protection for our "upcoming" fights...not finally be adequate for fights we did 10 levels ago!)<P>So we have our Steel armor.  When we hit 20 or so (but not before...our guild master deems us "unproven" yet) We can turn in our Steel item, a Fine Steel weapon, and an Aviak Charm and we can get "Fine Steel" Armor.  Better AC..maybe a stat boost!<P>About 30's we're told we can trade in our Fine Steel, a number of Rubies, and "a certain item" and we can get "Rubicite Armor".  The "certain item" would vary depending on the armor item and is what gives each item a particular boost.  A beholder lens, for instance, with a ruby and a helm, would give a Rubicite Helm with a WIS bonus.  etc., etc.<P>At 40, we are sent to the Temple of Ro.  There we learn that by collecting the Icons and Idols, and by turning them in *with* the right Rubicite piece, we get the appropriate Gold armor..with BETTER STATS THAT WHAT CAME BEFORE!!<P>At 46, we can hit the planes.  There, instead of getting the armor like we do now, we get a "Gem of Innoruuk" or some such.  By combining them with our Gold Armor, we get the corresponding Etheral Mist piece WITH BETTER STATS THAT WHAT CAME BEFORE!!<P>We hit 50's and it's time for Donal's.  (Donal's..great AC, but piss-poor stats.  Fire whoever dreamed that up!).  Again, by collecting the right items from the mobs, we can trade in our Etheral Mist for Donal's Armor of Mourning WITH BETTER STATS THAN WHAT CAME BEFORE!!<P>Post 50's: We take the Donal's and upgrade it again.  Perhaps here, we even get to customize it a bit.  By combining an armor item, the right mob drop, and a Star Ruby..we get red "Velious" armor.  If we put in a Star Sapphire..we get blue armor.  Fire Emeralds give a green piece.  Black Sapphire gives Black..Topaz gives Gold...etc., etc.  All the same stats, but we actually (gasp!) get a choice!<P>Of course, all the items are Lore, No-Drop.  If you have an Etheral Mist Helm, you cannot get another Rubicite.  You upgrade and that's it.<P>Now...look at what this creates.  Ongoing quests.  We now have something to work on while were IN a particular level range..and something to look forward to in our next range.  Lore / No-Drop means no twinking.  Level-Keyed means no 5th level Rangers in full Rubicite.  No downgrading means no farming.  Definite status symbol armor, as you CANNOT have the armor unless you've earned it.  The "extra" items are always available, even if sometimes difficult to get to.  And item "input" is regulated because when something comes *in* you know that something else is going *out* due to the concept of "upgrading."<P>------------------------------<P>Long post, I know.  But there are your solutions.  It uses mechanics that already exist in the game.  Verant will have to do a bit of work to implement them (instead of the lazy "dragon level" approach).  But when done properly you will have a game that works, not a game that *is* work.<P>Lonzrick L'Amore<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Great post, Lonzrick! That armor idea sounds great. I got two main things out of it, that EQ needs:<P>1) What I said in my post, also. On going quests! Quests that start at low levels and continue to be built upon as one goes up, so that the quest never really stops, like they are supposed to do. Thus, EVERquest.<P>2) Questing for things rather than camping them. Too many things in the game are pulled off of the corpses of dead enemies and thrown on one's back. Putting important things in quests sounds great. I liked the idea of Ethereal Mist armor coming from a quest rather than gained from a dead cleric. That way, we can choose which one to get, and there is never a piece rotting because everyone alsready has one. (fine for balance sake, make the BP two pieces  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )<P>Also, as a side effect of this, camping is at least slowed down. Why? The components are gained over a long period of time, not all at once. You don't have to worry about gaining all those pieces, you just have to be around there and gain them by the time its time to turn them in (because of the level restriction). Also, maybe xp from the quests can actually mean something, since they can only be done once.<P>Actually if quests could only be done once per month, and quest xp was increased to compensate, I would be very very happy. Come to think of it, if my quest armor GAVE experience, I would be very happy. *rolls eyes yet again*<P>-Thain Champion of Kaladim<BR>of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about when you finish a quest, say JBoots, the AC is common etc etc, but when you turn it in, Hasten tells you that he has to go to the bank to get his pair and it will be X ammount of time before he can get them to you, X increasing with the number of ppls turning them in.  (Assuming say 5000 ppls on a server)The AC is now common and so is the ring, EVERYONE on the server turns in their stuff at the same time, and your unluckily the 5000th person to turn it in, that neabs haster is gonna tell you "I'm sorry young quester, I need to get to my storage safe to get you the boots, give me a little while to go get them for you, it wont take long, only 100,000 hours."  It's lame, but you know what, if I can log off and 100,000 hours later log back in, and have Hasten say "Oh, there ye are fellow, I have just gotten back, here are your boots"  Now, the boots have come in at a rate of 1 every 20 hours, AND theres not this camping factor, only problem is now everyone does every quest and everyone has about 4 billion counters on them of when they get what items.  But you know what, thats VI's problem, not mine, this is just a suggestion(all be it, lame one) on 1 way to fix it.<P>Personally I think if a quest takes YOU 20 hours to do, even if someone does the quest 1 hour after you, so what?  They earned them.  So what if everyone has the best armor and equipment?  As long as they earned it.  I don't see earning something as sitting on my butt for 20 hours while my pet solo's Cyclopses for me, and then when the AC spawns I send in my pet and nuke a bit because I'm glad I can finally move my @$$ outta the heck-hole called OOT and get my nice item.

</FONT><HR>I hear you. I see that as one of Verant's biggest problems, and it will be the ruin of EQ. Maybe not soon, but in the end, however many years down the road, it will be this that kills it.<P>The problem is that in Verant's eyes, 'challenge' is equivalent to 'time spent'. Let me repeat:<P>Challenge = Time<P>That is their downfall. Whenever something takes a lot of time, they say it has to be challenging. Well, I can think of a lot of ways that you could make something challenging without making people sit at the computer while watching TV/reading a book. Timesinks are the worst idea VI has ever put forth into the game. <P>It may be the reason EQ has gone on this long, but it is not a good solution to the problem of making a long lived game. If they had not taken the easy and safe rout, then they would be even more successful.

</FONT><HR>All of you saying "Who cares how many of them there are in game, as long as the people earn them?":<P>I'm not going to flame, because it's not a silly statement.  I'm all for people earning stuff, and yeah, I think 20 hours should count as earning it.  BUT.<P>You are completely and totally forgetting about human nature.  Let's think Pre-Kunark for a moment.  What was pretty much the best ring for a melee type?  The simple Jagged Band (yes, I know about the plat wedding band, but let's face it, it isn't 16x better for a melee).  Ac 5 Str 5 - pretty awesome for a ring!  These sell for 50pp or less on any server I've been on.  Have you ever inspected someone and said "WOW, cool!  Jagged bands!  -2- of them!"  No.  Why not?  Cause they're everywhere, despite the fact that they're damn near top of the line for like 6 classes.<P>I think it's a REALLY simple observation of human nature that rarity = value.  If you're going to argue that, well, there's about a hundred years of economic theory (not to mention simple human observation) that you'd have to knock down first.  THAT is why they only want so many of a given item coming into the game.  They want these to be the -cool- items that people see and say "Wow, I wish I could get lucky and get myself one of those!"  There are other examples of this, by the way.  <P>Now, your opinion isn't silly, and so I'm not flaming you.  It's a different opinion.  But you know what?  The above rationale for wanting to keep items rare isn't silly either.  It's a perfectly legitimate game design, and I personally agree with it.  If all items were common, it would get SO boring.  There'd be nothing left to -want-.  And everything would be cheap as dirt.<P>Anyway, it's a perfectly legitimate game design, so I'm thinking that cries that the Verant design is "stupid", "asinine", "lame" are being spouted by people who can't understand simple economics, or human nature.  <P>So come on guys.  Let's take the fact that items need to be rare as a given.  Verant's not going to change their mind on that, and they'd be absolutely foolish to do so - they got that part right the first time.<P>Now, since items need to be rare - and By God, we've explained the 20 component quest assembly line concept enough times, if you haven't gotten it by now (Lockjaw) you never will - you tell me (and Verant) a better way to keep an item RARE that WORKS.  Cause I sure as hell can't think of one.  No one else has come up with one that works, on these posts or in other games.  And I really doubt that if you were paid for months on end to think of a way, that you could either.<P>But -please- don't take that to mean that we shouldn't try.  I'm just saying lay off the Verant flames, they're really uncalled for on this one.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You are perfectly correct in your reasoning, Quinn, excpet for one thing that you are forgetting: alternatives.<P>Simple: there are none. Sure, there are other items that you could use. For example, instead of getting my cleric quest chestplate (which is very hard to get), I can get a Bloodstained Tunic fairly easily.<P>Unfortunately, there just isn't enough variety at certain times. Also, there is the notion in EQ that there has to be the 'best' item. This isn't the case in most other games. There should be several items available in the upper ranks that would be chosen based on preference and luck in obtaining them. Sure, there is a little of this in EQ, but what does every warrior want? Cobalt. What did every ranger use as a weapon? A Yak. Etc.<P>This concept is what is wrong with EQ. There is *one* speed increasing boot that is such and such rare, blah blah blah. Instead there could be speed enhancing boots of different speeds each with a certain rarity associated with them. That way, you wouldn't see the *need* for particular items that you see currently in EQ, and you could say. "Wow, look at that." and mean it.<P>There are several systems that could be incorporated. My roomate and I camped the frenzy forever to get the fbss. Why? Because you are expected to have it at higher levels. There was no alternative in haste gear, so that was the only one to get. Now, if there were more haste belts, not as good as the fbss, but more common, or even a more common drop off of the frenzy, then there would be alternatives, and everyone wouldn't want one. Sure, it wouldn't be as 'valuable' (maybe), but the game would benefiet due to 1) less camping and 2) less 'I need this' mentality.<P>Food for thought.<P>-Thain Champion of Kaladim<BR>of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004216-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004216.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004216&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004216&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
