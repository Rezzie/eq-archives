At this point both guilds (Soul Assassins and Triton) have given up on this zone and left. The only exception is Irontaail (Monk) and Adaru (Cleric) both in Triton on Povar. <BR>We have spent countless hours trying all suggestions to this zone. All we ask is ...<BR>IS THIS ZONE WORKING AND ITEMIZED? or are we wasting our time and we should wait till it is open?<P><BR>here are 2 links to huge dissussions and picture and things we've tried from this zone ...<P>http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=5749.topic<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052329.html<P>Please if you can see it in your heart VI ... just answer if this zone is actually working? Nothing has dropped except for cards .. these we got by killing the zone over and over. We dont think it is a kill based zone, but we've tried everything else we can think of including killing Bristlebane. 8-(<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seriosly though Irontail, how are things going up there?? I'm really pulling for you on this one.  This seems to be a zone I would GREATLY enjoy.  I had a though though those shoulders that dropped the "Distraction" ones, the name seems a bit odd.  Is it possible that this is not the real PoM??  Perhaps it is just there to "distract" you from the real one?? Just a thought<P>Skabahz Ahkeedo<BR>Servant of the People of Norrath<BR>You have ruined your own lands a_giant_rat17!!!

</FONT><HR>After re-reading all the long posts and what FOH said about the tigger been obivous, my suggestion would be...<P>Get a Rogue up there to pick-pocket/lock-pick the chest and/or any picture on the walls. In regards to the "CLOSE" bit, there may be a door that needs to be unlock.<P>I would hate to think it's a simple as needing to lock-pick the chest.

If so, maybe you could say, "I have proof of a white stallion" and give that proof to Lithiniath?  <P>Also:<P>&gt;&gt;You say, 'I seek a cure for the line of Lithiniath' <BR>Prince Thirneg says 'Ahh..Lithiniath, the first of the black unicorns, cursed by Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane to spread madness and delusions. Lithiniath is not evil, but his lawful magical nature has been replaced with a chaotic reflection of it that has twisted his mind. Lithiniaths physical form can not survive the removal of the chaotic magical nature. The only cure for Lithiniath is death and rebirth into a lawful vessel. <P>Is it possible to kill Lithiniath, and then rez him back?  Obviously in the rest of EQ you can't rez a mob back, but maybe in PoM?  <P>Just a thought...  I'm still wading through all these posts!

</FONT><HR>To the person that stated maybe a rogue is needed l highly doubt verant would make it so you HAVE to have a rogue to pick a lock for you to be able to turn te items in to get quest results. Its simply something they havent done. And since l have been in PoM not a single thing has been locked and l don't have the key. Also to the person who suggested right clicking . l went all over everywhere and right clicked about everything not a single result. Also went to the gold room and tryed clicking the chests to see about a combine no luckn there either. <P>Keep the suggestions coming.<P>l can do without the lamer WOOT 1st post people tho.

</FONT><HR>Well ... 3rd part 8-)<P>Im hoping that what ever it is that is the trigger .. 1st I hope it's possible that I can do also ..hehe, 2nd Im really really hoping .. we didnt try it when it wasnt working and passed it by ..hehe<P>1 - I'll try the cards on the corpse thing tonight .. 8-)<P>2 - I'll try rezzin an NPC corpse tonight also ... 8-)<P>3 - We dont seem to have been able to find those missing NPC's ... 8-( I wonder if FoH did .. there are lots of portals in the zone. We also had some doors removed after the first day Ester came in ... so it's possible they added new portals that we would have found the first 2 days .. but didnt and now they exist and we havent found them. 8-( .. we spent a whole day searching and trying to click everywhere ... but that was b4 the PoM patch ... DOH... 8-(<P>4 - I have not tried right clicking yet .. but also will tonight. 8-)<P>5 - I still am sucking at begging, although the Clerics fishing skills have gotten much better ...hehe (I need to get an unbreakable fishing pole up there ...haha)<P>Im really hoping for a big update to www.planeofmischief.com .. maybe today or tomorrow .. the basic idea Im doing is to take 9 images of each room .. N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, SE and a central picture .. then do a detail outline, description and NPC listings and links. It's taking forever ... between that and testing new ideas .. and looking for those NPC's .. but I have alot on my home system and will hopefully post up a big update soon 8-) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pestilnse ... we tended to agree with your post. If you have an oppertunity to read thru the posts .. we have been trying everything from Shakespere to Training NPC's from one room to another ... We were all hoping for the zone not to be hack and slash ... 8-(<P>Unfortunately .. the only ones to get anything out of the zone FoH .. have sort of indicated that it IS a hack and slash type zone, with some 1 main trigger we all seem to be missing . 8-(<P>Also unfortunately FoH has deemed, not to share thier info with the EQ community .. 8-( So we are atm trying everything anyone suggests 8-(<P>I understand your thoughts that it would be nice NOT to have to Hack and Slash thru a zone, and to have one with that is brain vs brawn .... On that note .. if you have any suggestions .. please feel free to post them .. we will try them .. 8-)<P>Thanks for the post 8-)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And one,two,three,four are 51-52 they spawned blue after patch. Chuckles was 52. Another thing was when me and Jaeden took the small room to big room path the ape and halfers went from blue - yellow-red to my 52 shammie. at different hieghts.

</FONT><HR>You certainly could be correct Milki.  I didn't think that FoH was making this up before, but after seeing the uber item generator, I have my doubts.  I hadn't seem the item creator before, makes you wonder how many fake screenshots are out there.  I tested it, and you could make a screenshot that looks exactly like the one on noows.com.<P>The name of the item is also a little too suspicious, especially considering that it has no effect.  Where does the name 'Distraction' come from if it's not related to the effect of the item?

</FONT><HR>*Post about bugs and whatnot in PoM... No new thoughts, just for a bluename to look at.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">*<P>If Ester or someone along those lines is still reading, the pathing in the upside down area needs to be looked at. It was just a joke when I tried the area with three people. Mage pet suicided when sent to attack Walnut. Walnut would not move from his spawn point, and ended up summoning mage to lava pool in maze! Terilings wiped her out, then walnut summoned me down there while he was still visibly in the upside-down section. <P>He eventually warped down there, and we had a good old time. Then all the pumpkin heads get bugged near YOU SHALL NOT PASS when moved out of their room. They just walk back and forth, never getting out of the loop. It was just hillarious looking at how poorly designed this section is, until it winds up getting everyone killed.<P>The pathing and the card drops need to be looked at. I've cleared nearly all NPCs in the zone multiple times, aside from Ferjeneror and My Right Hand. None of these new cards FoH mentioned, or hardly any others. <P>As it stands after getting two bubbles of 59 in PoM thus far, we've gotten perhaps 13 cards. 11 squires, one black knight and today a blue crown off of 86. Thus far we've cleared most NPCs aside from the garden area, which has quite bad aggro. <P>Perhaps we'd be more free with trading cards to figure out the apparently ungiven quest (In other words, no NPC appears to say "Give me this for this!", it seems to just be a guessing game) to unlock the mystery of the zone if they were not so, so rare. I can't imagine turning in anything aside from a Squire on a whim considering the current drops after two weeks up here. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some stuff to try:<P>1) Bizzznawa is following Rissa. Rissa says some dialogue, within which she says "'Maybe if it rains, her wings will be wet and I can get her!" So, maybe try training Bizzznawa into the water, or give Bizzznawa or Rissa a flask of water.<P>2) The chest surrounded by the four gnomes: Mnyup, Pela, Klia, Lynx. To me it looks like this:<BR>"My pun: leap like a lynx." So, possible solutions to the riddle? Maybe jump over the chest (although it is KOS, so...)? Maybe just say "My pun: leap like a lynx"? or just "leap like a lynx" near the gnomes/treasure chest. Or maybe somewhere near there you are supposed to leap over something, like a small hole or a river? Personally, I like the second idea best (to just say "leap like a lynx" because a pun is a play on words, and you would be saying what the interpretation of the words is).<P>3) There are those number guys on track (vun, doo, dree, vour, vive, seeks. Maybe go up to the number people in the main room titled one, two, and three, and say to each their respective ogre slang names. IE: go up to one and say "vun," go up to two and say "doo," and go up to three and say "dree."<P>4) This is more of a question than a suggestion, but in the main room with the numbered guys and the gnomes with "itch" and "upple" endings for their names, why doesn't Blich have a "t" in it? Is it just a programming error or a clue for something?<P>5) In the chess room, there are all the chess pieces and the apes. The ape called "I Like This One" is standing next to the black king. Maybe he is saying he wants a black king. What I mean is, give him the black crown card.<P>6) In the room with "My Right Hand" try asking him about his left hand. For example, say something like "Where is your left hand?" or "What happened to your left hand?"<P>7) There is a wizard named "Mizer." A miser is a greedy person who doesn't want to share his money. Maybe ask him for money? Or give him money?<P>Those are what I just thought of. Tell me if any work. =)<P><BR>Talladar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So try either saying "plea like a lynx" or "how does a lynx plea?." Also, think how a lynx pleas. I dunno, but it's considered a feline, so does it meow/mew? Maybe try /emote meows.

Someone said something about "Mees Gono Keel Uuuz" sounding like it is an ogre talking, and same with "Vun, Doo, Dree, Vour, Vive, Seeks, Dern, Loscounthahaha." All that led to some people thinking if it's in ogre talk, and Donk is the only ogre, that seems to sorta pull together. So, I was thinking, maybe all questions should be directed at Donk. My thing about leaping or pleaing like a lynx... maybe that should be said to Donk. Maybe all answers to riddles we think we have but didn't work actually do work but need to be said to him. *Maybe* he is even the real Bristlebane!!! Since he seems to be running the zone (I say that because all that stuff is in ogre-speak), maybe he is Bristlebane in disguise. Try asking him about Bristlebane, and also about Birstlebane.

</FONT><HR>OK, just a couple of thoughts after reading this thread. I love puzzles  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1. Mynup Pela Klia and Lynx<BR>Mynup is probably my pun<P>Pela could be plea, leap, pale, or peal<P>Klia could be lik a, kil a, laik(lake?), alik(alike, I like?) a kil. can't come up with anything that makes 100% sense for this one<P>Lynx could be Links?, XYln (referring to a location.. XY line?), Nyx L (kill someone "L") or just referring to a cat of some sort. <P>I'm probably trying too hard and the answer is completely obvious, but maybe that makes sense to someone.<P>2. Regarding the alice in wonderland references. Has anyone tried to get to PoM while Mini-ed? Miniature dollhouse, alice drank the potion(ate the cookie?) to go through the door, etc. Perhaps you would be beneath the notice of the dragons if you were miniature.<P>Also the trees that seem to be clickable, has anyone tried a giant potion to reach these? The person that said that they did find an exit here, were you a large race, and perhaps could reach it better?<P>I'm eager to hear more, keep us posted, and good luck!<BR>Demgar<BR>Vazelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good Idea Demgar. Shaman can now make a potion that shrinks the user anywhere, even outdoors. Traditionally, the shrink spell only works in dungeons. Maybe PoM is the reason they added the potion? Irontaail, etc. I would recommend picking up a few of these potions, maybe they will give you a new 'perspective' on Mischief.<P>Kaine</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, the things you can do with 5 people up here. We wiped out the zone as much as time allowed. I did find those two little *nasty word*ers, Bit and Mizer. They are rather... bizarre looking. Naked halfling body with a plate helm. Didn't drop anything at all.<P>Killed Lithiniath, he dropped a black marble, tons of spells, horn. Didn't realize quest gems were intended to drop off of any NPC in the zone, but Lithiniath apparently does drop them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Decent card drops today... Two knights and one jester. Nothing new noticed, certainly starting to run around in circles. Pinky dropped a Rusty Mace, which no one planted on him. I found that to be just a wee bit twisted, but who knows...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Irontaail<P>Why don't you zip up the room screen shots .. Then people can download them as a room. Look at them localy.<P>Drop the small ones and stick with the big ones .. You can get it all working on the same server that way.<P>If you do not want to do that. Sign up with several free web hosting sites and keep a room or two on each.

</FONT><HR>Thanks all for the website suggestions .. I forgot that I own another website .. that I made when I was leader of another guild www.KnightsOfTheCreed.com ... haha Dorian reminded me that I still own a ton of webspace there, so Im going to move everthing over there and redirect www.planeofmischief.com to that address in the next few days ....<P>Also by the end of this weekend I should have all the main rooms in PoM posted up on the sight with the 9 views of each.<P>Thanks again for more ideas .. I'll try more tonight 8-)<P>Grads Coladar on the Jester .. what NPC did you get it off of? Fenj? My right Hand? .. that is where we got ours. I have not recieved any black marbles off of Fenj, must be a new loot .. or any rusty weps at all ... hehe .. but yes there are plenty of lvl 60 Spells off the big NPCs here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065255-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065255-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065255-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065255-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065255&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065255&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
