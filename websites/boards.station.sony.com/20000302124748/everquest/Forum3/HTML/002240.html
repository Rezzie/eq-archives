</FONT><HR>YES! yes, yes, yes, yes, 10 dollars is well worth it.  I know how you feel.  I have always been more interested in the single player experience than in multi-player.  But I thought I would give this game a chance and try out my 1 month free trial (do they still offer that?) <P>It didnt help matters when I couldnt get the game to run on my pc at the time.  But 8 months, (and 1 new pc) later and I honestly can't pull myself away at night.  There is nothing quite like co-operating with REAL people you dont even know to achieve a goal.  Even if you decide to go solo it's still fantastic.  If you go for it, and decide to sacrafice your hard earned 10 bucks a month, then prepare for many tired mornings at work.  Because you will not be getting much sleep once you get into this game.  <P>I also agree with Rabdos, I havent bought a new PC game in almost 2 months now....a record for me!<P>Aaradek<BR>10th Lvl Warrior for the Soldiers of Brell<BR>Bertox Server  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>On my box, it says, "Internet connectivity required to set your EverQuest account. A monthly service charge is applicable after your trial period ends."<P>This is exactly what it says on the box, word for word.<P>If you read your box before you bought it, you would have found that there is a monthly charge and that there is a trial.<P>Elsewhere on the box it says, "30 Day Free Play! Valid Credit Card Required. See box bottom for details."<P>The box also says, "EverQuest can only be played when connected to certain online environments....and the payment of additional fees or charges."<P>Verant will keep this up because they will most likely have a long life in the PC game market because this is simply the best online fantasy game in the world.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>LOL...  Well, as a shameless addict of this amazing game, I'd say yes, it's worth it.  I wasn't please about the 10 per month when I first signed up (but at least I knew about it! <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) It took a grand total of about 10 minutes to decide I would sign up for six months (just as a trial period you understand  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">)<P>But that aside, it depends on you.  If you are intrigued by the concept of playing a extreme graphical fantasy game with literally THOUSANDS of people from all over the world, then EQ is for you.  <P>I haven't bought a new game since EQ, Granted, that's only a couple months, but I used to buy one or two a month!!!  So yes, even discounting my 6 month pre-purchase of playing time, I've still saved $40-50!<P>I really, really enjoy this game.  If you do sign up, when you create a character you get to choose any of 28 servers.  I would recommend one of the three newest servers.  Luclin, Lanys T'Vyl, or the Nameless.<P>Go Forth!  Have Fun!

As you may or may not have noticed, there are many people on this board who are attempting to give positive, helpful advice to newer players and create an atmosphere or excitemtent and interest in the game.  Please don't come to this board with your negative attitudes and slams on Verant Customer service.  Leave those on the Gameplay board. thanks.<P>Elrind Isildur<P>BTW, I have been playing for 5 months and have never had to contact Customer Service, so I'm assuming many others haven't as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yes, it is defentily worth it.<P>If you want something that you can justify the monthly fee, know this. There are patches, fixes, and additions added to the game every month. There are many people that do not like the changes, but that is the nature of people and changes. But the point comes that while Everquest is a game, it is an ever evovling game. There are about 2 to 3 major changes per month that you get as a subscriber of Everquest.<P>But as said, be prepared to loose a lot of sleep.

</FONT><HR>corwinh,<P>I am not sittin here bashin Verant i am simply statin the facts.  chrisbop1 wanted to know if the game was worth it or not and i dont think you should say all good things about the game while there is just as many bad things as well.  Ive played this game for nearly 8 months and cancelled my account due to many issue with Verant.  But anyways why should you just say all the good things so he get his hopes up and decideds to play the game then he realizes it was not so wonderful as you make it out to be.  Face it Kill Stealin, item farmin, rude ppl in general, over crowdin, long camps, and being forced to group just about all the time are issue with the game that WILL NOT get any better but worst.  Verant has already decided where they want this game to go and nothing anyone can do or say will change that now its to late.  Many ppl have realizin all the problems with the game/company and ir return are just playin EQ till Diablo II and other new games come out.  The reason i made all the negative comments about Verant is cause everyone neglected to say anything about any of them and that is just as much a part of the game as the good things and the person askin should not be blindy told otherwise.  Im glad you havent had any need to get help with Verants Customer service, but when you do dont hold your breathe.<P>Kao<P>Kao</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>kao,<P>I'm not saying that I live everything about EQ.  I'm not saying that Verant couldn't improve their customer service.  I'm not saying that EQ is the perfect game.<P>But I have spent $20 a month on EQ (two accounts, one for me and one for my wife) since the day it came out.  I'm also willing to bet that despite your whining you (much like the vast majority of people that post here) still shell out your 10 bucks every month, too.<P>If you really think Verant should be hurt by losing customers, don't turn away the new folks.  Cancel your own account.  As long as people continue to shell out the money they can't really *****.  Put your money where your mouth is.  If you're still around that obviously means that there's something good enough in EQ to keep you.  Why try to rob other players of that?<P>And besides, what other game receives as much support as EQ?  I can't name a single customer service department in the industry that's any better than Verant, can you?  How many other publishers continuously add new weapons, new spells, and entire new maps to their games as well as a near continuous stream of bug fixes and enhancements?  None that I can think of.<P>Phinn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There is a very interesting fact about gaming. This is true about all games. And that is that when a better game comes out or when we get bored with a game that we currently play, we (as gamers) go find us another game to play. All games go by the way side. I remember playing Wizardry many years back. At the time, it was the best game out there. I do not play it any more. Why? Because there is a better game. So saying that EQ is not worth playing because people are currently only playing the game while waiting for Diablo II is incorrect. EQ is worth playing because it is fun and currently is about the best game out there in this arena. When a better game comes along, we will move on to something else. Until then, EQ is worth the $10 for the experience and enjoyment you will receive playing the game.<P>BTW, if you played the game for 8 months. There must have been something you liked for 7 of those months for you to continue playing. No one would spend $70 doing something that they true did not enjoy at any time during the period.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 40 summers<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Phinn,<P>Before you post a respond to someone elses post please read it.  In the 3rd line of my post i stated that i cancelled my EQ account, so in fact i did put my money where my mouth is as you put it.  I am not here to simply bash Verant i am tryin to inform someone that ASK if the game is worth it or not and i am simply statin the negative sides of EQ since no one else wants to say of any of them i thought i should.  Reason being why i think that is if i was a new potential customer i would like to here the pros and cons to EQ rather they just hear all the pros and then find out about all the cons in game.  That could save me time if i dont want to deal with that type of thing and dependin if your a powergamer or casual gamer that makes a enormous difference since Verant caters to the powergamer.  I did not see any good reason for EQ to keep me the only thing that did keep me in the game to start with was RL friends that got the game and we all wanted to have fun playin together well the fun went away when our group of friends could not slowly over time do things that we were once able to.  I am not tryin to rob a player of anything, i am simply makin them aware of the situation before hand as many others that have post have NOT.  <P><BR>And besides, what other game receives as much support as EQ? I can't name a single customer service department in the industry that's any better than Verant, can you?&lt;--For this comment, there are many games out there that have continues support such as EQ not all games have to be online to receive alot of support.  Since there is no other customer service dept that is any better out (that you can think of) that makes it ok for Verant to be sloppy with theirs inreturn for no one else havin better (that you can think of).  Why does Verant take the step to take a step above the "normal" customer service and become exceptional in it?  Im sure if Verant really wanted to improve their customer service dept they could.  They do have the Sony/989 Studios name backin them up.  Yes those are seprate companies but im sure that those companies would help out in some type of form if Verant was to approach them about the situation.  Even though Sony/989 Studios dont make this game there name is still on it and that is all that matters when you go to the store and you see the company logos on the box.  You think someone that heard bad things about a Sony/989 Studios game even if it was only for publishin would want to consider another game with those same companies backin it up?  I wouldnt cause if they dont care for how a situation is being treated and yet they have their company name there just make money without carin about customer i would think the same would hold true for other games as well.  Oh well enough of this.<P>Kao<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It all basically boils down to what kind of experience you've had with the game thus far.<P>Obviously players that have had no technical issues, and no reason to deal with Verant's questionable customer service are going to hold this game in higher opinion than someone who's system crapped out on them during install, or wound up having a stolen account key.   <P>I wont comment on the actual "issues" in the game itself.  Ie: Ksing, overcrowded servers, camping, etc. Because theres not much i can do about it.  One thing i wont do is scream my head off about these problems to Verant (which I'm not saying you are Kao, but many others on these boards do) and expect an instant solution.  Theres always going to be people that complain about something.  You cant please everyone.  And so what if he doesnt end up liking the game? He's out a trip to the store to return it? big deal.  I say try it for yourself, if you enjoy it Great! If not than take it back. It's as simple as that.<P>Aaradek<BR>10th Lv Warrior for the Soldiers of Brell<BR>Bertox Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sorry forgot to touch on one other thing in your post Phinn.  Their are many companies out there that do add new items to there game all the time and have patches and such.  I think half the reason why EQ needs as many patches as it does is because they (the patches) are not tested well at all and in return cause other bugs in the game.<P>For Wadin,<P>I know ALOT of ppl from in the game before i cancelled my account and just by readin are waitin for Diablo II to come out so they are passin the time by with EQ just to have something to do, and Diablo II is free.  Also there is AC whcih i have not played myself but i have heard many good things about but and also negatives as well but there other games out there that are better (based on opinions) and ppl will move to them when they find out about them or when they got to there limit of taken enough BS.<BR>  <BR>Yes i played this game for nearly 8 months and it was fun at first.  Reasons why it was fun i had a lot of RP friends that played together all the time also there was not nearly as much "nerfin" going on as there has been lately.  The first few months i had a total blast playin mainly cause of my RL friends then it became a lil more annoyin cause when we hit around lvl 35 the game started becomin alot of work but we had fun still cause we all knew each other.  Then in the last few months the game has been a barrel ride downhill with all the so called "enhancments" and all the "nerfin" the game was not fun anymore and alot of my RL frineds cancelled their accounts because of it and shortly after i found myself in the situation i was havin no fun at all because the reason i had fun to start with was gone....my RL friends.  Granted i had many online friends but it didnt not weight out the lines of lies and other things Verant was handin us so i cancelled my account after splittin all my items on all my charaters between my online friends and guild.  The game now is just headin downhill faster and faster, many causal gamers are becomin truly fed up as they can only play an hour or two at a time so they wont be able to do the things that they really wanted to do (plane raids for example) and they have a hard time lvlin cause it is gettin harder and harder to get a group in EQ and then to have to leave very soon after is not to great.  Also many powergamers are startin to feel it too with the nerfin of things.  Just a few examples of many.<P>Kao<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>xKorpse,<P>I agree with you totally.  I for one am not one of these ppl that go yellin at Verant to fix things, reason being theres already 1000 other ppl doing so and there really isnt no way to solve the problem cause its a player problem really.  Only reason like ive stated before to mention these negative things about the game is so he does understand what hes going to see in the game and not to be so shocked when he witnesses (when sayin he i mean chrisbop1).  He also seems a lil upset that he has to set up an account before gettin the free trail (givin the credit card info out im assumin why) so he might not want to take the risk of that to start with.  Like ive said just tryin to give him a veiw of the whole game not just one side of it.<P>Kao</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The question, though, is, 'Is the game worth it?'. Sure, the game has problems here and there, but most people that have serious complaints about the game are after months and months of play (most of us here have characters at least well into the 30s, if not 50s or multiple high chars). Obviously, though some things about the game irritate us, we did get our money's worth. I figure as long as someone gets a few months of good play, that is probably a lot more than some of the games I've played that got shelfed after a few weeks.<P>Sure, EQ has problems, but it is still really worth it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002240&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002240&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
