&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I am making this post to provide some general information to the masses about disconnections/isp/modem problems that i know to be a problem while playing everquest.  Im sure that some are going to flame this saying that i dont know what im saying ect and thats fine because i hear it all night at work.  Ive gained this knowledge from working technical support for a nationwide ISP for the past 2 years;  ready here it goes.<P>1. Modems:  Today the modem scene is quite confusing yuo have internal, external, cable, dsl, software flow control, hardware flow control ect.  First most common PC users are going to have software flow control modems; this means that along with the actual hardware on the modem most of the data transfer is controlled by software made for the modem.  These modems sometimes have problems handling large packets which unfortunately are what Everquest sends your computer.  Up to date software drivers can improve the performance of these modems greatly and if this doesnt help then you may have to look into an alternative modem.  Examples of these types of modems are LT Winmodems...Rockwell HCF modems, Conexant soft K56, USR 56k voice int win ect.<P>- Next type of modem that is very common in PC's today are called controllerless chipset modems.  What this means is that the modem card itself does nothing with the information coming through the phone line. All of this information is dumped directly onto your computers processor.  It would be very difficult to play EQ with this type of modem...not impossible mind you but difficult...working in Tech Support these modems cause many problems just staying online.  These modems are prone to disconnections because your computers processor is meant to run applications not interpret internet data and this causes data to get lost and disconnections are very frequent. Examples of these are HSP Micromodems...Motorolla sm56 various other companies use the HSP chipset as well<P>-Third type of modem is the external hardware flow control modem.  If you are going to use a standard dialup modem i would say this is the best to try.  These plug into a serial port in the back of your PC and are completely hardware controlled meaning they interpret all data within themselves...even though EQ may still give these problems general performance of these is usually much greater than that of internal modems. Ex. of these would be Zoom external, Diamond Supra Express external and USR sportster ext.<P>-Cable/Dsl modems are more on the broadband network side of the internet connection.  These provide faster download and usually faster uploads as well and can handle an EQ connection better than standard dialup...and i mean usually. I use a cable modem as my means of connection and i still get disconnected from EQ quite often but i will get into that shortly.  If this type of connection is available to you i would recommend paying the extra cash for the connection if possible.<P>2. ISP:  A misconception that many ppl have is that when you change an ISP you are going to change your connection performance/reliablility ect.  This however may not always be the case.  In a certain area there are usually a large number of servers but then there are a small number of trunk lines which all of these servers plug into and even less backbone lines (Ex. UUnet and ExodusNet) that the trunk lines plug into. I know that seems confusing but basically what it means is that if you have problems with EQ/connections and you change ISP's you may be connecting to the same servers going through the same trunk lines ect so that means that even though you have a different ISP you are going to have the same exact problems.  I know this happens because the company i work for has many ISP's in close proximity to each other so when customers leave one they usually jump onto another one of our ISP's.  So just becuase you have changed ISP's this doesnt mean that this isnt causing the EQ problems.<P>-ISP Quality is another factor that is going to make or break your EQ experience.  I know this to be a factor because my ISP which happens to be the one i work for is not the best when it comes to connections. Like i said before i have a cable modem and im willing to bet i get disconnected the same amount or more than most others.  I know this is not my cable modem or my system which happens to be a Atholon 800mhz 256mb ram 32meg Geforce 256 AGP video card and some other goodies ,my problems are with my ISP.  I know this because my roomate uses a dial up connection and we get disco'ed at the same time even some of my co-workers across town will go Link Dead the same time as me.  There really isnt a sure fire way to know if your ISP is reliable or not unless you know someone that works or directly deals with the ISP.  But just to let you know all ISP's are not state of the art/top of the line.<P>3. Disconnections themselves usually occur when the modem can no longer handle the data being recieved or looses track of the data being sent to it.  Packet size plays a large part in disconnections. EQ sends very large packets      (packs of data) and some modems cant handle these packets and tend to choke themselves to death so to speak.  A quality modem can help this problem but may not fix it completely.  There is the case of MTU's which you can read about at some of the modem tweaking sites on the net but im not going to get into here becuase that is something that really should not be tampered with.  EQ is the type of game that wreaks havoc on modems in the same way that Starseige: Tribes would do.  There are things you can do to improve things but there is no sure fire fix or surefire solution all the time<P>Im sorry for being so lengthy but i wanted to provide you all with some info that may help you all out.  Good Travels and thanks for your time<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Your information for the most part is very correct but according to what has been going on today the main issue is not the modem or connection type but the UUNET routers and if that is the case then they need to find a way to back up the system or use another back bone. This seems to be the main issue when the network is haveing all these issues. It is always someone elses fault but Sony is a big boy or company and should assume some of the responsability for this. As for my Qualifications I have worked in the computer field for more than 24 years now and worked for some of the big guys doing tech. support, " Dell, AT&T just to name a few" doing computer support gave me a very good start and even better customer relations skills. As with the 2 I mentioned customer sat is there goal. And it seem that at times all the goal here is to make money. IE the question about if they were to put a cap on servers would I pay $49.95 a month for them. I of corse answered No. because the service its self would not change and why would I pay the same amount or more that I pay for my connection which by the way is a DSL connection.<BR>And yes ISP's do have and share the same backbones as others in there area but some of them are more customer aware than others some of the smaller ones give better service because there customer is there money or back bone of there bussness. Well I have let you know how I feel about it so I will shut up.

</FONT><HR>Yes an informative but not all the way true post.  And I will tell you why.<P> If you and all your buddies are getting disconnected at the same time, unless you all live together on the same block or in a very small town, then you are not all using the same routers.<P>Sounds like another customer service rep that needs to look at the larger picture.  If you are going to provide a service and charge for that service then you need to be reliable and responsible.  If you remember what happened to AOL with the not being able to connect issue's well that could very easily happen to Verant with the I can only play for 5 minutes then get kicked back to my desktop issue.<P>I myself build and sell computers and I know a thing or two about customer service. <P>I learned that if you give the customer what they are paying for, you don't get any hassles from the customers.<P>I also learned early on if you do not take short cuts then your technical calls will be down to nill.<P>I also learned that if properley check and double check all things prior to shipping (or in Verants case releasing) that your technical issues get dropped down to nill.<P>These things Verant is lacking on....  Read through the 10,000 other posts griping about the poor customer service, or are all those just repeats from the unreliable uunets and terrible routers?  When that many people are having the same problems and Verant just turns there backs on them, that is called wrong plain and simple wrong.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002368&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002368&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
