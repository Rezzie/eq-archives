</FONT><HR>Fletching leaves a lot to be desired.  Nobody buys arrows -- you need a minimal skill to make the most effective arrows (1 damage, 150 range) and nobody is interested in anything else.<P>(Yes, you can make 8 damage, 150 range arrows, but on a darkwood bow this is a damage increase of about 15% and a cost increase of literally 10,000% per arrow.)<P>If there is a way to imbue magic into arrows, that opens a lot of possibilities.  e.g., is it possible to make a c-ockatrice beak work like an arrowhead, and when you combine it with the other materials you get an arrow bundle with effect:stun?<P>If that works, we can come up with endless possibilities.  Arrows that proc snare, or a tentacle terror style knockback effect, etc.  Short of making them proc ice comet, I don't think there's anything you can do to unbalance archery, because the damage is really pathetic, so there should be plenty of room to add some effect arrows without adding significant power to an archer.  (And, for example, those beaks are sufficiently rare drops that you wouldn't be able to flood the market with stun arrows.)<P>I also think it would be interesting if there could be some items in the game that required a minimum stat to create -- e.g., it costs a troll a LOT more money to raise fletching than, say, a high elf.  It would be interesting, though, if there were some special items that could only be made by someone with a 180 strength -- or a 180 int -- etc.  Perhaps the strongest bows could only be crafted by someone with a 200 fletching and a 250 strength.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Try making bows - what I do is carry a collection of bows in the bank and sell them as well as the arrows. Also, get involved with a guild and let the guild officer know you are a fletcher. Guild members are more likely to buy from you than someone else not in your guild. As far as the 8 damage, 100 range arrows go - keep them for yourself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'll come up with an arrow recipe that uses ****atrice beaks but the benefit of the arrow will have to be in its damage/delay ratio and its magic/non magic flag. Unfortunately the current engine does not allow for missiles to have procs. Another problem would be the fact that items with spell effects can not be made stackable, making storage and reloading of missiles with effects difficult.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well met Yakatizma!<P>I've had a 200 fletching skill for longer than I can remember. I also run the Ranger's Glade and have a lot of suggestions I could offer for fletching.. some in regards to other trades.<P>C0ckatrice Beaks would be a good addition to arrow components.<P>Here are some examples we have thought of collectively for some time.<P>* New foraged items that result in fletching components. i.e. feathers for vanes, wood sticks for shafts (or bone in field of bone, steel pieces in Kaladim, etc..) Some zones could yield fletching components, but not all. All Rangers can forage and we are the class that uses fletching most.<P>* I see now that smithies can make silver arrowheads.. great! Gnomes can tinker cams.. great! And I think now silk strings can now be made with spiderlinks silks.. great! We still need shafts, perhaps from the fletching skill itself.  We also need player made vanes, or fletches.. maybe from tailoring and the use of cloth, or hides to do so. Also, enable potters and smithies to make ceramic and steel bow staves. These staves are in our fletching book, yet have never been found. I don't know how you would work them into the tables since Darkwoods are even trivial at 200 skill.<P>* Fletching requires A LOT of space in our inventory. Especially with zones in Kunark, we don't always have access to vendors. Perhaps make items that can create multiple fletching elements such as a large wood stave can create stacks of 20 wood shafts when we right click (maybe have a successfull skill check.) These items should be comparably priced and should have "charges" or "uses." So we could purchase a large flint rock that had 10 uses of create stone arrowheads. Successfully using the large flint rock would produce 20 (or 5, whatever) stone arrowheads. Same goes with nocks and such.<P>* Magical components. Currently, all fletching items are labeled as MAGIC, yet combine to create mundane items. Silver was a good step, but us VASTLY expensive. We need more alternatives to make magic piercing arrows.<P>* Rethink the way cams work. In real life (yes, I know it's different) cams reduce delay and increase damage. Cams currently reduce delay BUT reduce damage. Also, make it so we can cam the other bow staves please.<P>Fletching as a whole needs to be looked at costwise. It would be different if it were jewelry and there was a nice demand for bows. But given that you don't want bows to be used for other than pulling really, the market for high end bows is almost non existent. With a 300pp failure for high end dark bows, it is hardly incentive to increase your fletching over the ability to successfully make 3 damage 150 range arrows (a good standard.) The fletching kits are big enough that we can add many other components during a creation. Maybe the addition of enchanted metals, fire beetle eyes, burned out lightstones, etc. could create magically enchanced bows and or arrows. For example, putting a fire beetle eye in a kit with arrow components could create Fiery arrows. These arrows wouldn't have a proc, but their base damage would be 2 to 3 points higher than the normal arrows made. You could do this with tons of items.. poison components (the ones rogues use,) burned out lightstones for a magic increase, sulfur stacks, plains pebbles, etc..<P>Also, not sure if you have any say, but make quivers do SOMETHING. There is absolutely no reason to carry a quiver. They are too small and have no beneficial effects. Perhaps add a bow haste ability when using special quivers...?<P>Speaking of quivers, I don't think anyone has found the recipe, nor use for a resulting fleeting quiver. Can you look at that please?<P>I appreciate your time and efforts on this and hope that we (and I) can continue to give you some constructive feedback.<P>Respectfully,<P>Sunmoon Glademaster<BR>The Ranger's Glade<BR>http://eqforge.com/ranger<BR>sunmoon@eqforge.com  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>We have tinkered cams that can be used in making fancy bows, but I don't know enough about high-level fletching to know if they are used.<P>Here's an idea.  It's a pity about the proc limits, but within the constraints of affecting damage/delay only, how about a fletching recipe that accepts a gnomish firework (tinkered item) instead of a shaft?  Real world hobby archers know you can make a pretty spiffy explosive arrow by filling an aluminum shaft with powder and using a bullet primer for a tip.  So have the recipe deliver up a single, non-stackable arrow with a good solid "crump" damage (something like a normal crit) and an insane delay.  (Ya gots to be careful handling those things, an' it takes time.) It shouldn't be overpowering, but it would be fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I currenly am able to fletch class3 bone hooked arrows with fletching at 125 (dmg4 range 150) good standard but very very expensive. I would like to see in fletching  a slight reduction in price, as well as enhanced tecniques. Say for example a master smith making fine-steel should not a master fletcher create higher damaging missles. Also you have said that arrows would have a problem Proc'ing  but what about poisonous arrows? having a fashion a poison and fletchers combining it into thier recipe it would make archery more viable for puliing and helping in damage over time. I don;t think that it would imbalance the game.  Utilising some somponents to do fire or cold based damage arrows. Having a Fletcher make a master bow and then incorporating gems, or having an enchanter enchant the bow with a proc ability. Obviously this will have to be very difficult and the the proc cannot be imbalancing, some simple things  snare, Flamelick, engulfing darkness, these procs may not last as long as the spells and as with most proc's there is a % of it procing. Due to the high delay in bows it would seem to imbalance the game.

</FONT><HR>Fletching exhibits an imbalance between risk (cost) and reward (payoff). One way to fix this would be to make Archery a more powerful combat skill (i.e., increase the payoff), but Verant seems not to want to do this for Vision(tm) reasons.<P>So, we are left with either lowering the risk by reducing the cost or tinkering with the results.<P>Lower cost: make all bow/arrow components forageable, make tools never be expended, lower merchant prices for components (or raise what they'll pay). If all components aren't forageable, then make them available via a quest of some sort like the components of the Trueshot Bow.<P>Tinkering: make bows/arrows more interesting and complex. Different additional components for different resulting arrows and bows. I wonder if a successful hit with a special arrow could have an interesting effect on the archer or the bow itself, not just the mob? (Like those intelligent swords in D&D) You could get berserker effect, or haste (lowers delays for a few rounds), or bufs up dex or agi.<P>One problem with this is that you might end up with little stacks of different effect arrows to sort through in a fight. Not good.<P>Make quivers do something interesting. I like the idea of decreasing delay.<P>Add quests where you turn in a cool bow and get something interesting (since players don't want to buy them, alas).  Perhaps there are elven archers who want nicely made bows and will give a reward for them, even if it doesn't involve killing a_drooling_monstrosity00?<P>Critical: You probably have to coordinate with Rowyl on this one, but make it possible to buy a stack of 20 items with one or two mouse-clicks! (How about Ctrl-Click on a merchant item brings up the "how many?" box with 20 preselected?)<P>Consider raising the skill-caps on trade skills to 250.  Then there would be room for more interesting high-skill items to make. (Olympic 20-cam fiberglass bows, Chateau d'Yquem for brewers, etc.)<P>Consider giving experience for reaching various preset levels of skill in any trade skill, or even for any increase. (When I think of all the time and money I've put into trade skills vs. reward, and the same for fighting MOBs vs. reward, I'm sometimes amazed that I bothered).<P>    -- Vizco<BR>       Ranger 25th, Prexus<BR>       Fletching: 150<BR>       Bank account: empty<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, some suggestions for Fletching.<P>First things first, Please put in craftable Ceramic and Steel Bow Staves. The ceramic Bow stave would require a Sketch (300pp), Water, and 3 Large Blocks of Clay. This item would trivial at 208 Pottery skill. It would be fired on 4 High Quality Firing Sheets.<P>A Steel Bow Stave would require the same Fine Steel Folded Metal Sheets as the new Fine Steel Armor. (3 of them), a Mold (300pp), a file, a Smithing Hammer, and a flask of water. This would trivial at 205 skill in Blacksmithing.<P>In addition, during stave creation, it would be possible to add either a Mana Vial, or one of the new Imbued Gems, (Maybe both) and each level of mana vial would give the final bow a +1 to STR, STA, DEX, and AGI (So the 39th level Mana Vial would give a +4 STR +4 STA +4 DEX +4 AGI to the bow it made). The Imbued Gems would give a +1 to all saves. (So the highest level imbued gem would give +5 save poison, disease, fire, cold, and magic). Making a stave in this manner would increase the trivial level to 228 for ceramic bows for one or the other and 248 for both. Steel would be 225, and 245 respectively.<P>The staves themselves would follow the same trivial charts as the Darkwood Stave when being used with the fletching skill to create a bow, BUT, the ceramic bows would have an across the board 10 point decrees in Delay, while the Steel Staves would have an across the board 5 point increase in damage. (Yes I know it would be a LOT of work to program in ALL of the variables about 2000 different final product entrese, so you might want to thing about making the final product only either base stave with hemp string, or dual cammed, carved, with silk string to cut down the variables).<P>Next, to components.<P>Make ****atrice Beaks, and Sabertooth teeth a type of head for an arrow. Using it would increase damage by 2 over the current best arrow head and make a magical arrow.<P>Make Griffin, Harpy, and Aviak Feathers usable as vanes and have them increase the range by 100 over the best range increase of the best nock, and make the arrow magical.<P>Let Darkbone, Barbed Bone, Drybone, and Icebone chips be used as nocks increasing Damage on the arrow by 1 more but decreasing the range by 50. They will also make the arrow magical.<P>Finally allow the Race Type metals (Mithril, Adamantite, etc) be used to fashion shafts. Small brick of the ore type, file, water, and mold. These would increase the damage by +1 over the best shaft again and make a magical arrow.<P>So if I used all of these new parts to create an arrow, I would end up with a damage 12 range 200 Arrow that could hit magical only targets.<P>Used with my suggested Rough Steel Bow, it would have a range of 350 total, and hit for 41 maximum damage or 82 damage on a Critical. Its delay would be 68.<P>Sassnik Dreameweaver, Level 51 Ilusionist, Tunare (Krieger)<BR>TradesMistress of Tunare<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The way magical arrows were implemented was a bit of a cop out.  All the exciting possibilities for arrow combinations with spells thrown out for what?  A silver tipped arrowhead without even a greater chance 'to hit' than the standard arrow.  <P>There were great possibilities of class interactions here - the ideas of different caster classes being able to enchant different types of magic arrow... and from Verant's perspective the happy prospect of yet another platinum sink to soak up those high level bank accounts... I'm surprised Verant didn't jump on the chance.<P>We know Verant don't want to make archery too powerful and I understand that it could cause an imbalance in the game... it would be bad for the game as a whole to get into the Ultima Online situation... but the arguments that it is a form of 'manaless spell casting' do not really hold up very well.<P>In order to fletch arrows I have to sink both time and money into the skill - time that I could have spent adventuring - the time spent fletching is similar to meditating for a spell and paying for the arrow components is no different to paying for spell components.  I fail to make arrows and casters 'fizzle' spells.  I can't shoot arrows at point blank range and casters get interrupted if they get hit.   There is a significant delay (casting time) associated with each bow shot. Spells are often partially resisted and arrows often do less than maximum (or even 'average') damage.<P>Here's another suggestion for a minor improvement to archery for rangers and to one to improve arrows for all.<P>The Trueshot bow can be made by anyone with a decent skill in fletching... it can only be wielded by a ranger though. What I have in mind is that a ranger who makes his own Trueshot should gain a 'to hit' bonus with that bow because he made it for himself therefore it is tuned to his style of shooting (stance, draw weight etc).<P>This bonus is not transferable to another ranger (i.e. if the bow is sold or even made for another ranger then the bonus is lost) - this means to get the full benefit of a Trueshot then the ranger must make his own bow. I'm not suggesting a massive ATK bonus, but something that makes a Trueshot (or a Rain Caller constructed from a Trueshot) slightly more effective.<P>Another bonus that might be applied to these bows, or maybe to all bows across the board, is that the *minimum* damage inflicted is that of the arrow.  I'm so sick of seeing my 8 damage arrows, fired from a dam 20 bow (with an archery skill of 201 and a dex of 124) hitting for 1 point of damage.  This would give some (limited) encouragement to use the higher damage arrows.  To see a 'double damage' hit do a mere 2 points of damage is almost insulting.<P>The following idea applies to all the classes able to fire an arrow from a bow and / or fletch a magic arrow.<P>To enhance arrows all casters should be able to enchant arrows. This will prevent the casters griping that one class has been given an extra spell - maybe give them each one or 2 spells that enchant arrows with a spell say 2 circles lower than their current level of power.<P>Rather than say 'casters can enchant arrows' why not give each caster class a different 'enchant arrow' spell... for example:<P>Enchanters maybe get a straight + accuracy / damage effect that is stackable with any of the following effects:<P>Necromancers get a poison arrow effect (a mild DoT)... maybe limited to rogue only when firing the arrows.<P>Mage gets a fire arrow spell (DoT again) or alternatively a lightning effect (DD).<P>Wizards get a DD explosive arrow effect. - Possibly a 'fire based' one and an 'ice based' one for flexibility.<P>Clerics get an effect that enhances arrows against undead.... maybe paladin only?<P>Druids get an ensnaring root arrow.... ranger only?<P>Shamans.. maybe a spell that reduces the delay (wolf spirit arrows  )<P>Drawbacks<BR>=========<BR>1) The arrows must be silver tipped (therefore expensive).<P>2) Can only enchant stacks of 10 at a time and quite expensive on mana.<P>3) A 'fizzle' while trying to cast the enchantment ruins the arrows.<P>4) Although this effect should benefit all classes it should be set up like a weapon proc - an archer of too low a level for a given spell will not get the effect - this will reduce the farming of 1 shot kill arrows to low level players.<P>5) Also each spell requires a gem component of some small value.... but you require one per arrow.  For example, to enchant a basic 10 arrow stack you need 10 silver tipped arrows, 10 topaz to enchant them to improve accuracy, then to get the lightning effect spell you need 10 pieces of amber.<P>6) And of course the aggro effect of the equivalent spell is transferred directly to the archer.... nothing new there.<P>7) There is still a chance that the arrow will miss its target and the spell could still be resisted.  I would suggest that it shouldn't be able to 'fizzle' again though.<P>I don't think that everyone is going to put down their druids, necromancers etc and start playing rangers and warriors - for one thing we will need these casters to make our arrows - but it will help to make archery a more viable skill although whilst keeping it as an expensive luxury.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't know the possibility of this.  In fact, it's probably not possible.  But it occurs to me that if delay works the way I think it does (ie the delay of the arrow and bow are added together) it might be interesting to see arrows with negative delays (if possible):<P>"I tell you, Margok, the arrows fairly leapt from my bow.  Why, if I didn't know better I'd swear it took off before I had even let go of the bowstring..."<P>Sure, even if possible you couldn't do MUCH in this direction, but it's another possibility given that there's such limitation on what you can already do with the arrows..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Iposted this on the gameplay board, and didn't get a response, let's see what it does here.<BR>I've got a couple of questions for Verant.<P>1)Would it be possibe to have arrows that have effects such as Flame arrows, Ice arrows, Undead arrows, and Poison arrows?<P>2)Would it be possible to have Bows that Proc?<P>3)Would it be possible to allow fletchers the ability to place enchantments on bows?(ie, allow the fletcher to assign stat modifiers to bows)<P>Now, as far as the arrows with effects go, it would be like casting a DoT on a MoB when the arrow hits. Now of course the MoB would have a chance to resist, but it would be so nice to be able to snare a foe at the same time as hitting for some decent dammage. In order to create these arrows, you would need other items as well, which shouldn't be a problem with the 8 slots available in the Fletching kit. For fire arrows, you would need a FireDrake scale, and so on for the others.<P>As for Bows that Proc, have it work just like the weapons that do.<P>About the Enchantment of bows made by fletchers, allow them to select from 3 stat modifiers. They are given 3 points to add to any stat, so a Bow could have +3 to STR, or +1 STR and +2int. This wouldn't be too hard to add the 30 or so Items you could create into the Item database to be referenced to.<P>And while I realize that Archery was never meant to be a form of combat in EQ, with just a couple of adjustments, it would be a great supplement to combat, and make the skill of fletching more useful, and Profitable (IE jewelcrafting)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If arrows can't be given procs of any sort, that sort of limits things.<P>If I remember right, don't arrows have a delay?  (It's always "0")  If that functionality works, that could give some new options:  An arrow that's 100 damage, 150 range but, to limit it, also adds 300 delay to the weapon.<P>But here's an easy one:<P>Bows can have stats.  The one off the Froglok Forager in TT gives the holder +3 dex for instance.  Suppose we added some 'magic ingredients' to bow making.<P>wood + string = bow<BR>wood + string + greater lightstone = bow that glows<BR>wood + string + undead froglok tongue = bow with +5 poison resist<BR>wood + string + Flowing Black Silk Sash = bow with haste :)<P>Just examples.  I'm sure we could come up with 100 more in about 5 minutes.  The question (for implementation) would be if you could then do:<BR>wood + string + FBSS + tongue + lightstone = glowing haste bow with +5 PR.<P>A bow like that would still suck for damage, but at least it would be useful as a beneficial inventory item.<P>Alternatively, you could make the formulas work with completed bows:<BR>finished Darkwood Bow + lightstone = identical bow to what you started with, but it glows<P>I'd kill to combine my Runed Bone Fork into a bow so I could carry a bow that granted the resists I get when I use the RBF.  (Everyone who switches between a bow and a RBF and has accidentially thrown their RBF when they forget to switch back please raise your hand... thank you.)<P>Also, bows can have magic effects.  Another world of possibilities.  Perhaps combining with a griffon eye would grant permanent see invis (like the necklace in Droga) or unlimited charges or castable see invis (like the Bracer of the Hidden) or 10 charges of castable see invis, etc.<P><BR>Basically, if we can't do anything exciting with arrows, we at least know there's a lot of room for improvement on the bow without having to change anything on it's combat (in)effectiveness.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, being able to get new types of feathers sounds good to me! Especially griffon feathers. "Oh GrimFeather . . . my arrows need more feathers . . ." *wicked grin*<P>The, er, bird beaks sound good as an alternative magic arrowhead, but here's an idea for something high-level? 'Dragon talons'?<BR>Oh come on, you know you want to see people using those just to show off how they're good  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> To balance them, make the arrows nodrop?<P>New bows possible? Lighting-blasted wood from the Plane of Sky? Heartwood bow stave (think darkwood but only drops and provides better delay/damage)?<BR>Strings . . . making silk strings sound good. But tailors making another type of string? 'Drachling silk string'? Those need to be useful for something at least.<BR>There's lacquer now, isn't there? Composite bows anyone? <BR>Some sort of bone bow stave from a creature? <P>Adding abilities to arrows/bows? Can we say 'poisoning'? Rogues suddenly get that skill in demand . . . make poison vials, combine with a bow to get a proc Poison or something else?<BR>Fire beetle eyes making fiery arrows: Now there's another use for them! And can they be made to be a light source too for night-blind humans?<BR>Maybe these can be limited in charge to balance them (all right, someone asking for nerfed items which don't exist yet! J/K) not a FEW charges, say, 20, the size of a stack of arrows. Then we might get to sell bows . . .<P>Hmm, a really interesting idea, just way out there for you archers who want something to drool over having.<BR>"Dragon-horn bow of the Ykesha"<BR>Think on that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>As a humble fletcher (skill 114) I want some interesting future items in my range other than good bows. Let us make more magical arrows at lower skill, even if they are less effective than silver-tipped. I do not want to have to keep pulling ghouls with spells, as it draws others too . . .<P>Anyway, it's late here and I just wanted to toss in my 2 copper (I fought hard for these, darnit, quit snickering; Broon just did NOT want to give up his lunch money!)<P>Alpheus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about snake fangs for arrowheads, or as optional 'barbs' for arrows? Extremely low level, seeing as how snake fangs (not the giant kind) are only a copper apiece, for very low damage, but good for cutting expenses for the fletcher on a budget.<P>And perhaps Bixie stingers, Scorpion stings, giant wasp stingers, etc. They all rather fit the look and feel of arrowheads.  And I honestly don't know of a quest involving bixie stingers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought, <P>But IIRC when combining certain gems and metals (componants) in jewelrycraft certain maic effects, and stat bonuses are added to the finished item..<P>Now with fletching for both arrows and bows the combination of certain componants produces a better arrow/bow.<P>New if a player were to have BOTH skills ( and no i dont mean two players, only one player here) to a certain level, perhaps they would be able to use there "Advanced Fletching Kit" to combine certain gems etc into the bow or arrow to produce said effect.<P>You could use the same tables as the jewelrycraft to decide what effect goes in to the finished item.<P>Now if arrows cant "proc" effects, can they have stat bonuses, that bonus applies to that "shot" only.<P>As for bows, same thing, but the effect would be permanent. <P>Obviously only one gem/metal would be allowed to be applied at a time, and i would sugest that existing proporties are reduced.<P>e.g. if you add +1 str to a bow, you also add +1 delay or -1 damage.<P>WW</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
