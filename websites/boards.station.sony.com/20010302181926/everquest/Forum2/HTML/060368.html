</FONT><HR>Chyrlene:<P>Please give us more credit than that flip answer.  Aggro control?  I'm sorry, but besides Enchanters, who have an admittedly tough job, other casters can self regulate their aggro, ie Don't over-nuke.<P>If a Wizard doesn't want aggro, he waits a bit before nuking.  Times his nukes, etc.<P>Do you believe a Cleric can do that?  Tank_02 says "Please heal me!" and Cleric_01 replies "Sorry dude, I just threw a heal at Tank_01 and Rogue_04, I can't heal you until you take another 20% of that mob... or if you can last 30 seconds more while taunting, I'll risk it."<P>Clerics cast heals when they are REQUIRED.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, Phasefire, take the sage advice of those posting above.  "Learn crowd control" and "avoid aggro".  IOW: Don't heal.<P>You'll still end up dead, but at least you'll get to see everyone else die before you.

</FONT><HR>You guys are idiots.  There is a BIG difference in a cleric healing compared to a caster mezing or damaging mobs.  <P>The difference is that a caster has a CHOICE to not cast a damage spell UNTIL the appropiate time.  Even an enchanter has a choice.  He/she can chose to cast a single mez vrs an AE mez.  Course there is still a BIG difference there also considering if the spell succeeds, the mob stands still and does not rush the enchanter.  <P>Dont even start with that crap "you can root" cause with my 51 enchanter, I use immobolize at times and I am lucky if it lasts more than 5 seconds.   Nevermind that the spell adds MORE agro.<P>A cleric has ZERO control on agro.  The choice for the cleric is... <BR>1) Heal "X" person and possiblly get agroed (deff. will get agroed if person "X" is getting damaged faster than group can damage the mob)<P>2) Let person "X" die.  <P><BR>Hmmm,  I will take that back.  I guess a cleric COULD do some agro management.  Course, I dont think anyone wants a cleric who lets ppl die so he can survive and heal the rest of the group.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kraegor:<P>Your suggestions seem fairly reasonable, and I am sure that with practice, Clerics (those that stick it out) will adjust, but it won't be as simple as this.<P>There are times when I group where my Healing powers are not taxed (ie I don't go low on mana overmuch) but there are many times where mana conservation is crucial, ie I go to 20% during a pull even if I am medding whenever I am not casting.  With Clarity I can usually med enough back between pulls to keep the flow constant.  If I am forced to double up heals, not use Complete Heal, and heal early, the reult will be me going OOM, being unable to med as much because I will be getting hit more, and a lot more downtime.<P>And what do you think might be a consequence?<P>Either the Druids and Shamen stop nuking and start healing (be careful what you wish for guys) or perhaps you'll see shouts of "Group seeks TWO Clerics"<P>Of course, not everything needs to be doom and gloom.  I have every faith that a fair workaround will be found.  However, if this aggro 'balancing' is Verant's way of getting Complete Heal out of the game without actually having to remove it and suffer all the negative publicity, I'd rather they just take the spell and save us all the death and xp-loss we'll have to endure before we figure it out ourselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Um, question, Are you all wacked?  How the heck to you control agro with the new biggest AoE taunt in the game?  CH!  The answer is, you cannot.  Clerics are to heal the tanks.  They have to use CH or they can not do there jobs PERIODE!  They don't have an option not to use it.  When the tank is almost dead they cast CH pure and simple.  Now CH is the biggest AoE taunting spell in the hole game.  There is nothing a cleric can do to get the mobs off of them.  Chanters can AoE stun and AoE mes.  Don't even think that all Clerics have to do is play smarter now.  This nerv has basically killed the Clerics main ability and that is to CH.  Here we have a lvl 60 Cleric who has basically done the right thing for all I can tell.  We had a Cleric log last night due to the same thing.  How would you like to die every time you cast the only spell that made you viable in your group and it cause you certain death every time?  Catch a clue folks and realize what this has done to everyone in Norrath.  I sure would not want to be in the Clerics shoes right now and I am a freaking Wizard for gods sakes!  I would not be surprised if they all all High level Clerics go on protest or just retire there Characters all together now.  Basically all they are good for are Resurections now anyways.  Um, what is a Warrior good for without a Cleric?  I guess the solo classes will rane supream now in Norrath becuase without Clerics in groups in the high level game grouping is over.  /sigh<P>Kelhadar Drakain<BR>55 Evoker Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>'now you'll have to think like enchanters.'<P>Huh?  Ridiculous statement.  All these other classes have ways to reduce or avoid aggro, clerics do not.  There's even this neat little chanter spell called 'mem blur'.  Does a cleric have that?  No.  Do they have Evade?  Concussion?  Feign Death?  The answer is no.  <P>Can they time their job so that a sufficient amount of aggro is built up on someone else?  No.<P>'the cap below 51 was 800 hate, regardless of how many HP are healed.'  800 hate?  So, if a cleric heals, mob turns on him -- now the group has to do 800dmg while this thing beats on the cleric....and then he'll have to heal himself afterwards, re-aggroing again.<P>And if there's more than 1 mob?<P>I'm sorry, but you people are the nearsighted ones.  Either that or n00bs in lower guk.  This is a serious change, i.e. nerf....and totally defeats most of the high lvl game.  Warriors with optimum weapons and taunt skills can no longer taunt uber mobs off of the clerics, who die one by one in every encounter.  So what now on mobs with 1,000,000+ hp?<P><BR>Kudos Verant...those late-night beer bong decision making parties are certainly the way to go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem has been that cheal was WAY WAY WAY too powerful a spell, and really shouldn't have been put in the game in the first place.  Rather, more powerful heals should have been provided.  You all know the strategy EVERY high level cleric has used, let the mob pound on the melees until the melees are getting close to death, and time the cheal to land just before death for best mana to healing ratio.<P>Ummmm, no, the idea should be not to let the melees get that low in the first place.  Velious Uber-mobs aside, that strategy is why the warrior-cleric combo was considered overpowered by Verant and the rest of the playerbase.  So Verant decided to do something about it, without removing cheal.  It's a change that will help game balance overall, but will also require a bit of game tuneing as well, now that cheal won't be the solution to every uber encounter out there.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is obviously one of those things thats best left 'broken' but from the horror stories i heard last night, and having witnessed it myself, its rather obvious that this helps no one.  EVERY time our cleric did a CH she was aggroed hard, This means if you dont have a chanter in your group, your screwed, plain and simple.  This alters the entire balance of the game, it forces you to have crowd control, if you pull more then 2 monsters, your cleric is going to go down everytime she heals.  Remember, that 5000 point CH you just cast on that tank just jumped you not only to the top of that one mob he was fightings list, but everyone else in the immediate area.  So what now? are the warriors going to have to taunt mezed mobs for 30 minutes before its okay to break it?  Maybe this is the warriors more usefulness upgrade? Not to mention that enchanters just became even MORE of a required member of the group *laugh*...<P>Oh, our servers Uberguild Legacy of Steel had a lovely time with Velketor last night, apparently every time the cleric CH'ed, he was killed a second later I wish verant would think about things like 'hey that mob quad hits for 850+ damage..thats kinda hard to ignore when you consider the need for CH....ya know you can only have so many clerics.  And the clerics can only have so much 'new and exciting fun' running around from mobs after they aggro.<P>Azith<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I couldn't agree more with the poster.  I hope verant does something about this one.  I had been hunting in icewell keep for the past few weeks with almost the same people.  We had 3 groups with 3 clerics.  With every ch the clerics did, we were dead within 30 seconds or less.  This happened 3 times before we said to hell with it.  Total party wipe out 3 times..ridiculous.  Before the patch, we were able to heal a few times atleast without getting aggroed and when we did get aggroed, the tanks had time to taunt it off.  Last nite..no chance of the tanks taunting it off of me.  High end mobs, alot are MR resistant, so you can forget root/stun and snare and mezzing in some places.  Someone mentioned atone in another thread, I almost couldn't stop laughing enough to type out my response.  Atone is a sorry spell in the 50's.  My armor isn't wimpy, I have all planar and then some other nice stuff..so it's not like I'm in level 30 stuff.  I'm in appropriate attire for my level.<P>I'm truly disappointed.  I've never "whined" about the cleric class before, but I think my EQ days are numbered if they let this aggro thing go through.<P>I've noticed some people saying quit *****ing, well, just wait, if the cleric dies, the tank dies, the evacer dies, the enchanter dies...you all die..it will affect you.  When this becomes common place and you get sick of it, you will remember these threads.  If this isn't happening in your groups last nite, my guess is you aren't fighting in challenging enough areas.<P>Saphdia - disappointed 54 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So, Chyrlene, the "bottom line" of your agrument is that you fully agree that CH has, for all intents and purposes been removed from the game and the cleric class should just live with it.<P>Most of them won't.<P>I wish you good luck with your druid and shaman primary healers.  Not the top 10% who know what they're doing, the other 90% who cast heal at one bubble down in a three mob fight and spend the rest of the fight running around the map "kiting" the aggroed mobs.<P>You should live about as long as the CH clerics would have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mob 80% Tank 30%?  Yeah, it does sound like a problem.<P>I solo a lot, so I'm used to seeing that health bar drop down to the nether regions (Yes, I sweat a lot at the computer. Why do you ask?) <P>But one of the things I've noticed with the regular groups I'm with is that I almost NEVER get below 60%.  Drop  a bubble, I see a healer casting on me.<P>CH Heal may be a mana efficient way to do things.  But it comes with a penalty.  A big enough penalty that perhaps you should only consider using it under the most dire of circumstances.<P>Fortunatly, it's not your only weapon.  Figure out which weapon (spell) to use at the applicable time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060368&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060368&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
