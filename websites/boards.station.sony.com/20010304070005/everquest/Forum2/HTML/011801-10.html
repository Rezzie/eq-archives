Although, if I remember right, they didn't let players use spells.  If they hadn't let bards use their songs the battles would have lasted about 30 seconds each.  <P>It would have been more enjoyable if they had let the bards into the caster duels.  =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am not saying we should have been in the test of steel, I was merely mentioning that because that was the contest where they left out monks, while seemed to have thought they were in the contest.<P>They said that rangers could compete, but there were no ranger rewards, but instead monk rewards.  It said something like for a monk " a monk weapon of similar strength yet to be created" (paraphrased) but yet monks couldn't compete.<P><BR>Bards should have been put in SOMEWHERE though.

</FONT><HR>Ok folks, i put similar words up on a different thread and here goes again, i think tons of folks are really missing the underlying issues--<P>bards in general have received little support from verant in general. software defects that have been in existance for 6+ months is just not acceptable. when somebody complained on the board that the 50+ snare song was being used as an exploit in karnor's the song nerf went live in a matter of days. we've waited since solsek ro opened for that stoopid bardic weapon quest. once again don't miss the point-we don't care about the weapon. we do notice that bugs are not fixed for months, but damn can verant move when somebody cries exploit.<P>how bout some long overdue bug fixes in addition to the few songs folks are currently complaining about. <P>nemesion<BR>42 bard@prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

A song that we have to sing non-stop to hold up to four mobs asleep is only good in a group. It's not gonna make us better soloers, can't even really use it while soloing.<P>Chanters would be the only class that could be upset by us being given some limited crowd control, but as far as I can tell they are not opposed to the change either.<P>Doh, guess I rambled a bit ;) Anywayz thanks to everyone who chipped in with a voice of support.<P>Elloden Notespinner, Level 53 Bard, Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Nice for newb bards, or folks wanting to fix some faction or other.  Not a bad quest for the effort it takes to do it.<P>How about the Burynai Bundt Cake quest in FV?  How many times has that been asked yet never answered?  Heck, all we want to know is if the blasted cake is in the game.  I guess this is another one of those "mystery" things VI likes to toss out.  <P>Folks, with a thread that has stayed on Page 1 since it was made, already up to 10 pages, and over 350 posts, VI is *not* ignoring this thread.  Personally, I think they are hoping we will just settle down after a while.<P>Don't let them get away with it this time.  Every time something has happened, we have grumbles a bit, then went back to business as usual.

</FONT><HR>Ok posting this on a chance this will be read. I've posted before and nothings been done about it.<P>The bards 55th song Cantana of Replenishment has a stacking problem. This happens with any spell that has a mana component or a health regeneration component. Now if you cast clarity/regen before the song and then sing it stacks fine. But it won't stack the other way around. ITS VERY ANNOYING to have to stop song everytime someone wants chloro or clarity in a group. IF its stacks one way it SHOULD stack the other way.<P>2) Bard drops in hate on cazic thule server at least have been HORRID. This game is supposed to be balanced. I have been up in hate for 2 weeks running and maybe 3 pieces total imbrued drop. Someone needs to turn up the random drops on bard armor or at least examan that. Any bard on our server will tell you that the drops are atrocious.<P><BR>Make me a happy bard do not make excuses just FIX it.

</FONT><HR>I got to thinking...maybe, just MAYBE, they named the song incorrectly, much in the way they neglected to mention the double resist checks. MAYBE, the song is supposed to be called "Kelin's Taunting Tremelo" and the "resist rates" that many of us have calculated were actually "success rates." MAYBE, the MOB "nods" because your taunts are boring the creature. You know, much in the way that sticking your tongue at someone when you are four years old is mean, but doing it when you are forty is just...dumb? So, MAYBE we've all been wrong, and the song does work correctly. Just a thought...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, please don't try to suspend our hopes with a promise of examining pixie strike.  After your statement regarding the drum graphic, it is quite clear that your knowledge of bards is less than zero, no offense but the plain truth.  I am (oddly enough) not upset that this issue has taken nearly a year to address.  I am VERY upset that after all this time you can somehow come to the conclusion that Kelin's Lucid Lullaby is useful in any scenario beyond level 35.<P>I don't complain much about EverQuest, as I have little to complain about.  It's a terrific game.  But when I do speak up, it's usually about something that deserves a second look.  This line of songs needs work.  Given your lack of knowledge of bards, how can you justify making decisions affecting them?  Who was the "customer on the phone" and how much experience did he have?<P>So I have a proposal.  I invite either you, GZ, Ester, or any of the coders to call or email me to assist you in collecting data and results for these songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike, Twilight).  I will offer an honest opinion with no desire to "overpower" the bard class.  I don't see how anyone could possibly call bards the "weakest class in the game" in the first place.  Most of the songs are NOT broken and do have their usefulness in the right situation.  I pray that you accept my offer so that this matter can be properly resolved.  I don't think this will escape the minds of the players until something happens.<P>And just think... then everyone could blame ME instead of you or Ester!<P>Sincerely,<BR>Nexroth, student of the Absonant Bind<BR>Senior Senator of the Oracle of Virtue<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>born March 30, 1999<P>CONTACT:  nexroth@oracleofvirtue.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I might as well post my support, and my desire to see this thread exceed 400 posts.<P>Most of what I will say has been said before, but I will restate it for the record.  I am trying very hard to comprehend the statements made by both Ester and Abashi. <BR> <BR>Ester said that the song does not increase in effectiveness and is not intended for us above level 30.<P>  That is total and complete baloney.  Nearly every song that bards get increase in effectiveness as the bard increases in level.  Exceptions to this would be the level 4 song, you can't point yourself at a corpse any better, the level 21 song, you can't do a short range tp any better, the level 31 song, levitate is levitate and maybe one other that I am not thinking of.  That is the point of bards getting so few songs, the fact that they do get better (increase effect) as the bard increases.  We don't get new versions of songs (no upgrades).  A song can and should remain useful for the bard's entire career.  The exception to this is the post 50 songs, several of those seem to have a combination of effects that remove a bard's need to twist certain songs.  The combination is weaker than twisting the two original songs, but hey, we can do more at once with them, it's a trade off.  <P>Abashi said that the primary resist lowers as the bard increases level, but the secondary resist remains constant, as it should.  <P>  Excuse me, did you say as it should?  Exactly what form of skewed logic are you using?  The first part of your statement is correct, the resistance rate should go down as the gap between levels increases.  It is the secondary resist that is the issue, with a constant 35% resist rate on all creatures, the song is effectively made useless.  As any PC gets up higher and higher level, there should be a lower and lower chance of monsters resisting (assuming that you have a constant monster level to the PCs increase in level).  Absolutely no class would even be considered balanced, or even well thought out, if a level one creature had the same chance to resist them at level 15 as they did at level 60.  <P>Abashi also said that a song that uses no mana could never be as powerful as a spell that uses mana.<P>  Again, this has been refuted in so many ways, but I'l like to make sure that you were aware of a couple things when you made that statement.  I'm sure that you knew that the most creatures a bard can affect with an AE is 4.  This is true for the mez and true for the level 43 song (not sure on other AE songs).  Is there a limit of 4 on the enchanter spell?  The duration on the bard mez is already 1/3 that of the weakest enchanter version.  An enchanter's level 16 mez lasts about 18 seconds, a bard's mez will last at most 6.  We are already not as strong as the mana version.  Each tick we are refreshing the song, which means that each tick they get new saves against the song anyway.  That is 3 times the chance of the monster making a save than against the enchanter version.  Okay, enchanter casts mez, he isn't in the middle of the group of monsters, he sits and meds for 2 ticks (assuming he doesn't want to do anythint else), he recovers (some, all or more) of his mana.  Bard has to be in the middle of the group of monsters, has to refresh the song at every tick and has no choice but to do nothing else.  Then you add the secondary resist?  Result: Bards buy the spell and then never use it after the first couple of attempts because it gets them dead fast. <P>Abashi's comment on the drum animation convinces me that it isn't a single person posting under that username.  I am certain that Abashi knows of the drum animation issue, it has been raised before, and he has commented on it before, yet now he doesn't know anything?  Evidence of my theory being the weird hours that he posts, his knowledge of a subject then later his ignorance on the same exact subject,  his ability to directly contradict his own statements.  An alternative would be a frazzled person with no ability to retain long term memory.  I like the first theory better, the second implies that he doesn't keep track of issues raised over the long term.  <P>If I may make a suggestion, it would be easy to keep notes.  A simple binder with sections marked for class concerns.  A subsection for each class.  Jot down concerns as they are raised, if the same concerns come up again and again and again, put checkmarks next to that line.  Once in a while post regarding each class that has raised concerns and address the repeated concerns with soundly reasoned full explanations of why/why not something will be changed.  If the concern is raised again, then point to the previous post, if it is refuting the explanation with new material, then note it for the next 'state of the balance' post for that class (or explain better in response to that particular thread).   Similar sections can be kept for other types of concerns.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Having just been exposed to Skalme's pompous personal attacks, I ponder how best to express my disgust at Skalme's total lack of sensitivity and reasoning. Unless you share my view that learning the truth can be a painful experience, especially for Skalme, there's no need for you to hear me further. I can repeat with undiminished conviction something I said eons ago: His claim that he is a bearer and agent of the Creator's purpose is not only an attack on the concept of objectivity, but an assault on the human mind. To bring the matter closer to home, let me remind you that his statements such as "Governments should have the right to lie to their own subjects or to other governments" indicate that we're not all looking at the same set of facts. Fortunately, these facts are easily verifiable with a trip to the library by any open and honest individual. We must fight the warped, distorted, misshapen, unwholesome monstrosity that Skalme's words have become. Our children depend on that. <P>It's one thing to resort to underhanded tactics, but wanting to canonize anal-retentive bigamists as nomological emblems of propriety is undoubtedly going too far. Even if our society had no social problems at all, we could still say that Skalme's utterances are not witty satire, as he would have you believe. They're simply the malicious ramblings of someone who has no idea or appreciation of what he's mocking. Sincerely, a great many of us don't want Skalme to ascribe opinions to me that I don't even hold. But we feel a prodigious pressure to smile, to be nice, and not to object to his hectoring zingers. The bottom line is that my earnest denunciation of Skalme's catch-phrases must have failed to register with Skalme as being legitimate sentiment.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nice post Skalme. We keep all saying the same thing in different ways, holding out hope that one of these ways will make Verant go "OH!  So THAT'S what they mean?  Maybe we SHOULD look at this again."<P>There are several posts on here that explain in detail what is "wrong" with Verant's statements on both the Chains and Mez issue.<P>Either put both resists into one, and make it an average of the two percentages, improving with each level and capping at 30th like they claim...or lower the secondary resist at least a little bit.<P>The no mana arguement doesnt wash, there are so many other things that hinder a bard.  No twisting ability during song, resist checks on every tick, having to be "close" to the action, less duration then Chanter Mez, limit of 4,etc.  It hardly seems that not needing mana to cast this is an advantage at all.  Chanters still would have the best Mez without the secondary resist.<P>The "no-fight" arguement on Chains doesnt work either.  Even when a mob isnt snared in any way, they are running away, they DO NOT fight.  Any snare spell will stop them. Using Verant's logic ALL snare spells should be nerfed (which i dont want).  As is though, this song is still useable, the only danger is that the mob will get away and call freinds, but i have still been able to use this song without that happening.<P>The Mez song though is an entirely different story.  It is UNUSABLE.  I tested it the other night, and luckily mezzed 3 mobs on the first tick.  However, 6 seconds later, they ALL resisted and i got my ass whooped until the next tick, where 1 was mezzed.  Next try, none were mezzed. I didnt get any further, i died while fending off 3 mobs, all around 25th level (i am 33). No taunt would get them off me.  Might as well throw this song out.<P>I let my group know now that i can mez ONE creature only, right up front, then i use my Charm song.  This song is dangerous in itself, but at least i have a chance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
