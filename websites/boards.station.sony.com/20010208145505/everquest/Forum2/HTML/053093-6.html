</FONT><HR>Meeka you defenitly have a point with AoE taunt. Rouges may deal more dmg then warriors but without a warrior to taunt it makes it harder for them too. Maybe varent can set up a system where if you help rouges be able to backstab youll do a bonus point dmg on commission ?

</FONT><HR>Yes, everyone has adapted to the current situations.  But it gets boring using the same strategy over and over again.  New skill mean new strategies.  If Verant wanted people getting bored with the game, they wouldn't keep changing/adding things.  I agree with you that Warriors are well balanced already and don't really need any further tweaking.  The AoE taunt isn't really any new skill for us, it would be an expansion of a current skill.  I don't really think it would cause any balance issues, either.  It would really help in certain situations, though, and I'm all for being able to do my job better. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> My main character is a level 44 Warrior and only have and see a few problems with the balance but after reading all the other posts in the thread think many ask for way to much, im sure I wont be liked but am posting only what I think is best and easiest.<P>Kick... Normal kick for me is about 15-18 damage, true it adds up over a long fight but all those kicks in one fight equal about the same as one Critical Hit. Not worth all the Stamina to me.<P>Taunt... We have Taunt? Yes we do have supposedly a slightly higher taunt than any class but as mentioned compared to a lower level SK it is useless to try most the time.<P>Bind Wounds...  is fine as is, yes id like to see it higher but think every class should rely on another class for some thing. no reason to change it.<P>Shields... I know from alpha testing other online games one wearable on the back is not some thing that will happen here way to much to ask for BUT<BR>more weapons with AC on them is a better alternative I think. maybe add AC to existing weapons?<P>Critical Hits... Seems half my criticals are from Kicking, a real waste to kick for 32 points specialy when my normal Crits arent as high as a normal Rogue Back Stab.<P>AC/HPs... If we had any more than we did we would be unbalanced, I seem to be the only who things so but if you balance your armor and items right you have many more than any other class but a little extra on weapons would help our group value.<P>Binding... I have not seen most of Norrath in the near year ive played mainly because I dont want to run across 5 zones with no armor or weapon to get my corpse only to die again on the way even though im supposedly A Ghost, Why can living things see and kill us? thats besides the point.<BR>id be in more groups and travel more if I knew I could be bound some place near where I was going.<P>Main idea to finalize the balance for Warriors is to disable Critical Hits from Kicking so that when it does go off it is usefull and not basicaly wasted.<P>Secondly A more effective Taunt since we are the main Damage dealers that are closest to a mob why do mobs decide Hey ill go attack the cleric way over there?<P>Those are the only two things I think are truely needed, without our Taunts working we arent of any use to a group and with out doing some damage when a Critical goes off whats the point of having it unless kick damage is raised slightly.<P>Dont hate me for not wanting every thing lol I do want every thing but dont think some things are Needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Three things;<P>1) DISARM is worthless - I really like the idea of it, but in practical application it is honestly worthless.<P>2) Berserker Frenzy &lt;= 2 bubbles of health - Someone previously suggested that this could be changed to be a skill/button. I really like the idea, and it fits with the class. Same type of cycle as LH or HT, gets better with age, all that. I think this might change it from a useless novelty to something to look forward to without screwing up class balance.<P>3) Trolls in 1st person view - I currently play a high level human warrior, only because when I got my first decent stell helmet as a troll, I couldn't see when attacking. Try it out; it's really irritating. Enough so that I re-rolled my character and started over.<P>Cheers,<P>Rip</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Inability to obtain decent resist stats while maintaining ac, str and dex. Every time I go on a large raid that requires extra resist stats, I sacrafice so much on my main stats just to achieve the minimum resist before buffs. Whereas casters seem to easily be able to achieve these numbers. We need gear with more resist stats on it, please or have our natural resists raised.<P>2. Give us a warrior only cloak with decent stats. I'm tired of losing rolls to hybrids because it has +wis or +int or clerics who insist they need the extra ac. I told the last cleric who won the turtle shell that he could tank the mobs and I'd stand back and bind wounds on him.<P>3. Verant seems to have this philosophy that warrior armor needs to be placed in the hardest to get at places or be the rarest drops. I don't have to take my boots off to count the number of cobalt helms and bracers on E`ci. What gives here? I mean ac and damage taking define a warrior, so why make the armor the hardest to get?<P>4. Warrior Epic quest makes no sense at all from a story line. The drop rate on items is horrible based on the difficulty of the encounters.<P>5. The Epic weapon scabbard is a joke!!!! a 4 slot container that I have to carry around if I want to switch weapons? Gimme a break!!! I can't put other stuff in it, because it has a combine button. It is basically a worthless item I have to carry around to be able to switch weapons.<P>6. Why would anyone use the 2handed warrior epic weapon for anything other than the auto riposte discipline? When I equip it instead of the 2 1handed weapons, I lose 51 attack and 40 dex and I gain 50 extra on the DD spell proc. HMMMMM with 51 less attack and 40 less dex, I miss a whole lot more often and I proc a whole lot less often, so why would I ever chose to use this weapon? Am I missing something?<P>7. Warriors should be able to resist summons. Why should anything be unresistable?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hmmm, Im 49th lvl so I dont have much to say about the diciplines. I do however have a few things I would like to see addressed:<P><BR>Critical hits/crippling blows: They occur often enough but I can stand to see a critical hit of 18 with a Wurmslayer when my usual damage on nearly every round is in the 60 to 90 range. I dont give a dern about the math or the argument Verant uses to justify this. Yeah, crits/crips may just be eye candy but in my opinion, they are rare enough let us see at LEAST the amount of damage the weapon is rated for PLUS our damage bonuses. Im sick of Crits in the 3 to 20point range....thats just a normal ****ty hit if you ask me so what makes it a critical hit?<P>Warrior Epic Quest: For the Love of GOD! I want to see this quest looked at. I understand the need for Verant to make these weapons rare but two DRAGONS? geesh as if the Sarnak Queen wasnt hard e-freakin-nuff. 8) I would like to see ALL but one of the quest components be attainable by a SINGLE balanced group of level 60's. And the remaining encounter hard enough that multiple groups of mid 50's and 60s are needed to acquire it. Geesh Verant you have made single group centric game here, dont you think you should design the encounters to cater to that player configuration?<P>SOMETHING to DO between 45 and 51 besides moan about the class: Casters get the world and you give em more! They have spells regularly dispersed to them all the way up. WHAT do warriors get besides a chance to max all of our weapon skills. (Which BTW you would have maxed anyway if you're worth your salt as a warrior.) I dont have any suggestions here. Maybe weapon specialization (though I think you've shot that down already) maybe ummm, some new diciplines I dunno but give us a reason to keep playing! That may be one of the reasons you dont see many high lvl warriors in the game. (at least on my server.)<P>On a related note, I know that Verant likes to promote a player driven economy. However, to reinforce what someone eluded to earlier, anyone that has played a warrior from level one cant even come close to affording these items. Thus we are reduced to using inferior weapons while your "Caster chosen" either auction our gear for insane amounts of money. (So much money, in fact that only other members of your "Caster chosen" can afford it!) OR they just twink a noob warrior and powerlevel him up to my hard-earned level. We are a gear centric class, gear is what makes and breaks us. Our gear is usually what makes and breaks a group. Anyone that has played a warrior knows that our gear upgrades keep us broke all the way up the leveling ladder. Please, give us old-timers (the hardend fellows that had to wait until level 15 to dual wield, or wielded combine scimitars until lvl 35 8P) the chance to upgrade that we deserve! AND let us do it without abandoning our good friends in our smallish guilds to join uber guilds to make ends meet. Make our items no drop please. <P>TAUNT: Hmmm, one question here. Why can I taunt off a lvl 54 warrior using a Lamentation blade and a jade mace when I am wielding merely two FS daggers? I Dont think that should ever happen. Obviously, you have Taunt intrinsically tied to the NUMBER of attacks per round moreso than the  than the amount of damage done. This poor uber chump (who's primary crit BTW is a Necro - grrrr.) Was begging me not to taunt so he could go berserk. I even stopped attacking and was still was gettin' an arse whoopin'! Im not really interested in the numbers but please weight the amount of damage more than the number of attacks. This might make 2HS a more viable option at higher levels. Dunno how that would affect the taunt disparity between Us, Hybrids, and Casters though. So I encourage all you warriors out there give the two FS dagger test a go and see what happens. More info here might be useful. *shrug* It might have been a fluke. But it was about a 6 hour camp in the doggie Capt room and I had no problem taunting from him all day. In fact I eventually stopped taunting all together. <P>Finally, I think that all warriors that had the balls (figuratively for you lady warriors out there) to worship Rallos Zek should get some sort of stat advantage over all other warriors while we are berserk! Eat that you agnostic WIMPS! 8) Or at the very LEAST make all Rallos Zek worshipping warriors non KOS to ALL the MOBs in the giant city of Velious. <P><BR>O and one more thing....I LOVE clerics but a Cleric with BASH???? Give me a freaking break! Clerics need to be on their butts waiting with baited breath just to heal me. 8) They dont need to be up meleeing. Its bad enough that you gave bash to the shorties (referring to kick w/ stun here) without a shield! GRRRRRR! There should be a disadvantage to choosing a shortie just as there are disadvantages to picking a large race. <BR>Also, for the noobs these disadvantages should be CLEARLY STATED on the character creation screen so that people can make an informed decision when creating their first class. <P><BR>Thank you for your time and attention 8)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I had planned on saving this for the ranger thread, but I guess it does bear posting here:<P>The issue of taunt being ineffective is, more often than not, the fault of dumb players.  It is entirely possible to keep a mob off of a monk, rogue, wizard, etc as long as they are doing their best to avoid aggro.  The times when I go nuts trying and failing to taunt are when the rogue doesn't evade, or the wizard empties all his mana chain nuking right off the bat, or other such foolish actions.  If people played their classes properly, this wouldn't be an issue, and those too dumb to avoid over-aggroing probably deserve the deaths they get.<P>The one exception to this is rangers.  Rangers are simply a suicidal class.  They are the fastest hitting and highest damage dealing hybrid, which means they draw a large amount of aggro on themselves.  Furthermore, their spells (dots, nukes, and especially snare) are huge taunts.  This, coupled with the fact that they have very low AC and HP for a melee or hybrid and most importantly no way to shed aggro pre-jolt leads to some serious problems.  The only way I can taunt off of a ranger effectively is if they use a slow 2 handed weapon and don't cast, removing well over half of their effectiveness.<P>For rangers to be able to make use of their full potential and actually provide a benefit to their group, there must be a better way to taunt off of them, pre-jolt.  Increasing a warrior's taunt effectiveness would be one answer, but the best solution is probably adding a skill to allow rangers to shed aggro, something like evade.<P>I think I speak for many many warriors when I say that the best thing you can do to "fix" warriors to make our class more enjoyable and effective would be to fix rangers.  Nothing, not even the ability to gate, bind, and sow ourselves or something equally ridiculous would alleviate more frustration than making it possible for a warrior to keep a mob off of a ranger (or the ranger to keep the mob on the warrior, whichever).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  I would like to say first off that I do not play a Warrior, never have, I only play Casters. But I like Warriors seeing as they keep me alive  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>  <BR>  Positive changes I think warriors should have are as follows..<BR> <P>  1. Already mentioned, Bind wounds...I have always thought warriors should be the best class at binding wounds, it just makes sense, ever seen Braveheart? 'Nuff said  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR> <P>  2. Also already mentioned, Taunt, Warriors should have some mega taunt that reloads after a short delay that has almost a complete chance of being successful.<BR> <P>  3. That battle cry sounded interesting... maybe something called "Battle cry" That boosted str or Stamina for a short period of time?<BR> <P>  4. Blind fighting, the ability to continue fighting as per normal when blinded, if succesful.<P>  <BR>  5. While I don't see the need for a "fear" type skill, or "sneak or hide" How about something like intimidate? Which reduces the chance of mobs agroing before a fight?<P>  Anyway just some suggestions from a third party  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is not much wrong with warriors. To those who are worried about their ability to taunt i have to wonder where and what and why you cant taunt off. My warrior is 59....as opposed to 47 or 53 or whatever. There is only one pc i have trouble taunting of and its a level 60 monk with FA. My only gripe with warriors is equipment. Its not what we   can get , its how difficult it is to obtain. SoV has changed this a bit but still , the availability of Cobalt helms and bracers is ridiculous. The same goes for haste items. PoA and Sebilis haste items are absurdly difficult to get. At 59 i still use a FBSS despite spending countless hours in Seb. RBG's are beyond rare. Why? Is it such a huge concession to allow reasonable access to a high haste item with ac? Anyway hope this doesnt seem unduly negative because i love playing my warrior and i think its a class that has been handled well by Verant in general.

</FONT><HR>One big complaint:<P>Lack of quest weapons:  Most of the warrior weapons (the good ones) are dropped by mobs that are camped.  How about a no drop high end weapon with good stats (something better or equal to a lamenation) be given out by a quest??  Caster types have some decent quests (the velious focus item for example).<P>Lack of armor with both saves and AC:  Other than planar or mix and match, most of the warrior armor does not have any saves to it. If it has saves then the AC sucks.  Is this a design issue?  How does this stack up against uber mobs that hit for 800s and cast nasty AEs?  I would like to have questable armor with decent AC (like crafted at least) and good saves along with stats.  Make these quests doable by higher lvl characters.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, warriors aren't gonna want to hear this, but it has been bugging me for a long time.<P>Warriors (or any other pure melee) should not be able to use clickable effects.  I would even have to say that weapon procs are a stretch.<P>As a hybrid, I pay for my casting abilities with lower hp, ac, and skill caps.  In return, I can cast.  That is supposed to be a trade off.  But with clicky armor and items, warriors can cast just as well as a hybrid (better actually, cause armor doesn't fizzle) and they get the high skill caps, ac, and hp.  Doesn't really seem fair that I should suffer melee penalties if the warriors don't have to suffer a casting penalty.<P>Of course, I would rather see items that allow hybrids to raise there skills, hp, and ac to that of a warrior.  Maybe even an item that grants a hybrid duel wield or some new disciplines.  <P>Perhaps instead of putting spells that pretty much stink on a paladins DW armor, make the armor raise our skill caps, or clickable skills.  Maybe even make the spell a buff that is self only and allows duel wield.  <P>Caeelar Grailchaser<BR>51st Paladin of Tunare<BR>Infinite Realms on Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah i am a level 10 warrior and ive been palying with a level 10 paladin a level 9 sk and a lvl 9 magician. i have like 50 hitpoints more than the hybrids which isnt fair because they tank almost as good as i do and i usually end up dying or dropping out of a fight because the pally has already used lay on hands on himself. I dish out less damage than the sk which i cant understand because i have a better weapon. Isnt a warrior supposed to be a fighter. how come im not even a good punching bag? and the way i see it i have nothing to look forward to as far as offense goes. so please i dont care about taunt. i think that if we do more damage with swords we would be a more usefull character. and we need more hitpoints we are a "tank" after all we traded spells for pure melee. i cant see why i do less damage than a shadow knight and a paladin tanks better than me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Take for instance Wurmslayer 25/40 moderate quest, Kunzar Ku'juch 8/22, Sword of Skyfire 10/22, Lamentation 9/19, Jade mace 9/18 all of these are non-plane single group spawns.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry if this has already been mentioned, but I play a bard and am not gonna read through all the text for Meat Sheilds. Only thing I can really see the warrior can truly complain about is the epic weapon. When you split it, the delay on your blades is far to slow. Warriors can actaually get weapons that are better without having to go through an actual epic quest. As a Bard I understand the epic in epic quest. If you go through that much effort the dmg and delay should rock the house. Not like it was a give away fa like the Rogue, shaman, cleric, ranger, enchanter.<P>Other than that warriors need more spells in their armor. I mean warriors just need CH on their vambrace or something now and they will be all done &lt;sarcasm.&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a warrior I would like to hav enew skills between level 35 an 50. These are the ones that I like:<P>Improve or replace disarm skill: Pretty useless skill in PvE setting.<P>PIN skill: Let us forfeit attack for a chance of pinning the mob. Make us loose AC, DEX, DODGE, etc, but let us have a chance in immobilizing a mob. Could also act as a mega taunt.<P>Battle cry: Is there something more "warrior" than a battle cry? This could give us an attack bonus, STR and STA for a short period of time (maybe 15 sec). The draw back is that we loose some AC (little) and that after the battle cry we loose some stamina. After all shouting for 15 sec takes some energy and may disrupt regular breathing. I mostly see that skill as some Roleplay enhancer.<P>Also there should be a way for warriors ( and I mean only warriors) to resist fear effects when they attack! Could be link to the battle cry effect. Maybe the resist to fear (more than normal resist) could be explain by the second state of mind (if not physical) that some warrior attain when they charge to battle. (Could be linked to beserk, battle cry or other...)<P>Just a few taughts,<P>Acier Innox<P>P.S. Please, try to allow us to do more different things. Could be a few new skill that aren't really big bonus but that define us more from the rest of the melee or hybrid class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Even travelling can be a challenge.<BR>Now how many hours have i spent shouting for a group when every cleric/enchanter/bard that showed up got one at the first shout ?

</FONT><HR>Aquilis-Innoruuk wrote...<P>"small races are lacking in there melee skill points, that are not made up for in any means especially by their evasiveness. Some defensive activatible skill would be nice."<P>You forgot to mention that small races such as yourself also get things like sneak, hide, and/or forage.  Perhaps you just take these things for granted?  As an ogre I love the unstunnable from the front thing, however you should realize that it's only from the front.  At the same time I have to buy all my food and have no sneak and no hide.  As for stats, it has been shown by parsing logs that STR doesn't have a very significant effect on the majority of our hits and increased STA just gives an ogre a few more HP than a midget but not a huge amount.  So I strongly disagree with your comment about the XP bonus "is not enough to compensate for their lack of skills and stats."  In fact, midgets are getting compensated in other ways yet still receiving a nice XP bonus.  And don't forget your better faction either.<P>And some people are suggesting give midgets more advantages by giving them slam too?  Uhhh how bout we all just play halfling warriors since then the only thing we lose is a handful of HP?  Up to 50 it's hardly "300 hit points" as some might suggest.  Yes, around 55 is becomes more noticeable but considering that with the XP penalties a halfling would be about a level or so higher due to the XP bonus it becomes less noticeable.  <P>Higher base STA just doesn't effect HP as much as those who play small races seem to think.  Those of us who play fatties are usually shocked when we run into a midget warrior with about the same equipment who has about the same AC and HP as we do.  It makes you wonder why you've been cramming into SolB and leveling slower all this time.<P>Now let's look at equipment.  Hero bracer cannot be worn by large races.  Also, there's some quest bracer in SoV that has great stats and a nice proc.. no large races can wear.  I don't remember the details of the item because I stopped paying attention after I realized "Yay, another nice item that large races can't wear."  Good thing the other races can wear items that allow them to compensate for lower base stats but large races can't compensate for their XP penalty and ruined faction in most places.  And did I mention hide, sneak, and forage?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As far as epics goes, maybe it should indeed be a better risk/reward ratio.  However, considering the small percentage of warriors who will actually complete the quest I don't think it should be considered part of the class balance issue.  There are thousands of people out there who think that because they can start their epic quest and kill a couple mobs, that means that someday they will finish the quest.  The reality is that the last parts of these quests requires a powerful guild willing to help you finish it.  Powerful guild means they have a lot of members, and every one of them wants the guild to spend time on their epic quest.  I would guess that even 50-80% of the people who complain about epic rewards being underpowered are people who have zero chance at completing the quest in the first place.  Like the person who is "trying to decide if i should complete it or not."  Hehehe, you can't just decide to complete it, you have to first put yourself in a position that makes it even possible.  This is not a flame, more a case of pointing out that the epic reward has little to do with balancing the class.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Now on to piercers.  Honestly I've found that most of the good peircers are rogue and maybe shaman (what?) only.  I'm talking about piercers that drop in places with very comparable level hunting ranges.  Very few, if any, piercers that warriors can use have procs.  Now Absor, as you read this thread notice what is being said about taunting because it is entirely true.  The only way that a warrior can keep up with others on the hate list is to not only taunt but also PROC.  Standard weapons no matter what the ratio just don't attract enough attention to make taunt work.  Well, as somebody else pointed out, sometimes without procs we can taunt effectively but after swinging at us for 1-2 rounds it immediately goes back to its original target.<P>Speaking of comparable level ranges and drop rates, somebody else brought up a good point about cobalt drop rates.  How many cobalt bracers are on your server?  I would guess Povar has maybe 3 but honestly I don't even know of a single cobalt bracer.  I know one of the uber guilds has a grand total of zero and has killed thousands of myconids.  I mean sure, it would suck to see every low level twink running around in full cobalt but when I'm at 51 in full crafted and I know that a couple pieces of indo is all I can hope for that's a bit sad.  I like my crafted, but at 51 it's starting to get really outdated with very little chance at getting any upgrades.  People don't camp myconids/reets because it often requires a non-pickup group with the levels/composition of a group that could go to Hate.  Not everybody has such a group at their fingertips.<P>Skills past 200.  Somebody said they are level 45 and have a defense of 208.  I don't even know if I have that high of a defense at 51.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And the only time I get skill raises on 1HB and 1HS is when I dual wield two of the same type.  I used to try to wield one of each and switch between primary/secondary to allow both to progress at a relatively even rate.  Once I hit 200, it has become a matter of using two of the same type at once, hoping for a raise, then using two of the other type at once.  This of course means not always using my "A List" weapons (best 1HB and best 1HS) if I want to have skills go up.  Then we're back to the taunt issue... even a slight decrease in damage output (i.e. "B List" weapons) effects my ability to taunt.<P>As for hybrids tanking, Harkov you are missing the point.  Balancing a class has little to do with specific scenarios like uber raids.  It's great and all that we are needed in those, but not everybody plays this game in a way that puts us in uber raid situations every day/week/month.  I'm talking about normal 6-man groups.  A paladin/SK can fill a warriors' shoes in most groups with little noticeable difference.  A druid/shaman can replace a cleric but with a hugely noticeable difference.  Uber raids are a different story altogether.  You need multiples of most classes and happen to need more warriors, rogues, and clerics than other classes.  But that doesn't make warriors balanced in day-to-day playing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i made a post yestersday on some of my concerns about the warrior class.  I wanted to re iterate one of the points i made as ive seen several requests for it; and also to add an additional request.<P>1st id like to re-iterate my request for more warrior only quests.  Id like to see these quests ONLY completed by warriors WITHOUT OUTSIDE HELP.  Make the quest in such a way that if the warrior receives outside help then they have to redo the entire quest.  Some ideas on quests are armor, weapons, misc. inv slot items (meaning rings earrings and such) stat and skill increases (modest ones only doable once but it would be nice) and bind points.  In doing this it would serve 2 purposes.  Give the warriors some different equipment options making them look completely different from one another, and most importantly give warriors an ability to solo during the quests and would NOT be unbalancing to the other classes.  If this can be done, would u PLEASE make the quested items appropriate for the level of the quest.  <P>My 2nd point in this post is to ask if Beserker Fury could trigger on a warrior starting at 50% health instead of 30%.  My personal reason for this is that were i actually the one being beat on, i wouldnt wait till i was almost dead to get PO'd at the mob beating on me   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>P.S.  the quest idea could be used for ALL classes not just the warriors, and might help those that are not capable of playing long hours at a time or play off hours when groups are hard to come by.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>I agree with most of the items namely:<P>Taunt-needs to work better<P>AC-plate hybrids come very close to my AC, to me I should have more AC by a definate margin of effectiveness, not merely 30 to 80 points.<P>HP-Hybrids again, come close.  I am an ogre that maxed his sta and hyrbids still come within a few hundred hp of me even with lower sta by a significant amount.  This is insignificant when mobs hit for 400 or better on the higher lvl mobs in SoV.  Give us more HP per lvl post 50 or give our warrior specific items more HP bonus's on them.  I would love to see more +100 hp or better items.  Right now arguable one of the best items for melee is the 6ac 65hp rings enchanters can make yet all class's can use them.  The Dagas is another great example, 20ac and +100 hp.  This is a warrior weapon in every way, more items like this would be very much appreciated.<P>Epic-pretty much explained in other posts<P>Thurisaz Folkvang, Ogre Warrior<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I already made my list of demands, but I want to add a rebuttal to a few of the things people are saying. <BR>  First off, please increase bind wound. I read someone saying that every class should have to rely on someone for something, but the fact is that warriors have to rely on everyone for everything. I mean, if I'm not careful running over a hilly zone like NRo or Dreadlands, I have to stop and wait for my hitpoints to go up or take an xp death. That's too much dependance. And no matter what a warrior wants to do in this game (safely), whether it's travel, fight, or anything else, they have to rely on others. No exceptions until you get into high level gear, and even then things can get hairy real quick.<BR>   Secondly, my main server is PvP, and I can't tell you how useful disarm is. It's awsome. And for all of you non-pvpers, use disarm to pull mobs that summon. That way they won't summon you while you pull them back since mobs don't summon unless you hit em. Just please leave me my disarm skill so I can keep knocking the swords out of the hands of those SK's who think they're so bad  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>    And lastly, I want to discourage you from adding too many, if any, hitpoints to warriors. It would go a loooong way to clearly establish our dominance as tanks, but it would make the game too damn easy. As it is I can get my hps up to 4000 when buffed, and I'm only 51. There are tanks with good gear that have 5K hps and an ac of 1210 buffed. That's sick enough. But then you add in Complete Heal? Come on, it would just be silly. Giving warriors another 1000 or so hps would just end up unbalancing the PvE and force you to nerf something or increase the power of the high end mobs, which no one wants to see done. Maybe a discipline where you temporarily get more hitpoints for those really high level encounters, but other then that....<P>Shelrabbi<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warrior issues from my perspective<P>1) Taunt - Definitely needs to be looked at. Taunt in 50+ encounters has been increased somewhat by the taunt patch but not enough.<P>2) Taunt with 2handed weapons- Doesnt happen at all. I have to dual wield to have any chance at taunting. My ideal warrior would be using a 2hand sword or axe. My 2hander(which I love) sees almost no combat time due to taunting issues.<P>3) More HP would be nice but not critical imho.<P>4) Why does peircing cap at 240 instead of 250? Makes no sense to me at all. <P>5) I would like to see the Cobalt Bracer and Helm moved to mobs more like most other classes kunark armor items. Seems most other classes have a much better chance of getting their class armors because of where the items are located. The cobalt bracer is the most expensive armor item ive seen on my server. For a bracer to cost more than a runebranded girdle or seblisian berserker cloak should give some idea of its rarity. If they stay as is then I would love to see the effects of the bracer and helm placed on the Thurgadin/PoG armors. I need both of these effects and would like to see it on my armor since its already available on other peices of warrior armor.<P>I really dont see any other major problems with the warrior class. I have no real opinion of the epic since im not in a guild that will be capable of doing the mobs that drop the items for it. All the other items I have seen listed really will not impact the warrior class that much. Bind wound works. It could be better but it serves its purpose. Warriors are not a solo class thought they can do it in some situations. Disciplines are fine. Some are useless, some are great. The good ones definitely make up for the useless ones.<BR>Melee binding? Who cares. I dont see it as an issue. Didnt bother me at low levels doesnt bother me now. Crtitical hits/crippling blows are eye candy. Nice to see but dont really effect overall damage. Running speed? Sow potions and Jboots are the fix for this. <P>So to sum it up. Taunt is the only real Issue with the warrior class. The others ive listed would be nice to see changed/improved, but are not critical to our class.<P>Thundre<BR>57th warrrior<BR>Cazic Thule server <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Can we get an official reply to the rumor of an 1100 AC softcap?  Does it exist or not?<P>If it does not exist, then great.<P>If it does exist, then we'll have some problems.  All of us who have spent mass game time and plat building our AC up point by point thinking it meant something will have to unload this high end equipment at rock bottom prices since it's no longer in demand.  Then we need to shift focus to +stat items of questionable worth.  And of course we do not know what soft caps are on stats, or even how certain stats affect our fighting.  There is constant debate among the warrior community concerning stats and as far as I've seen, nothing conclusive has been determined.<P>So please release the following information:<P>Does an AC softcap exist?<BR>If so, what is it?<BR>What are the softcaps for other stats?<BR>Exactly what does each stat do for us in battle?<P>Warriors' equipment selection is as important as a caster's spell choices.  Yet we have no way to know if we're blindly running down the AC trail and not improving our characters at all.  With high end, no-drop items in the game, it's vital that we know if the stats and AC on the item will even be used or if the item should be passed to someone else.<P>Another note on the 'softcap': If it does exist, and if it is 1100, then we have a balance issue with hybrids.  Warriors are cleary intended to be the best tanks in the game, meaning we must have superior AC and hit points.  At higher levels, a plate hybrid can easily hit 1100 or even 1200 AC and come within a couple hundred hitpoints of us.  If there is a softcap of 1100, then the only difference between a warrior and a shadowknight or paladin, from a tanking perspective, is about 200 hitpoints.  Add in their hybrid spells and skills and they become a class cleary superior to warriors.  I think that is the warriors' fear right now.  Any information about this soft cap or any other AC issue would be greatly appreciated by our class.  That's all it would take to ease our fears.<P>We play warriors to tank.  That is our number one goal in this game.  If another player, even another warrior, is getting hit during a fight I get jealous.  I taunt like hell and try to bring the focus back to me.  If I can't pull him off another warrior, that's not so bad.  I give the warrior professional respect and keep trying.  But if it's a ranger, or a shadowknight or a paladin that the mob is hitting then I get irritated.  If the mob ignores me completely and continues to dote on the hybrid I get quite pissed.  I am a tank.  I am a meatshield, and it's my job to take the hits for the team.  Without that I am nothing but a low level DoT spell.<P>So as you evaluate the classes please keep this in mind.  Spell effects on armor? Cute. Disciplines?  Eye candy, with a couple exceptions.  Crits and crips?  More eye candy, just not as tasty.  What do we want?  We want to be considered the best tanks in the game with no argument whatsoever.  We need to have a noticeably greater number of hitpoints and an AC that cannot be obtained in any way by a hybrid (if AC over 100 has any use, of course).  That's it.<P>Warrior class defined in three words:<P>AC and Hps.<P>Everything else is just packaging.<P><BR>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>lvl 59 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>To begin with I'd like to address the complaints made by non-warriors here and there in this thread.<P>Warriors are specialists. The only use anyone has for us is in combat, to suck up damage and grab a mobs attention. To be so specialized we've given up a great many things. We knew this going into it. No complaints.<P>The thing a great many people that don't play warriors, who have posted to this thread, seem to be overlooking, is how utterly useless we are outside of a group or without an extensive support network.<P>You complain about the spells on our armor and the fact that they don't fizzle. The spells are generally worthless, or extremely low level buffs, and go unused. I could get buffed by a 9th level druid and have nearly the same utility as that provided by most pieces of cobalt.<P>You argue that we are the supreme tanks and that we need no modification at all, yet monks, sks, rogues, rangers and pallies all have nearly the same ac and, in most cases, superior offensive and / or taunt abilities to us at high levels.<P>All a lot of us are asking for is more ac and hit points and the ability to taunt more effectively. We're not asking for a decrease of your effectiveness. We're just asking for a more clearly defined specilization in what we are supposedly the best at, damage absorption and effectiveness at taunting mobs. We're not even asking for an ability to travel or escape better, for the most part. <P>In summary, damage absorption and taunting are all we've got that define us as a class. We'd like to be just enough better at it than everyone else to keep that distinction. So, why fight us on it? It will only help the group, and believe me there's no one more group focussed than your average warrior. Without the rest of you we couldn't have gotten this far at all.<P>As far as what I'd like to see to "balance" us;<P>More AC, More Hps. (It what defines who we are as a class, and 50 ac and 300 hps seperating us from folks at high levels is so little difference as to be non-existant)<P>Better taunt. (Its what we do, and unless we're the highest level in the group and / or have the best gear its hard to do more often than not)<P>Loot drop improvement (Cobat helms, cobalt bracers, and the epic quest examined)<P>Nothing new there.<P>-Theis Rogala 53rd warrior Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>2 things...<P>Caeelar, this is a warrior talk.  Not hybrid.  Please keep your comments to yourself.  You won't see me in the hybrid thread talking about how nothing needs fixed/changed, so please refrain from 'trolling' in ours.  Thanks.<P>Secondly, critical hits/crippling blows:<P>They rarely post 50+ disciplines happen, warriors pre 50th would love to see the % chance increased for both to go off.  Also the damage for both should be capped at something 'above' the normal max damage you do with your weapon wielded.  Currently crits figure the damage that 'hit' would have done and then give a damage bonus.  Thus you have times when a critical hit, hits for like 12 damage when your max damage normally is say 30.  It is rather unappealing to have a 'critical' hit be less than you normally do for damage when you get a max hit.  Rogues got backstabs minimum damage capped, just asking for the same kind of thing.  Ours isn't even a skill so the balance issue isn't as big of a deal.  Crits/crips are something that go off based totally off the server side controlled %'s.<P>Crippling blows happening more often when at 20% health, pre 50 discipline would be nice too.<P>Thanks...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At this point we get so few abilities in our pre-50 life that sometimes it gets boring, for newbies this can be tough since it will take them months to reach high level.<BR>  Warriors are decently balanced but before you can say they are done, increase their taunt. its VERY hard to taunt high level kunark / planar mobs. on that same note, give us an area effect taunt. since taunt wont break mez, but does build aggro it would be awesome, let us get it at lvl 30 or so.<BR>  Give us a natural haste, Other melee types that can use similar weapons as us should not be as effective as us, they've spent time studying other disciplines, be it abilities or spells, whereas warriors have spent their life studying the art of battle.monks for instance have spent their life studying hand-to-hand, which justifies their natural haste.<BR>  Make 2handers more effective. the only two-handers warriors use are extremely good, plane dropped two-handers, they just dont taunt or hit like dual one-handers, personally i would rather wield a two-hander, unfortunetly they suck; maybe you should lower their delay, respective to the warriors level.<BR>  <BR>  In conclusion, more HP, more Regen, better taunt, natural haste, increase effectiveness of two-handers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well after reading through all these pages of responses, I've finally decided what I want to say. <P><BR>First off, I counted four posts out of six pages from Iksar Warriors, if that doesn't tell you something, I don't know what does.  I already stated and a couple others did too that Iksar are completely screwed on armor, basically now this is our armor setup from birth to abortation   <BR>Level 1-10 Usually do the Curscale quests and get some Curscale armor which is ok for newbies, since Kunark is a great place to sell silk and bone chips people usually can save up enough money to get leather in these levels, that's fine Iksar Warriors are normal here.<P>Level 11-20 Some warriors save enough money to efford some leather and banded to go together perhaps someone has given them varies pieces of other armor (Tizmak has been given out alot lately), again Iksar warriors are normal here, having banded, and mixed leather (perhaps SOME Cabilis Scale, if they're very lucky)<P>21-30 Here's where the problems start, all other races are starting to be able to get into Fine Plate armor, while Iksar warriors are either still in banded or maybe Cabilis Scale, this isn't a huge problem with Iksar AC bonus, so it's not terribly noticable....yet.<P>31-40 Here's when Iksar and other races alike begin thinking about stat increasing armor (i.e. Crafted and Trooper Scale), most other races usually get their Crafted without much trouble, Iksar can (WITH HELP) complete all of their armor quests fairly easy (expect the Breastplate quest, which is amazingly complex) right here is when Iksar are actually better (stat wise) that most other races due to Trooper Scale having slightly better stats than crafted and our AC bonus (it's arguable yes, but I've never lost a dual to another race warrior in these levels).<P>41-50 This is a slow time for armor, some Iksar go to Karnor's and get Jarsath Scale to replace some Trooper Scale or Enchanted Cabilis (other some other variation) Other races enjoy their crafted and look for stat boosting items not whole sets of armor just yet, during these levels Iksar aren't terrible yet, just about even with other races. <P>51-60 Here's where the problem sets in...huge at that, other races start getting Cobolt, Indocite, and other whole sets of armor while Iksar are stuck in their scale armor, now there ARE some armors in the Plane of Growth (and supposedly the Plane of Mischief...if anyone ever finds it) but usually people won't pick Iksar Warriors over other races due to our poor equipment in comparision with other races.  And if we do get on a raid we STILL have to compete with other warriors for armor IF it drops.  Warriors in Indocite and Cobolt still want better armor just for looks and maybe better stats just to switch out, so they roll and if Iksar lose, oh well better luck next time you're STILL in your level 30 gear while everyone else is planar.  <P>That's it for level specific, but I'd like to point out yet again that Iksar armor is far and few between.  A poster said that Beserker armor gave Iksar warriors an unfair advange...Ok you start an Iksar warrior, get him to 55ish, and see how great it is to wear the equipment from your 30s throughout.  On Lanys there is VERY few Iksar warriors, and the posts here only prove it's not just Lanys, everyone knows Iksar are shafted on armor, that's why they don't play em.  The KOS reason turns off some yes, but many people play Trolls and Orges, and they're almost as KOS as Iksar.  Anyway enough ranting on armors, I've said as much as I can on that.<P>But before I go I'd like to agree with Trana on a race specific skill for Iksar warriors. <P>I think this should be a Tail attack like Trana said, usable like slam is for Orges, Trolls, and Barbs.  Iksar ARE considered a large race, this is proven by our LARGE race exp pentaly, so why not give us a large race skill?  Tail attack that stuns just like slam, that'd be a great attack and wouldn't unbalance in the least bit.  That's just my dollars worth of cents.<P>Rabrik Rko'Tramist<BR>Iksar Warrior<BR>Lanys T'Vyl<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi there. I play a 58 barbarian warrior on the Tribunal and thought I would add my voice to the discussion on some changes. More or less echoing the same problems that have been brought up:<P>1) Cobalt bracer and helms. These need a serious change on the drop rate as you've heard from other posters.<P>Cobalt bracers are valued more than just about anything in the game. There are several true stories of these bracers running well into the 100K to 150K plat range. I have actually witnessed them selling for this much, and it makes my stomach churn. The bracer is the real kicker because a warrior will generally need to acquire 2 of these! There is absolutely no other class that has a Kunark armor piece that is more highly valued (ie. the seller of one will make charge you your first born for). <P>2) The primary hand sword of the Epic weapon needs its delay adjusted. It's too slow to be even worthy of an epic weapon. The proc doesn't really taunt that much and is more often than not resisted. Stats are nice, but a warrior should want to use their epic weapon.<P>3) Disarm. This skill is basically worthless. I keep it hotkeyed, but I've counted 1 successful disarm in 50 armed mobs. That's just silly.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053093&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053093&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
