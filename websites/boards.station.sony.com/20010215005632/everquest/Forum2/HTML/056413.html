</FONT><HR>You can read the previous topic here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053089.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053817.html<P>Author Topic: Enchanter Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 01-26-2001 11:24 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Unfortunately, as will probably be the case from here out, I just don't have time to do any research before starting this post. I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters… <BR>Again, the usual reminder. I am primarily looking for balance concerns here. But I am certainly willing to put bugs on the list. Also, though I really do understand the fact that you want to emphasize and back up statements by others, please, please try to keep the repeat information to a minimum. I'm finding that by page three or four on these threads I'm rereading the same suggestions by people that start their posts with "I didn't read this thread, so I don't know if this had been said…" I don't want to stifle any creativity. But I have to admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing good new ideas late in threads when they are buried among things that others have covered several times before.<P>So, please, let's hear what you think is unbalanced or broken about enchanters. Here are the few things that I had already jotted down:<P>Gift of Brilliance: When compared to similar buffs by Clerics and Shamans this spell doesn’t seem good enough. Sure, it will see use, but it could be a better spell. Quick comparison:<P>Aeogolism (60th level Cleric spell): Adds 1,100 to max hit points and 54 to AC for a single target. Lasts 2.5 hours. Costs 750 mana.<BR>Focus of the Spirit (60th level Shaman spell): Adds 405 hit points, 67 strength and 60 dexterity for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 500 mana.<BR>Gift of Brilliance (50th level Enchanter spell): Adds 150 mana and grants a mana regeneration rate increase of 2 points per tick for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 450 mana.<P>The Shaman and Cleric spells essentially replace other buffs. Gift of Brilliance stacks with Clarity II. It might be nice to have the mana regeneration be 2 points greater than Clarity II and NOT stack with it so that enchanters could use it to save a slot. And perhaps rather than increasing the mana bonus, give it an intelligence bonus. But perhaps at this level enchanters just don't need any more intelligence boosts…<P>Illusions drop when zoning: Is there a gameplay reason behind the fact that illusions drop when you zone? If not, can we make it so they do not?<P>More Illusions: I think it’s a good idea to dig through the list of current global characters and see if there are a few more illusions that we can give to enchanters.<P>I know there are more issues…<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ah Finally I'm on here.  I've been non-connected for about 2 months now and my other Enchanter friend wouldn't let me post using his computer.  But through sheer luck and expertise I have arrived at the table.  Albeit a bit late, but I'm here none the less.<P>Now, I shall attempt to make the reading of this easy on the eyes, so as not to cause bleeriness as you say.<P>1. What I expect from a game that I pay $10.00/month for plus $50.00 initial game cost.<P>2. Fun after reaching the pinnacle or Zenith of power in my chosen class.<P>3. What is realy broken; what can be discarded; what should be upgraded/downgraded; and what would be cool.<P>1. What I expect from an investment of $200.00 and 4-6hours x 365 days or so - from a game.  First and foremost from ANY game, it should be FUN.  It should be escapism at its grandest or some level thereof. From a role-playing-game, I expect to be fairly lost in the world it creates.  I expect it to capture my imagination and fancy.  Everquest did this and more at first but after many trials and errors and bad policy decisions it has failed miserably.  I used to enjoy playing an enchanter but alas that thrill is utterly gone.  I log on now and walk around frustrated, aiding or scaring newbies or lowbies, or Ebayed highbies (or the ignorent in general).  Now what i would expect from a MAGICAL casting class would be utter and complete self sustaining POWER.  You have made allusions to enchanters being POWERFUL.  You are sorely wrong.  Let us define that here right quick.  Power (as per your interpretation) - the ability to turn characters or a situation that should be nigh impossible, to plausible; the popularity of the class in a group setting; the love other classes have for certain benefits the class brings to a group.  In my book all of these things are USELESS. (note emphasis) I don't care to pay a monthly fee for the enjoyment of someone else.  I don't pay a monthly fee to make someone else grandious.  I don't care to be liked for the benefits I bring to another class.  I pay my money to be lost in a world.  Immersed in fantasy, not buffing someone elses rusty toosh.  Had I wanted to do such a thing I would have chosen Shaman or Cleric as my class.  Buffing someone else as my sole purpose or individual expression of my magic is enfuriating at this point.  Due to your coding I still can't take on a throng of greens, even with my uber pet. How silly is that?<P>2. I reached lvl 50 some time ago, in fact I reached lvl 47 many months ago and was quite lethargic to make the final spurt to the finish, that was lvl 50 at the time.  Why? NO FUN.  Enchanters post lvl 44 are not fun to play.  "Oh, what is this magical number of 44?"  The last lvl that we get an illusion.  In fact the only reason I reached lvl 44 was that it had a "cool" illusion at all.  Those other androgenous, luke-warm and unmentionable spells that came with the lvl were not even an incentive nor a consideration in reaching that lvl.  Ergo lvl 49 and 50 were just add ons that happen by happenstance, no wish or desire on my part realy.  Your game is not fun at this lvl.  I had refused to purchase Kunark at first but through several threats by my Sunday LAN party friends I acquiesced (sp).  I thought 10 lvl of torture were not necessary for me to prove my utter boredom with the game.  Well with Velious I have won out and I stand justified by the many negative posts I have seen from purchasers of the update.  Kunark has done nothing special for me, in fact I rarely go there and have nothing from there except my sebelous key (sp).<P>3. Now the gravy.  I may not be popular in saying what i'm about to say, but read and think about my points.<BR>     a. Enchanters - there is much myth and legend in classical fantasy and mythology and a wealth of information concerning this word 'enchanter'.  At it's base it is this class has historical manifestations akin to the EQ wizard.  In most accounts Enchanters are vile and reviled magicians of the most powerful nature.  Even more sinister are accounts of enchantresses. EQ's version of enchanter comes close only in its charming abilities.  Mezmirzation was also a tool used, but such a tool then allowed much more sinister and subtle dismantling magic that is completely unavailable in this game.  <BR>     b. When first playing an enchanter in EQ I thought at some point we were going to become lunatics because of the mind altering magic we used.  (that would have been fun) And for several levels I had completely forgotten what my true race and form were. (again it would have been fun to lose my native race and identity)<BR>     c. It seems that enchanters because of their abilities in the game are the hands-down questers of the game.  I had tried to be the first to get the fiery avenger on all servers, personally, just to prove a point. Unfortunately I wasn't high enough lvl to enter the plane of sky/air (whatever that silly overpowered place is called). I've never played on pvp, but enchanters must seem quite inadequate because of game mechanics, to infiltrate enemy camps.<BR>     d. take a look at your policy about letting classes wander a zone unaided and without danger. It would not be overbalancing to let us do that again.  You have created vast zones that no characters see, because you deem it out of the question to let characters wander the zone.  No mob in the game truely feels threatened by a PC, not even green ones.  This is a shame even at lvl 60.  You are stifling the adventuresome nature of many by this silly notion that every nook and cranny should present death.  Why should it?  Why can't i turn into a sea slug and explore *** (that water zone with the killer mermaids in it) or turn into a kangaroo and jump around Kunark unmolested; or morph (note i said morph) into a D'Jinn (sp) and soar around the plane of air/sky.  Why did you pay those guys so much money to wrap those skins on the terrains and buildings and not allow the PC's to even see it.  God forbid we should see that the hermit in South Karana has a bed, table and chairs in his little run down cabin.<BR>     e. Whirl till you hurl is a long range stun, it's a needed enchanter repetoire that should have upgrades all the way into lvl 60 and be appropriately tailored to work; <P>color flux series is a much needed series and has great cool factor, also needed to lvl 60; <P>Memblur has awesome cool factor, needs to be fixed and applicable at least only for the enchanter, self only memblur would be grande in my book, needed to lvl 60; <P>Invisibility needs to be fixed, enchanters are magical in nature and nothing is better than disappearing, it needs to be fixed and work in the middle of combat as a self memblur, it is a technique and arrow in the quiver of the enchanter repetoire; <P>Improved invisibility is on the plane of growth, this nullifies any good enchanter's ability to get this spell; <P>Improved invisibility should work ala AD&D not the stupidity of interpretation I hear it has in this game, improved invisibility should allow you to attack or cast without you being the target of spells, but due to tailtail signs allows you to be attacked with a great boost in AC (c.f. AD&D 2ed); <P>Charm should improve in length, resistability, casting time and have a wider lvl cap as the enchanter gains lvls; <P>Instantaneous duration, highly unresistant charms are not needed and should be completely discarded; <P>Spells should shorten in casting time and lengthen in duration the higher the caster is and the higher the spell and NOT the converse; spells should take less mana the higher they are or the higher the required magical skill of the enchanter, not the converse; <P>Speed buffs are unnecessary except for self or pet only speed buffs; <P>Give bards clarity (akin to ours) and change enchanter current clarity spells to self only or pet; <P>Gift of (insert name here) series is useless and I haven't purchased not even one and don't intend to; <P>Rethink, revamp or take out velium; <P>Rethink, revamp or take out jewelry skill, I would kill my jeweler if he failed as many times as I do in this game, your mechanics get in the way of fun, its not needed at this juncture of all server economy, a revamp is realy necessary now that the game is quite mature as are server economies; <P>Even new servers have old players on them who's economies become in sync with all the older servers quickly, realize this and program accordingly; <P>Shield and self buffs should be much more effective, enchanters are very very weak; it would be quite interesting if enchanters with all of their buffs could equal a melee or hybrid, I've seen quite a bit of wishing for this since post lvl 44 is so boring; <P>Tashania line of spells needs to be heightened in its severity, remember IT ONLY ATTACKS MAGIC RESISTANCE, it's already limited in its use, and that use should be quite formidable; <P>Reduce tashinia series taunt factor drastically or increase the debuff factor of it drastically, you can't have both a weak debuff and a high taunt factor without reason, realize this and change it; <P>All enchanter spells are magical in nature the tash line of spells should be in sync with specialized debuffing in that area; <P>Remove the silly term illusion from the name of illusions and put the word polymorph, it's symantics but stop kidding yourselves and playing us for fools, it sounds much cooler anyway; <P>We need more polymorphs, it gives us hope and enjoyment, and the new ones should have very nice advantages; <P>Revamp your minimum system requirements since many upgraded for your game anyway, realize this and change it; <P>Take away superfluous buffs and make the polymorphs of appropriate lvls to those targetable buffs, i.e. water breathing should be ditched in place of water elemental, this will make the enchanter game much more interesting for the enchanter to overcome faction for the ability to breath water at such a lvl, follow the logic for the other targetable buffs also, levitate/air elemental etc..; <P>Fix fear, reduce the taunt area of a feared mob, it makes no sense for a feared mob to enrage rather than spook his comrades, a feared mob should have a chance of fearing mobs he comes into contact, this would be much more interesting than fearing a mob and causing a train; <P>Fear should last longer, cast faster, and be less resistable the higher lvl you get along with the spell, it's one of the mind altering arrows in the enchanter repetoire, realize this and change it; <P>Give enchanter self only buffs, they are the masters of the magical arts for sheer magics sake, at least historically, and in so are more in the know of how to use it to their advantage and the disadvantage of others; <P>Drastically change the direct damage spells, they are horribly underpowered, it presents more of a harm to the enchanter than a benefit; <P>Drastically reduce the resistability of enchanter direct damage, it has the same taunt factor wether it lands or not, which is illogical at best, it should land more often since it is an ALL OR NOTHING spell, unlike other classes; <P>For the most part an enchanter that DD's now is stupid, it's a most unused line of spells; <P>Change polymorph so that religion doesn't matter, it is illogical that a dumb ogre warrior bouncer who can't spell god would see through your highly magical illusion and omnisciently know your religion, the only person that should even suspect such would be a shaman or cleric, and that would be on a very slim role indeed, the eyes should be believed more than feelings; <P>As it stands no enchanter chooses a religion now, divesting us of a portion of the game that I assume you intended to impact the game; <P>Mana shield - damage attacks mana points before hitting the health levels of enchanter; <P>Visual indications - spells should be far more dynamic than they are, esp. color flux, how did you drop the ball on this one? the name itself lends to visions of lots of brilliant color; <P>Giant class resistance or immunity to stuns is ludicrous and illogical, giants are dumb and not terribly savee about magic, there is no reason for them to be immune, this is a not-needed ability; <P>Mob resistance in general should be exception not the rule, you should underpower all spells and make mobs almost rarely resistant to spells or put the appropriate mobs with special abilities; <P>Hmmm I'm scared to say this but the choke line of spells makes no sense in this instance - mobs without the ability to choke, its hilarious to see a skeleton or sea cucumber choke; <P>Make appropriate mobs immune to the series, increase the power of the spell in compensation and increase the DD power and lower its casting time in compensation, it just reflects badly on your programers, realize this and change it, I shudder when thinking of such a bad glitch escaping the many hands it passed through to make it this far, what a pity realy; <P>Make enchanter powers more to recon with than they are now; <P>Enchanters are not a power unto themselves at all; <P>I humbly acquiesc to the shaman buff masters, let them be the best at that; <P>Change the role of the enchanter to a more subtle power unto themselves that can do things no other class can do, "I hate enchanters like you" makes my blood boil when i hear a mob say that, I think to myself 'woohoo, you haven't seen the full force of this fully operational battle enchanter', that would put the wonder and fun back into the game;<P>As it stands now, your game is race to 50 or now 60, get a bunch of items and then get bored with the game because you can't do anything fun anymore;<P>You all concentrate on the high end game when the game is actually over at that end (as it stands now);<P>Understand, I soloed for the most part to lvl 50 just to prove i could do it,and it only took a few months, I know more about the game than most, I play my text based muds more than I play everquest at this juncture;<P>Finally I wouldn't play any other class to lvl 60 than enchanter, I love the class, I have many twinks of all races and classes, but my passion is enchanter, your many nerfs have ruined a good thing and you have this erroneous notion that because other players want an enchanter in their group that the class MUST be powerful, it's all smoke and mirrors;<P>Bar none, enchanters die more than any other class, I've died in groups when noone else died for hours;<P>Allways, a caster at higher lvls has been powerful, in your game it doesn't hold true, with a little resistance gear or certain mobs, casters are useless, that should never be;<P>You may consider rendering enchanters pet less and actually improving upon our spells and granting us the suggestions on new spells, enchanter life is hell and from lvl 29-49 most enchanters are petless anyway, since they are broken or nigh not worth the cp to buy the tiny dagger it takes to cast them, i've never seen so many useless spells;<P>Enchanter items should be useful for the enchanter, I can't imagine you all sat around the table and came up with the pinnacle of an enchanter (connotation one who is the originator of magical items) would be a stupid item that BUFFS someone with speed, this has to be the most horrible idea of the zenith of a class i've ever heard of, the epic quest, as described to me, was to be an item of supreme magicness and connotes extreme power for the USER, I have over half the items by accident and I assure you I will not complete this quest, I'd rather do everyone elses epic quest as an exercise in frustration instead of doing mine, PLEASE revamp this item, I can't believe you all came up with this, I was so excited to see all the different classes epic items and their abilities, imagine my utter dismal chagrine when I saw ours, what a complete and utter let down, like a poisoned dagger to the heart, it SMACKS of "oh gee we ran out of ideas, let's just give them this and call it a day" no thought, no imagination, not EPIC whatsoever, how disgusting.<P>I tried to be as brief and original as possible.

</FONT><HR>I have a great idea for enchanters. I dont follow the boards too closely for enchanters because I play a wizard, and that in itself takes up enough of my time discussing their balance (up to post 9 now...).<P>I get the impression they want more illusions and you dont want to use more space for new images. Correct? I suggest a gender-switching illusion. Say your a male gnome. Cast it and become female! Its not useful, but its fun, and thats what most illusions are about. It should be able to stack with other illusions as well, so you could become a female wood elf if you were a gnome, or a female cactus if you were a cactus...err..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dead-nameless brought up the "illusion death" again. Heard it before and i think it´s a good idea, but i think he´s wrong about the casting time. The average situation i would need that spell is the moment after casting tashan and been summoned by that mob so it can beat me down. In my experience i NEVER got 10 sec´s to live then, let alone uninterruptet. <BR>It should be cast in 1 sec, or 2 sec´s maximum.<P>BTW, you out there Absor ?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>To start off, I just would like to say that I agree with many of Shakaama's points, especially those referring to the role of enchanters.<P>As for class balance, someone stated that enchanters can take the place of 10 players in a given situation, or something along the lines of this.  If enchanters are really, this overpowered, then why do I not see enchanters 'quad kiting' monsters, ten against four would hardly seem like a contest for us.  The reality is that the statement is completely without merit.  And in fact, the only thing I agree with VI on, is how 'bleary eyed, as you so elequently put it, you really are when it comes to the enchanter class.<P>If enchanters can make the impossible seem possible, it is not because of the enchanter's abilities are so powerful, it is through the use of effective groups and strategies.  So I say it is unfair for you to punish and impede our class, just because we can play our class well.  <P>I am refering to the release of Scars of Velious, in which you crippled our class, making us uttlerly useless.  As I have read through the posts I realize, as well should you, that this is not just my opinion but the veiw of practically all enchanters who have posted thus far.  I can agree that Velious should be a challenge, but surely that does not mean making a class or classes who use and rely on only one genre of spells.  If you REALLY wanted to create a challenge, then there should have been much more diversity in creating these situations, and Im guessing by now it is far too late to change anything...<P>*Maybe you could have emulated the Plane of Hate, and made SOME, not all, creatures have high resistances to a certain type of spell, and varied to degrees so that people would actually have to think about their encounters, and what and or what not to fight. Some have high Cold resistance, some have high heat resistance...ect.<BR>If it is an issue of balance that you wish to adress, than take a look at this, putting all your eggs into one basket is not balanced.<P>Regarding the enchater class, yes they should have powerful mond altering spells.  Wizards should have extreme damage dealing abilities, just like enchanters should be able to confuse and deceive those around them.<P>Shakaama made a very good point that dimwitted ogres should not be able to see through the powerful illusionary aspect of the enchanter class.  Does the word Illusionist ring a bell?  As for risk v. reward...Does saving some time between banking really disrupt the game that much. It just the same as a wizard or druid porting to their desired location to go sell/bank whatever; the enchanter saving some time to go bank at a closer location due to our limited means of travel.  Not only does it have utility, and does not disrupt the balance of the game -although Im sure if and WHEN you decide to respond you will think one up- but it is also fitting to the role enchanters play as refering to our mysterious and deceitful forms of magic.<P>Let me give you some insight (if you pardon the pun) into the enchanter class.  I think it goes without saying that enchanters are not an offensive magic class, we are more for support.  We augment the abilities of our comrades, and confuse our enemies.  We also rely on one style of magic, as Im sure I have stated several times already.  Wouldn't it make sense that if we only use one form of magic, that we should specialize in it?  I think so.  Yet we still come up short in many areas we should specialize in.  I really don't mind if a shaman can debuff better than I do, great, he/she should have something they excell at, and yes I group with a shaman on a regular basis and his Slow Spell (same level) overwrite mine consistantly.  I think it is safe to say that enchanters specialize in many mind altering fields and various forms of crowd control. I can not think of a reason for a giant, 10 levels below or more myself, or any amount within reason for that matter, should be immune to my spells.  I can understand level caps on spells, maybe the level 34 mez spell, Entrance, not being able to work on a Sand Giant, but how come Dazzle, or Glamour of Kintaz cannot, even Rapture, although I have not done this one from personnal experience yet from my readinf the results are the same. There is just this natural immunity?!  I suppose Ice Comet would not work against a low level Ice goblin of sorts if this were the case....  Does this seem to be balanced?<BR>Also our spells cuase monsters to be more agressive than they should be.  The Tash line comes to mind, either make it pre-'nerf' when it reduced Magic resistance by 60ish, which made sense seeing as how enchanters only use magic, or make the agression SIGNIFICANTLY reduced.  I can recal instances in which I waited until a bloodthirsty ghoul was down to 80% health before casting Tashania, while tanks were hacking away, then having it attack me just after that one spell.  And I see I am not alone in this as well, yet again.<P>Im sure that if there is a response to this, it will say, who are you to decide what the class should or should not be able to do? I think that same question could be said for the design team or whoever is going to be the deciding force in this factor...Are the customers right, or the game moderators who admit their lack of knowledge is these areas.<P>Just a quick recap:<P>*Improve the effectiveness of illusions:<BR>Let enchanter illusions, or any illusionary magic, hide ones' faith, as a true illusion would.  Also a few post 50 illusions would be nice. Ive seen some great ideas thus far, I'll let you deal with it<P>*Balance and vary the resistances of monsters in Velious.<BR>Not only will this be more challenging, but it will also make other classes involved.  Just the inverse shouldn't some things have weaknesses. I mean, I think a Frost Giant would have less of a tolerance towards fire magic, so Im not sure how this works with wizard DD's but shouldn't they get a bonus amount of damage for creatures with certain weaknesses, same goes for Cold, Heat, Disease, Magic... weakness, maybe implement a bonus amount of damage, this may also help against those 'Uber mobs' with 100k+ HP<P>*Scale the agression of certain spells.<BR>Since the enchanter tash line was 'nerfed' in effectiveness, it seems the aggression was left as is.  Either put it back up to 60, or decrease this accordingly.<P>*Make Reoccuring Amnesia Reoccure for once<BR>Enough said...<P>*Random duration charms...?<BR>Risk v. Reward: High risk, high cost, little reward.  Maybe make them have fixed durations. Dictate's duration is pitiful for a level 60 spell. 750mana for a 48 second charm?!<P>*Resistances in SoV:<BR>A challenge is a challenge, but how about some diversity, instead of focusing on just magic?<P>*I did have a good laugh on a post of turning my opponent into a frog, but seems like the whole issue with Ignite Bones all over again... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>*Are we a pet class or not??????<BR>Can we improve the pet? Can we get rid of it? Commands?  What is the deal? I saw shamans get their pets buffed, that I agree with, they needed it.  But then, Why druids? All that comes to mind is WHY?(besides charms that is)<P>*How about a +/- thing...<BR>Noticing more of the same? I know I am. If we got some feedback (pardon the pun yet again) we won't have to repeat ourselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Shakaama has good points (as do all the other lengthy posts), but, again, I do have some disagreements.<P>An enchanter alters our virtual reality.  An enchanter's gift is to change the situation to help ensure a favorable outcome (to the enchanter).  This means that things like buffing allies and debuffing enemies is an important part of what an enchanter does.<P>Crowd control is senior.  Without crowd control, all the buffing and debuffing (especially, since debuffing NPC's is of limited use) which we can muster is inadequate.<P>So, while there are many good points which Shakaama makes, I strongly disagree with the idea that enchanters shouldn't be good at the kinds of things they do buff.  I agree that shamans should be good at it, too -- it would be fantastic if the shaman's buffs were of more use (i.e. stats mattered more) than they do now, but that's a shaman and general gameplay issue, and not an enchanter one.<P>The other point is an enchanter's damage spells.  The very fact that Shakaama has mostly soloed his way to 50 contradicts his argument.  Our damage spells are NOT what enchanters do.  I picked an enchanter because I wanted a weak class which needed to use other skills to win the day -- not just blast, blast, blast.  And, amazingly, this is exactly what I got.<P>Enchanters don't need more DD.  Had Shakaama (and many others of us) had inadequate DD, then we'd never be able to solo past 15th level -- and yet we can.  It takes awhile, sure -- we don't layeth down the smack like anyone else -- but we can solo, using the other tools we have available to us.<P>We do not, in general, want to be wizards.  We want to be enchanters.<P>No enchanter would have a problem with Velious if the difficulty of Velious were that it required a change of tactics for us.  Instead, Velious simply says, "No, you can't do that, have a nice day -- somewhere else."<P>Imagine for a moment that Verant turned the tables in Velious and had enchanter mobs which actually used the Mesmerize line, and mobs which knew how to coordinate their attacks on a single target.  In other words, imagine that mobs did unto us what we enchanters have been doing unto them for so long.<P>THAT would be a challenge, and it wouldn't require millions of HP's.  Every caster with Dispel Magic suddenly has a vitally needed spell, and mobs wouldn't need to cast AE Pillage Enchantment (oh what fun THAT was...), because we'd be stripping buffs and debuffs and mez's off ourselves!<P>Instead, all we have to look forward to are extra spells of questionable or minimal value, coupled with the reduction of our activities to dispensing two buffs every twenty to thirty minutes, and mobs whose AE dispel attacks make the value of the only thing we have left -- our buffs -- questionable, anyway!<P>Wouldn't you feel betrayed?<P>I do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>what I would like to see is a change in the way our spells affect lower level creatures.  It's rather disheartning to cast Anarchy on a spiderling and have it resisted.  As a 35th level Enchanter I would think a spell that does over 200 points of damage can dispatch a level 2 creature.  Furtheremore take a look at our self only buffs.  Please have them overwite the Shaman talisman series. It's really frustrating to have it cast on you and then be unable to overwrite it with your own spell designed to protect only you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The 'trick' is enchanter ballance is greatly influenced by the environment they are in. Because an enchanters 'purpose' is to change their environment.<P>The short version, i'll wax eloquent further down.<P>Antonica - enchanters slightly overpowerful partialy because they're not 'necessary'. risk vs reward has 2 years of ballance though and the rewards go down slightly with each expansion, its about right. dont change it imo (the 1-50 game)<P>Kunark - Enchanters seen as necessary (i dont think they really are except extreme circumstances) but IMO well ballanced. <P>Velious - Enchanters under ballanced mostly because they dare not interact with their environment in any conventional way.<P>Velious class ballance is a different ball of wax. IMO enchanters need for velious one or more of the following.<P>- Practical use of our less used more ballanced spell lines in velious. Perhaps curse of feeble mind, weakening, whirl, lull, our exceptional recant magic or other 'lost' spell lines could be given notable, less resistable , ballanced purpose in velious (land of resistance and home of the invalid target  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )<P>- A reveiw of enc taunts vs velious mobs if we are to continue trying our conventional spells. (ie lower taunt on the highest end or velious version spells so we dont automatically die trying)<P>- The most complex idea but one with coolest posibilities i imagine A new 'combat time' spell line to cast which will affect encounters including velious encounters in a ballanced way. (wizards due to hp ramp have similar problems)<P>Hear me out!<BR> Mez, charm and all enc MR based spells have been i think obviously deemed unballancing for 80k hp quad 250 hitting mobs in velious. Enc's cant cast them in velious. This comes under the auspice of a new 'enchanterish' purpose in each fight that wont be as unballanced as our old purpose. New buffs dont count as they span time, not at fight level. root is NOT an enchanter purpose. Wizards and rangers do it as well as us. Paladins do it best.<P>Ideas for this that i dont think would alter too much ballance but give enc's a place again, perhaps some new kind of taunt control, perhaps a new spell to partially combat procs, or casting, or cure the effects of these (a self immunity to some/few detrimental effects and ability to cure it from others? stun comes to mind). Group level casts with short duration and significant effect would have tactical use without greatly altering fight ballance. There are hundreds of ideas i'm sure. (Group Phasing: half taunt, half damage against entire group for 10 seconds, cost 300 mana, * useful, * skill and timing required, * not universally benefitial, *automaticaly limits itself by mana pool and number of encs in group. Extreme mebe but an example.) <P>Food for thought.<P>Some concerns.  A lot of what i see here is asking for improvement / fixes without any ballance relation. Fair enough. I think requesting new spell lines, abilities, is a bit out of line and neends ballance justification I definitely know requesting verant re-make a class how it "Should" be, how someone would feel powerful being, or how in literature it has been. Is pointless. <P>Verant has said it before, They didnt build popular mythology or literature representations. They dont apply, If they chose to name a coldain dwarf as "Apple" you dont tell them apples are supposed to be red and hairless. They built Norrath, So lets talk Norrath. If they call this class "enchanters", lets ballance a Norrathian enchanter.<P>These threads are about ballance?<P>I ask myself, how can you ballance a class based system? The entire premise is that each class have its own strenghts and weaknesses therefore anyone looking at other classes will always see strengths they dont have and feel weak.<P>Enchanters, as the game seems to play out, are perhaps the most unusual and therefore the most un-comparable to other classes. We are not damagers (directly), nor are we healers (directly). So what do we ballance against? PvE the "ballance" is decidedly one sided. <P>Btw, i find the PvE ballance of sebelis for encs very good. A nice mix of resistances (boks, krups, illis) (jug,mycon,reet) that offer challenge to both priority and mana pool, and it is possible to survive the taunt of 'most' of my spells on.<P>I disagree with those that say Dictate is underpowered or needs improvement. 50 seconds of control over a velious mob is the best damage spell in the game and imo worth 700 mana. Trick is surviving afterwards  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>However there IS a problem in Velious in that if you're not lvl 60 and dont have dictate. The enc is best doing ONLY what he's done since lvl 16 speed and clarity. Sorry no excitement there. The problem left is nothing really 'new' for the enc to challenge in velious. Since any challenge from the enc against a velious encounter is greeted by <BR>"This mob cannot be affected by x spell"<BR>or<BR>"This mob resists your x spell"(99% of the time)<BR>Mob hits YOU for 1/3 your total buffed hp.<BR>Mob hits YOU for 1/3 your total buffed hp.<BR>Mob hits YOU for 1/3 your total buffed hp.<BR>Loading please wait...<P>root? you're wearing a robe! let the paladin do it - trust me on that.<BR>slow? see shaman. or better see tank with proc weapon.<P>I'll stop here for now.<P>Well that's my second stab at ballance review for an environment altering class.<P>Antonica/Kunark, we're ok.<P>Velious, badly in need of ballanced enchanter type purpose. Short term, combat level improvement to control situations without our typically huge alterations of them. (taunting to myself in one spell is a huge alteration  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )<P>thanks again for the time.<P>Edair N'mirroz &lt; Legion &gt;<BR>Enchanter of Veeshan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For a enchanter 15 buff slot is not enough. There are many time I run out of room, to cast some nice buffs on myself. What about combining some buffs into one spell, and make them self only. <BR>Combine our shield with a cha buff, int buff, see inv and ultravision at higher lvl's. Lets say lvl 49 and 55.<P>Very few enchanter's keep up a rune on ourselves, just to expensive, and no open spell slot. So what about having a buff that gives us a self only regenerative  rune.<P>We need a mez line for giants and dragons. Right now uber guilds bring 1 ench with a epic on high lvl raids, to keep everyone buffed.  What about a short duration, very short casting time, low mana, and single target mez for giants and dragons.  Some mez that would force us to chain cast the spell, With it we can hold up to 2 target's with a mez, if you are good in switching targets back and forth.  In this case a regenerative rune would be very nice, because we would not have a stun for this types of mobs.<P>Boon of garou, a very nice spell but I never have it up, no free spell slot. Can you make it like our other buff, load it, cast it, remove it.<P>We have the best magic debuffers in the game, I never have it loaded, no free spell slot. Can we have a item with, theft of thought on it, so we can open a spell slot for recant magic.<P>I need to get around the battleground fast could we have a illusion that gives us some extra speed in dungeons.<P>I love crowd control, I have not killed giants or dragons yet, because I can't do the one thing I love. So please give us a mez for the new continent. I would like to leave seb one day, and explore, but only if I can have fun, and a buff machine is not fun.

</FONT><HR>Also pls review the casting times/spells of the vellius enchanter items from Plane of growth - the robe casting rune iv is just not worth if you can cast rune V for the same price an just a litte more mana (faster casting means medding up the difference), legs that cast a casting-10s clarity are just used to buffed Younger players at the bank - sure it helps to save a spell slot and rememing spells - but hell even after a corspe run i rather wait till i have the mana for Clarity II then to cast this 10s spell on someone.<BR>And why has the lvl35mob necro/SK item from droga a instant invisibility while our Enchanter boots have more like 7s casting - sure its saves a spot and is a nice trick but for a Planar item you need 2 to 3 full 50plus players to get it - it could have at least a shorter casting time... same applies also to most of the other caster items dropped there in my oppion....except may be for the dd- caster robes - <P>And please start looking into the PVP-problems Enchanters have at highlvl have on Cash-loot only servers like Vallon Zek/Tallon Zek. The Enchanter BotB should be hillarious... :-) Rapture... mana drain.... and probably  death by speed pet as we dont have any other means to hurt a mr buffed up person other then melee and pets (charmed pets are not welcome in pvp due to highrisk of xp loss) - <BR>sigh<BR>Marem Beguiler lvl57 VZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1)  There needs to be a consolidation of high level enchanter buffs.  For one thing, this helps to obviate the tedium of stand, cast, cast, cast, sit, demem, mem, stand, cast, cast, cast, cast, sit, demem, mem, stand, cast, sit, demem...<P>    Consolidating clarity and the int/wis and mana lines of spells would be a good step.  Providing a "sight" spell that would consolidate Ultravision and See Invisible would similarly be useful, and even better would be a group spell with resist magic, see invis and ultravision.<P>2)  Fire resistance based mezes/charms.  This addresses some components of the Velious problems people are experiencing.<P>3)  New spells.  Area of Effect Dispel Magic would be nice.  A new Tashan spell with a dispel component would be even nicer (and, again, helps deal with the perpetual spell-swapping).  <P>    New TYPES of charms would also be interesting.  I would like to see a mob enchantment that summons the mob back to the enchanter similar to the way that 51+ mobs can summon players (i.e. "you will not evade me...")<P>    More mana manipulation spells would be nice, as well.  Perhaps a short-duration high-regen, long recasting clarity.  Perhaps mana-transfer spells.  <P>    FEEDBACK:  Enchanter damage shields should be different from magician and druid damage shields.  Enchanter damage shields should REFLECT damage... or perhaps keep feedback as is, but add a DAMAGE REFLECTION spell that rebounds, say, 10% of damage dealt to the target.  There would also be a 10% damage reduction component, of course.<P>Those are my thoughts.  It would be nice to get some feedback on them.<P>Maldisdain Atheist<BR>*** Illusionist ***</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ill be the representative from the boards as well as Neferti who already posted..<P>Change whirl and the upgrade to work like cleric stun and holy might.  To tell the truth, lessening the max length on this spell has no effect because it never reaches it.<P>Remove Sentinel.  Worthless after nerf just pisses people off.<BR>Remove Strength.  Why do we get this?<BR>Remove True North.  Useless?<BR>Remove Calm line.  Cant think of a time i would have to have this.<BR>Remove Shifting sight line.  Pointless.<BR>Remove Curse of simple mind.  Too resisted/useless.<BR>Remove invigor line.  Why do we get this anyway? It has nothing to do with our specalties.<P>Make our power over magic spells the same as wizards with the ability to overcome much higher resistances.  They have it for ice, magic, and fire.  Why cant Enchanters have it only for magic?  Its easily arguable that we control magical forces better than they do.  What would I, personally, sacrifice for this power?  My pet easily, and all the other spells I just mentioned, not to mention fear, all multiple target mez, all DOTS, all slows, all blurs.  I can make the knife go deeper.... all shifts.... all mana regen... Id give it all up for this power.... Make our spells able to hit something with 2MR per level.  At level 60 let me hit 120MR We are representatives of gods at lvl 60, my god would give me that power NP but he is innorruk... Id even take 1.8MR per level or 1.7 per.<P>Remove level based magic resistance increases for players.<P>Blur - Make it work at high levels.<P>Give us another spell at level 56+ that removes ALL effects on any target like pillage used to do way back in the day.  Even if it doesnt remove disease/poison effects we would still like to have the spell. <P>Reoccurring Amnesia - People always tell each other not to waste time getting this.<P>Armor Sets - Design it for enchanters.  Give all the same type of resist instead of each one different.  Do this with all ENC sets.  Make hate all save vs fire.  Make kael all save vs cold etc.  This 10 of one resist to come up with +10 resist all at the end doesnt do anything.  Not to mention it seems like everything that saves vs poison just happens to be a foot slot item?  It is interesting that to get high mr you have to mix one piece of insidious one piece of cryosilk and single items from other entire sets just make say cryo all save vs cold because its cryo and we all know what that means... and make insidious protect from fire since thats what hates all about.  Make beguilers protect all against one thing etc.  This would definately help a lot in dungeons and would give a feeling of progressive dungeons.  You clear all of fear and pick up the cryosilk items then you can go over to cold dungeonX and use the cold resistances on all the cryo items to your advantage there.  As it stands now you have to go to fear and pray for the drop you need, then to the same thing in hate, then do the same thing...<P>Give us Shadowstep or something else with the same effect.  So far Necros, Wizards, Bards, and Rogues have this spell, and Enchanters could possibly need it most considering all the 100% MR things and the fact that with 3-4 items a player can be invincible to enchanters after tishania.  Ok for Bards and Rogues its an item(cap of the insubstantial) that just happens to come off "Tolapumj" which just happens to be an ENC mob.  The ENC mobs get items with shadowstep.... gee let me think about this.... cant say they dont give it to some enchanters then....<P>Do not consider illusions for balancing issues, illusions do not balance anything.  <P>Also look at enchanter mobs, I had one 11 levels lower and myself with 150MR+ and it was landing every single DD and charm it casted on me.  Now assuming the 10MR/level higher that would mean if I was the same level as it it would be able to hit 100% of the spells it casted on me if I had max MR.  This is also interesting because players cant hit players with spells having even half of either condition be true.  Enchanters wont hit anyone 5+ levels higher and they wont hit anyone ever if they have 75MR after tishan.<P>Add a key that allows you to go back to previous target.<P>Lengthen the time our buffs last at 50+ maybe even giving it to us percentage wise to lvl 60 at which level any buff cast would be double duration.<P>Enchanters need higher caps in defensive skills like Defense and Dodge.  Enchanters are the second biggest taunter in the game and this would allow you to leave the taunts the same so that everything would still come kill the enchanters every fight but they would be able to defend themselves a little better.<P>Wake of Tranquility - This can only be used for pulling entire camps and any other class can pull entire camps just as well as we can.<P>Tsunamii Val'Sharess<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aggro of tash line of spells needs to be reduced.  Enchanters should not have to wait as long as they do to tash 50+ mobs as they currently do without commiting suicide.<P>Dictate needs it's duraction increased. Enchanters already have more spells we need than we can mem at a time, and huge re-cast delay spells that don't have ballanced durations or effects are not practicle.<P>Illusions should not drop on LD or when zoning. Dieing because you go LD during a fight is bad enough, but its rediculas that i can be illusion ogre in grobb and be perfectly safe, until i LD, returning and getting owned.  Illusions should not drop when zoning because there is no roleplaying reason behind it, and it is rather irritating because zones are not marked.  Having certain zones where illusions fall would be ok, such as with DMF when entering the Hole or Velketor if you can back it up with reasoning, but in general illusions like all other buffs should not drop when zoning.  Someone said in an ealier thread that illusions should drop on zoning so that you can gate from neriak to freeport and your DE illusion in fade, and i disagree with this person. If you want to gate to freeport drop your illusion first. If you cant find a safe place to drop illusion Risk Vs. Reward says your getting off to easy by being able to gate from there not KOS and arrive in freeport not KOS also.<P>Illusion death:  Yes it would be cool, but if it was intoduced like FD for necros it would be too unbalancing. We should not be able to almost instantly FD.  I think illusion death should be intoduced aimed at assisting CR. If we can look like a lamp post we should be able to look like a corpse.  Give us a 20 second casting time illusion death.  We wont be able to duck away from getting killed but when it is apparent a raid is going to fail we should be able to fake our death if we can back off for 20 seconds or so to assist in CR.<P>Memory blur: Our highest lvl memory blur should do a 100% memory blur on almost all mobs unless it is resisted and we get a "X has resisted your memory blur spell." Mobs that it should not work on are for example gods/dragon.  You could even say that some races have too good memory to be memblured such as erudites or something, similar as to how giants are too large to mezz, but for the majority of mobs memblur should be 100% effective all the time unless it is resisted and we GET A MESSAGE.<P>If we dont get a message, it should work. For example: If an enchanter color slants in PoG they see Protector of growth is stunned by whatever colors. Its a lie.  Mobs that are immune to stun should give a resist message.<P>illusions: illusion male/illusion female are already in the spdat file just let us use them please, we are masters of illusion.<P>PoG armor:  Clarity effect on pants is 100% useless.  I can med enough to cast c2 on myself in the time it takes to cast c1 off the pants.  Please put c2 on the pants, or anything that is usefull.  Put something on the pants that we would use, even if not often. Put overwhelming spenddour on it.  We dont cast it that often but it would be one less spell we have to mem.  Even Ultravision would be ok, or even better a new spell is is combo of ultravision and see invis.  Umbra, gift of pure thought, gift of brilliance, pillage enchantment, anything that we would use.  As it stands the only reason to use PoG/Quest legs is to cast clarity 1 on newbies withouth having to pull it out of the back of our spellbooks. Invis on boots is nice but just takes to long to cast. Its handy being able to use to invis your group when running through kael or WW or something, but with time it takes to cast it 6 times, i could mem invis and invis 6 people with lower cast times.  As far as the robe goes, rune4 is a waste of a peridot. We can't use the robe to chain rune somebody effectivly due to cast time, and there is really no reason to use it. Times that enchanters are needed for lots of runes we usually have a specific task and therefor can free up a slot for the much more efficent rune 5.  If you want a rune effect for robe, give it rune 3 with a 8 second cast or soemthing so we can occasionlly rune ourselves with a cheap rune to save clerics mana or something.<P>Also, this is not specifically an enchanter issue, but could we please have a casting time box for item effects?  Using a right clickable effects still makes us do the same thing as casting the spell, so can we please see the time?  It very irriating not knowing if your spell has finished casting because the person you are casting on is not in range of you seeing "X's body pulses with the spirit of the shissar."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>one more thing.  Area effect Clarity 2 would be very usefull on raids where there is only one enchanter and we have to constantly keep everyone c2'ed.  If clerics can get AE healing why cant get AE c2?
