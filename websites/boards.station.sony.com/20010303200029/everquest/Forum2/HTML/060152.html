&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This patch has proved the death of the cleric class. There were 2 major changes that, while neither would have killed, nor even maimed, the class, taken together, they've ruined us.<P>Change One.) Shamans and Druids are brought up to par in healing power, or nearly so, with clerics. That is, minus the ability to CH.<P>Change Two.) Complete heal now seems to generate the amount of aggro the spell heals (10 000 points of damage, or the amount of HP actually healed; not sure which).<P>Now, I will give two examples of what the aggro change did, as the first one's impact I think is self evident.<P>I was in PoG with my guild knocking down rares, getting our 14th melodic bp + legs. This is one example of what happened ALL night. The monk in my group FD pulls two thiflings. The chanter, using Tash (nice change btw, I def. noticed my enc not dying a lot), pulls a thifling off of the monk, as the monk kites the other between river and the guardian. Now in my group I also have the main tank, and as the tank gets low I toss a bp heal on him, and then a CH. My CH is perfect, well timed, efficient; I risked 10 seconds of not being able to do anything, and get paid off by the efficiency of the HP healed. Patting myself on the back, I turn around and get run over by a thifling. We finish the first thifling off as everyone turns to me, and I get heals from the other clerics there. But the thifling will NOT GET off. I Divine barrier, and gain 18 seconds of respite. then the thif turns on me AGAIN and continues to pound me for double 180s until I die.<P>In OS before the second patch, I was in a shroom group. We get a pull of a warrior. We attack the warrior, blah blah blah, but an adept pats onto us and the enc GoKs it, tashes it, and slows it (60 enc). We finish the warrior, me having used one CH and one DL. The warrior taunts, and breaks mes. I have the enc on my hotkey ready to heal his ass. I don't need to. The adept runs straight at me. He proceeds to tear me a new [EXPLETIVE]. I DB, when that wears out, and I basically get my ass kicked by this slowed shroom, constantly getting interrupted. I die. My group zones.<P>Now, from what we have seen, Complete Heal, when used WELL, is actually a BAD THING. When I use it well, I get UNTAUNTABLE AGGRO and I die. My guildmates offered me a solution "use remedy and DL". [EXPLETIVE]. You can't remedy and DL on [EXPLETIVE] mobs that hit for 200+. Complete Heal is the ONLY thing we get over druids in the healing department, but complete healing is UNUSABLE IN THE CURRENT INCARNATION, AND WILL MOST LIKELY BE IN IT'S NEXT. So why get a cleric over a druid or shaman? CH? Wait that's unusable mainly! We COULD use it so it's not efficient at all, at DL efficiency, but then what would be the point? DL is faster cast. There is NO point having a cleric other then reses, and you only need ONE for that, or one sitting at the zone. Any more and they're druids who've been emasculated.<P>Shamans can slow. They can DD. They can DoT. They can summon a useful pet. They have mana regen (can). They can buff hp and stats, their HP buffs stack w/ druid and cleric buffs. They can heal.<P>Druids can port. They can snare. They can solo. They can dot. They can DD. They can group gate. They can damage shield. They can heal.<P>A cleric can heal, he can buff (Heroism is overshadowed by the last druid buff, they don't stack), and he can stun (useless on mobs over 55, the [EXPLETIVE] I'm fighting). But that healing... It's superior to everyone else. He has CH!... But wait. CH is unusable due to hate issues. What's the point of having a cleric? Druids can buff almost as much HP as a clerics hero and symbol w/ ONE spell. Druids can nuke. they can dot, snare evac. Shamans can slow. They can slow... And they can slow. Did you know slowing is what a shaman does?<P>Why have a cleric!? BECAUSE HE HAS CH, which is UNUSABLE. <P>Cleric = dead class. Thanks info, good bye, time to twink my warrior. Too bad my good [EXPLETIVE] is no drop.<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>Stop the presses, please.<P>Try to let the patch "dust" settle a bit before we all "fly off the handle."<P>Although the preliminary reports that I've seen so far are not very encouraging, I don't think we should be screaming just yet.  Only a bit more time will really give us a more complete and lucid picture about the effects of this patch.<P>For any clerics out there that're understandably feeling no small amount of angst towards Verant right now...

</FONT><HR>Keep in mind that this is just one set of changes.  Right now hate list management is totally out of whack because there's no way to for a cleric to drop lower on the hate list.  If they fix atone and enchanter hate wipes in the next patch, maybe that will fix the problem.<P>Failing that, we'll have to learn new ways of prepping a mob before we engage it.

The spell was never designed as an in heal spell.  It evolved into it because verant added ungodly amounts of hps to mobs.  However, as often is pointed out here in the threads, many dont use cheal, they use remedy/divine light.  <P>I cant think of any reason that such a large heal shouldnt cause more aggro.

So why get a cleric over a druid or shaman? CH? Wait that's unusable mainly! We COULD use it so it's not efficient at all, at DL efficiency, but then what would be the point? DL is faster cast. There is NO point having a cleric other then reses, and you only need ONE for that, or one sitting at the zone. Any more and they're druids who've been emasculated."<P>Well youll get that cleric because he can reduce downtime with cheal.....the original intention of the spell.  Additionally dont discount reses....they are huge post 50 as you well know.  Deaths without a res can often mean a huge loss of gaming hours exp wise...<P>Styxx wrtoe, "Shamans can slow. They can DD. They can DoT. They can summon a useful pet. They have mana regen (can). They can buff hp and stats, their HP buffs stack w/ druid and cleric buffs. They can heal."<P>Do you nuke when you heal?  Most clerics I know dont nuke when they are primary healer...why would suddenly a druid/shaman start dotting/nuking if they are the primary? <P>If I start a group with sha/dru as a primary healer, you can bet your bottom dollar that Im gonna tell them, you nuke, youre gone....period. <P>Styxx wrote, "Druids can port. They can snare. They can solo. They can dot. They can DD. They can group gate. They can damage shield. They can heal."<P>See above.<P>Styxx wrote, "A cleric can heal, he can buff (Heroism is overshadowed by the last druid buff, they don't stack), and he can stun (useless on mobs over 55, the [EXPLETIVE] I'm fighting). But that healing... It's superior to everyone else. He has CH!... But wait. CH is unusable due to hate issues. What's the point of having a cleric? Druids can buff almost as much HP as a clerics hero and symbol w/ ONE spell. Druids can nuke. they can dot, snare evac. Shamans can slow. They can slow... And they can slow. Did you know slowing is what a shaman does?"<P>Downtime is why you have a cleric...you will get a lot less of it.  That includes reses which can save lost time in finding a cleric, corpse retrieval, etc etc.  This game is about avoiding time between kills (mostly) a cleric helps you avoid the downtime much more than a druid/shaman ever will.  <P>However maybe now the cleric wont be the only viable healing option in the mid 50's and beyond.<P>Styxx wrote, "Why have a cleric!? BECAUSE HE HAS CH, which is UNUSABLE."<P>See above. <P>Styxx wrote, "Cleric = dead class. Thanks info, good bye, time to twink my warrior. Too bad my good [EXPLETIVE] is no drop."<P>I would correct that last statement to the whiny cleric is a dead class. <P>Reiryc<P><BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

I did NOT complain about druid and shaman healing.<P>My main beef is the hate change, which makes the CH unusable. Now druids and shamans heal EXACTLY the same as a cleric. As to not DDing while healing? I do it. If I'm FM and I'm bored I'll DD. I'll use my hammer. I'll do that [EXPLETIVE]. my groups will tolerate it because I keep them alive and I keep the heals rolling.<P>Are you irrational? You seem to think that druids and shamans should be healing JUST AS WELL AS CLERICS. That's idiocy at best... I'm not doing a point by point reply, mainly due to the fact your whole post seems to be based on this premise and completely ignores the hate changes... Which makes me think you're not part of a guild, nor a druid who groups.<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

So clerics, for paying the price in specializing in healing to the extent that they sacrifice almost all else... Can make it so there is 4 less minutes of downtime per hour, over a druid? Most likely less.

</FONT><HR>I disagree Diggler, but i can respect your POV.<P>The reason why people could get around VS's ability? Wizards (fast kill), and aggro management. What? They've ruined aggro management, and mobs in velious have 200k hp?<P>I was one of the first people to kill VS, and was probably one of the first people to kill VS using a method that did not involve oodles of wizards after VS was upgraded. I seriously cannot see any work arounds now, other then adding more and more people, and as you probably know, there is a hardware limit to that. More then 40 people in a confined space will cause massive LD.<P>I could kill tunare today if I could get some cooperation between guilds on my server (need many of the "right" class). But Tunare is a straight forward fight, really. A mob that quads for 700 can kill any tank in 2-3 rounds. a CH is 2-3 rounds. What's the solution? You control aggro such that a CH is landing on a tank every 2 rounds, or such that the aggro is shifting to another tank every 2 rounds. However, unfortunately, this will not work. The mob will simply beat tank one into the ground, then kill the cleric who CHs him, because the tank CANNOT match the damage output of the mob therefore a CH will by definition have MORE aggro then the warrior.

</FONT><HR>Yes, we must have a second healer in the group now from all I have seen.  With Complete Healing a death sentence, that means either the Druid / Shaman will be chain healing their new heals on the tank, or on the Cleric.  Chain healing on the Cleric is bad mana efficiency.  Clerics don't tank as well as meleers before the meleers get defenseive skills, so I know for a fact that there is more to tanking than just defenseive skills, defense and AC.  So, the Cleric class will be using the same heals that the Druid and Shaman classes will be using at the very same time.  Not only are two healers required, they will be insufficient.  I suppose that Verant will have to tweak the agro, but until that time, I will be playing alternates or farming greens.  Enjoy the new healing.  When we come back, you will be expected to know all the tricks to healing that Clerics have learned, and if you don't, you won't get a group because your reputation will be shot.

Why's that? because anything beyond 32k hp, or similar HP, just got 10x as hard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What kind of sick, demented, sadistic people run this game anyway? When we clerics said the class was boring, let us do something other than heal/med/heal/med, WE DIDN'T MEAN DIE!! <P>So now the cycle goes like this heal/die/heal/die, sounds like a whole lotta fun!!<P>Another thing is, druids are a soloing class primarily, so if they want to (and they obviously have) become more group friendly, NERF THEIR SOLO ABILITIES!!! C'mon, common sense here, Druids have the best of both worlds now, solo and now group, what kind of balance is this!! <P>OR Since Clerics have become less group friendly because of the CH nerf (which it is, face it, they may not have directly nerfed it, but they made it worthless) make Clerics more solo capable, give some DoT's or something, simply giving us invisi, or some type of self only gate, isn't gonna makeup for what you did. <P>As i look back, i pray this is some sick joke or dream that will be over with tomorrow, you guys have really REALLY screwd things up this time...."BALANCE" HA! what a joke...a sick and unfair one...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree with original post.<P>this patch means two main things for clerics:<P>1) you (as a cleric) will die more and with you, your party.<P>2) you will be less demanded for most encounters due the MASSIVE market of druids out there.<P>In the end result this will cause more druids to be created and played and more clerics to become res mules.<P>To the druids that argue we should WAIT, its only the beginning of the ballance threads... well I say if they cant do it at once they should bring the servers down for 2 weeks until they did, this is NO FUN.<P>To the guy who suggested to play a druid if they are so great. I have played over 130 levels on 4 different druids they ARE that great. Its stunning, they get it all, just everything to a degree that you wonder why not ressurection and dual wield. And yes this patch will make me play my druid more who is curently 35th level on my play server. Can you say /played 2 days and 17 houers? <P>snorfen.<P>52 Vicar on Cazic Thule. Soon to be forgotten and living on as a res myst. <P>Kellrim <P>35 DROOD on Cazic Thule. Yes, they got me play the class THEY WANT.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
