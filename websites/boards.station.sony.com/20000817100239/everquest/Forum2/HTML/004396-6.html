</FONT><HR>I think that any GvE teaming will have to be limited to being based on race. I dont think god or class can be taken into account. One example used in a lot of posts is a gnome necro, so let's stick with that one. True if it was a strict GvE then the necro should be on the evil team. However, without drastically changing the whole game structure the gnome can only be created in Akanon. This means that you have a character having to be in a place where the majority of people around him are on another team. As he gets known, he becomes a target a sort of "here is someone I can kill without having to go far to do it". Ultimately you will probably not have gnome necro even chosen as an option to play, and applying this to all the class/god combinations that would end up being KOS to most people in their home towns (necros, shadow knights from any "good race" for example) you will cut down on the diversity and choices people feel they can make in what to play.<P>GvE might be a good idea, but it needs to be GvE based on race only, no one should end up being killable by the people they have to share a home with, everyone needs some place in the world that they can feel at least a bit safe in. If you could change it so necros have a choice of evil cities to start in regardless of race that could work, same with diety. Unfortunately I cant see Verant making that type of change, so the idea of Neutral, or team based on god or team based on profession, would be more damaging than helpful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The major point we need to get across is 95% of the light guilds play it light VS dark, not GvsE, if you implemented religion based, or didn't allow other teams to heal each other in pvp, you really would be making the dark team the strongest, opening up a ton of exploit possibilities, and virtually ripping apart every light guild on TZ. the Geography in game is not set up for 4 team pvp. <P><BR>-Dalrak Dragonsoul, loyal cleric of brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>When Abashi said "Good vs Evil", I'm pretty sure he meant "light races versus dark races".<P>Actually implementing good vs evil (and presumedly "neutral" as a third team or something) would be great.... for a new server.  But to implement it on VZ/TZ now would obviously wreck existing guilds and at any rate would be a lot more trouble than I invision Verant wanting to bother with.<P>#4 with "light races vs dark races" would be no trouble, and would be a serious improvement over what we have today.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>GOOD VS EVIL!?!?!  YES!!!<P>I've been long in favor of this, but I have one question: Does this mean that good Humans can fight against evil Humans, and the evil Humans would be one the dark "team"?  Or does it simply mean the merging of the short/elf/human teams?  If it means the prior, I'm ALL for it!!  There is even good reason ingame that the opposing sides could not heal/buff one another.  Just to be clear the evil team would consist of all dark races as well as characters with an evil god, ideally, IMHO.<P>PLEASE make a G v E server!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There has the potential to be very exploitable.  Many people are making this a balance of power issue.  On Tallon Zek the teams have subsided into a Light vs. Dark environment.  The players have come to this on their own because the balance of power for over 9 months laid with the dark races (team orange).  The server is not simply about numbers but about equipment and levels as well.  For a very long time team light has fought to overcome the force and are now starting to gain ground.  Since this natural shift of power has happened some very few vocal members are consistently petitioning the GM's to try and change the gaming code to benefit team orange.  <P>Tallon Zek is a very political server that has shown the ability to adapt to any number of situations.  The community has worked very hard to prevent light vs. dark X-Teaming, as time goes on there are more people who wish for a 4 team environment.  The community has a way of adapting and working through balances of power.  Alliances are formed and broken on a weekly basis, this is what makes the game very interesting and extremely fun.  <P>Out of range healing has been on the server since day 1.  It very rarely becomes an issue of harrasment but when it does the GMs do a wonderful job of dealing with the situation.  Healing lower levels on your team promotes team unity and should not be impacted.  Would a knight let a squire be killed while he is standing there?  Preventing +8/-8 healing and buffing would be a VERY BAD IDEA.  We have learned to deal with difficult situations, when faced with an OOR healer we simply call in for reinforcements...it is very gratifying to overcome these odds and an important part of the game.<P>1) NO: *VERY* Bad idea which will take away the political aspect of the game which is a big reason why many people still play.<P>2) No: *VERY* Bad idea which will hurt the teamwork of a single team.<P>3) No: Code should not control the server environment, the population should.<P>4) G vs. E is an idea, but one that would need careful consideration as characters and classes were formed with the current server environment in place.  Also the balance of power would greatly benefit the Evil and not the Good team.  This arrangement should be about benefiting both sides...team orange has been in power for 9 months, it would be wrong to simply squash what team light has just begun to accomplish.  Again putting code in to prevent helping others would be a bad idea - the server community has the ability to keep this under control.  We have done it for over a year on TZ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>1) The darks are now getting their clocks cleaned. 3 on 1 is now getting unbalanced. Darks were the one's that had more higher levels. But, with Kunark and the wide open hunting places, the lights have leveled and caught up. I see it getting more unbalanced every day.<P> Yes it is how we played for the past year. But it is time to evolve if we won't to keep PvP fun.<P>2) the Out of range healer thing is getting abused more and more everyday as we (the PCs that play healers) have reached the higher levels now. We have a lot more higher level healers walking around now than a year ago...yes?<P>  I would be all in favor of a +- 8 level healing/buffing  range. <P>I think that the other non-healing class bring up a good point when they say : Me a level 50 monk can't do anything to help that level 15 PC, so why should the Level 50 cleric be able to make a PvP impact.<P>and at level 39+ making it +- 15<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How hard would it be to have a new flag, similar to the /roleplay flag?  When this flag is off, you can be buffed by anyone as usual, but you cannot attack any PC (as if you were on a blue server).  Turn the flag on and all your buffs switch off and you can only be buffed or healed by your own team, but you can now attack the other teams.  Note that when the flag is off, you still can be attacked by others with the flag on from opposing teams, you just can't attack until you turn your flag on (which wipes all buffs to prevent you from getting buffed by a non-teammate just before attacking).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

We had a full group on a halfling warrior blue to us, but we never even took out 1/4th of her life ebcuase she had a lvl 49 druid throwing down thorn sields and chlorplasts and heals, and was *heavily* twinked( a lvl 20 w/ full crafted, resist jewelery, and dual yaks).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What you descriped does not sound like abuse at all.  In that case it seems like you should have decided not to kill the halfling and gone onto easier prey.  There is nothing that says you *must* be able to kill whomever you want.<P>The team spirit should not be squashed.  I myself have had to deal with out of range healers for well over a year (character was created in Aug of 1999), and I can tell you without a doubt that they can be dealt with.  There have been several occasions where I was not able to kill my oponent, but even more where I was able to bring in support and kill him with numbers.<P>There is nothing more satisfying then to kill somebody under the protection of a high level caster.  It adds an entire new aspect of role playing, and the abuse of it is rare - despite what others profess.  <P>There is absolutely no reason to make code changes to affect this - the GM's do a superb job of responding to the *RARE* harrasment issues.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>one solution overlooked may be to open up the healer to attacks by his or her own team.<BR>If team A is attacking team B and someone from team B heals someone from team A he or she could be attacked from anyone on team B until he zones.<BR>I think Verant should be able to set it up this way. An example is if the Gnomes were attacking the Elves and an Elf heals the Gnomes, other Elves would be able to attack him. Once a heal or buff spell is cast on a Gnome the Elf opens himself up to attacks by his team. The only downfall would be if an elf kills an elf how would the faction loss be handled..Hmmm maybe only a faction loss to Gnomes (or what ever team the elf helps). Or no faction loss to the same team? Anyway just a suggestion..and that is what Abashi is looking for is feedback. <BR>There are too many flaws in the other suggestions as i see them. <P>Baltik Zealot<BR>Gnome Wizard who likes to group with other "teams"<BR>to defeat evil in Norrath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think that TZ should be made a GvE server with no crossteaming. Followers of Discord could be potential exceptions. Like a neutral party. If you make it a no cross teaming server you would be ruining the entire structure of TZ. 90% of the guilds on the server operate GvE. Many guilds have based their entire operations on killing darks, and assisting lights. If there was a no crossteaming rule, all darks would have the advantage. There are as many, if not more members of the dark team than there are all of the three others combined. I know many people that have High level characters on Tallon Zek. If all we are going to do is get killed every three minutes by a dark dominated world, while our good team members can only stand by and watch we will most likely quit everquest. This is a very touchy issue for many people. With many of the servers inhabitants already playing GvE I think that it would be the best solution.<P>Thank you for you patience,<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

And its more realistic. If a honored knight starts to attack you or a honored wizard casts a area of effect and your in it..let him be attacks by his comrades and the evil foes...would make things more interesting..It just makes sense and would not hurt game balance..it would solve your problems above..that 50th healer buffing/healing that other team would go kos to his own kind...I would be mad if I couldnt attack this guy helping out..makes no sense..but keep in mind..he isnt in the wrong for helping..so dont prevent him from doing it...just flag him kos instantly..makes more sense...and adds some fun.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>  Basicly it would be like Rallos...but alot more complex..You would want to watch who you kill.<BR>Also how do the guards know who you have killed is behond me..Install a arrest function where instead of this Kos all the time stuff,depending on faction they would either be kosed or arrested and have to sit in jail...Would also add some rp fun to this game...Keep in mind my ideas for inprovment are just suggestions on preserving the game..With all the new ones coming out you need to do alot of changes within the next year..Housing and mounts I know have nothing to do with this but while I am posting Ill suggest...think on them heavly..Players like new things and would love to own their own things like a house or a horse ect..It makes the game alot more fun and you will keep your players a long long time...<BR>   Thanks and good luck <BR>           Jadien</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gimmers,<P>you recommend an above player to just leave the halfling twink and his level 49 druid alone and move on.  Well that pair sounds like they specifically came looking for low level trouble.<BR>That character will never level above 20 because it can a) proc b) get str bonus c) be master at martial skills d) kill all the way down to level 12 and with a 49 druid kill up a pretty good way too.<P>Yes a knight would not stand by and watch a squire die.  But then again can your knight heal an NPC squire?  No.<BR>Just think of it that the OPPOSING forces gods power is blocking YOUR gods power to aid you in the conflict.  Teams will still be needed and many levels will be needed in fact MORE will be needed range wise as one 50 cleric will not be enough to keep alive entire squads of lowbies.<BR>Sure the 24 cleric can be there which means a 30 necro which means a 38 paladin which means a 45 shaman and VOILA the level 50 cleric still gets to play too.  Marvelous.<BR>Everyone wins and those of us who DO not have high level characters or high level friends right there in the area still have a FAIR chance to fight some FUN PvP.<P>And isn't FUN the most important thing?<BR>Or is it just stacking the odds in your favor in a game when the COn system tells you the outcome for 80% of given encounters anyway?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If you make it a 4 team server we wont be able to do planes, dragon runs....ect all lights will quit or go dark once they realize they can do nothing fun at higher lvls which is what they have worked and worked for....TZ is not like blue servers with lots of ppl, with a 4 team server we can do nothing, I think that we cant use AoE spells is bad enough, please we have been punished enough for the 3 team alliance. it will RUIN PvE and thats what people are doing most when playing, we are OK right now so please leave us alone!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My final word on this:<P>1. 4 teams doesn't work for PvE or PvP<BR>2. The elven team lacks some of the strongest PvP classes in the game (Necromancer, Shadowknight, Shaman, Monk) making that team useless for all purposes.<BR>3. The geography will leave the elves stuck on faydwer except for the ability to port.<BR>4. The dark team will outnumber the 3 other teams in both numbers and races.<BR>5. The dark team already has the most secure access to the best dungeons in the game, not to mention (with the exception of humans) the most diverse class choices.<P>So basically it will fall into the Humans vs the darks.  Anyone who has an elven or shorty character might as well forget about planes raids, dragon runs, high level dungeons, getting quest armors (from faction hits with humans) etc.<P>If your "best" choice is implemented, will there be a movelog offered or do we just cancel?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about this. +/- 8 levels on heals and buffs, institute faction hits for indirect killing, like you do for mobs. and after your faction gets to a certain level, you change teams. No reason a human SK wouldn't "go evil" he would hang with the inkies.. In the middle, they would have a problem at home because of faction, and also because of natural faction they would have problems until they finally switched teams for good. At that point they would have at least dubious faction in the other teams home city.<P>Just a thought. Not too much coding I would think. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>RE: Out of range and invulnerable healers not a rare occurace. It's  standard guild policy on Tallon Zek.<P>I wish I can say when I used that exploit, it was a rare occurance. But, I am ashmaed to say it was not. And, many guilds now use that as a standard policy. Level 51 driud healing and buffing a level 7 warrior is just plain lame. And I did do it for the sole purpose of harassment/zone control/"helping a guildmate"/whatever you want to call it was still just plain wrong. <P>And when people say will just call in a higher level to take them out? Ahh come on this newbie guild I harassed barely had anyone over level 10. And it's still just plain wrong.<P>As a level 51 druid I have seen invulnerable healing use A lOT under the pretense that it was helping a guild mate out. But the intention was to use an exploit to make somebody leave a zone(s) by harassing them.<P>This is not a rare occurace, it is an everyday occuarance.<P>I am total against Out of range healing now<P>Druid level 51 Human<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Got to agree with Gordon on this. I play of Tallon Zek alot and if a DE is caught buying, selling, or making deals they are often out of thier guild and mental blacklisted by players that know of the actions. What I also notice is team 1 targeting areas that are often camped by people on team 2 who are several lvls lower. At the same time team 1 is getting healed by someone out of range of team 2, so they can freely med during the battle. Said healing is also taking the money looted from team 2 and holding it so team 2 can not loot is back. smart? Yes. Legal and honorable, depends who is answering. A great example of this is the treants in South Karanas. Lvl 20 to 25s hunt that spawn, usually DEs. About once an hour a group of 28 to 30s come and raid being healed by a 35th or higher cleric. So what do I do? Something equally cutthroat, I wait nearby in zone with a full group of 35s. As you can see its just as bad. Do I like doing this? No, but if I don't the lvl 20s will spend more time on corpse runs then getting XP. Worst off being killed there makes you subject to XP death while getting your corpses if the Treants are too near your corpse. I hate it, because its a waste of my time and the 20s trying to level. Sure I could camp plenty of ligth zones where I know the lvls are much less, examples like OOT and Unrest come to mind but I'd like to think PVP doesn't have to be reduced to who has more healers out of range or camping lower lvl spawn points. Only thing that makes me more said is seeing someone on your team who has teamed with the other because they don't they the character on your team anymore. I can't hit a traitor, which in my mind deserves death more then those who he traded too.     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Comparing the same-team healer and out-of-range healer problems on TZ:<P>Out-of-Range Healer:<BR>----------------------<BR>1) Very common.<BR>2) EXTEREMELY unbalancing when (as is usually the case) the healer is many levels higher than the combatants.<BR>3) Can be fixed without negtively impacting non-exploitive healing, simply by preventing healing only in PvP situations.<P>Same-Team Healer<BR>-----------------<BR>1) Very rare on TZ.<BR>2) Unless the healer is much higher level (which would be prevented by fixing the OOR healer exploit, so is irrelevant), the situation is much less unbalancing, since the healer will often not be able to heal beyond the capacity of the combatants to overcome.<BR>3) Fixing this with Abashi's proposed solution will have a major negative impact on non-exploitive healing, eg a dwarf healing humans fighting a group of trolls.<P>For these reasons, out-of-range healers seem to be a much bigger priority in terms of code-changes.<P>My suggestion would be<BR>A) to use Abashi's suggestion to prevent OOR healing in PvP, though perhaps making someone ineligible when attacking a PC, not when attacked.<BR>B) Address same-team healers by imposing faction hits when a PvP healing leads to the death of the opponent. <P>However, the faction hit should apply ONLY if the person killed was attacked by the healers "friends", not in the reverse case. The reson I say this is that some members of single-race guilds on TZ have stated their intent to ruin the faction of their opponents.<P>Sky<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt; We have learned to deal with difficult situations, when faced with an OOR healer we simply call in for reinforcements...<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>The seriousness of OOR healing may look very different to a low level player than it does to a high level. It also looks very different when you aren't in a big guild with high level members.<P>Calling for reinforcements is not an option for:<BR>1) People not in guilds.<BR>2) People in low-level guilds who don't have willing and availabel high-level allies<BR>3) People in small guilds which have only a few high-level players, who may not be online, or close enough if they are online, to help.<P>In other words, most new players who are playing their first character. I went through that myself - I was in a small, new guild, with nobody to help us when we were confronted by OOR healers, which happened every single time we fought against a group of darks bigger than around 4 characters. It sucked.<P>Sky<P>Sky</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004396&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004396&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
