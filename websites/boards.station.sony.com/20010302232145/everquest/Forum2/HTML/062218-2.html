</FONT><HR>this is me thinking out loud.  I use declaratives a lot so read it as thoughtful not A hole.<P>Ok, when you click an item "it" casts a spell.  Not you, it.  We know this is so cause it has the same cast time no matter who is using it.  The item has it's own channeling ability etc.  This allows hybrids to cast while being hit cause the ITEM rolls channeling.<P>We know that each item is a unique data structure.  Individual recall of items by GM proves this.<P>This means that casting items have much larger data structures than non casting items.  The structure probably looks similiar to a *players* data structure with respect to spell casting.<P>Question? what does a players structure look like in regaurds to recast?<P>Theory:  recast and resets for skills and spells are NOT stored on the server.  datestamps etc for them are local.  This is eminently possible because you can't give spells or skills away.  An obvious exploit for having item recast info handled in the same way is that I can pass the item to my friend and he/she will have no info on that particular item thusly being able to instantly click it.  Anyone know the score to musical Donal's Breastplates?<P>The solution of storing recast info server side would add a load to server computers they are not willing to accept.<P>An alternate solution is to rewrite the trade screen scripts.  You can then store recast info locally, *but when you give the item to another person your computer tells their computer how much time is left on the clock*.<P>good? bad? evil?<P>-Doc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You could only do it once and nothing could be cast from that slot in the alotted time.  So you could pass it to all the clerics but when it got back to you wou could not cast it.  Probably not worht the time to do it.  That thing should be no drop anyway.<P>I wonder how this info is passed server to server as you change zones?

</FONT><HR>"Theory: recast and resets for skills and spells are NOT stored on the server."<P>It stores the data both locally and on the server.  You can have a spell icon pop up pre-maturely but when you try and cast it, no go.  Monks are actually having quite a problem with mend right now because of this.<P>"An alternate solution is to rewrite the trade screen scripts. You can then store recast info locally, *but when you give the item to another person your computer tells their computer how much time is left on the clock*."<P>Since re-use time for spells & abilities is currently stored server side (along with item charges) it'd be pretty darn simple.  Simply stick whatever recast information you're going to use wherever you're putting the info on charges.  If it's an object (or a struct or whatever) you just pass a pointer to that object to the new owner and delete the old pointer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That would also prevent you from say casting a DD with your bracer of nuking and then swapping it out for a bracer of the hidden (see invis right click).  I don't think that'd be the intent of recast times.<P>"I wonder how this info is passed server to server as you change zones? Assuming multiple servers or one server being multiple zones."<P>I'd assume that when you zone, the game saves the current character (and everything you need to know about him/her) and then gives a "heads up" to whatever zone you're heading into.  Then the other zone process can just load it from the database.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We are now making wild guesse at how it works but still, there is always a compromise and I think this is worth compromising over.  I would most certainly give up swapping out castable items for the ability to add a recast.<P>As far as Bracers, earrings and rings go(where you have 2 ears, wrists and fingers :0, and could move it to the other, et al), just leave them the way they are(long cast) and dont use the recast time.<P>It is pretty obvious that it is difficult to change but as long as the compromise doesnt make it worse(exploitable) then who cares.

</FONT><HR>And don't forget, you can't store just the tic for the recast to be avail, because what if I camp?  Or go LD?  That "tic count" expires while i'm offline...woohoo, freebee.<P>Tracking a small, finite number of things on a timer (mend, evade, etc) is easy.  It's WORSE than you say.<P>Each character has 8 general inventory slots, 8 bank slots, and 16 equipment slots if my memory serves.  You are looking at it as they only track each of those.  Nope.<P>I have the BP of uberclickyness, 10 second cast, 30 second recast.  I click it, it casts, I give it to George, now the recast is passed to him..right?  He puts it in a bag, pulls it out, gives it back...etc.  In order to do that, EACH item in the world would need a clicky timer that's persistent...that means database...not just "in memory"  Oh, but it's probably also now added in-memory too.<P>Now, there are 2000 players online.  Assume 10 slot backpacks max, that's 176 slots per online character or 352000 "timers" that have to constantly be monitored and updated against their recasts...as opposed to the 2-3 timers per character (6000).  Memory?  Not really an issue?  That's 3 MB of RAM assuming a int64 (worst case) spread out across all the servers...no biggie.  The problem lies in the server(s) constantly having to go validate/update timers on items in bags, in bank accounts, etc.<P>I click my bp, put it in a bag, in the bank.  Pull it out, give it to George who puts it in a bag, then into the bank, then pulls it out...then tries to click.  15 seconds elapsed time...but the item has a 30 second recast...so that whole time the item changed hands, the server was having to constantly "touch" it's data elements to update the countdown on the recast.<P>Recast on spells is easy because they are tied to a player, and there are at most 8 of them.  Even if all players were casters, that's 16000 spell timers to update.  Compare that to the 352000 potential item timers to update.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The server says he cant cast anything in that slot for 15 mins.  You give it to fred, he does the same.

</FONT><HR>I think placing a recast timer on each slot is the right way to go. This should only apply to the 16 equipped slots and the 8 top level inventory slots. No more activating items from inside of bags. If these timers were done as simple countdown timers stored as a single byte for each slot and decremented on every tick, you could get any recast delay you wanted from 0 to 25.5 minutes (in six second increments) with only 24 bytes of storage per character. Every tick, the timer is decremented and if the timer is 0, the item can be activated.<P>Now for the real trick to prevent exploits due to trading/swapping items. The timer has to be reset when the item is placed into the slot. This would correspond exactly to the way memorized spells work. They are not available immediately after memorizing; you must initially wait for the recast time. If you have an item with a very long recast delay, you would have to prepare for it by equipping it in advance.<P>There are still some flaws with this idea to be worked out. If the timers are only kept in server memory when the character is active, zoning or camping would necessitate resetting all timers. This could be bad for items with long recast delays, or even for shorter delays if the item must be used quickly upon zoning (Mask of Deception when zoning into a KoS area). Therefore, these timers would necessarily have to be permanently stored in the character database.<P>Ideas that require changes to the character database are usually rejected, but what if we just altered the meaning of some bit of existing character data?<P>Now for some speculation about the internals of EQ itself. There must be an ID in the character database for each of the slots to hold which item is in that slot. I would expect that that number is 32 bits (as 16 bits wouldn't allow enough items) allowing for 4 billion+ different items. Are there that many items in the game? I don't think so. Are there more than 16 million or so? Maybe, but again, I don't think so. If not, then we could change the 32 bits used to store an item ID to only use 24 bits for the item ID and use the remaining 8 bits for the slot timer. To avoid a massive database change during the patch when implemented, allow everyone to get the first use of an equipped activated item free (without waiting for the recast time). I don't think that would be overly unbalancing, and would certainly negate itself after 25.5 minutes of play anyway.<P>What do you all think of my idea?<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 48, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;sigh&gt; Programmers of the world, UNITE!  &lt;grin&gt;  Long post, sorry.<P>Here's the architecture as far as I see it:<P>DB - The DB is more then likely going to have to be, like all DBs, normalized to heck and back (unless they are looking at access times, in which case, it may be denormalized to heck and back just to get the query performance.  Caching should fix that, shouldn't it?).  <P>Handling static information is pretty easy.  Store the general item characteristics in a table and FK back to the character table (with maybe some sort of either multi-join table in between or denormalized coding for speed, not sure which).  The client datastructure need only store the key and maybe summary info about it and link back to the DB (since we query an item much less then we use it).   <P>The dynamic stuff is the key though and is stored,um, where?  Two solutions to that: either store it on the server and update the client or store it on the client and update the server.  <P>If it's stored on the client (data structure numerically limited and probably dynamically allocated from that Global file we hear so much about) then we can add whatever mechanisms are needed to calculate recast (since no-one other then the player needs to know how long until the next recast) on the client and just make a local call to figure out what to do next. This is almost certainly stored as a decremented tick count: 0 meaning you can recast (why bother with the DT overhead?).  Certainly, this is part of that global datastructure (or maybe spell datastructure.  Procs are, after all, just spells right?).  Each item has a field that contains the spell PK of its proc and the proc is handled like any other spell.  That brings me to another problem: do spells have a recast time (I play a Rogue so wouldn't know)?  If they don't, maybe they should.  *That* would be a wise architecture change methinks.<P>Now, here's where it gets interesting...if items have a spell slot and that spell slot goes to the spell datastructure (which already holds all the spell information) then the only issue is if spell recast is different from proc recast (which may be the case).  Solve that by simply adding another spell to the spell database.  Procs, most certainly, calculate spell casting in a different way (mana usage, comes to mind) so there has to be another bit of code that executes only for procs (or negates certain spell casting tests).  Good design would put the two in the same function but with different parameters (so you can reuse the code, right?).  If they have either 4th normal form or relatively well normalized data in the DB then adding or deleting "stuff" (spells, armour, equipment, characters, whatever...) should be straightforward: just add another record to the appropriate table.<P>If everything is stored on the server, then, again, we just calculate the tick count as with all spells and carry on.  The issue becomes communicating another number back with the regular update traffic.<P>No, I think there is something more going on here.<P>So far as I can see it, there are three issues preventing the changes (none of which are architectural).  <P>1)  Any changes to the global file will require all of the file to be retransmitted (poor file design, IMHO) which, at however many megs, is a pain both on the network and on the client.  Same with any code changes to the client.  <P>2)  Datastructure communication.  By that I mean that obviously the datastructure and the DB tables have to be synched up to load information.  Adding a field to the DB means adding a field to the datastructure which just brings us back to problem 1.<P>'Course, all of this assumes that Procs are spells.  If not, why not?  That would be the architectural change I'd make, lickity-split.  <P>The sticking point could be that spells don't have recast times and they are now trying to make some spells (ie// those cast from items) have additional attributes (like recast) that they didn't architect in the first place.  To change that, they have to change the datastructure (for spells to include both the total recast tick time and the current ticks left till recastable) and the DB (add the values per spell).  The more I think about it, the more I think that spells don't have a recast time and, therefor, Procs are not spells glued to items.  Hmmmm, sticky problem.  <P>Maybe make the first couple of bytes of the name actually encode binary values that correspond to the recast time and time to recast respectively?  Nice hack, but I wonder if there isn't a better way?  Anyone want to speculate on the total EQ Architecture?  &lt;grin&gt;<P>Thlinto Ratscar<BR>"Time is life's currency."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Assume you have 2 pairs of boots, one that grants strength 2 min recast, 1 that grants a damage shield or something with a 5 min recast.  Nope, you can't use both just by changing them out.  You have to wait out the recast of the first before you use the 2nd.<P>You've just changed the requirement...hence you seem to understand part of the problem even though you won't admit it.  You've just acknowledged no timers on the items...that means you can't put recast timers on item effects.  You have just suggested putting recast timers on SLOTs instead.  Uh, yeah.

</FONT><HR>Another issue would be the rebalancing of all these items.  Verant has stated many times that they are against increasing the number of spell slot that casters receive because spell selection is a tactical choice.  Now if I have an item that casts say strip enchantment with a 11 second cast I might still occasionally actually mem the spell because an eleven second spell lock is dangerous.  Now switch that to a 5 sec cast 48 sec recast and most likely I am never memming that spell again.  The same applies to almost any spell which has limited use but would be nice to have memmed on occasion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If they really wanted to the slot could have a yellow border it the item is uncastable at that moment.<P>The more I think about it, the more I think you don't really need to deal with slots per se.  Just need a regula ol list on the client and server.  Not very elegant, but hey, if it were that elegant, it would be easy to fix.<P>The server should never even have to tell the client that a cast is invalid since the client should disallow the cast in the first place.  Just a check for hacking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry had to post on this one ROFLMAO. <P>I'm a commercial developer by trade, and you are saying you want something hard coded and yet claiming to be competent. <P>One of the biggest porblems VI have had with EQ is the fact that so much is hard coded and therefore harder to change. Think for an instant of the affect it would have to change the core code rather than a server side file, that's one massive download plus server downtime vs just server downtime. Hmm, guess which one's going to keep the chimps happiest?<P>Also there's the fact that a change to one record over scanning through vast amounts of code to make a change, I know which I think is quickest.<P>While the credentials you have may be good, you would appear to lack the experience in DB implementation over wide scale systems.<P>Not trying to flame you, but you did bring a smile to an old developers face.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062218-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062218.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062218-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062218&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062218&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
