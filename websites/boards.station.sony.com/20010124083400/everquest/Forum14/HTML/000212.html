</FONT><HR>Bah, the boy likes being one of the rare classes in the game. That is definitely NOT druid.<P>Facts are plainly that Druids have alot of useful spells, so do Shamans. I'll take a smart Druid over a dumb Shaman in my group anytime and I'll also take a smart Shaman over a dumb druid. The classes are nowadays very alike in their grouping ability. The only Shaman that will tell you that Druids have better grouping spells because they can cast on the whole party at once is, and mind you this is merely an opinion, a lazy Shaman. Any Shaman worth his spit realizes that buffing is a circumstantial thing. Some classes will recieve some buffs, other classes will recieve others. Try casting your Talisman line on an int caster sometime, they don't often appreciate it because it overrides their self buffs. Does a Warrior or Ranger have much or any use for the Charisma buff you can provide? It's not likely, but the Bard in your party will appreciate it phenomenally.<P>The trick to being the best possible Shaman you can be is having a plan and a routine for every situation. Look at your spells and use your imagination on how each one of them could prove useful when the stuff hits the fan. Try to be efficient in whatever you do, it only makes you strong. And lastly, never forget that, when grouping, each minor buff you cast doesn't do a terrible lot alone, but once your Warrior has +50 str, +40 dex, +40 agi, +40 sta, +235 hp, +25 ac, and resists against whatever your opponents are casting to boot, you've got one meaty Warrior. Heh, in that instance even a Dark Elf Warrior can prove useful!<P>Have fun, enjoy your rarity, Druids only wish they had it, trust me.<P>-Dinguss Dorfeeter<BR>-50th, Morell Thule, Sinister</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One other point i would like to make which lots of people dont seem to realise or point out are shaman DEBUFF spells.<P>My shaman is lvl 22 now, and grouped for gnolls in SK (lvl 25-28 mobs). If i get off Malise (magic resistance debuff) on the first go, followed by slow and dmg/ac debuff, i can halve the damage the mob does to the tank. On average the tank takes between 1 1/2 and 3 bubs of damage against a yellow or red mob! Add our stat, hp and ac buffs and you have a class that is more group friendly than a druid and generally slightly worse at soloing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 25 Barbarian shammy and I just absolutely love her! Shammys are fun, fun, fun!<P>Know one thing: Shamans are generalists. They're quite good at everything, but the master of none (eh... with the exception of slows). You can heal a bit, tank a bit, dot a lot, DD a bit, etc. You're very versatile. Read the druid vs. shaman thread and you'll get a lot of good arguments for both druids and shamans. (PS Shaman are good BOTH in outdoor and indoor areas)<P>If you do choose a shaman, and faction is a bit of a deal, choose a barbarian. They're quite good as shamans. High innate str is a bonus. Put all you can into wisdom. Put the rest into whatever, dex, str, agi, etc. At 5 points it's not going to matter THAT much.<P>So far (up to where I've been) two turning points are level 9 and level 24. At level 9 you get Spirit of the Wolf. 'Nuff said. At level 24 you get the Regeneration/Cannibalize combo. It's awesome. You'll find your downtime is so much more reduced.<P>Lastly, please don't get sucked into class envy. Don't compare your class to every other class in the sun, and envy every ability of every other class... That'll just make you unhappy. Play your shaman. Use every spell you have yourself, find out if it's useful or not to you. Enjoy your Shaman for what he/she is: a generalist. You will never have the best dots (Necros), you will never have the best nukes (Wizards), you will never have the best heals (Clerics), you will never have the best melee (Warriors), you will never have the best pet (Necros), etc. But you know what? You can DO ALL OF THE ABOVE pretty darn well.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've got a 31 Barbarian Shammy on EMarr.  I really like my Shammy, he's a lot of fun (for some reason), but very frustrating at times.  I think I find the biggest frustration being generalization.  I know a lot of people who tell me Shaman are really cool for this or that reason, but I very rarely see groups looking for them.  I think the biggest plus to Shammy (besides being an underplayed class) is being a generalist, but on the other hand, that is my biggest source of frustration.  <P>Here's what I see as pros and cons of Shammy vs other classes (and this is probably all a re-hash for the 50th or so time, but hey  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>PROS:<BR>*Relatively low number of Shammy.<BR>  There are lots of Dr00dz out there, and not as many Shammy so you get to feel a bit less cookie-cutter.<P>*Decent armor/weapons<BR>  Shaman get to wear decent armor (chain type, or plate if you can get your hands on Totemic, go to the Plains or do the high level Kunark Dungeons).<P>*Decent weapons/melee skill<BR>  There are a number of nice Shammy only weapons (mostly spears) out there.  These weapons are really nice, if you can afford them or get into a group to get them.  You can deal out decent damage if you dare to get in melee range.  Depending on the group you are in you can get away with this.  I've noticed that this can be a bit dangerous though as critters don't like the fact that you've DoTed them or Debuffed them and no you are sticking them with your shiny spear.  Our armor might be decent, but we can't suck damage for _that_ long<P>*Alchemy:  Only Shaman get it.<P>*Spell Selection (ah, the nitty-gritty of it)<BR>  We've got a lot of spells the spread across several main areas.  <BR> Healing (about the same as druids and not that much worse than Clerics until the late 20s/early 30s).<BR> Buffs: Well, I know I get some surprised reactions when I start going to town on buffing a tank.  We can buff all stats short of Int and Wis.  We can buff HP recovery and attack speed.  We have some utility buffs (invis, vision buffs, levitate, enduring breath, SoW).<BR> Debuffs: We can attack speed debuff (best class at it).  We can resistance debuff.  We've also got an ATK and stat debuff.<BR> Damage: We have 2 decent Damage over Time spell (DoTs) lines although there are some level gaps between much needed upgrades.  We have a line of cold-based Direct Damage (DD) spells and a couple poison-based conjuration DD spells with Velious.  There are also a couple damage rain spells (poison-based).<BR> Pets:  I don't have one yet, but from what I've heard and read they can be okay, if on the pricey side for mana.  Just don't expect the performance of a necro or mage pet.<BR> Canna/Regen: Probably the best thing going for us. Keeps down time down.  This combo probably pushes us ahead of Druids as healers.  I know of a fight or two where I ran out of mana at full life and kept the party alive with the extra couple of heals I got out of canabalizing down to 1 or 2 bubbles of life.<BR> Roots: not much to say there.<P>The wide variety of spells the Shammy gets lets you fill all sorts of roles.  You can concentrate on buffing, on debuffing, on DoTing and Blasting or on Healing in any given situation.  Usually you can even cover a couple of these.<P>CONS:<BR>*Training?<BR>  Hope you like heading to your home town  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Make friends with a Wizzie or Druid because you can't train anywhere but home (maybe Trolls and Ogres can train at each other's homes, not sure as I'm a barbarian, but their homes are only 2 zones apart so that's not all that useful anyway).<P>*Generalist:<BR>  The single biggest probablem I think Shammy have is that they are so general.  There really isn't anything unique about the Shaman other than alchemy, and that of debateable use.  A well balanced group doesn't really need you, and that's where it hurts sometimes.  Groups start needing the unique abilities of other classes, and combining those in a group they cover your specialties pretty well too.  You are an adequate fill-in sometimes, but not often ideal.<P>*Spell List:<BR>  Nothing unique about it.  We have the best stat buffs, but those are of debateable worth, especially when you start getting to higher levels and most classes have started maxing out their primary stats.  At higher levels your stat buffs become overkill.  That warrior doesn't need 50 points of str, only 15 or 20 to hit 200, if that.  Besides stat buffs, there are AC buffs and HP buffs (done better by Clerics who are irreplaceable above level 30, at least or HP buffs stack).  Enchies buff attack speed better than Shammies do, and Druids get the same regens a spell level after we do and get group regen spells thrown in the mix.  Plus they get their skin line, which is like our HP and AC buffs combined.  Mages get nearly the same resistance debuffs as us and have useful blasts, pets and damage shields.  Enchanters have only slightly worse attack speed slows than we do, and are almost as needed as clerics at mid to higher levels for their clarity and mez lines.<P><BR>Over time it seems like Verant has given more of what was appealing about Shaman to other classes.  That kind of discourages me since Verant supposedly wants each class to have 'uniqueness'.  Shammies are the spellcaster equivilent to the melee classes' bard in a way.  Okay at a lot of stuff but having nothing unique to itself.  I'm curious as to where Verant plans to go in the long run with the Shaman or if they are sort of being phased out in a way, by having there abilities spread amongst the other classes.  I certainly hope not, as I love being a shammy, but I'd really like to see something to encourage the class to continue to grow.  I think a lot of Shammys are discouraged by the course Verant seems to take with us.  Absor has a decent list of Shammy concerns that the staff will be looking at over at Verant so hopefully something good will come out of it.<P>Hope this is helpful and at least partly objective, although I do have some bias being a Shammy myself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Graelon McMarrin, Shaman of 31 season.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I certainly didn't mean to say that shaman weren't useful, what I wanted to point out was that in a number of situations another class will be able to cover your role well (sometimes better, sometimes a little worse) and offer something else, often times unique.  This puts the Shaman in a difficult position if well-composed groups are around.  If you are a flexible Shammy, then you can fill in or be 'secondary' for a role or let someone else be secondary (i.e. Enchanters debuffing) so they can concentrate on something else.<P>SO, that said, Besides pointing out the specifics in my previous post, Shammy are cool because there aren't to many of them, and who doesn't like being taller than almost everyone else.  They also have a decently wide range of spells.  You just need to understand going into it that there is almost always someone out there who can do what you do, and often times better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Will there be someone who can fill that extra spot better than a nuker?  You bet.  Let's say you need a nuker.  You get a wizzie, he drops a nice DD on the mob and suddenly it's crawling all over him.  A properly equipped Shaman will be able to take the quad-hitting for a few rounds without soaking up half the clerics mana.  And you think slowing isn't important?  Fewer attacks = less damage = less healing needed = more mana all around.  Sure, one could argue that an Enchanter could slow the mobs, but why settle for a less powerful slow spell *and* make the Enchanter use mana that might be spent hasting the tanks or mezzing mobs (besides, next to CHeal, Slow and Mez combined is one of the greatest ways to get something's attention).  So while a Shaman might not add anything *unique* to a well-rounded party, they *can* make that well-rounded party function better than they could alone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000212&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000212&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
