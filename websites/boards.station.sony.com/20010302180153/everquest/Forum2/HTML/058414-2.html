</FONT><HR>Stating that increasing ranger's defense and offense will make them more desirable than a warrior in any group shows an incomplete understanding of how a ranger is different than a warrior.  Several things make warriors the most desirable damage takers in any post-50 group, regardless of Defense.<BR> <BR>Armor AC: Ranger's Kunark drop armor is 6-11ac less per piece than warriors.<BR>Item     Tolan's -- Cobalt<BR>Helm        18        25<BR>Gauntlets   14        25<BR>Boots       18        25<BR>Breastplate 35        45<BR>Vambraces   18        25<BR>Bracers     14        20<BR>Greaves     24        35<P>Totals:     141       190<P>A difference of 49 raw AC, or approximately 76 actual AC.  Right-click pells designed to be used during don't really come into balance discussions for melee characters because of long cast times, though I would argue giving pure melee characters spells somewhat degrades hybrid casting abilities.  Invis on warrior greaves, shrink on bracer, are useful and somewhat needed, but contribute far more to a warrior than getting mana-free versions of spells we already have does for a hybrid.<BR>Obviously this armor set will not be available to most The same differences are apparent in lower level armor, though to a lesser degree.<P>Hitpoints: A level 60 Ranger can expect to have under 2k hp naked.  A level 60 Ogre warrior can expect to have just under 3k hp naked.  This disparity is what makes a CH on a warrior vastly more efficient than a CH on a ranger.  Other hybrids have more HP than rangers, and I've seen casters with higher self-buffed HP (and yes, my ranger focuses on HP gear).  Hybrids gave up something to get spells: for Paladins and SK, it was the DW ability.  For Rangers, it was plate armor.  Now in addition to those things, we have:<BR>Lower offense: pal/sk<BR>Lower defense: ranger<BR>Lower hitpoints: all three<BR>Lower armor AC: Pal/SK (also ranger, but we should have this penalty)<BR>Which makes hybrids, overall, worse at both taking and dealing damage.<P>Not that all this really bothers me...I've retired my ranger and started an Iksar monk, who has more AC naked at 35 (569, I think) than my ranger did at 52 (550 exactly...I die enough to know that number by heart =[).<P>Hybrids in general need major changes to be desireable in the post-50 world.  The versatility they provide is great for a player who never intends to play the very high level game, but in the end-game specialization (warrior, rogue, cleric, enchanter, wizard, monk), not versatility (shaman, druid, hybrids, magician [though CoH (summoned booze...er, nm =p) makes them very desireable]), is what makes things happen.<P>sorry for the length, but I think I've made it worth reading.<P>Treesoul<BR>52 Pathfinder - Retired<BR>Rucus<BR>35 Monkey</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor noooo, i believe THE reason we are picked for groups is because we can do a fair amount of damage..the reason this is sought after in groups is so people can get Exp in a shorter amount of time..like continuous pulling. The theory of just because we can do tons of damage doesn't mean we necessarily should is a reach, and not a very good one. No way would we be desirable in a group if we Rangers chose to sit down until the mob was at half, that would take forever to get exp for my groupmates..better off just having a group of 5, it would take the same amount of time to disperse of the mobs.=\ Sorry but better dodge/parry..or some sort of evade that is slow reuse like my level 1 sense heading was *snicker* that thing took like 3 min to recharge, by then at lvl 1 I was lost again <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Deam</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*sighs* Most have said it already, and better than I, but I'm going to add my voice.<P>We don't do massive damage. At any level really. We may SOMETIMES outdamage a warrior. We NEVER come CLOSE to the damage of monks or rogues. But we are still constantly shooting up the hatelist...why?<P>Because of the way taunt works. Low damage low delay weapons = One heck of a lot more taunt than High damage = High delay weapons. This has never seemed right to me.<P> I mean, in the middle of a furious battle, a rogue sneaks up and drives his dagger into the monster's back. The monster is massively pissed off. <P>In the middle of a furious battle, a wizard chants a spell, causing a huge wave of destructive magic to strike the monster. The monster is massively pissed off.<P>In the middle of a furious battle, a ranger steps up to fight, misses a few times, lands a few swift hits that do less damage than the mighty warrior hacking away with his hefty blade. The monster is massively pissed off, forgets the rogue and wizard and crushes the ranger to a little green pulp.<P>Don't you see the problem with that scenario? Where's the sudden and instant damage? Why do all mobs seem to have a built in instinct to instantly mush any ranger they see? Why, when a groupmember pulls does the mob turn on me the moment I hit auto attack? I don't even have to HIT a mob to get its attention. Our damage output builds steadily, unlike rogues and wizards who tend to let it out in one big, single blast. Which means I have to be in there fighting for at least the majority of the battle to be of any use. But because of the way taunt is set up, rangers can't do this without being a serious drain on the cleric's mana. <P>Maybe I'm being selfish, but I don't WANT to have to switch to some heavy two hander and back out for half the fight. I gave up hitpoints, and AC for duel wield, for crying out loud, I want to USE it! Something is wrong when a warrior using a high damage weapon, triple attack, kick, and non-stop smashing of the taunt key, CANNOT out-taunt a duel wielding ranger. <P>We aren't asking to be elite, we aren't asking to do the most damage and never get hit, we are BEGGING for mere group and class survival. Rangers have NOTHING that another class doesn't have, they bring NOTHING to the group that another class can't do, and can't do better.<P>Track-- druids and bards<P>snare-- druids, wizards, necros, sk's..<P>sow -- druids, shaman<P>damage-- Warriors, rogues, monks...if we have to back off, Pally's, sk's..<P>spell damage-- wizards, clerics, enchanters, magicians, necros...etc. etc.<P>Defense-- Warriors, pally's, sk's, rogues, monks, bards, and most if not all caster classes.<P>archery-- don't make me laugh, same skill as a warrior, crits sometimes and double damage on an unmoving, un-snared or rooted mob post 50 is only good for pulling, is expensive, and as Verant has stated will NEVER be a primary form of combat. Don't get me started on Trueshot please..<P>SO, based on pure skills alone, a ranger would only be chosen for a group if there were no (insert all melee classes plus most caster classes here) around. Why is this NOT a problem????<P> Of course there is utility, but utility and versatility only get one so far. In the high end game, our limits get rangers killed, and in uber mob encounters, they get rangers not invited.<P>SOMETHING needs to be done guys. This is your last chance to get it right, before a lot of rangers leave in disgust for your competitors.<P>No bones, no excuses, do it and do it RIGHT.

</FONT><HR>It seems to me the problem with rangers isn't our defence or how many hits we can take, it's how much we piss mobs off.  Several of the other classes have ways to shed that aggro but we don't.  Instead of making a potentially unbalancing change to rangers could we instead see an increase in the ability of warriors pallies and SK to taunt?<P>-Pyween Darkwood (Ranger)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Directly from Darkwen's post which Absor agreed with:<BR>"the massive offense that a ranger has"<P>Huh?  What massive offence?  Even if we had the exact same offence, and weapon skills, we WILL NOT match warriors melee output.  If you add in spells we might be able to outdamage a warrior, but these are "special" situations, not the norm.  Warriors get Critical hits with Melee, Crippling blows, incredible damage dealing disciplines, and better weapons (for the most part).  When we stop to cast a spell to add extra damage we are taking away melee swings, and arguably could be doing LESS damage over this time than if we meleed (especially with resists, fizzles, and partial damage).<P>Where's the "massive offence"?  At best we will do roughly the same damage as a warrior, bring a little utility to a group (unless of course we are indoors), and no where near the defence/hp/tanking ability.  There will ALWAYS be places in groups for warriors.  All that we ask is to be able to fill one of the secondary slots and feel like we are bringing value to the group.  If we get agroed and are forced out of melee, we can't fulfill our role as a damage dealer.  While Jolt is a good solution to this it doesn't ALWAYS work.  <P>The sad reality is that Rangers are the ONLY toe to toe class with Caster defence, and has the lowest AC of ALL toe to toe classes.  This makes us look like a CASTER in melee, making the target pay us undue attention.  A 230 defence would result in about 70ac, and should at least make us not look like casters to the mobs.  A few more hp (say 400 at end game) would let us live that split second longer for the cleric to get off that heal.<P>IF a ranger had Triple attack, warrior parry, reposte, dodge, and hp, a warrior would STILL be better in melee because their available armor and equipment is better.  No ranger is asking for that, we just want to be viable enough for a group to have to think for a split second before they decide between adding a second warrior versus a ranger.  Do we need a little utility (snare/sow/buffs) or do we need a second damage taker?  Depends on the situation.  <P>A ranger will NEVER replace a warrior in the #1 melee slot (tank), all we're asking is the ability to compete for the second spot instead of a second warrior being preferable in most every case.<P>-Mirk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>what really bothers me is Absor responding to posts that agree with him, but give no mention to the posts that argue valid points.  If you waiting until the posts are winding down Absor, I appologize.<P>I am fast leveling to 50, where I will retire my Ranger for a Monk or Cleric.<P>Rangers(pre Kunark) were an awesome class, now they seem to be the worst possible class to be.  I have trouble finding a group becuase no cleric likes dumping it's mana on a Ranger in combat.  Expecially when A warrior can take twice the damage with a much greater dmg output than we can.<P>Increase our defense/dodge/parry.  To be equal to, or darn close to a warrior.  We have WAY less hp, wear lighter armor, and are more agile.  It should make sense that we can out dodge a warrior.<P>I can do enough damage now, and do not mind leaving offensive skills where they are in order to obtain defensive skills.  Anyone who says rangers should be able to dmg like a warrior are light in the melon, if you ask me.  More Dmg output means more Taunt. Cleric's would refuse to group with Rangers becuase all they would do is cast Cheal, and RES the dead Ranger.<P>A defensive cap upgrade is a reasonable solution, and can be taken care of in one patch.  This Defensive cap upgrade would quiet Rangers down a little, and would put us inline with Rogues/SK's/Pally's as the filler/secondary Tank in a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok my 2cp worth.<P>About a month ago I posted on this board what is wrong with RANGERs, because i wanted to start one.  I got back 10 different replies that there is nothing wrong with them minus archery, and ofcourse they get hit alot.  I'll make the comparison to 2nd Ed. AD&D. A ranger with a 18dex, and in elven chain would have an AC of 2, and the ranger could not get any better than that, but a warrior could go up to PLATEMAIL, with dex of 18 would have an AC of -4 or better, -5 with a shield.   In EQ terms that (scale of 1 to 1000) Ranger would be about a 500 ac and a warrior would be 750 or better.  This game is kinda based on those priciples.  In every game system RANGERS (under the context used in EQ) use light armor and are light on the feet.  They are ALWAY EASIER TO HIT.  But they we're the only class to be able to DUAL-Wield weapons without a penitaly.  Rangers do out damage people I read those threads, a lot of people said that the ranger defense should be higher because they out damaged everyone putting them on the top of the agro list.  Why is it now some of the same people say they do not do as much damage as a warrior, or a rough.  Most of the rouges damage comes from backstabbing, as it did in AD&D.  <P>I really don't understand why people are complaining so much. The HP issue is on the list to be addressed, that archery and one more thing are the only things I saw really being asked for, DODGE, Archery is on the list but Perry or dodge is not.  Personal opinion is that DODGE should be higher the warriors and paladins, almost as high as a rouges (if not the same), because they do not wear the heavy armor.  <P>Otherwise I am very happy with the Ranger info.  There has to be a balance somewhere and Absor is correct.  The problem is that most people want super characters and that just isnt' going to happen.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know why I like a ranger in my group?  Because they track and snare and heal and tank and can even blast things.  That's why I like one.<P>After level 50, name me a class that doesn't have problems.  This game is broken past 50, because Verant INSISTS on the monsters scaling up at exponential power while the characters go up gradually.  In real, relative terms of power, you are weaker the higher level you get.<P>That increase of raw power requires groups to specialize just to hope for success, and to have multiple groups to do this as the encounters progress.<P>And many classes just get left out in the cold.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mr. VanCouvering: open mouth, insert foot.<P>Rangers deal less melee damage than Warriors.  Warriors have a better damage table, better skills, critical hits with melee weapons, crippling blows, and access to equal or better weapons.<P>Monks and Rouges are on a completely different level as far as melee damage goes.  As for Wizards, just don't go there.<P>I can match a Warrior if I burn hard.  That only lasts as long as the mana holds out, which is one mob -- and I'm playing a Human Ranger, not a Half-Elf, with a fighting WIS of 105.  It's also only true now that hybrids don't lose weapon delay time by casting (and because I use slow weapons to reduce taunt -- Wurmslayer/Crystallized Sword.  Downside is that I can't taunt to save someone else's life.)  Keep in mind also that Rangers don't get to sit down and meditate, so once I run out of mana, that's pretty much it for the night.<P>There is simply no justification for the attitude expressed towards Rangers.  We are not "dealing tons of damage".  (Pasketti's log analyzer says I do 1200 damage per minute, which seems high; Copeland's weapon analyzer puts me at a more reasonable 970).  We are outdamaged by both offensive fighters (Rogues and Monks), one of the defensive fighters (Warriors), and two CASTING classes (Magician and Necromancer pets summoned by equivalent-level casters can outdamage a Ranger in melee, easily.)  Then we get worse defensive ability than every fighter class named above and second-rate methods for managing mob aggression.<P>Our spells do not compensate for this.  Our spells are no more useful to our groups than the secondary abilities of Rogues (scouting, corpse recovery, access to locked or trapped areas) or Monks (scouting, corpse recovery, pulling).  Typically our spells are of no use whatsoever to a group; Snares are overwritten by other PCs' spells and equal or better buffs are available from the other casters.  It does not even make sense to, for instance, have the Ranger SoW the party instead of a Shaman or Druid; the caster can do it for less mana (no hybrid mana tax) and can meditate to recover it (fighters don't get to sit out the next pull).<P>"Rangers are complex"...no, they're not.  The problem is actually very simple.  We have the same issues Rogues used to have; we need the same solution the Rogues got.  We need defensive skills similar to theirs and we need aggression management similar to theirs.  This is not rocket science, so I can only assume that Verant is making a mountain out of this particular molehill for reasons of internal politics.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think offensively Rangers are about right.  Defense though is a BIG problem.  You seem to think that adjusting offense is what we need for class balance.......Youre wrong!  I say leave offensive skills where they are and up our defensive skills.  I can already here you say "Then we make warriors less wanted/ useful."  I say BULL.  Warriors get alot more hit points.  Warriors get much higher AC items.  Warriors get stunned less.  Warriors have crippling blows and critical hits.  Even if you DO give us warrior defensive skills their HP and armor will still make them a better tank.  Giving us more offense is just going to make us mana sponges even worse.  Youve been on a big "group" kick lately but do you REALLY think giving rangers more offense is beneficial to the group?........NO!<P>TIME TO REMOVE YOUR HEADS FROM YOUR ARSES VERANT.<P>Logic should have told you these things a long time ago!!!!<P>Kalyn 37 Ranger<BR>Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor said:<BR>And you want to be complaining about me not understanding rangers (even though I think you're wrong), not Abashi. Sheesh, I've been at this since October, and still people get us mixed up. <BR>(end)<P>I did read through your post before writing this.  From what I gathered from your response you don't understand and the original question/statement about you (not abashi) is correct.  You obviously do not understand the major areas of the game nor the issues of the ranger.<P>Absor said:<BR>Rangers are complicated. Give them enough offensive power and not enough defense, and they die a lot. Up their defense and they start to be more valuable in any group than a warrior. Neither solution works. Therefore, Jolt.<BR>(end)<P>This is not a true statement.  We can see it isn't true with just a small amount of analysis.  The first thing we need to look at are the other classes besides the ranger that have dual wield and double attack.  You would also have to weight those more against the utility of the warrior because they also have special attacks that the ranger doesn't get.<P>The monk and the rogue both have a very high defensive ability.  Their defense is right up there with the warrior.  In many cases the monk and the rogue have better offensive abilities then the warrior.  Is the warrior complaining that their abilities infringe on them?  Even if they were, what would it matter to have the ranger come close to the abilities of the warrior/rogue/monk in the area of defense?  If anything it is their offense that is in question tied directly to their defense.<P>Besides, the rangers have a lower AC and natural HP.  Even buffed with a lot of +HP equipment they still don't come close to the warrior.<P>In the rogue's case and in the monks case you not only give them extremely good defense you also give them incredible offense.  Both of these classes outdamage the warrior hands down.  In the case of the rogue they are very good at out-damaging the warrior.<P>The monk also has the ability to heal (via mend) and the ability to FD to get out of trouble.<P>The rogue doesn't have the heal ability nor the FD but they have the evade skill.  Neither the rogue nor the monk are plate wearing classes.  They may be limited in their weapon selection, but there is no question that the weapons and skills they have directly compete and are almost better in regards to survivability and damage output.<P>Jolt isn't the answer and it never was.  If you'd read the posts by the plethora of rangers posting in the class balance speeches and you would see that most agree that jolt doesn't solve the problem.<P>They state many things about it but the three worst issues are as follows:<P>1)  The spell level is too high.  Yes, I saw that it had been move to 51.  But this goes hand in hand with the cost of the mana.<P>2)  The cost in terms of mana is too high.  It has to be cast over and over during the fights so the ranger winds up using their mana to recast due to resists and the fact that it doesn't keep you down long enough to work properly.  As well, the rangers, and all hybrids, have a very limited mana pool.  This is due to the limited +wis modifiers and base wis for many of the classes (int for the SK).  As well, the hybrid is constantly in battle.  This leaves very little time to med.  In addition to this they have a lower med cap so it takes them longer to med even when they med.  Additionally the hybrids have a problem due to the mana casting penalty.  Each spell cast costs them 30% more then it costs their parent class.<P>Due to the fact that jolt costs so much and is resisted so much, and the fact that it has to be cast over and over, many rangers use their mana up casting it and can't use their spells for the other things, such as double damage.<P>3) The ranger looses offensive ability when they cast this spell due to the fact that they have cast and recast.  This means that their potential offensive damage is diminished even below the worst melee damage dealer, especially when it is resisted.  <P>Why should the ranger have to manage their weaknesses in this manner and have to focus their play style on managing the agro and due to their inherent weaknesses when the other classes do not have to do the same thing.  Not even the wizard has to do this.<P>In fact, the wizard, can cast Ice Comet 6 times (if they have enough mana) and never have the mob agro on them.  Even against the dasterdly most in fear/hate/and the lower area of old sebilis they can do this.  It is even possible to chain cast the rain spells, dd, root and snare and not have the mobs agro on the wizard if they do it correctly.  They are not having to manage their agro.<P>The ranger on the other had has very few options and this is because they are a front line arms lenght melee class.<P>What we really have are a series of buggy routines for determining who to hate.  The mobs are focusing on the number of attempted hits, AC, HP and class to determine which class to attack instead of focusing on who is doing how much damage.  As a result of this we have to constantly tell the mobs that they are wrong by using spells and skills to alter our positions in their hate list.<P>It is well known that the hatelist is updated on each and every swing.  This doesn't mean that the damage has to be of any consequence to the mob.  They may even be all misses, but if you swing fast enough the mobs hate list is updated to move you up.<P>The rogue community and the monk community all stated unequivocally with concrete examples that this is exactly what was happening.<P>Tell me this, because this is the case, how is it that the ranger can control that.  What is it that the ranger did to unleash their firehose of offensive power.<P>I've move into a fight after it had been going all along and the mob turned on me after only a couple of hits.  I've even swung and missed all times and had the mob turn on me and wouldn't relent.<P>Others have tested, time and again, with slow weapons (with dual wield) and the mobs still turned on them even though they didn't swing fast and they did virtually 0 damage.<P>It absolutely is not the case of the ranger class having to manage their offensive output.<P>The offensive output of the ranger just isn't high enough.<P>The warrior always has the offensive edge against the ranger.  They do more damage then the ranger.  If the hate list operated solely on damage output, as you are stating, then the mob would constantly be focused on the warrior, monk and rogue.  The monk and rogue could get out of the way with FD and evade.  The warrior would then become the focus.  But this is not the case.  The ranger is the one taking the hits and the mobs are unrelenting.<P>Absor said:<BR>But if Jolt is too good, then the low defense of a ranger is no longer a drawback, and they again become overpowered...<BR>(end)<P>The ranger isn't overpowered.  Compare the ranger to the other hybrids and the other melee classes and you can see there's a problem with your statment.  I really dislike the fact that you made a generalized statement without any supporting evidence.  The ranger class talks were rife with examples of why the ranger is at a disadvantage across the board.<P>If I were to judge any class as overpowered it would be the rogue.  If I were to judge another class, and it being a hybrid, I would say the SK.  Next in line I'd say it was the paladin.<P>The rogue because they do so much damage so fast and they have a great way out of trouble.  In addition they have such a high offense, dual wield, and defense.  They also have poisins and are required to unlock doors.  They have sneak which makes them invis to almost everything.  Their armor is great, and their epic is easy to get.<P>The SK due to the fact that they have the level 44 necro pet and the armor/ac/hp/defense/offense/weapons, etc make them a force to be reconed with.<P>The paladin because of their enormous AC/HP/Defense and even offense due to great weapons and the fact that they have the ability to buff themselves and any party member for an additional 995 HP and can increase the AC dramatically.  In addition to this they get the 90% experience rez.  No matter what happens they get 90% back.<P>One thing to note is that with this imbalance issue the ranger class is constantly having to manage their weaknesses while all the other offensive classes can manage their strengths.<P>Absor said:<BR>It's very complicated. But I suspect that I understand it as much as almost anyone.<BR>(end)<P>I disagree.  From what I wrote about what you've said so far, you don't understand it.<P>Absor said:<BR>What you need to understand is that just because you have great offensive power does not mean that you can just use it as if it was a fire hose. <BR>(end)<P>First, we don't have that great an offense.  Yes, we have some nice weapons, but you have to be in a pretty powerful guild to get them.  Aside from that we are the 4th best damage dealer for the melee classes or 3rd worst, if you wish to look at it that way.  We are further down in damage dealing then we are further up.  If you include the bard then we are right dead in the middle.  But if you look at it we are only this good due to a couple of factors.<P>The first factor is that these other classes that are behind us is simply based on the stat called offense.  Yes, this is higher.  And yes, we have a higher 1hs and 2hs and 1hb and 2hb.  But it is only marginally better.  This is the case because we can really only use one of these at a time.  Sure we could do 1hs and 1hb but one of those would be in the off hand and thus would suffer from the lack of bonuses from min damage and from str bonuses.<P>So, in essence, the offense skill and the 1hs skill really only gives us marginally better ability at offense.  The dual wield is still lower then the warrior, monk, and rogue.<P>With a good 2hs weapon a paladin and SK could easily come close to our damage.  Give the SK a level 44 necro pet and they will dwarf any comparably leveled ranger in their damage output.  I know this because I have a level 56 necro and I know exactly what that level 44 necro pet can do.<P>We've already discussed archery and spell casting.  Archery just isn't it.  It never will be.  Casting isn't viable as long as we have to constantly manage our weaknesses.<P>Again, the ranger class should not have a problem dealing their damage any more then the rogue, monk or warrior deals theirs.  Do you understand this?  If they can blast like a firehose then so should the ranger.  If the ranger should not be able to use their offense, which they gave up their Plate armor to get, then neither should the rogue, warior, nor monk.<P>Just from this you can see that what you said is utterly and completely false.<P>Absor said:<BR>Rangers need to learn the lessons that Rogues and Wizards learn early in their careers. Just because you CAN do a ton of damage, doesn't mean you should.<BR>(end)<P>This is completely untrue.  I have a 55 wizard and I have had to deal with issues of agro for the longest time.  The issues of agro are completely different for the wizard.  The wizard has much higher damage and much lower agro on their spells.  This is well known.<P>As well, the wizard is not a front line arms length melee class.  It is completely inappropriate for you to compare a behind the lines caster to a front line arms length melee class.<P>The comparison to the rogue in this situation is also a problem.  The reason is that the rogue has significantly higher defense and a signficantly higher offense.  In addition to this they have the evade skill.<P>There are no lessons that needs to be learned by the ranger.  You just are so predjudicial in your comments it shows through like a bra under a lace blouse.<P>The whole community of rangers have spoken in the class talks explaining the issues and giving you concrete examples.  You have chosen to pick and choose which ones you wanted to let the team hear about.  That is wrong.  You continue to use unsupported generalizations to sidestep the real issues.<P>Upon examination of the ranger's defense and HP it is obvious that it is unacceptable to have a class with the defense of a caster and the self-buffed HP of a caster while requiring them to be on the front lines as an arms lenght melee class.<P>Removal of them from the front lines denies their ability to be the offensive damage dealer that they could be and that negates the reason why they gave up plate to get dual wield.<P>Jolt doesn't solve the problem and is a stop-gap measure.  Over the past 9 months rangers have been telling you that.  The whole community voice their concerns from day one that the jolt spell isn't the solution.<P>Even with jolt the mobs still bang hard on the ranger to the point of draining the mana of the cleric.  If and when the jolt spell works it then becomes the "go attack the enchanter" spell.<P>We've told you time and again when it first came out that the spell needed to be 1 second, that it needed to be available at an earlier time in the ranger's career and that it cost too much mana.  Over the past 9 months we have proven it to you time and again.<P>It really disappoints me that you try to come in here and say you are all wise and all knowing and that the ranger community at large doesn't know how to play their char.  I think you've been speaking too much with Abashi because that was his attitude.  If you had been following the ranger talks and truly examined the facts you would not have come up with that conclusion.<P>It is someone's retributive nature that is keeping the ranger class down.<P>You have given us skills that don't work, you have given us skills that are broken, you have put us in a position where the ranger has no effective use in the post 50 guild events.  You have made it so that we take a back seat in the epic encounters.  We can't participate in dragon raids, etc.<P>This is unfair that you won't take the time to really examine the issues of the ranger.  I can understand why some of the ranger talks didn't hit home.  They were excessively repetitive.  You also had all the other classes to examine and summarize.  If you were to take the challenge of examining the ranger class in the post 50 area on your own, by actually taking a few of your nights and really examining them, really looking at what we are saying you would have no choice but to do that.<P>As it stands it is completely obvious that you have not done this.<P>Prior to the changes on test the ranger's offense in most areas is 240, including dual wield and double attack.  The proposed changes to the offense of the Paladin and SK put them within 10 points of our offense.<P>That 10 points is rather insignificant.  And, with the fact that the off-hand of the dual wielder doesn't benefit from any type of damage bonus we an see that the ranger just doesn't meet the offensive powerhouse that is letting loose with the firehose.<P>Man, I am a bit upset that you didn't even take the time to examine the other classes before you made this statement.  You didn't bother looking at all areas of the complaints in the ranger threads.<P>This is really disappointing to me.  I hope someday we can get someone inside Verant that will fully take the time to understand the class issues.  It has become apparent that you nor anyone else really is taking the time to do this.<P>The unfortunate thing behind your post is that you don't seem to understand that there are many players out there that have the playing experience well beyond your own.  I personally have 5 level 50+ characters, and only one of those is a ranger.  My experience with a warrior, necro, and wizard show me that you are not applying the correct concepts to your conclusions.  You aren't following the flow of what is happening in melee.<P>My experience in RL has told me that you are a person that doesn't listen well.  I've managed 60 people and know what it means to have to listen.  More times then not when you have the majority of the people telling you one thing those people are right.  It is only common sense.<P>Even given your inside info to technical data I fail to see how you would be able to fully grasp the concepts that those technical data apply to.  Had you been playing those characters that you are speaking about and applied that technical knowledge then we would have a different situation.  But it is obvious that you don't.<P>The jury is in.  The ideas and concepts you have alluded to have been judge by the ranger community to be incorrect.<P>The ranger class is straight forward, not complex.  The range class has serious balance issues.  The jolt spell is not the correct way to solve the problem with the hate list bugs.  The fact that the ranger community as a melee class has to deal constantly with managing their weaknesses while the other classes get to have fun and manage their strengths is a major telling factor.<P>The fact that the monk and rogue directly compete with the warrior on defense and offense and yet the warrior doesn't feel infringed upon is also a telling factor that directly disproves  your position that the warriors would have no place in the game (or take a lessening role).  The fact that the SK and Paladin will be within 10 points of the the ranger's current offense, at the time of the upgrades indicates that there are other classes that will compete on a damage dealing level just like the ranger.  The fact that these other classes have nearly the same HP and AC as the warrior and yet they still get major offensive capabilities (in the case of the SK) and defensive capabilities (in the case of the Paladin) should tell you that they are the ones that will be worrying the warrior.  <P>You can't give a dual wielding double attacking max hitting 19 delay pet to a class that is within 10 points of the rangers post kunark offensive level and not say that they aren't going to be an offensive force to deal with.  If you even consider that the SK has a double attack on a 2hs weapon, along with their DW and DD pet you must conclude they have nearly a better offense then the warrior.<P>With the paladin's ability to do massive HP buffs along with a 90% rez and they have superior heal with some very nice AC buffs you must conclude that they too are a force to be reconed with due simply to the fact that they will be able to last longer in a fight.  We have a level 59 Paladin in our guild that has done 185 crit against CT in fear.  This same paladin had over 5000 hp when I looked at the snapshot. <P>Just consider that this class can stand in there and take hit after hit after hit and keep swinging their weapon, then step back and cast superior heal, then rejoin the battle should tell you that this adds to their offensive capability.<P>But if the ranger has to step out of the fight and control their constant agro due to hate list bugs and poorly implemented bandaids (jolt) then you can see that they are not able to sustain their damage output.  As long as jolt is a spell rangers will not be using their DD to cast on the mobs.  As well, the ranger mana pool just isn't good enough to be able to allow them to use both jolt and the other spells.<P>There was alot of debate as to why the warrior had to take a back seat to the necro and mage pets.  Even a slight glance at the level 44 necro pet should tell you that they were complaining even out it.  It has a dual wield (without arming it) and double attack and when buffed can be a 19 delay weapon that as long as it is controlled properly can continue to do damage adding up to far beyond the amount of mana it cost to cast that pet.<P>You see, you are choosing what to look at and what not to look at.  You aren't seeing the forest through the trees.  There has to be a reason for it and I just can't figure it out.<P>It has nothing to do with the ranger letting loose like a firehose.  That just isn't viable due to the fact that the off hand doesn't recieve the bonuses and the fact that the monk and rogue should be in the same situation as the ranger, only they never can be due to the fact that they have such a high defense.  They also have higher AC and higher HP then the ranger class along with special attacks and disciplines.<P>I'm sorry this has been so long, but I wanted to show that Absor was not paying attention.  You can't say one thing about a class without looking at the other classes that should be similar.  In this case all we had to do was look at the melee classes.  But because he compared the ranger problems to the wizard problems I had to make comments refuting that as well.  It is unfortunate that you actually think the wizard has an agro problem and that they are standing next to the mob when they are casting and that they are casting full force.  Even then, if they do it at the right time they can let loose.<P>Metaphisto Stargazer, 54 Ranger<BR>Caution, 55 Wizard<BR>Thryll Seekyr, 56 Necro<BR>Loga Rhythmic, 50 Bard<BR>Rhose Bhud, 50 Warrior<BR>Innoruuk<P>--all on the same account, BTW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Post level 50 discussions are so cumbersome!  First of all I play a ranger because it's fun, and believe it or not it still is.  I wish I could find a group, but contrary to popular opinion it is possible to solo a ranger for experience above level 50, and this is the only thing that keeps the game from becoming nothing but a frustrating, never ending search for a group willing to accept a ranger.  (I'm also blessed with a great guild.)<P>First I would like to add that damage output can be pretty high, though not as high as some other classes.  I noticed I do much, much more damage with an increased dexterity, as a matter of fact I hit three times out of four 90% of the time with my dexterity items maxed out (of course the level of the mob is a big determining factor).  Of course, I would be an idiot to do this in a group, and have to switch out my dex items for stamina items.<P>Second this is a no-brainer as someone has already mentioned.  Rangers already have a severe hit point penalty, and the best AC items don't even begin to compare with warrior AC items.  Hello?!  Isn't this penalty enough?  Take the stupid defense cap off, it isn't going to make rangers a super class by any stretch of the imagination, and will in no way make the warrior obsolete.<P>Third the balance issue for rangers as far as groups are concerned can never be resolved by looking at a ranger's casting.  Please!  In a good group, why would I want to cast a spell?  I can see the occasional snare if it hasn't been casted already, but aside from that what caster at my level wouldn't have better.  Spells are simply a luxury for soloing, nothing more.  The casting time is a waste of time.<P>Fourth, I am very happy that Verant is making an effort to increase the group friendly asspect of the ranger by making possitive changes, or at least considering possitive changes, instead of the usual nerfing that Verant seems to have been addicted to in the past.  I'm still frightened that Verant's answer to the agro problem will be to nerf offense.  Please don't do that!!  At least us rangers don't have to put up with the constant nerfing that druids have to put up with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, the difference between a Rogue and a Wizard learning when to do massive damage and when not to and a Ranger learning it is that a Ranger is already (and will continue to be) about the 4th ranked damage dealer in the game.  We have a lower ranked damage table than warriors, no triple attack, critical hits only on bows, and no crippling blows.<P>As a result of this, unlike the other two classes you mentioned, if we have to pull out of melee because we're hitting too much agro this drops our damage ranking like a stone.  Wizards and Rogues can generally hold off and still do the most damage to a mob.  A Ranger must fight the entire combat to hold his own vs. a warrior, though, and prove his worth to the group/raiding party.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I still think they are ignoring a rather basic disparity in the offense/defense issue.  Rangers have received no upgrades since Kunark was relesed, and are basically lvl 40 in defense.  Even casters like druids and shaman got upgrades.  When Alan says that we have Jolt, that's was something introduced WAY AFTER Kunark came out, and I think was a small bandage applied to a sucking chest wound.  Verant has stubbornly refused to admit they made a mistake in regards to ranger defensive issues.<P>It's not like we want 252 in defense and other "defensive" type skills, just a bit of parity.  If the knight classes get upgraded to 235 in offense and 252 in defense, they WHY, OH WHY, can't rangers have a 235 defense in conjunction with a 252 offense?  I understand managing the hate list, but with the current 6 person group limitation we sometimes have NO CHOICE but to do our full damage potential.  That's like telling a pro-athelete to igonore his physical skills and do basketweaving instead because he was making too much money.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif">  <P>We are not asking to get defensive skills equal to warriors.  If we have to pay for our offensive skills with lower hit points AND lower AC AND lower defense AND lower dodge AND lower parry AND lower riposte, it just seems like we have to deal with a lot of ANDS!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  Just let us get a bit of parity with our role.  Give us all the offense you want, but let us have some skills and abilitites to offset that.<P>Also, DON'T NERF Rouges.  They are VERY WELL Balanced now, nerfing Evade will make them as mad as rangers!<P>So, what does Verant have against Rangers and Rouges?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i have recently  quit playing my ranger because i have come to the conclusion they just suck now, and until something is done. i'm letting him sit there. my ranger is level 53 with 1025self buffed attack, 174str, 145agi, 120 dex, 107 wis and at least average armor/ac and with full hp/mana i could NOT even solo a GREEN mob in skyshrine. (just think at lvl 53 how low a mob must to be green to you)i see the problem mostly in velious. i find myself almost dead from snow dervishes. <BR>all i can say is its bull. <P>so while changes to tracking, givinv rangers see invis, lowering jolt, and maybe recharging the raincaller are nice changes they don't to crap for any ranger wanting to explore and kill mobs on his own. especially somewhat high green. to me this is the real problem. when a ranger with all his spells and skills has to run from a green mob, now i think its time to evaluate our characters for balance. i think with all the changes in the Verant has just made this game worse and i think the new expantion is a total waste of money. yes it looks nice, but i refuse to go there when green stuff owns me. What Verant needs to do is make worth while changes that effect our preformance both solo and in a group. to me a good change in rangers isn't making tracking better or making the epic quest useable in either hand. we need to look at the bigger picture. yes maybe raising offensive and deffensive caps might help, but what are the conquences? verant needs to make changes that wil have a positive effect on ranger Solo and group abilities.  <P>and a good way to keep mob off you is never use taunt. i haven't used taunt since level 1. it keeps the mobs off me, and when i need to get the mob off someone i just snare it or blast it with an agro spell. most of the time i have no problem with the mob or with it going nuts on me.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's something else here that nobody has mentioned that bothers me a lot.<P>Let's just assume Absor is 100% right.  (I don't feel this is the case, but let's assume it is.)  Therefore, we're assuming that, all other things being equal, our spells' utility makes up for the tremendous aggro we receive.  Now, given that, we're being asked to give up 1/8 to 1/4 (one or two out of eight spell slots) simply to manage the aggro we draw.<P>Exactly HOW many times are we expected to pay for being able to cast spells? (I don't see it as paying for dual wielding.. all warriors get our offensive skills.  We differ in that we get spells, and as a result we give up something.)<P>By my count we now pay in terms of:<P>AC<BR>HP<BR>Defense<BR>Sec. Defense (dodge/parry/riposte)<BR>Weapon Selection<BR>Disciplines<P>and now we actually take a hit in the spell utility area where we're supposed to be gaining the ADVANTAGES for giving up all of the above.<P>Please note:  EVERY other hybrid class gets to make up for their "shortcomings" in ostensibly useful ways.  If we accept that SK's and Pally's give up offense for their spells, their method of "compensating" (i.e. drawing aggro for tanking) for their shortcomings have useful secondary benefits.  Pallies stun, which provides, well, stuns.. (at least until the mobs go resistant to stuns), and SK's dot, lifetap, etc.. sure, they may not get MUCH benefit beyond aggro from these things, but at least there's some.<P>Rangers get.. ummm.. jolt.  It affects us, and only us.  The ONLY use it has is patching up a problem that exists due to other factors.  If you insist that jolt is how we should deal with these things, then restore some utility to jolt.  Make them dots that lower hate every tick while still doing a modest amount of damage.. make them stun while still lowering us on the hate list.. but it's rather disturbing that you tell us we have these problems because of the great utility of our spells, then ask us to sacrifice that utility to "fix" these problems.<P>(A couple of quick additional notes.  Yes, I didn't include bards.. bards function in QUITE a different manner than the primary combat hybrids..  a bard is still useful if he never engages in combat.  Neither a SK, Pally, or Ranger is.<P>Additionally, the comparison to rogues/wizards is VERY off base.  We don't have the capacity to do NEAR rogue damage, even for one fight with full mana;  and we also don't have the capacity to do the IMPULSE damage (event/time == impulse) that <BR>wizards do.  Heck, as others pointed out, that <BR>"firehose" of offense we have is doing good to barely surpass warriors in optimal conditoins.. without having to "control" ourselves for aggro management.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Before ROK came out I NEVER posted on these boards complaining about the ranger.  NEVER.  I was perfectly satisfied with the class (altho I did hate how tracking worked). I could TANK with the best of them, do good damage and had some neat spells. I was happy with the class. I was having FUN with it.<P>Then Brad (Aradune), decided to change all that.  He didn't ask the players first.  He just decided to change the ranger's role.  How?  By not raising their defense along with the other melee classes.  By changing defense/dodge/parry/riposte tables that were in place prior to ROK and by changing the AC discrepancy between plate and chain.<P>HE decided that rangers will no longer be the EQUALS of the war/sk/pal. End result?  Rangers got pummeled and pummeled bad.  They became dazed as a result of losing their once proud role.<P>After ROK came out I was on these boards nearly daily screaming foul.  I felt betrayed.  I had played my ranger with a certain role in mind quite successfully for almost a YEAR, only to have the rug pulled out from under me.<P>I won't even bother going down the ABASHI road back then.  He never bothered to do his homework before responding.<P>Brad decided to leave heading the "Live team" and enter Jeff Butler.  Jeff Butler was viewed by many rangers as a potential "savior" to the class.  This image was created from the "famous" Las Vegas meeting with him, Brad and Sunmoon.  I, of course, was skeptical as is my nature, and even warned folks on the ranger glade boards not to discount Brad's influence. <P>Jeff then conducted many "tests" regarding the ranger.  NEVER has Verant disclosed what these tests shown despite numerous requests that they do so.  What then did Brad do?  He decided to up dodge/riposte some and THAT was it. Rangers cheered, and there I was again warning them all that this would not matter.  And guess what?  It didn't.  At BEST the changes aided damage avoidance by a mere 2-3 percent.  BIG DEAL.<P>Now SOV came out.  SOV is at best a playing ground for the "elite" guilds. And if the rangers weren't getting creamed enough in Kunark, now they had to fight critters in SOV which made Kunark critters look like pansies.<P>What was happening now?  Certain classes were becoming "elite" and others were becoming obsolete.<P>So now Verant decides to do a "final" class balancing act.  Personally I don't think many really know what that word means.  I define it quite simply, balance means that no ONE class should be so powerful compared to another.  There should be PARITY. A warrior should NOT be more valuable to a group than any other class.  A rogue should NOT be more valuable to a group than any other class.  A cleric should NOT be more valuable to a group than another.  An enchanter should NOT be more valuable to a group than another.  And prior to ROK that was the case.  Class substitutions could be readily made with EQUAL success.<P>Not so now.  And ranger IS at the bottom of the list bar NONE.<P>Let me state that playing a ranger to level 50 is CAKE.  I know what I am talking about.  I've done it THREE times on THREE different servers.  BRAND new servers, where there was nothing to be handed down to me.  I was not using items that were above my level range at any time.  I even leveled my first ranger to 50 using a PGT and OBSIDIAN SCIMITAR.<P>It's post 50 that is the problem.<P>It's ironic that I have THREE level 50+ rangers and not one is 60 yet.  It's not that I can't get one to 60, I could have a long time ago; it's because I don't have fun with the class after a certain point.  I get tired of always playing the bride's maid.  Right now I'm playing a SK (level 32) and he rocks (twinked like hell tho).<P>I blame one person and one person only for all this. BRAD.  <P>The proposed changes to the ranger simply will not, let me repeat, WILL NOT change the plight of the ranger.  It is simple MATH.  4th in offense, last in defense for a melee class means LAST in group choice.  That will ALWAYS be the case.  ALWAYS.<P>Some say rangers aren't asking for same defense as warrior, etc..  WRONG. I want the SAME defense as ALL THE OTHER MELEE classes.  It's the ARMOR'S AC differences that I am not asking for a change.  Plate should have more AC than chain.<P>Right now ALL the other melee classes will have defense of 250-252.  ALL OF THEM.  Absor I defy you to explain to me why a rogue and monk justify 252 defense and NOT the ranger.  I've stated this question plenty times and NEVER has anyone from Verant even tried to answer it.  You say we have great offense so no defense.  Well rogue and monk have the BEST offense and BEST defense.  EXPLAIN THIS.  Explain to me why a TAUNTING class defined by YOU as part warrior should not be put on parity with rogue/monk defense.  You can't.  Tis why no one at Verant ever tried. You know, I could at least accept being LAST in Defense if I was FIRST in offense.  THEN your arguments might make sense.<P>Until changes are made to the ranger which will improve it's tanking ability it will never be group useful at the higher levels.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The only thing that I don't like about being a Ranger is that other Rangers B***h all the time about things that we CAN'T HAVE (tp, bind, SoW at 30)!<P>Tewfik Swiftarrow &lt;Circle of the Oak&gt;<BR>Ranger<BR>Veeshan server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey guys.. 1 Thing you lot have done, is GUT stuff.<BR>I on the other hand have done a lot of testing with my ranger 53 and a war 53..<BR>We basically beat the hell out of each other..<BR>trying different things.. I have listed some of the things we have done, (main ones of interest).<BR>All of this was logged and stats taken..<P>Stats.. War is a human .. ranger is helf elf.<BR>EQ worn... Stuff to be worn for that level nothing           UBER.<BR>Setup 1.<P>  War -Wyrm slayer(pri) and green jaded axe<BR>      -tactics  beat the crap out of the ranger                using all tricks.. disarm included.<BR>  Rngr -rev whip(pri) and flux axe<BR>      -tactics as above. Full spell buffs, but <BR>       no casting during mele.<BR>result  war = 30% , ranger = XX<P>Setup 2<BR>  War -Wyrm slayer(pri) and green jaded axe<BR>      -tactics  beat the crap out of the ranger                       using all tricks.. disarm included.<BR>  Rngr -rev whip(pri) and flux axe<BR>      -tactics as above.

NO spell buffs, <BR>       no casting<BR>result war = 55% ,  ranger = XX<P>it seems that in this case, there will be some variation. But  the average should look like this.<BR>So the comparison if a ranger and war is not bad..<BR>But... as to the number of attacks.. the ranger missed on average .. close to 50%..<P>If verrant has baised the agro on the number of attacks to add to the agro list on the mob.. then the ranger will be king for mob agro..<BR>and if the ranger casts.. War taunt will not be that usefull, (the ranger may as well be the tank.)<P>This situation  shown above is what I see to be an average for the war/ranger comparrison..<P>Conclusion...  Rangers will be a high taunt player<BR>and a drain on cleric mana.<P>Hell now you can all go mad and disect my notes.  <BR>But it is some informative info that you can use as a guage for these classes using these wepons.<BR>Please do not make them the standard for your different comparisons.. eg:half elvf vs Ogre.. or whatever.. this works for this base case..<P>cheers<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've played a ranger since March of 99'. It has not been easy, and it has not always been fun, but I always wanted to play the ranger class. Yes I have complained about the difficulties of playing this very unrespected class, but the way I see it, it is my right to be able to do so. It's easy for someone tell you to drop the character you have nurtured for almost two years, I choose not to do that. I am fast approaching lvl 50, (I am only able to log in once a week due to RL and all of it's trappings)and I think if fixes are not implemented I will not attempt to go beyond that magical level. Will I turncoat and play another class? Perhaps, but not for long I fear. I think, unless the ranger class is fixed (and it is broken, all you unbelievers be damned), I shall soon depart EQ for greener pastures. Is this a threat? No, because no one but my online friends will care if I go or stay. Im not gonna rehash the problems with the ranger class, you all have done a much better job of that I could ever hope to do. Im just letting any of the powers that be know that the current situation is unacceptable, and you have one of two choices: 1) Fix this class with these very intelligent and thought-provoking ideas that have been provided to you by the players...or 2) Lose customers who have no desire to waste time, money, or respect on a dead end road. Very simple, very straight forward. Aside from some of the more outlandish ideas of port and pets, all ideas listed in these threads have merit and are extremely doable by Verant without destroying class balance. For example:<P>1) Archery: It has been said that making archery a primary melee skill will unbalance game play. Balderdash! Increase damage and decrease delay on bows, and give them the same aggro as say a wizard who casts Ice Comet, or an enchanter who casts Tashan. If you treat archery as a DD spell being cast, then all that does is puts us on par with casters who use HUGE nukes. We can never in a million years do the same amount of damage of one of the big nukers with our bows, even if they were reverse-nerfed. So we might gain a little advantage in soloing...so what? Maybe that will make up for two years of denying that there was a problem, when we knew different. <P>2) Spells: We all know that JUST giving us spells will not help too much, but it might make life better. JOLT has already been proven to be more of a liability than asset (mana cost and resists) in many cases. While we are not opposed to a JOLT that works, I think it come too late in the game for most. Since we do play the hardest class of them all, why not dumb down some of the spell lvl requirements? SOW at 30 is way more than appropriate, it should have been a given. Of the spells being addressed on test, I have to say many are good changes. BUt what about what we dont get. Max 18 agil buff, when we are supposed to be one of the most agile classes that play (aside from monks and rouges, who have had nice fixes given to them)? No dexderity spells at all, not even little ones? From about 30-50 we live by our procs most of the time. Not to mention that the afore mentioned achery skill is aided by dex. Im not asking for pets, ports, or any thing remotely Uber, but come on give us something. I do believe that we need a better binding system, but that is really something ALL melee have a problem with. It has always been silly to me that the ppl who are most dependant on their equipment are always the fartherest away from their bodies.<P>3) Second class citizens: We rangers have taken alot of grief in this game, but for the most part we were able to suck it up and keep going. It is getting more and more difficult in post 50 to do this. Ever been turned away from a group because of your class? Let me tell you, it sucks. Once you hit lvl 45 it seems your usefulness is diminished greatly. Sure we can get groups in outside venues pretty easily, we are outside type of guys. SOW, snare, high damage output, some ok utility buffs, good pullers. Yeah in the outside world we can hold our own. But on planar, high lvl dungeon and dragon raids we start to lose our credibility. At the really high lvls we are usually passed over for more "desirable" tanks. If we are taken, usually it is to be a meat shield for casters. Heh, if I had a pp for everytime I've heard the term manasink being applied to myself by healers........Well, you get the point. We have no class defining skill, and that has always been our problem. Archery is a joke, tracking is sometimes better with lower capped players like druids and bards, our spells are often not needed because of druids and such, and our AC and defence skills are laughable. We need something to set us apart from other melee. Again, better suggestions for this was made by more knowledgable folks than me.<P>Im disgruntled and saddened by these issues. Why? Because I see myself leaving good friends soon because some people at Verant are not insighful and honest enough to adimit their mistakes. Even other classes (the intelligent ones, not idiots like I've seen post on this subject) admit we are one of the, if not THE weakest, class to play. I, for one, do not wish to give up being a ranger. It has become such a part of my online persona. But neither do I wish to continue being disrespected by others because of the weaknesses of my class. The ball is in your court Verant, fix us or lose us. Your call.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you're going to say stuff like "just because you can do alot of damage" please qualify "alot".  Bear in mind that Warriors are the 3rd on the list of damage dealers and the best hit takers.  Even if you bring our offense and weapons skills up to warrior level we still will not outdamage them as a result of lacking triple attack and having a lower damage table (If I remember correctly the Ranger damage table is set somewhere around 5-10% below a warrior, while this may not sound significant any amount below is still below).<P>As Thryll pointed out, Rogues and monks have 252 Offense and Defense and this doesn't seem to infringe on Warrior territory at all.  As a result, I don't see how you can justify your comments about raising our defense.<P>What I really really want to know is why at level 50 it's perfectly acceptable for all hybrids to be just slightly behind warriors and have our spells make up the difference (let's face it, although all of our spells see use at some point the vast majority are rarely used), then by the time we reach level 60 pure melee classes dominate.<P>Let's ask it in a simple question format.  You're planning a raid and going after a big target...  A Dragon or Venril Sathir or some such example.  You've got to limit the number of people that you have so that you have maximum effectiveness with minimal lag.  You've got a couple of slots open that you could fill with a Hybrid or with a pure melee.  Given that you've got healers and casters to cover the spells that the hybrids might use, why do you pick the hybrid?  Or, as a friend in an "uberguild" once asked me "Why take half of something when you can have the whole thing?"<P>Terrak Steeltalon<BR>Ranger Lord Outrider of Tunare<BR>&lt;Forsaken Conclave&gt;<BR>Bertoxxulous Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
