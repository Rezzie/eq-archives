</FONT><HR>Friends of Norrath, what im about to tell you is shocking!! I swear to god that it is the truth and nothing but the truth.<P>The most corrupted thing and the biggest kept secret on veeshan is that FOH have GM's working for their guild!!  I will tell you the whole story and then with careful research, you WILL, i repeat *YOU WILL* find out sooner or later.<P>Do you know why FOH is so abusing? Do you know why many people complain of their rude behavior and NO GM does anything about it? Do you know why most of the time you talk to them and they remain silent and wish not to speak with you? Do you know why they have good items on their players and no GM is investigating? I WILL TELL YOU!!<P>And Lastly DO YOU KNOW WHY the message of the day lists Kreugen as one of the tactic winners?  Yep you guessed it right, HE is a GM, and he will be the one of the many FOH gm's that im gonna point out later.<P>Story number one:<P>I was in lower guk camping the Ghoul lord with my friends this one night and everything was going well until Xerexs one of the FOH pops in the room.  Damn right, he charmed the ghoul lord just when my group almost killed him and auctions the lord for sale.  ----what he does is charms the ghoul lord when the lord is almost dead, then feigns death so that the charm breaks off and then he blasts the lord to deat----  YEPPERS i typed /who gm all right at that moment and DING! one GM online.  But guess what, no matter who petitioned that nigt including my whole group, that GM that was on at that moment was as good as DEAD, No response on the GM whatsoever. I even used the tell command, and guess what, NO response.  The GM and Xerexs had the deal worked out already i bet.  Well, after the Ghoul Lord, he went straight to the Frenzy and did the same thing.  Took the Frenzy loot as well as the Ghoul lord and headed to the Cavileir.  Almost took out the cavalier too, but lucky that group had a wizard, so right when Xerexs feigns death the wizzy ice cometed the cavalier.  During that time, the whole zone was going crazy, everybody was shouting and petitioning, but the GM's that were on were all DEAD and Deaf.  I was there.<P>second story:<BR>Dynamic NINJA looted the SMR and left the whole group in the ghoul magi to die. Did you hear about that?  Yep he did and he was a FOH.  Dynamic if you read this, YOU KNOW that robe is mine you THEIF!!  HE ninja looted the SMR and gave the one he had to his friend TYVERIS.  TYVERIS was down in lower guk at level 31 camping the SMR with Dynamic.  NOW what would you have thought if you were down there seeing Tyveris a level 31 and Dynamic a level 40 with a SMR already?  Of course you would think HMM... why is dynamic down here camping the magi when he already has a SMR? YEP you guessed it, the SMR was for Tyveris.  They had it all planned and YEP even though my group and the whole zone petitioned on him, there was no response whatsoever.<P>Kreugen A GM:<P>I was in Lower guk and came up to Kruegen, guess what he had a FIRST NAME, MIDDLE, AND LAST NAME.  So i said "hey kreugen, why do u have a middle name"? then he said "OH, I forgot I have a GM on this account!!,      YOU BET, he is a GM.  Verant says that GM's cannot join guilds, but trust me thats all a lie.  Its just to throw us off.  I have the screenshot of this on my computer for reference.<P>Everytime I log in and see the Message of the Day, it makes me wanna throw up.<P>Beware everyone, members of FOH knows stuff about your account too.  stuff like how many warnings you have and if you have been suspended or stuff that GM's did on your account.  Why should they not some of the members in FOH are GM's.<P>YOU must think im joking, and may critisize me, but do what i do, Do careful looking and you will know.  FOH dont want to talk about it much.  they dont like talking to you about anything because the info may leak out.  Some of the items they have on their character are either NINJA looted or KS'd.  And worst of all, some may be given by GM.  GM's says that they cant give out stuff, but I know for a fact that they can.  OUR former Lead GM caphys has given stuff out, I know because i have screen shots and im sure many of you have had him give you stuff.  But lets not discuss about Caphys, lets just say GM's can give out stuff.<P>To Varent, IF you read this, I urge you to investigate and make norrath a better place for everyone.  After all, its YOUR JOB!!<P>I have more to tell you if you want to know, i will post it some other time!!<P>POST ALL replies and I shall respond, IM NOT scared or anything FOH! its time the truth comes out.  YOU have been hiding too long and abusing to many!!<P>Sincerely<P>A TRUE friend of NORRATH</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Dear god...you seem to have an over-active imaginiation. Let me clarify a few things for you.<P>   Kreugen got his name "Champion of Brell" by completing the Butcherblock Hammer Quest. You might try researching a little before you spout off like an idiot. <P>As for Xerexs and Dynamic: <P>   I doubt Dynamic Ninja'd the SMR. People camp items they already own all the time...whats wrong with that?(Seems to me that yer upset that he would roll(and win??) on an item he already has) <P>   Xerexs probably did charm the Ghoul Lord though(wouldnt be suprized at all)<P>   FoH has all that sweet gear because they are dedicated players. Maybe if you spent more time playing and less time fabricating slander you too would have some nice gear.<P>   Anyway i was bored so i thought i would clear that up...<P>                           Dinanmer - 50 Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I believe they are dedicated players.<P>From reading other posts here though, is it true that they strong-arm their way into the planes and so forth as is described on other posts here?<P>It's not a stretch to think that any arrogance wouldn't be involved in a guild of this size.  I'm certainly not making accusations, but I have heard a lot of realistic sounding complaints.  Seems like it is an unfriendly way to take care of things.  I've been curious some time now what Furor has to say in response to those things he has been accused of.  Certainly he is not obligated to defend himself, but when things seem more valid than others, maybe it is a good idea.<P>I will say though, one thought on this post.  One day when Veeshan was down I was logged into the chatroom for Veeshan.  I never really chat there, just kind of read since I'm as bored as can be =)<BR>The topic of FoH came up, and half the room went into a rant about them.  The guides became angry with them, and told them they were not allowed to say anything bad about FoH.  It seemed odd to me.  Most of the time the chat rooms are nothing but complainers.  Why would the guides choose that subject as any more inappropriate than the others?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>loren, my name says it all. thats what the majority of foh i have had encounters with can do. There a few that have been nice in return. but 75% of foh suck ASS! Ks'n, ninja looting, spawn hogging, crybaby to gm, farming, stuck up, got no real life, complainers when they dont get there way, punk ass bi*ches. That is fact from my time playing e.q. I am not sure about all this b.s. about them being g.m.s but so what, they are going to cheat either way. LOren is an idiot, how are you gonna kick someone off, and if you were being sarcastic, you need to work on it a little bit. YOu were coming off as a real life early 20 soemthing female who is a control freak. one little bit of pressure and you snap like a twig. its just all about a game that foh has ruined for many. there are games for people who have to crush everything in the world..they are called half-life, t.a., anything else you can blow up stuff and kill everything to get the big prize. F.O.H. is just in it for the ... who knows. But with only a few foh deserves no respect.<BR>Up yours loren kick me off the server<BR>/rude<BR>/rude<BR>/rude<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>FoH sounds like the Epitome (spell?) of the Uber-Guild. A Bunch of K3wL D00Dz who are after all the PhAt LeWt. Why dont you just unite all the smaller guilds on your corrupt server and send FoH a message that you are not gonna be walked all over anymore? If they are such a problem I think the Non-FoH people would have banded together long ago. However, I do see alot of complaints about them. If they are true then FoH are just a bunch of losers with no life who can spend all that time perfecting thier vidoegame skills. But thats a big IF   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>As far as GMs being involved in assisting a guild in any way its just wrong and there needs to be some housecleaning on Verant's side if it is true. <BR>BTW I wanted to see the Veeshan board because I was curious if there were alot of complaints about FoH. <P>Andaericus 50 Shaman<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
