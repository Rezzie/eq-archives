</FONT><HR>to tell you the truth, i have no problems with places like the sleeper's tomb, places that me and my guild will never see. I belong to a guild who can do some decent raids, but our tactics and player base are not the best of the best. we have work to do before we can even do fear by ourselves. the existence of content and items that i will never see doesn't affect my game. we are still challenged by com, chardok, etc.. there is plenty for us to still do and be proud to beat. <BR>the encounters that vi designed around the bp I will probably never see. It does piss me off that venril sathir requires the riposte disc, making my pally even more useless. <BR>there should be uber content for the uber guilds. and they should get phat lewt for going there. as long as there is content to challenge me and my guild that work for where our skills are at, i will be happy. <P>-weirzbowskey 53 pally<BR>snag L'puss 48 lizzy necro of bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I disagree with two things. First, this idea that the people who first killed dragons and did the planes, are the only ones who will do the same in SoV.  I for one just started a new character a few months ago, and i'm already killing trakanon and Venril sathir, doing Plane of growth Raids, and getting ready to jump into zones like dragon necropolis and Siren grotto &lt; spelling? &gt;, anyway. You are what you make yourself, ever man is his own person. You're not born into a class, this isn't mid-evil times... <P>Another thing id like to say about SoV and "uber" mobs.  With SoV there are alot of lesser "uber" mobs for guilds with less powergamers. IE: Lodzila and Kelorak Dar &lt; spelling :P &gt; ? These are a few that i know about, but they are very easy for an "uber" guild, and just the right difficulty for a high 40s low 50s guild.  Even though they are "easier" than your average VP dragons they still drop very Decent loot.. ( 23ac cloak/shield, Club with a 149 dmg proc???) umm this is good stuff.. not to mention Planer type weapons and Cloak of Flames look alikes.  Well i don't dissagree with everything you've said, but i do think you might be slaming poor Brad alittle to hard here.  SoV hasn't even been out that long yet, maybe we should wait awhile before attacking it.  Although... /sigh i'm dissapointed with the Troll Beserker armor looks, arggggghh i'll be wearing cobalt cause it roxor, thx.<P>-Kagun Carnage<BR>56 Warrior<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a good point.<P>There's a rule of thumb in much of software development called the 80/20 rule.  You try to write your software to handle 80% of the cases pretty well.  It's likely that the remaining 20% of the situations will be FAR more complex, harder, or something and prohibitevely difficult/expensive/time consuming to do well.  But you put most of your effort in making sure you do 80% of the situations well.<P>Applying the 80/20 rule to EQ, I would suggest Verant spend most of their time making sure they handle 80% of the players well.  The remaining 20% (including the  10% ahead of the curve and the 10% behind the curve) you only do things for if they don't mess up what you did for the 80%.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just want to say that I support this post completely.  I have felt this way for a long time.  And as much as everyone else would disagree, I for one would support VI if they took the game down for a month to revamp and retune everything.  Yes, give us a free month and fix things to be geared toward the top 25% rather than the top 2.5% of players.  Hell, I would still pay that 10 dollars if they promised to spend the month changing things away from being a game for the elite to have fun and the rest of us to buy their junk and level where they don't want to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Congrats to the post, its awesome and i agree whole heartly. You might have described a scenario that might kill EQ one day or cost it at least a lot of costumers. It cant work in the long run to design the game for a small part of the community.

</FONT><HR>Sad but true.  What they can take from this is to learn to improve AI of mobs.  Mobs should know to move around players, move around obstacles, go up and down ramps, and behave in realistic ways.  Solve this and then there is going to be more to a mob than hp, whether it is a caster, and whether it can summon/death touch.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What's this doing on page 5?<P>As a long-time casual player, my concern is that low level zones are being adjusted for the upper level players.  The obvious examples are Kithicor Forest and Lower Faydark.  What message does this send to the playing populace?  Verant wants to cater to the high level players AT THE EXPENSE of low level players.  I don't like this trend.<P>Sorry if this seems to be a tangent.  It's related in my mind, anyway.

</FONT><HR> Good post, the compliant is that VI is gearing toward uber guilds to keep them happy and ignoring the rest of us. mmmm wouldn't it make sense to stop this line of developement. If they have nothing to go for what would happen, they would get bored, start new char and learn to play all over again. I mean sure they would still go after what is there now, but if VI geared back toward the rest of us then why would anyone need to be in a uber guild.<P>I know probaly dumb on my part but just a thought.<BR>Everyone gets tired of farming at some point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A very good discussion...<P>I have thought for a while on this and feel that the uber/non-uber disparity within the game is now irrepairable.<P>There is no real solution to it apart from a complete revamp of many of the basic game coding.  Unfortunalty, this is not a commercially viable solution for Verant/Sony, it is simply not worth their effort.<P>The only way that the development of the game can continue is with an injection of revenue, ie, an expansion.  It is all well and good to talk about what is best for the game etc. but we must never forget that we are dealing with a commercial product and that profit is the bottom line.<P>That said, lets look at what we can do with an expansion.<P>The introduction of new interfaces, graphics etc. is an easy one to add... most expansions are expected to include these.<P>So it comes down to content.  First, set your boundaries.  You must create content up to the highest level..  and a little bit more.  This is to 'advance' the game.  It must be only slightly higher than the current highest level in order to allow room for your next expansion.<P>This is where we hit a major problem.  The origional top guilds have had many months to build up equipment from the very highest levels of the game.  Areas that once took 50+ people to sweep clean now take 25.  This is not only due to equipment but also the very high level of skill and coordination that well drilled uber guilds can attain.  This kind of level is already out of the reach of the general population.<P>A slightly lesser guild might well be able attempt the kind of 50 people raids that the uber guilds are now finding straightforward but are unable to do so with an regularity due to the constraints on spawn times.  They are trying to 'catch up' but unfortunatly, cannot match the current uber guilds in sheer zone dominance.<P>So, the game designers have there 'upper boundary' to work from.  The best loot goes to the very top of this boundary.  The organisation and skill required is also set from this upper level.  Remember that this upper boundary is slightly higher than what the designers think the uber guilds are capable of.  These zones are created to be uber deadly.<P>The lesser guilds are practically excluded from them due to the dangers of complete character loss there.  The uber guilds are keen to get in there, more for prestige value than anything else.<P>The developers begin to work downwards from the upper boundary and create lower level zones.  They set the zone difficulty based upon the first ones they have created, the uber+ zones.  These zones are more difficult than the current ones that already exist for the same level as the developers expect eveyone to eventually get better (better equipped, more skilful).<P>The problem is, the general population doesn't want to work harder than they currently do for same reward.  Even the lesser guilds have constraints on time/people that force them away from the new zones.  All we are left with is an uber playground.<P>Eventually, the top guilds begin to explore and recover loot for the very top level zones.  Increasing the gap even further.<P>They also begin to reap the rewards of the slightly easier zones.  The 50-55 zones are so difficult that they require equipment from the old top level zones even to survive in... these zones are now straightforward to the now uber+ guilds (new term.. uber+ = no zone in the game requires more than 30 members to reap).<P>The other 95% of the population is left to scramble around in the old zones trying to attain a level that is forever beyond them.<P>Is there a solution to this ??  Quite frankly, no.  It is a vicious circle.  Now that this disparity exists, it can only increase as the developers try to 'advance' the upper level of the game.  'Advance' in EQ means more hitpoints, more resistant, more damaging, more, more, more.  It will eventually reach a point where you require certain loot from a MoB before you can defeat it !!!  This will be the ultimate outcome.<P>So the future of the game has already been decided.  There will be an elite cadre of guilds who can access 100% of the game.  The rest of us will have to settle with whatever is left after these guilds are finished with it.  Future expansions will also be no longer viable.  The customer base that will buy them will be too small to justify the investment.<P>These problems were created from the very roots of the game.  With all the good intentions in the world these problems are practically impossible to avoid.  MuDflation is not a game problem, it stems from human nature and is no ones 'fault'.  It's too easy to ignore what is happening to the game in the early stages and agree to 'look at them later'.  Once the concrete has set... thats it.<P>Eventually, as new games begin to take over EQ's throne, similar problems could develope in the next generation of games unless they are VERY careful.  This will require a much more long term view of the systems they are producing, and I think this is beginning to happen.<P>When we are playing our total immersion games in 30 years from now and commenting on how perfectly balanced they are remember that EQ has taught us many lessons.<P>Just my 2cp   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The reason why this post hasn't been answered is that you are calling the Vision(tm) flawed.  The game is working exactly like they planned it to work.  The only way super ubers can be super uber is to have a caste system.  Super ubers, uber, 55+, 46-54, 50, never make 50, 31-45, never make 31, midlevel forever, newbies.  This is the caste system in the Vision(tm) too I am quite sure.<P>The amount of time that the game sucks from you as you increase in level is so grossly unbalanced for a reason.  The majority of the players will never make it to the peak but will have the burning desire to do so which keeps them in the game paying $10 a month until they truly burn out.  Brad has stated many times that he expects the players to burn out.  Not in those words mind you, but he has said it.  He doesn't expect you to "finish" the game, meaning enjoy it to its fullest.  He expects only a very very few to do that.  NO NO NO he expects you to BURN OUT, GIVE UP, and QUIT.  This is the Vision(tm).<P>Once you realize this and get off the leveling, equipment treadmill you'll either do one of two things.  1) QUIT and move on.  2) Play the game with the realization that you are in one of those groups and based on mostly real life factors will never move up the chain.<P>I played EQ since beta and quit for about a year until I figured this out.  This week I basically maxed one of the chars that I started in December when I came back to the game.  He is a level 31 monk and yes he is maxed for me.  If I get another level with the time I have to put into the game I'll be totally shocked.  That is why I play on the team PVP server because I still have something to do.<P>This is the Vision(tm). And Yes for must of us it truly sucks when you dreamed of what the game could be.  The leveling treadmill is just too time consuming for 80% of the people who purchased the game.  Perhaps if 80% could make it to the real game things would be better, perhaps not, we will most likely never know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The uber guilds are not the bad guys.  They get the good items because they are willing to explore the new zones first.  These are the people who play EQ 60+ hours a week.  I agree that Verant needs to do something to ensure that the game remains fun for everyone and that there is always a challenge.<P>-First, I think Verant would do well by reducing twinking and power leveling.  Not that they know how right now, but it has to be done.  It's a slap in the face when someone who has spent a year getting to level 40 (there are tons of these people) watch someone with a level 50 character power level and twink a second character past them in a week.<BR>-I like having an economy, but farming has to be reduced.  That and the necessity to spend huge amounts of time camping single spawns.<BR>-This all deals with MUDflation.  In every mud, the powerful keep growing more powerful and the gap widens between the well-guilded and everyone else.  Now the uber people usually deserve to be uber, but they will do everything in their power to keep and expand their power and keep the gap widening.  Just like in real life, the rich get richer and everyone else is at the bottom trying to become one of them (and many will succeed, more will not).  However, in EQ (and every other mud I have seen) it is a one way street.  Nobody ever goes down.  The bar always needs to be raised.  I do not have the answer, but..<P>Here are some observations:<BR>-Players horde cash.  The world is always getting richer since money appears from nowhere.  Player expenses to give money back to the system are a joke.  You can't force a super rich player to spend money by having the game charge them for various things.  I have seen many players spend some time killing things simply for easy money to offset this game feature.  Out of money?  go kill some creature that normally has its loot split by 6 people 15 levels lower than you.  Then you get it all and quickly.<BR>-There is a 'best' of everything.  Only stats matter.  There can be 1000 1hs weapons in the game, but one of them is going to be the best for a certain class/race.  The rest become junk (or at least 95% are junk).  This is not like real life.  Is a BMW better than a Cadillac?  Who knows, it's personal preference.  There is no personal preference in EQ.  It's completely stat based.  Everything can and is calculated.<BR>-Players know everything about zones.  Not that this is completely bad, but it turns playing into something very predictable.  Especially in high level zones, things should be far more randomized.<BR>-Verant makes life too easy for the uber people!  Don't want to walk two zones?  Get a port (only if you have high level friends!)  Get killed?  Get all your exp back (if you have high level friends!).  Are you in trouble?  Evac out (if you have high level friends!)  Not only are uber people more powerful by themselves, the game makes it easier for them to accomplish tasks (travel, CR, make money, complete quests)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One of the greatest culprits that I've seen which promotes the disparity between the 'haves' and 'have nots' is truely in large part the game engine.  <P>Though it is too late to change the system now, let me express a possible solution for fixing this problem.<P>The "David and Goliath" scenario should be possible.  Why couldn't an aimed shot find gaps in armor and pierce the mere mortal underneath?  Certainly a determined 'nobody' with a fair amount of skill, determination, and a little luck can overcome the greatest of champions; though currently this isn't the case.  A level 40 will perpetually defeat a level 20 without breaking a sweat.  <P>I'm not saying that the playing field should be totally even, but rather that level should almost solely improve *skills* that promote your survival rather than simply making you 150 times as hearty as the peon just starting out, allowing you to absorb hit after hit while the lowly drop like stones.  The notion that one should avoid being hit altogether seems to not even dawn on some who develop these sort of titles!<P>With all certainty, this system would promote it's own problems to work out before implementation: Would one critical hit, say a major wound to the neck, kill always?  Would the mage, capable of igniting to cinders his unfortunate victim without flinching, be assailable?<P>Though I've not pondered further in this direction, I'm certain a think-tank out there somewhere can conjure an answer or three.
