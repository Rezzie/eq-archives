This means that I've since upgraded my old Darkforge armor which I still need for my epic.  This bag is full of DF, a ghoulbane and other odds and ends which I'll need.<P>4)  Coldain ring and shawl quests components have this bag spoken for.<P>5)  Tradeskill accessories - this bag has my geerlock devises for cooking, brewing, fletching and smithing as well as my odds and ends (file, spoon, pie tin, etc)<P>6)  Misc - armor, weapons and other gear which I need, but not all the time.<P>7)  Misc quest/faction items - I actually do the quest, unfortunately, most EQ quests aren't designed to be banged out in one session - you've gotta camp mob X for three days, mob y for a week, and hope that you happen to find components A, B and C laying around the zone or drop off of a random mob.<P>8)  Thurg armor gems - sadly, there isn't one specific gem that will do the job for each class - each class needs three of half a dozen different types of gems.<P>So now that means that any misc loot which I get I have to keep on my person till I can sell it or use it in a tradeskill/quest - I'm full!<P>I know that when I can find someone to help me transfer crap that I can just put it on a mule, but that takes time which I might not have when I need something.<P>So what can VI do to give players more space but still keep within thier vision?<P>Sell 2000 wieght containers with more than 10 slots - this keeps people from abusing them, but still allows folks to buy them in the bazaar and put them in thier banks.<P>Make specialty banks in each town in addition to the normal bank - the specialty bank will only be accesable in that town - that way when I go to Thurg, I can just hit the Thurg only bank to get my gems or Coldain ring/shawl quest items.<P>What about the tradeskill banks promised with PoP?  A bank where I could store an unlimited number of an item in a stack as well as my misc tradeskill gear would really be helpful - you can have an unlimited number of coins, yet you still get a coin graffic when you take one or more - why not do the same thing with other stackable items?<P>"Lockers" - if they don't want to give us the bank space, let characters buy or rent it - just please be reasonable about it - we're talking a neccesity, not a luxery like horses - being able to store an extra backpack shouldn't cost my character 10k.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Since the quantity field can't represent a quantity over 20, this only requires one byte. An external database reference, no matter what the type, can be represented in four bytes (a 32-bit pointer) or less. That's five bytes. Since each node (bank slot) can have a subnode (container) with up to ten slots, this means that the maximum needed, given a sufficiently efficient storage mechanism, is 55 bytes per bank slot - 5 for the slot itself and 50 for the potential container slots. <P>So 256 is a huge overestimate of what's needed - but, since I do not work for SOE, I don't know what's actually used, so I multiplied that by a factor for memory-ineffeciency.<P>In other words, it was a SWAG.

I suspect the order is more along the lines of 256 bytes per slot inside the pack plus 256 for the pack itself. Remember this item has to be accessed many ways. It needs an id for a reference in the database. An ID for which reference number it is. Prabably an id for the current owner. In addition I suspect that commonly accessed values are probably stored such as N0-drop and NO-rent to save on access to the database. For instance when right clicking a bag do you really want to iterate through every item in the bag, get it's database number and then call the database and check if it's no drop(to show no-drop status on the bag) or would you want to be able to quickly access flag values such as this? The reality is that we have NO clue how much space an inventory slot takes and guestimations can range from 4 bytes to 1k. Remember bank slots are storage their essentially invisible containers that travel with the character and probably have to be transfered across server boundaries and the like.<P>However, given all that I would also like a few extra slots in the bank.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Right now, I bet I don't have more than 5-6 empty slots between my inventory and my bank. LQ/MQ/HQ skins/pelts, spider/spiderling silks, velium, acrylia, tempers, foraged stuff, all my tradeskill/charisma gear, stuff that I looted that I didn't know what it was for but looked important enought to save, quest items, and spell components. You name it, I got it...... And that's just the first bag :-)<P>That being said, I have dreamed about linking all the banks on my account for some time. Nothing worse than coming back in after a drop-n-camp transfer than to see someone has discovered your cache of goods and is long gone, along with your goods.<P>Being more a casual player than a powergamer, there isn't always someone on I trust to do a transfer for me..... <P><BR>The Banks are considered global. Not having the individual banks the same way is inconvenient to to us packrat tradeskillers that don't have a second computer and account. If the current system is supposed to be discouraging twinking, Psst, It aint working.....<P><BR>Since you can now access more than several dozen items past a vendors default inventory, I don't believe capacity is the issue it once was.<P>Accessing the inventories is simple. <P>Represent each characters bank as a page, and use a toggle to scroll between them, just like the way the hotkey box works. Instead of numbered pages, they would be named for the characters they represent. Only have 3 characters? You only have access to three pages.<P>Flag/associate no drop items to the character, not the account (if it isn't already done that way). <P>Now when you are at a bank and wish to access the main inventory , you just hit the "Master Inventory" button in the bank window, and all of your ether-worldy goods are accessable (just like /bazaar, it's off by default). If a bank slot has a no drop item or a bag with a no drop item in it, only the character that looted the item will be able to interact with it.<P>"If the women don't find ya handsome, they should at least find ya handy" - Red Green</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
