</FONT><HR>Well I just logged out of EQ after another GM event turned into a joke. My guildmate Dwaveon (who lives in MM - heheh) said over guildchat that a Deathly Herald had appeared and announced Mayong Mistmoore was waking. Mayong appeared soon after together with his henchman (Lord Galendore or something like that) and a wood elven prisoner they had captured. The scene started to play out and thats when things got out of hand. Players trying to nuke the main NPCs, crowding Mayong, heckling the GMs, and generally spoiling things.<P>Verants fault? No. I sympathised with the GM playing Mayong Mistmoore - I must admit that I would have used the Death Touch far more often faced with so many players only interested in being disruptive (simply trying to slay major NPCs for loot, instead of seeing the scene pan out). <P>Some players excused their actions by calling it roleplaying, and indeed many players should be congratulated for continuing to roleplay despite the crowds of Kewl d00dz swarming Mayong. Maybe Mayong should have used more force so that he was treated with the proper respect and fear due to him - the death touch was used sparingly (Asian got it twice that I saw) and an AoE summon that moved players away from Mayong up the ramp was also used a few times. Mayong is easily god and dragon level, yet this very impressive vampire could barely move for the players around him making quirky comments and trying to nuke him every once in a while - hmmm.<P>Maybe Mayong should have appeared in his throne room inside MM and done the sequence by shout. Or maybe he should have had a killable bodyguard of L50 ancilles (that the GMs could keep respawning and throwing forwards to keep the bloodthirsty players busy).<P>I have heard that some servers have missed out on unique GM-given artefacts because players have nuked GM controlled NPCs before the quest could be given, and I feared this was due to happen again. I have been at past GM events, even though I am not high lev (L37 now), because I like to observe the history of Norrath unfolding, but some of the childish behaviour tonight ruined the sense of epic grandeur that Mayong's appearance should have provoked. <P>Solutions? <BR>1) ooc, shout and auction channels should be disabled in the event zone. The GMs should forcibly use a silence command on disruptive individuals.<BR>2) Using an apparition (such as a vision of a god, or a ghost) to give quests may be an idea - they wouldn't be targettable so couldn't be attacked.<BR>3) If the scene is just to further the history of the world, like today's event, then the major NPCs should have death touch and not be afraid to use it to get the respect and awe due to them.<BR>4) I agreed with some players that these events need more interraction, but if a sequence like tonights was just to advance the history then I don't see what Verant can do. Maybe finishing the sequence with a Mistmoore army in L Fay moving towards G Fay zone (and Felwithe) would have satisfied people.<P><BR>And so to the event itself. From what Mayong said it seems Veeshan and her dragons are involved - he mentioned both a mystical veil (as in a barrier) which restricts their power, and the continent of Velious which is where Veeshan clawed Norrath (see opening movie). Mayong also mentioned an evil dwarf that his henchman should seek out to help him slay the dragons Nagafen and Vox. Many players are running around Norrath at this moment looking for this evil dwarf (probably to nuke him - sigh).<P><BR>I won't speculate further than saying I'm sure this ties in with making the dragons stronger and higher lev with the expansion due soon (with possibly a new level 60 limit for players). I know Brad said in an interview that they wouldn't want players ever being powerful enough to kill Vox and Nagafen easily. Maybe it will also pave the way for Kunark dragons, the Velious continent, and for Veeshan to appear in Plane of Sky now its open.<P>I'm starting to ramble and must get some sleep - cya  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sigh it's no wonder we don't have a whole lot of GM run events and such occuring on this server...  Rodcet's lvl 50 crowd is quite comfortable with acting like 8 year olds (not speaking about all of you, there are still a couple good apples out there among the bad...) I was so disappointed when all the high levelers crowded around Mayong and company and spouted such things as Kill Mayong and doing such emotes as rubbing the DE girl's shoulders... it totally ruined the event for the rest of us.  About 5 minutes into the event I was talking in group with my friend Giliad and I remember saying, "I'm betting it won't take long till some dumb*** figures out that the other 3 are not invulnerable like Mayong and try to attack em."  And yet about 5 minutes later this very thing happened... They all started blasting the wood elf, the Lord, and the DE girl regardless of race or class, just because they wanted items.  I was highly depressed as well that Mayong didn't blast them all away or something hehe (I wanted to see some fireworks).  I admit the harm touches were a good idea but I would have been more open with them if I was Mayong hehe.  Some people really needed em.  I read on EQ vault earlier that when this event occured on another server (forget name) after people refused to stop attacking they were "summoned by the gods" to Tox forest.  Hehehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  After the event was over I saw one of my lvl 50 friends (shall remain nameless)were on and told them of the GM event and the first tell I got back was, "Cool!  What items did they drop?"  Sigh...  <P>After the event I chatted with a guide (lyekka I think is correct..) and told her that I appreciated the GM event and wish they had more... and then said it was less enjoyable because half the crowd wouldn't be quiet.  She kinda agreed with me and we talked a little bit more and she left.  <P>I can't believe our upper lvls of people were as bad as I saw them, but they need serious help hehe.  I was unimpressed as was the rest of my group (most of us were 30's).  Now I don't mind the people roleplaying as that adds drama to the event hehe.  But something needs to be done during the event to stop all the other babble.  I'm sure Giliad will agree with me on some of this hehe.  <P>Now that I've ranted long enough to air out my feelings I guess I'll go play EQ hehe.  Gotta get my MM fix before long  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Dwaveon Mistwalker<BR>Crimson Blades officer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yeah I agree with you totally Dwaveon (that makes a change - heheh). I'm now more awake than when I wrote my first post above, but while I'm no longer a hardcore roleplayer (EQs fault perhaps) it annoys me just how many high levellers are infantile kewl d00dz with nothing better to do all day than hunt the next little toy for their character - even at the expense of a possibly very dramatic sequence scripted by the GMs (but as the atmosphere was ruined I guess we will never know).<P>But Verant are partly to blame - they need to balance the events that move Norrath history along (like Mayong) with the events suitable for multiple participants of many levels (the Halloween event in Qeynos Hills springs to mind - lots of fun for anyone level 1 to 30 - we happily hunted Varsoon whenever he appeared while the lowbies happily wiped out the hordes of L10 skellys - and a good time was had by all).<P>There is so much they could do, for example: Imagine an Ogre/Troll/Dark elf army wandering across West Karana to attack Qeynos - of all levels with fast respawn so everyone at the Qeynos end feels they are holding back an invasion) - and similarly a paladin army launching an assault thru S Ro (another uncrowded zone) on the ogre and troll homelands (so evil races get an invasion to fight off as well). As far as I can see all this would take would be too switch half the spawns in those areas over to guard spawns from the various races (but of vasrying levels with different names - like Verant did with the Qeynos hills skeletons).<P>Well, its an idea.<P>I'll sign off this time - tiredness made me forget last time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Giliad Stormdancer<BR>L37 wood elf druid of Tunare<BR>Guildleader of the Crimson Blades<P>PS that was cruel Marzokk - I like your style - heheh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A few days ago there was a gm event involving werewolves or somthing (second hand info, I had gone to sleep before this).  The sky turned red for a while and these higher level werewolves came out.  Once they were spotted, they were attacked by the 100+ people in the zone.  The whole time, the wolves were begging for a 'cure' or to be cured of thier disease.  They did not attack, or inflict damage on anyone.  They just wanted to be cured (cure poison worked).  Only one person that I know of did it, but by the time she did most of the other wolves were killed.  <P>That was just sad.  To hell with roleplay, see what items they have on them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Its unfortunate but too many high level people are only interested in loot - maybe everyone level 45 or over should automatically become full PvP - that would keep them occupied - heheh. <P>That would have made GM night in Mistmoore quite fun - I wonder if all the dark elves, trolls and ogres would have defended Mistmoore from the hordes of good race players there - nah all of them would have turned on each other - lol  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>Verants game design rewards the "slaughter everything you can" mentality day after day.  Is it any surprise that the most successful players (the level 50's) tend to mindlessly attack at GM events?  They've been trained to  kill for lewt and exp for their entire EQ careers...<P>I would love to see more restraint and role playing, but I'm not surprised.<P>The early GM slaughterfests also are partially to blame for setting a non-rp precedent.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's not just the game design, but it's how they used to implement quests and sometimes still do. They've gotten a lot better about it, but the earlier quests, they'd put some great items on controlled NPCs and get killed before the scene could play out. The corpses would be ninja lootable and whoever right clicked the fastest would get those drops. <BR>It's sad that people are trained like that.<P>The only way that that kinda behavior can be changed is by having more events where rewards are given out *after* the event is done. GMs take notes of the active roleplayers (and I dont mean the idiots who shout a lot with thee and thou and try to tell everyone else what to do in the name of getting noticed), you know, the ones who actually contribute meaningful dialogue and action to an event. <P>Events can be fun if people play along, just they need to learn that playing along is the rewarding part of it.<P>-Donal Rootfinder<BR>Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
