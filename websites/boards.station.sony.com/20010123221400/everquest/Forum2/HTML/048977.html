</FONT><HR>C'mon folks, we were all new at one time.  <P>I remember my very first character was a human warrior who I started in FP.  I got him to level 5, then I walked out to EC, only to be eaten alive by some giant bug!  I wandered my way back out there, got my corpse, then got to one of the inn's along the road.  There I met a rogue who happened to inspect me.  I procceeded to get very angry with me, since he was "looking in my pack, and most likely stealing from me".<P>My next character was monk also started in FP, I leveled him to 6 (I thought I was awesome) so I proceeded to ride the boat towards BB.  I hopped off on sister island, and completely scared and lost, logged off.<P>My other favorite experience was dying in Butcherblock with my high elf magician who was level 7 (I attacked a basalisk) then wandering to Crushbone trying to find the BB zone again.  I had my first LD death there (*sniff*) and this was back in the days when you would continue to walk after you LD'd, so I had no idea where my corpse was.<P><BR>Sal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My first was my Barbarian warrior, and I never started another character till he got up to around 30 or so.  My fondest memories of him were wandering around the ice canyons of Everfrost.  At night I would run back to the guards and sit by the fire because at night, I could not see 2 feet in front of me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I had no idea how to adjust gamma in game.  Even with a torch, the darkness was impenetrable hehe.  <P>Learning to swim was an adventure too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The first time I jumped in the pond to go to the zone, my view got immediately skewed so I was looking straight up.  And as I was looking up at the stars, I slowly sank below the waters.  Panic immediately ensued as I tried to figure out how to claw my way back to the surface.  I took me nearly 20 minutes of climbing trembling back to shore to figure out how to adjust my view and swim to the other side.  <P>The first time I died, I nearly deleted my character.  The thought that I had died upset me so much, I thought I should start over, because I wanted a character that would never die hehe.<P>My two greatest triumphs, even today, are completing the mail quest, and completing the quest for my crafted armor.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
