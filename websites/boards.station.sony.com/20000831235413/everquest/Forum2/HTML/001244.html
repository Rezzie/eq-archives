I know that line of spell's would be a WHOLE lot of fun. and dont say illusions are not what we have in mind for mages. Necros turn into their pet's and get a mana regen from it, and a spell that turns a mage into a type of pet wouldnt even have to give ANY benifits.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Greetings again. I am glad that abashi at least mentioned then possibility of fun spells. But honestly, the bundles you mentioned are not FUN, they are ridiculed as jokes throughout mages everywhere. Many comment that they did not strive to reach level 51 only to gain the ability to ...summon food and water. As for summon beer, it is nice, but would the mages be overpowered if we gained the ability at lev 49?...or lev 39?<P>Im apologize, But perhaps our definition of fun spells differ. Mages want something, anything that doesnt have to have or serve a purpose...and multiple items summonings have been proposed (granted some are not thought out very well and are overpowering..but others have merit).<P>Voice graft is a great fun toy, is there some sort of opposition against giving the elementals a voice? and not class unbalancing.<P>How about if we cannot turn ourselves into elementals..how about turining our elementals into something like us....I would love to see my newest pet, now with the model of a dark elf and the texture map of the fire ele. No additions needed to the global model file, just a bit of rearranging.<P>Things like this are what (I feel) many mages want. Do a search in the old archives (if they still exist) Youll find many great suggestions (many not so great) but they are there. We want eye candy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Thanks again<BR>Czzarre 40th mage of Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Heya Yizz!!<P>Ok, back to the tpoic, ok I like a lot of 4sakens ideas. I think its important to agree that IN power, mages are fine. We dont need any more Damage etc (least in my opinion..leave the post 50 fire pets for another discussion). What the mage class lacks is diversity, it lacks enjoyment beyond killing. reading alot of posters here and talking to a lot in EQ itself, we like to perform. We like to entertain others while waiting for that tank who just died to travel across 3 zones. It would help the enjoyement and perhaps even the roleplay of the class.<P>Thanks<BR>Czzarre 40th mage of prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have been requesting "fun" spells for magicians in game feedback for some time, but no one seems to pay any mind to this.  By name, a magician should be something of a trickster.  Surely there are many possibilities for spells which enhance the magician experience and the experience of those around them without affecting battle.  A spell which turns water to wine would be quite a hit.  What about one that allows elementals to appear as something less generic.  For instance: a fire elemental might be a phoenix, an air elemental might be a dust devil.  Should a magician not be able to produce a rabbit from a hat?  A dove from a sleeve?  Such things would be harmless and yet compelling.  And certainly, one should not have to wait til levl 50+ to perform parlor tricks.  These should be introduced as low-mid level spells.  I have to say that, in general, I love being a magician.  But EQ on the whole needs more substance.  More story, more politics, more dynamism, more fun.  In Meridian 59, you could have presents gift-wrapped to give to others.  You could go to an inn and buy a chessboard and actually play chess with someone.  It's these nuances that make a great game.  And it's nuances like this that would round out the magician.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>K, all those summons are kinda useless.  "Fun" summons are apparently in the Vision to be one of the 50+ spells that are meant to "round out" the class.<P>Instead of a big huge DD spell, or a better pet, or a whatever, can I just ask that we be put on par to another casting class?<P>I understand that Mages are all about our pets, but honestly, in order to use a pet properly, 1/2 the time you need to summon your pet strategically and unsummon your pet in a dungeon because of how pathing works.  If you ever jump off a ledge to get to a lower level of a dungeon, you need to unsummon your pet so it doesn't path down weirdly and train you.  Instead of making the pet smarter, just give Mages 1 of 2 things:<P>A) A skin type spell akin to Wizards, Enchanters or necromancers.<P>B) A root or snare type spell.<P>Responses to this?<P>A) No Skin type spells, you get the phantom armor line!  Well, this line is fairly useless.  Sure it gives you a higher AC so monsters will hit you for less damage when they hit, and sure it now gives you a regen component, but that doesn nothing to change the fact that Wizards, enchanters and necros have a few free hits on their way out of the zone.  Let's face it, if you're getting beat on by mobs at higher levels, you're pretty much dead.<P>B) Your Earth Pet can root for you.  Well, duh.  However, the root is a proc effect, not completely reliable (Pet doesn't root on command and pet is lower level than you the caster, so it might not even hold in the first place when fighting a yellow or red or even a blue - blue to you is possibly yellow/red to the pet).  Furthermore, the pet has to be summoned and in situations where bad pathing disallows you from summoning a pet, if you need to root something, oh well?  That well, sucks.<P>If you have to say tough luck about the root line, why don't you just allow us to summon an item that has a charge or two of root?  What class is that really going to infringe upon?  Paladins who have root, or clerics, or rangers, or druids, or wizards, or enchanters, or necromancers or shamans?  And if having root infringes upon those classes, and Mages are supposed to rely on their pets, why bother with pets for necromancers, enchanters, and shamans?<P>Furthermore, all I see for root and a skin series for mages is "rounding out" the class.  If the spells have to be 50+ for it, then fine, make 'em that high.  I can't tell you how many times, being a mage I'm envious of all those other class's 1 simple spell: root.<P>Fletop<BR>Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Someone above mistyped the "Summon Beer" spell as "Summon Bear" which got me all excited for a moment..<P>How about a "Summon Creature" spell that would summon a random level 1 - 3 animal, under the mage's control like a pet. The spell would not work if you had a pet summoned, obviously, and would only summon common, non-magical animals from within the zone you were in. As it would be a pet, obviously you couldn't kill and loot it, so no free bat wings etc.<P>In combination with Voice Graft (yes we need that) Mages could then control and talk through small animals, which would be pretty much useless but potentially highly entertaining. Give the spell at around 12th or 16th level and you have a pure fun spell with no possible "levelling" application.<P>You could even extend it to summoning low-level NPC types like Gnoll Pups and Young Halflings, though you could be encroaching on enchanter territory a bit there...<P>If you could add the oft-requested pet command /pet dance you'd have fun for evermore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I just came up with an idea that would not in /any/ way shift power balance, but make it extremely fun to play a Magician. How about a spell that, when cast, prompts a screen like Resurrection. You're allowed to pick a race for your elemental. The elemental is the shape of that race, but still has the elemental texture. Wouldn't be too hard to implement, I think. An ogre with the earth elemental skin, a troll with air elemental...You could have some crazy pets! Another I was thinking, was to be able to actually CONTROL the pet. You can talk through it, you can turn on auto-attack and fight as it, you can see through it's eyes, etc. Skills and spells are disabled though while in pet mode, and you just click the spell icon (It'll look like a buff is on you) to end it. This may make them a little more powerful, but I'll leave that up to you to decide. Change it however you like. I just thought that those 2 would be immensely fun for magicians. Especially number one. You could make it maybe a level 12-20 spell, and the 2nd would me more of a 20-49 spell (Given it's uses).<P>Ramgan Corpsedancer<BR>Troll Shadowknight who haved 22 burfdays.<BR>The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Now HERE is a fun idea. Summon crystal ball. Come up with some secret info the game would be able to supply, and give it to the mage. For example, if you target a mob and use the crystal ball, it tells you what loot the mob has... maybe make the spell have an expensive reagent for balance and to keep it from being often used. Or some other prediction.<P>4. Summon x-ray vision item. Lets you see alll chars as they would look without any clothing (still with the basic clothing they have when not wearing armor of course). Would be hilarious to walk around in a high level dungeon with everyone looking like newbie, and some fun roleplaying too,<BR>not to mention screenshots. This is far less risque than many things already in the game. After all if we can see invis, why not see through items?<P>/end humor<P>We won't get the fun summon food item/summon various drink spells and shouldn't because they would undermine the already minimally-supported trade skills. Why become a cook when a mage can summon the food items?<P>Bind sight is a fun spell! But it doesn't make sense for mages, who don't get spells along that line, we summon.<P>We won't get illusion: elemental, because we are not about how we look, enchanters are. Just because we can summon a great elemental doesn't mean we can change our appearance. And this would step on Enchanter's toes.<P>The ideas here should:<P>1. Tie into summoning somehow<P>2. Not add power in combat or economics (e.g., one fun but impractical idea is summon fool's gold - looks like money to other players but disappears when they log out hehe).<P>3. Not step on other classes' toes.<P>If Verant wanted to make mages really happy, they would come up with some new pets like the "mist" or "mud" pets with some special ability, combining some of the other pets' abilities too:<P>mist: air/water<BR>mud: earth/water<BR>dust: air/earth<BR>Ash: fire/earth<BR>Smoke: fire/air<BR>lava: fire/water<P>Just some ideas.

</FONT><HR>By the way, as a high level magician who can cast bristlebane's bundle if I had the spell - it's a great idea for a fun spell, but should be level4 or 8 IMO. Enchanter's get their fun spell at level 1, minor illusion! BTW why don't they make an enc spell major illution, look like a nearby NPC...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well, i still think the illusions is a good idea druids arent a class to change form but they get wolf form ).  I do like some of these other ideas thou, bind sight and voice graft would be a nifty addition and i LOVE the summon pet idea, that would clearly help us mages with pathing problems, just have your pet sit in a safe spot and summon it when you need it )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001244-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001244-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001244-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001244-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=001244&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=001244&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
