</FONT><HR>We apologize for the previous Shaman thread going corrupt, Alan was still able to read a great deal of your input before it disappeared... so we will try to continue the discussion here, sorry for the inconvenience... ~Akriss <P><BR>You can read the previous discussion here:http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042820.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045780.html<P>Author Topic: Shaman Talk… <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 12-20-2000 02:37 PM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Hi everyone,<BR>I've taken a bunch of topics out of various posts and cobbled together this monster. I ended up not getting the names of the original posters, I hope you can forgive me if I don't attribute your posts or your ideas. I guess I'm more interested in addressing the ideas than giving credit…<P>First, some news about a few things:<P>1) Despite what I previously wrote about our satisfaction with the 55th level pet spell, we are still looking at it. I'm not promising any changes. But the debate continues…<P>2) The Rage Line: All the spells in the line should be working along the same lines as Rage now. But we did find an error. Fury was (is) giving a dex debuff instead of a dex buff. That should be fixed with our next patch (though there is no date set for a patch yet). There were some stacking issues to consider. We've looked them over, and they are working the way they should work. So, yes, it does overwrite some stat buffs and not others. That's the way it's going to stay. Changing anything about the way they stack would undoubtedly cause other stacking issues, and nobody wants that. <P>Ok, on to the various post snips. Keep in mind that this is sort of a first run through. You're getting my ideas and comments here, not company policy. I'm trying to get my ducks in a row so that I can present cogent ideas to the team.<P>&gt;"Icons for group disease and poison buff - when applied, the icon appears exactly the same as if you are poisoned or diseased, would it be possible to tint the icons blue so people know its a buff and not a dot. This also applies for the druid group resist fire and cold."<P>Actually, I think a lot of icons probably need to be redone. It's something that I really would like to see get a revamp. But, really, this isn't a Shaman thing, it's something that everyone would probably like. I'm not ignoring this idea, just moving it off this thread and into my want list.<P>&gt;"Alchemy - 2 things<P>1) NPC merchants will only buy back potions for between 9 gold and 2 plat, regardless of the cost to make the potion. Could this be made more in line with jewlry, maybe were merchants can buy back potions for 80 - 90% of the cost. Currently, the cost of practicing is enormious with no chance of profit in the end. I spent 2500 pp to practice the other day, and went from a skill of 50 to 90, to practice above this level will cost between 15pp - 200pp per attempt."<P>I'll ask into it. But keep in mind that trade skills are designed to only be profitable when items are sold to players. But if the return isn't at least reasonable when selling to vendors, I'll see if I can find out why.<P>&gt;"2) Currently only SOW potions have any demand at all, and occasionaly gate potions if people can afford them (cheaper to pay a druid or wizard). Could new gate potions be added to the new expansions zones?"<P>I'll look into it. But my first thought is that Velious is designed to be hard to get to, so that's unlikely. And, well, it might not be the intent of Alchemy to reduce the need to have a wizard or druid to zap you around the globe.<P>&gt;"Torpor – Doesn’t stack with chloroplast/regrowth, spirit of wolf, Turgur’s Insects, Ignite Blood, Plague, Celestial Elixer. None of these cases make sense except for SoW. We are not asking for Torpor to cancel DOTs, just stack with them, as well as CE and regen. In addition this spell hardly compares to other class Lvl 60 spells, with only 1200 hp total heal and all the negative effects, feel free to make it useful."<P>Well, stacking regens is always going to be very limited. And it makes some sense to me that you can't go into torpor while under a DoT. It's a lot of healing for little mana. It greatly reduces downtime. Personally, I think it's fine as is. But feel free to try to convince me otherwise.<P>&gt;"Avatar – Does not stack with Focus of Spirit and Wolf Form. Even if you want to make some of the components (str for example) not stack please make the overall buff and non-redundant parts of these stack. This is not the main problem however, which is that for 325 mana, a 1 minute duration and a 3 minute recast, with quite questionable benefits (for example this is not anywhere near what 70% haste spells do), shamans do not use this spell at all."<P>Again, it seems like a great spell to me. Perhaps others can wade in here and explain to me why this isn't a good spell. Keep in mind that stacking is a very complicated issue.<P>&gt;"Talisman of the Serpent – Most shamans consider this spell nothing less than an insult. Please just remove it. If you are feeling generous replace it with something a little more useful, a group Talisman of Kragg would be OK."<P>Not all spells will be 'A' list spells. There's no real reason to remove this spell. Heck, if you're playing with a lot of bards…<P>&gt;"Stacking of Curse of Spirits, effect on epic weapon Spear of Fate- Splurt, Choke, Ignite Blood all overwrite it. It does not take on someone with Skin Like Nature series buff on. These are all obviously oversights on your part please correct."<P>I'll look into it and see if these are, in fact, oversights or if they are as intended. It's not so obvious to me…<P>&gt;"Tigir’s Insects – Range of the area effect is pretty darned small. As this spell is so rare most shamans don’t have it yet to complain about this, but they will."<P>Well, there are a fair number of spells with a very small area of effect. It takes a bit of skill to land on a lot of targets, but it can be done. Keep in mind that monsters don’t have much, er… volume, so they can be stacked very close together. This doesn't seem like something that needs to be changed.<P>&gt;"It's pretty obvious from the original spell listing that shamans were designed as a generalist priest class with the following features: <BR>1. Buffs far beyond any other class<BR>2. Debuffing abilities somewhat better than an enchanter.<BR>3. Second-tier healing. Similar to druids in straight heals, with regeneration spells to help.<BR>4. Strong, but limited (only two) Damage over Time lines.<BR>5. Use of a second-tier pet at higher level<BR>6. Slightly better melee skills than the other priests. <BR>Sound about right?"<P>Sounds right to me, for the most part. I have a disagreement with point #2, but I'll get to that in a second.<P>&gt;"On the face, it sounds like a good plan. The realities of play at level 50 had some interesting effects: <BR>1. Stats were never implemented in a manner to make stat buffs overly useful. The ratio of their effect to mana expendature make them iffy to use in a lot of circumstances. The lines of buffs that did really matter (AC, HP, melee speed) were done better by clerics, and about equivalently to enchanters."<P>And later you mentioned something about buffs not being mana efficient either. Honestly, mana efficiency isn't the end-all and be-all of determining the value of a class. It's a consideration, but it's not the only thing that matters. The ability to do something that is useful might fully overpower the idea that you can't do it efficiently. Tell me if I'm wrong here, but shaman do have the most efficient buffs (with perhaps the noted exception of AC and HP by clerics and attack speed by enchanters). You must be comparing efficiently, I guess, to just blasting things. Keep in mind, though, that blasting things may not always be an option. Buffing the melee types in some cases might be more efficient.<P>But I'm willing to accept your comments as they are, even if I might not believe in them as strongly as you do.<P>&gt;"2. This worked pretty much as planned. Enchanters did most of our abilities at a slightly lower level, and mages could do resist debuffing at a lower level of effectiveness."<P>Actually, I had always thought that enchanters were supposed to be the masters of debuffing. For me, the current setup seems just right on this account.<P>&gt;"3. Worked as planned.<BR>4. Worked as planned, but got hit by a nerf aimed to stop kiting, which was never our forte anyway."<P>Good enough.<P>&gt;"5. Went okay here. The only real problem was our pet got hit by some changes aimed at reigning in the power of the pets that WERE problematic, namely necro and mage pets."<P>Goodness, pets again! <P>But, essentially, pets for shaman work as intended, right? They add a bit of damage and tanking, and they look cool.<P>&gt;"6. True, but largely irrelevant since at higher levels, necessity really dictates the higher efficiency of medding over melee in most situations, and we were never close in combat effectiveness anyway."<P>But not at all irrelevant to those in the level to use it. The ability for a shaman to melee pretty well makes the earlier levels a fairly easy go for them. Again, I think this works out well enough.<P>&gt;"So we got hit by a couple nerfs aimed at others, and the "king of buffs" title was both misleading and largely useless, but all in all, it was a good class. What happened with Kunark? Well, look at the spell list as a whole: <P>1. We got a TON of buffs. All 5 stats get a bigger version AND all 5 get group versions. About a third of the RoK spell list is buffs."<P>I gather you disagree with the continuance of buffs as the main focus of shaman. I think I understand this, and I'll bring it to the team. Don't, however, expect a revamp of all the spells post 50. It's not very likely that we'll be suddenly changing all buffs to DD spells or something wild like that. As you stated, up to 50 shamans are pretty darn great. I'm of the opinion that buffs are part of that greatness. But I think I see what you're getting at.<P>&gt;"2. Nice slow upgrade at 51, with still a slim lead over enchanters, but the Mage Mala line is much closer to our Malo than previously. In fact, from 51 to 59, mages have the same single-target debuff spell as shamans."<P>I guess this means that you're ok with the progression, and just upset that magicians have gained that type of spell. I'm not a big fan of the spreading of abilities over classes either.<P>&gt;"3. Worked okay. We got superior heal finally, as well as Regrowth and Torpor (once in its current version) to help. Fizzle rates are insane on superior heal, but the design idea was right."<P>All 'secondary' powerful spells like that have a bit more fizzle to them. You're not alone in that. And it is, frankly, just another drawback to the spell. Personally, I'm not sure that shaman should have superior healing… it's not unlike giving mages Malosi…<P>&gt;"4. Necros get our prized #1 DoT spell (Envenomed Bolt) at 51, then several upgrades. Druids get two DoT upgrades by 54. Shamans don't get their DoT updates -- and somewhat disappointing ones -- at 56 and 59!"<P>Confusion! You don't get he upgrades at all, or you're disappointed with them…<P>I looked it up. They seem to be there. In fact, here's what Everlore says about Pox of Bertoxxulous:<P>"This is believed to be the best DoT in game. It is the last Shaman DoT, doing close to 2100 damage."<P>Not that I hold everything on spoiler sites to be the gospel truth… <P>Please, give me some detail as to why these upgrades are disappointing.<P>&gt;"5. The pet upgrade is only minimally better than the 49 pet while hitting a HUGE cost increase. Our second-tier pet actually becomes third-tier as by level 60, Shadowknights have better pets."<P>I know… I know. We're still looking into this one.<P>&gt;"Now, as I mentioned, at 50 shamans were a pretty strong class, and it's probably true that a slight cut in overall power relative to the other classes wasn't out of line. But virtually every defining factor of the class was given a terribly minor update, save one. And, in a lot of cases, we were matched or surpassed by other classes in areas we'd been the specialists in."<P>I disagree with the minor update thing. And, well, if you agree that shaman were perhaps on the top few rungs at 50, then how else would you suggest we upgrade them?<P>&gt;"The one that takes up over a third of our spell list: buffs. <BR>It's really puzzling. One gets the feeling that the live team doesn't really quite grasp the role of the shaman in high level play, and although they think they're giving us key improvements in our major areas, we see them as near-worthless toss-ins that add to the pile of low-value spells that take the place that more interesting or useful spells could go. What's more, impinging on our REAL defining abilities by other classes is okay because they're not viewed by the design team as being shaman core abilities."<P>It seems that it's worthwhile to have a talk about stat buffs in house. But, well, I'm not convinced that they rate as… how did you put it… near-worthless. As for giving out core abilities to other classes, well, I don't like that either. It's always a fine line, though, between making classes playable and keeping things distinct for them as well. This is something that I also want to bring up to the team.<P>&gt;"A prime example of this would be the abilities of the class breastplates. In Kunark, the shaman BP casts a damage shield. This is really puzzling since apart from alchemy, we don't have damage shields, and the damage from it (5 points) is tiny... the real effect is the AC buff it provides. In Velious, the shaman BP casts a stamina buff. While not totally useless, it's hardly what we'd expect, when comparing our effects to say that of clerics (who get Complete Heal and Celestial Elixir)."<P>I don't want to make this into an item discussion… I really think those sorts of things are best served in a different thread. But I'll mention this to the team as well.<P>&gt;"I'm not talking about the strength of the spells. It's that the clerics (and other casting classes) seem to be getting spells that are central to their function in game -- primary healing. Whereas an ac buff+damage shield and stamina buff seem to say a shaman's primary function is to buff. When it's not true at all -- our primary function is generally to DEBUFF. More appropriate spells would be things like Turgur's Insects, Malosi, or Cripple."<P>Well, this seems to be where you and I depart philosophy. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. The damage shield obviously isn't part of your core function as a shaman. But buffing really is. Debuffing is a secondary thing. But, as I've said, I'll talk this over with the team. Contrary to popular belief, we do have people that play shaman on the team…<P>&gt;"I think this is the primary obstacle between the designers and players -- as far as the players are concerned, shamans just aren't there to buff. We may do it, but it's not why we're needed in the high level game, and it's not our major contribution to the group. With the game mechanics as they are, this is not likely to change. What DOES need re-evaluating is the priority that function is given when designing shaman spell lists and assigning appropriate effects to class-specific items."<P>Again, perhaps… Buffing is certainly something that is a primary focus at lower levels. Obviously, as you've stated, you think that focus changes post 50. And, again, I'll talk to the team about it.<P>Wow. I'm sorry this thing ran so long. I'm just probing for ideas and clarifications, and letting you know where I stand and what I think. Feel free to try to change my mind. It doesn't really seem that, reading over all the threads, there is all that much that you're unhappy with. I guess I'm a bit shocked to see so many posts about shamans lately…<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(cross posted from my own thread)<P>Absor I've been thinking about the problems with epic defense and tanking for melees. The issues with giving more skill points to hybrids or not to make them viable in their traditional roles and front line fighters.<P>What I think is that your developers are running out of dynamic range in the parameters that they are using to balance these classes, skills in defense, parry, dodge, block and riposte. These are all damage avoidance skills and are the only variables that really prove effective against uber 1000 damage per hit npcs.<P>Verant does have more room in dodge than the other skills and I think rangers should get much<BR>higher dodge for example.<P>Now on to the point of this being a shaman issue. Two things that are being overlooked in the balancing act are the physical stats: strength, agility, stamina and dexterity. We all know that these are almost nonfacters currently for combat purposes. Being much stonger doesn't help you to hit or hit much harder for example.<P>I propose that Verant improve the effect of these stats on combat performance by 10 to 20% depending on the stat. Log parsing has shown that most stats offer little to no measurable improvement above the 3 to 5% error tolerance for the sample. <P>The main stat I think should be is AGILITY because it does improve damage avoidance and mitigation in some small measure. By enchancing agility's effects by 20% this empowers more melee classes to have more defense. Adding more room for balance and more interesting variables to achieve it by the players.<P>Increasing stat effects also returns much balance to the shaman class. It was a terrible blow for shaman (and jewelers) when the players learned how little stats (and hence race) matter in EQ. A poor choice by Verant, but one you really SHOULD reconsider at this point in game balancing.<P>Increasing stat effectiveness creates more room for balance, more room for diversity, more room for equipment choices. Verant doesn't have to spend $$$ on more content. Just making stats measurably effective and worthwhile instantly makes alot of existing equipment and spells valued and used. Instantly more content for the players.<P>I propose that these stats be improved:<P>Strength - 10% more effective<BR>Stamina - 15% more effective<BR>Agility - 25% more effective<BR>Dexterity - 10% more effective<P>At the highest levels, hitpoints and defense need to scale up alot more to match the abilities of players versus npcs. Agility and stamina do it, but not enough. A wood elf warrior doesn't get missed enough and an ogre warrior doesn't have enough extra health.<P>Shaman's array of currently useless stat buffs would become valuable and desired. Instantly giving them dozens of "new" spells that are wanted and balanced.<P>Verant you have more variables to play with in balancing the game than you seem to realize. Quit beating your head against the equipment and skills wall. ENABLE your stats to work for you as well and your players will rejoice!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Shaman should be able to heal better than druid~"<P>... as long as druids continue to out-damage shaman. And yes, druids do.<P>I also DO NOT WANT to heal nearly as well as a cleric.<P>Give druid and shaman the same choice you made hybrids take. They get offensive or defensive, but not a heavy dosage of both.<P>I would rather be defensive as a shaman, for both self and others. That fits my role.<P>On that note, I'm tired of the nearly unresistable DoTs *cough*winged death/splurt*cough*. Nullify magic doesn't cut it for shaman, since shaman have so many buffs running at one time, and it gets very hard to leave room at the top when refreshing 10+ buffs.<P>I have always stood by my stance that shaman needs a cure for DoTs, regardless of what type of DoT it is. A spell that only removes harmful magic effects would cover this entirely, since we already have major poison and disease cures. Why do you give us 20 buffs, and only the useless cancel magic series to use?<P>That doesn't make sense. We need a way to remove harmful magic effects, and only harmful effects.<P>Whatever abolish doesn't remove, this new type of dispel should. I see this as the only option to allowing the continued survival of the shaman class in PvP.<P>Another gripe, is that all buffs cast by others should be removable by click. Well meaning people often cause me a fair amount of grief when they cast spells on me that I can not overwrite. When not grouped, I have 15 buffs running at all times, due to the way buffs work in PvP. Two or three buffs by others cast in the wrong slots (i.e not the first eight or so) puts some of my needed buffs in jeopardy of being nullified.<P>I really should be able to remove any beneficial buff that is cast on myself.<P>Either that, or do what you should have done in the first place: allow harmful effects to have their own stacking area, completely separate of the data space used by beneficial buffs.<P>Now if PvP doesn't count, then I don't count, and I can't continue to be a customer since I no longer play EverQuest on any other server.<P>Krenk Feen<BR>51st lvl Troll Shaman<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here is the second try on this post. First one got lost at the end of the last shaman talk 5. This is nothing new, more a refinement of ideas for adding side effects to stat buffs. First, as has been proposed before each stat buff would have an additional bonus effects. There is a minimum stat level for each bonus to take effect. For instance if the minimum for str is 150 and you have a 180 str. 30 points of str will count towards the bonus. The actual bonuses could be as follows:<P>Str - added percentage damage to *each* hit. We use percentage as opposed to a fixed value to avoid giving an advantage to smaller faster weapons.<P>Agi - added precent chance to dodge. This should be significant at higher levels. <P>Dex - added percent chance to hit or alternatively an increase in attack speed.<P>Sta - added percent to all resists. <P>These bonus values would only apply when a shaman buff is in effect. For instance a Ogre warrior with a natural str of 200 would not get the bonus. However an Ogre warrior with a natural str of 160 plus a 40 point shaman str buff would.<P>The minimum values for these stats could be set high enough so that they would only be effective when cast on melee classes, or the bonus effect could even be limited so that it *only* works on melee classes. This also gives a melee character the choice of specializing in offence or defense by choosing to concentrate on raising one stat. He would then know, once he gets a shaman buff to trigger the bonus, he would be really good in one area.<P>This would make stats more meaningful without unbalancing the game, since it woudn't change the way stats work under normal circumstances. As you can see this would be something that would get shaman into groups, without giving them more soloing power. Stat buffs after all are supposed to be our forte. This would really make them so.<P>Finally Verant would not have to add a single spell to make this work.<P>Absor can you at least reply that you have read this post. If I know you have read it and still don't like it, I'm OK with that. But I would like to know that you saw it.

</FONT><HR>Rarely check these boards because honestly seems people have to much time to post SO MANY topics, but having been a shaman for over 18 months I figured it was time to see if you guys would fix something instead of taking away or giving to other classes.<P>1&gt; Fix the shaman epic effect in regards to necromancer splurt over writing or chanter/sk/necro dots blocking. Very irritating having to slow then cast our epic's curse and get the spell did not take hold message. And then having to explain to group members why they need to either wait or not cast certain spells. I find it hard to believe that this is working as intended when even a low level spell can block our epic weapons effect. It is supposed to be the end all be all of weapons for a shaman.<P>2&gt; Buffs in my opinion aren't that bad with the exception of mana costs when considering a full group. 2 heavy tanks and casting kragg/str/dex/agi/stam and a shaman is at 20% mana. Our Talisman line over writes intell classes self only shield yet cleric health buffs stack fine. Why is that? Druid buffs stack with shaman buffs yet not with cleric buffs. Why is that? Shaman level 56? strength buff is not an improvement over level 49 strength buff with the exception of 10-15 minutes longer duration. Yet all the other 50+ buffs are major improvements stat wise.<P>3&gt; Comparison to chanters concerning debuffs is unfair. Our slow is only slightly better and cripple line is the same. They have an unresistable magic debuff. We have a really cool unresistable debuff! To the disease line. wow, And the aggro from casting this spell at any time puts the aggro from tash line to shame. <P>4&gt; Hand down speed buffs from the chanter class yet we are supposedly Battle shaman. Level 56 acumen spell basically useless when a epic wielding chanter is in group or on raid. <P>5&gt; Cann series versus any other classes mana regen line is, to be blunt, sickening. Stand cann sit stand cann sit. Please check the ratio on Cann 2 and Cann 3 and up the mana regen slightly instead of the 2 to 1 it stays. It makes no sense to call something an "upgrade" when you simply lose more health for a tiny bit more mana. I still use cann 1 because in the long run it is more mana efficient.<P>6&gt; Please check drop rates on "SHAMAN" 56+ spells versus other classes 56+ spells. It seems to be much lower versus other classes and I am sure other caster classes drops are lower also.<P>I could go on quite a bit but I'll see if any of this is looked at/fixed anytime in the near future. Have gotten to the point of finding other classes in game to play or even finding my enjoyment else where due to the issues concerning the Shaman class.<P>Boobash<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I personally dont mind being 3rd on healing at all, so long as they improve other areas that would make up for this.<P>Improve our buffs, particulary stat buffs, but also AC, HP, and haste buffs.  This is afterall the thing I started playing a shaman for, and found that clerics, enchanters, and even druids can buff as well or better than we can.  If this is fixed, we will be 2nd to the cleric in our ability to keep a party going well.  We will not have the healing of a druid, but people will do more damage faster, and take less.  This equils less need for the healing.  Hook us up with a cleric, can you say awsome for a group, druids would be better healers, but we would be better for the group.<P>This all asumes they make a Str buff add as much additional damage as a haste buff for the mana needed to cast the spell, and an agility buff aviod as much damage as the haste buff can add, and a stamina buff make stamina regenerate faster, HP regenerate faster, and gives HP buff which stacks with all other regen, stamina restore, and HP buff spells.  Dex can decresee fizzle, increase hit percentage, increase movement rate, and increase proc rates on weapons and be stackable with sow and haste type spells.  Charisma can allow for better regeneration of mana (as Charisma reflects both the inner and outer person) and still have the variable on prices.<P>If these all became effective buffs comparable to those of other classes we would be the king of buffs, and healing would not be required as much when we are in the group.<P>Clerics and Druids would love us becuase they can do more than heal, they can stun, do some damage and have more fun.<P>Int casters would love us for dex, and cha buffs.  (based on changes proposed less fizzle on spell casting, and more mana regen)<P>Tanks of all forms would love us for dex, str, agi, and sta.  More HP, more HP regen, be hit less, hit more often, hit faster, and hit harder, as well as proc there weapons more often.<P>Is not this what our buffs should do?  It seems to me that it is indeed what they should do, and if they did we would not need the druids greater healing.  We would heal, and keep a party going but in a different way.  This would make us desired as we are not just a lesser cleric when one is not around.  We are different, and I for one wish to maintain that difference.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing a shaman class since Dec. 99<P>From what I have seen from all the boards I have visited is that shaman buffs are nearly worthless.<BR>It would be nice if they actually had a noticable effect. As it is, there really is no point of waiting until 49th to get your strength buff you have been waiting for as the 39th one or even the 29th Strength buff will give you the same numbers.. Or so it seems. There just isnt that noticeable a difference between them.<P>That goes the same with all the "physical" stat buffs. There just isnt a difference between them.<BR>Granted, You dont want to make it overpowered but when you have trudged through the game until 50th you would like to feel a sense of accomplishment that comes from being a high level.<P>If our buffs stay as is there really is no point in them but to give a placebo effect on the target. Now I do not want to pay a monthly fee to give things that just seem to make a difference. I would rather MAKE a difference from what have cast on the target. I realize sometimes that tanks or whomever I give these buffs to appreciate the fact but really, There has been no hard evidence that these do ANYTHING! Other than make the tank feel good. Now I like my tanks feeling good about themselves but I would rather have a tank feel good about him/herself PLUS give them the bonus of the spells. I chose this class to try and make a difference in the dynamic of grouping. What I have found is I slow things and that is basically it. My buffs are basically on the top so if whatever thing we are fighting dispells them they are the first to go. This does not seem right to me. They should be missed when they are dispelled instead of just a shield for the "Important" spells.. IE, HP, AC, Speed buffs.<P>From what I have heard is,we are supposed to be the Kings of buffing physical stats, not to just fill your buff space with icons so they are the first ones to dispell. Make them important.<P>Thank you for your time, And I do think you have created a marvel.

After all, that is the ENTIRE function of the spell. to reduce the magic and other resistances of a creature, so the fact that it is resistable in itself seems strange.<P>Making the malo line of shamans irresistable from day one does not make it overpowering.. but would make the spell much more viable on epic raids.<P>On normal monsters in kunark, and velious, I do not even USE the spell, and still probably wouldnt, due to the fact that we can land our spells in fairly good order (tugurs etc) without requiring the use of malo. which is fairly expensive to cast.<P>BUT on epic raids, or on higher resistant monsters, this would give the shaman an edge... going from strictly a "buffer" to a front liner in a battle.<P>Yes, i realize the spell malo is irresistable, but it is a level 60 spell, and I know in my guild we have 1 level 60 shaman. (i am getting closer every day) but alot of times on a raid we only have 2 shamans online at any time that are between 54-56.  On a raid, they would jump headlong into the fight, and die happily if they knew they could get a malosini in or something.<P>I would agree, that perhaps increasing the COST of the spell and perhaps putting a recast time on it of 5 seconds or so would be acceptable.<BR>****<P>Tugurs... for epic mobs, total understandable that it is resist.  I dont even bother casting it on a major epic mob.... THAT would be overpowering.<P>****<P>Direct Damage line of spells on epic mobs.<P>Look into the resistance of these spells, and please fix.  we already have to eat a HUGE long cast time... and the cost of the spell to cast is not cheap.  But we should be able to use these spells in order to apply some amount of damage on these monsters.<P>Again, this post is about EPIC encounters. ... ie) Trakanon, Wuoshi, Sev, and high level boss mobs in kunark and velious.<P>I was impressed that I got in a "cripple" spell on wuoshi today tho.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>**<P>High level mobs resisting our Dots.  for instance... Wuoshi is a Poison dragon, huge resist to poison, if not immune. thats great... but we cannot cast our disease line on him (her)?<P>Krellar Bloodfang<BR>58 shaman<BR>7th Hammer<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>It would be nice at least to make our group stat buffs comparable to the highest end.  It's silly giving a group a strength buff that's subpar to the level 49 str.  These are high end 50's spells mind you!<P>I'd also like to know why druids get so many more group friendly buffs.   Be nice to group choloro/regrowth, endure breath, invis and so on.<P>I'm still bedazzled about druids getting a superior healing upgrade.  I doubt it'll have side effects like our Torpor.   You have to understand, shamans ARE the healing class for their race.   Wood elves can't be clerics but they share the same zone with high elves that can be.  Halflings can be druids and clerics.  Half elves start in cities with players that can be.  And of course humans can be both druid or cleric.  I mean how can the Iksar survived this long in the world with their healers only to be able to cast Superior Healing?  <P>I in no way believe to take over a cleric's position.  I'd rather have one in my group and slow attack mobs/debuff.  But there's many times when a cleric just isn't available or in a large dungeon raid where you have to play the role of healer in the group.   Makes it frustrating for people to die because of lackluster healing.<BR>Shamans are also considered the "wiseman" of the tribe, however we can't identify items.  Seems funny we don't have that ability. <P>An improved version of Turgur's would be nice.  Having a single target version from waaaay back in level 51 seems it should have a higher version.<P>I understand the whole stacking concept of druid skin series, cleric symbol and talisman.   But don't see the reason why it should override pure caster self buffs.  And now with the cleric self buff, Talisman won't stack with that.  So now Talisman is playing a smaller and smaller role.<P>It's apalling with Curse of Spirit (Spear of Fate dot) having such a difficult time.  For an EPIC effect it sure has limited power.  Necro spells and various spell effects just won't allow our spear effect to take hold.   <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes the first one got deleted but its now back up on the board ....<P>I would like to know what was the thought on RELIGIOUS JEWELRY and Troll Shamans? <BR>Sapphire Int-Dex-Str Innoruuk why no Wis? Is it only for Necros and Sk? <P>Here again we see the Troll Shamans get the short end of the stick.<P>Come on what is up with this ? Dont we get any cool stuff? We did not get the Race armor and now the Religious Jewelry as well? <P>I also checked in to it for Cazic followers and of couse the Troll shamans of Cazic also have no wis bouse to the Religious Jewelry as well. I looked for the barbarians but did find jade (ac hp is not bad though )not the ivory jeweler(I dont care the barbarians get the best equipment anyway compared to Trolls) for them.<P>Is there going to be any Race armor for Trolls? Religious Jewerly for Innoruuk shaman Trolls? the ring could have just as well been Wis not Int base most of Innoruuks Followers are Troll/shamans DE/clerics all wis base .. the SK dont have to be followers of Innoruuk ( trolls anyway not sure of the DE SK ) If Wis is used instand of Int for skill progression for Wis base char's. ( witch I think is still not working right ) It would have been better for the Innoruuk to be wis base not int base. <P>Race armor for Trolls? I have not seen anything for it in Grobb and have not seen anything for it anywhere on any boards. Ogres hate the trolls anyway why do we want them to make are armor for us? <P>Is it true are epic weapon dot does not stack with anything? or does it overwrite spells or is it overwriten? Why ? Can we change are weapon again? Let it port us to set loc so we can have to bond spots? something like a tel port? <P>Help our shaman travel in style  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>52nd Level Troll Shaman on E Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I thought I would post up on the rain based spells since this is a shaman and more issue.  The AE Rain spells should not hit pets like already requested.  This should also effect all targets in the AE, maybe limiting it to 4 targets like it is basically now.  <P>The way it works now is if there are 4+ mobs in the AE, the AE Rain spell will only hit 4 mobs for one wave.  If there are 3 mobs, it will hit 3 mobs the first wave and one mob the second wave.  2 mobs would get hit for 2 waves and that is it.  1 mob will get hit by all 3 waves.<P>The way it should work is if there are 4+ mobs in the ae, then it hits 4 mobs for 3 waves.  If there are 3 mobs there, it should hit 3 mobs for 3 waves.  2 mobs there should get hit for 3 waves.  1 mob there should get hit by 3 waves.<P>Pets should not be included in the mob count and be hit by this.  The caster should still be able to be hit by the waves if he/she is standing in the ae as well and be counted as one mob.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/ooc<P>I have one question...<P>If shamans are ment to be the most melee based **wisdom caster** why is out bash capped at skill 1. If in fact Shamans were ment to be the best melee of the cleric/shaman/druid, then why must we be restricted to the skill of one.<P>I enjoy using the buffs I have been given to fight (rage line). But I am hampered by our low melee skills. Just a simple thing, increase our general melee skills and more importantly in bash, so then we can at least have a chance of interupting casters.<P>And with the one question, two demands... FIX the bloody 55th level pet, it sucks and frankly **IS** an insult, and secondly, change our charm animal spell so it can either charm higher critters, or give us a NEW one at level 49 !!<P>Thankyou for your time !<P>Regards<BR>Ezmarela<BR>56th Shaman of Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That's cause bash always comes with the barb, ogre, and troll class.  IT's just a skill that's already in the class.  Like rogue barbs have the bash skill cause it's with them.  Iksars don't get it but however have the forage skill to take the place of bash.  Personally, bash is a great thing to have anyways for trolls/ogres/barb cause even if they wield a two handed weapon they can still do it.  It's a great way to interrupt casters, and is not really meant for doing tons of dmg.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I hear it all the time , the reason iksar cant wear it is because its plate. well for every one who says that look at the ac on it. It has the ac of chain and not PLATE. I see the reason in making armor that only one class can wear but to make a kick ass armor that lets all the racesbut one wear it. now tell me how fair is this? Soem players say go for your plane armor or SOV armor. LOL look at the stats the JB armor i would gladly have over any of it. If i would have known that the iksar would get this screwed yes i would have started a troll shaman.

</FONT><HR>Alchemy is better than it was but the number of available and saleable spells is very limited by the overpricing of certain herbs.<P>Regen and Quickness potions cost around 50PP to make, Gate potions cost 150PP to produce.  That's too much.  If you factor in the cost of failures its even higher.  <P>I think all herbs are over priced, although players will pay the market 120PP for a 10X sow potion, without flinching <P>... most other spells are not a neccesity and end up being very over priced.  If the stat potion herbs were much much cheaper, then I could feel justified in using them to gain skill.  <P>But I'm not going to go the Alchemy moneysink route... for what...?

</FONT><HR>I would like to group shaman spells and evaluate each group to see how good/bad they are.<P>Debuffs:<BR>In this class we get 3 main spell types, Malo, Turgurs and Cripple.  As most shamans will agree Turgurs is awesome dont change this mama-jama.  Malo line pretty good.  Cripple this spell is not that great, since stat increases/decreases has only minor effect, it does not really affect much.  Buffs are quite a different story because though they have a minor effect they have a very longer duration to overcome that fact, but Ill go into that later.<P>Healing:<BR>We do not get the same healing power as clerics as most shamans will complain and that we cant keep up with the healing demands of a 45+ party.  I feel that shaman healing is adequate we are not clerics and between slows, regen and superior heals we can heal with moderate ablity.  The only ability we lack that I feel should be added is a group regen type spell.  We get regen very early so it seems natural that we should get group versions of these spells.<P>DDs:<BR>These are not that mana efficent, but we are not blasters so this is adequate.<P>Dots:<BR>The mana effeiceny on dots I feel is not approriate (this applies to all dots not just shaman ones).  Compared to the mana effecieny on druid, mage, wiz dd spells these are very little improvement for a spell that needs 45 sec to 1 min 45 sec to take full effect.  Also specifically Bane of Life is only 4.5 dmg/mana ratio vs. approx 4.0 for Envenomed Bolt, this is not much of an improvement.  Also same type of situation with Pox of Bert and Scourge.<P>Buffs:<BR>Some Buffs can be viewed as Indirect Dots.  Because a str for example will to x amount of additional dmg over its duration.  As we all know the amount of xtra dmg (and hit percentage, which in turn is extra dmg) is small even for a large str buff, but do to its Long duration this can still provide a decent mana efficeny of dmg/mana.  Since only verant knows the exact game mechanics, I propose that for example a str buff be examined for its mana efficeny.  I would like to point out that it should be FAR more effecient than any DD/Dot because it is being wasted every sec one is not fighting.  A dex buff can be examined in the same way.  And an agi buff can be examined as the extra ac that it provides in seeing how much hps it saves over its duration and comparing that to a heal spell, again the Buff shoudl be FAR more effiecent than the heal as it is being wasted most of the time.<BR>Note: Avatar is bascially a worthless spell becuase of its extremly short duration, plz examine this.<P>Lastly Group spells:<BR>The group buffs that we get are actually not worthless but do have only limited application, they provide only a small benefit over the signle verisons even in the situations that they are better, for such high lv spells they should be better.  Giving them the same stat bonuses as the single versions would be a good starting attempt at fixing their usefulness.  Also give us group sow, this is a nice usefull spell, not overpowering and again we get sow at lv 9 why not group sow?<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055973-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055973-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055973-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055973-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055973-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055973&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055973&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
