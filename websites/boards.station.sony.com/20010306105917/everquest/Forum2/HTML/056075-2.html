</FONT><HR>Hi, I'm a 56 shaman and I'm a bit surprised of seeing jealousy and sympathy of our class from druids.<P>So far every class can do what shamans can do to a point and then some.  Enchanters can slow attack, debuff resists (although stackable with us), and debuff stats (we use same line).  Mages use the same line of malise.  These are pretty much the large effects that we can do that are noticable.   Buffs are great but stacking has issues since alot of items now are giving stat/ac/hp increases.  Our high level group buffs (minus disease/poison) are subpar to single target buffs.<BR>Shamans can't port, improved versions of invis (heck we can't even invis til 29th level), group endure breath, snare, stun, group health regens, group real sow,  unlike druids.   We don't have early forms of health regen (treeform for druids).   The only edge we have is sow and it's at low levels where it really doesnt make a difference.<P>You all are probably wondering, "Why the hell is this shaman butting in our discussion?"   I'm just pointing out that you have alot of uses.<P>Snare is EXTREMElY important on raids.  And yes I would like to see an improved version for you guys.   It's crucial to snare those mobs in let's say Chardok, where a runner that gets away spells death.  It's great to put on mobs while mezzed.<P>I'm just trying to voice an opinion from an outsider view.  Hope I don't ruff to many feathers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As far as I am concerned, druids are a well-rounded class and do not really need anything else.  I agree that they need to fix the healing problems, because at lvl 59 I can still fizzle 5 sup heals in a row and watch a groupmate die because I couldn't get a heal off.  But other than that I think we are a fun class to play.  It sounds like they are already making us better healers though, as has been seen on Test server.  Why does that bother clerics?  When a cleric goes OOM, and they need us for backup heal so the tanks don't die, which could cause us ALL to die, then maybe you think you might be glad they fixed our heal?  When we take 6 groups on a raid, and only have 5 clerics, a druid ALWAYS ends up being a healer for that last group.  So any improvements they make to the other classes in the game helps my guild in whatever we are trying to accomplish.  But other than the healing problem, I am very happy with a druid being my main class played.<P>My main concern is the druid epic.  I have had EVERYTHING other than Faydedar for 2 months now, but can't seem to get the ellusive dragon.  Do you think you guys could fix this for us please?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Verant say they discourage camping, but then for the druid epic you have to actually sit and CAMP all these mobs to get the corrupts to spawn.  Some get lucky, but others can spend 10 hours camping one corrupt mob before it spawns.  And Faydedar, well, he's just a joke.  As you read above, one guy camped him for 400 hours so far with no luck, and I personally have 60 so far.  Clerics can finish their epic in 2 days with luck, but I have been at mine for almost 4 months.  There are a whole 3 druid epics on Quellious so far, and a lot of people waiting for Faydedar now as a last piece.  Can you please do something about this spawn, or move the piece to something a bit easier to wait for.  It really hurts to know I spent all this time on my epic but have nothing to show for it.  Make it so you turn in an item to get him to spawn or something, so you don't have 20 druids at a time fighting over who gets to sit their mule at the firepots in Timorous Deep.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Please, this is an issue that really needs to be looked into.  Thanks.<P>Aguilera Angelheart<BR>59th Dr00d and officer of Wraith<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi all.  I doubt anyone will read this message as Absor's post is about 2452345245 posts ago.<BR>Here's my story about playing a druid to level 54.<P>I soloed 90% of my experience.<BR>That's right, 90%.  Nobody wants druids in groups because as someone mentioned several posts ago, 'druids are the best second rate class in the game.'<BR>- Strength and poison resist are second best to shaman.<BR>- Magic resist is second best to enchanter.<BR>- Hit point buffs are second best to cleric.<BR>- Healing is third best to cleric and shaman.<BR>- Damage shield is second best to mage.<BR>- DD spells are ... well way below any other casting class.<BR>- DOT's are second best to necro.<BR>- Teleports are second best to wizards.<P>On way too many occasions I have been asked to drop from a group so that the party can invite one of the other buffing classes to buff the party.  That is horribly demoralizing when you strive your best to help the party on major raids.  So what can you do?  <BR>- Your buffs are rejected by the party because there is another class present to provide better ones.  <BR>- Your DD's land 20-50% of the time in dungeons.<BR>- Your healing spells fizzle too much to heal the tanks in your party efficiently.<P>What do you do?  I don't have the answer.<P>All in all, here is a breakdown of what raids I have attended (yes, I do keep track as a matter of fact).<P>37 - Trakannon raids.<BR>27 - Nagafen raids.<BR>13 - Vox raids.<BR>17 - POF raids.<BR>13 - POH raids.<BR>7 - POA raids.<P>You know what my character is useful for during those raids?<BR>Spell one - Regeneration/Pack Chloroplast.<BR>Spell two - Damage shield.<BR>Spell three - Maybe a strength buff.<P>Druids aren't meant to be involved in major raids according to Verant's rules for the druid.  It is a fact.  The only things my druid is good for now is taxi service and soloing in OUTDOOR zones only.<P>Another thing that bothers me about druids is armor, or lack thereof.  Why are there half a dozen different warrior, shadow knight and paladin armor with greater than +12 wis for chest and other assorted which are +6 and greater?  Yet there are only 3 pieces of druid armor (chest) greater than +6 and most other pieces are between + and +4!!!!  That's retarded.  Up until 3 weeks ago I was wearing a foreman's tunic!!!! Some nice wizard in my guild gave me a shroud of nature (one of the items about +6 or greater).  Yes I have missed out on vermi and ES tunics but those are just 2 examples.  Druids have the FEWEST pieces of armor to choose from and are severely hindered by it.<P>Ah screw it.  I've complained enough.  All in all druids are horribly powerful when soloing but useless in groups post 50.  Gotta go, a guildie needs a port to Sebilis... of which I am not invited.<P>&lt;/end rant&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizards can port to some alt planes, right?  Would it be out of the question to ask for a group port to the druid ring in the Plane of Growth?  It's really a shame that a ring as awesome as that one is just another inactive one like the other run-down rings all over Norrath that don't serve any purpose..<P>I saw mentioned the removal of the batwing requirement for the Elder Spiritist's Boots.  /cheer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>On that, could any of the casting times on some of the other ES armor be reduced?  The Drones of Doom casting time I can see justified being as long as it is. It does damage, and timing is everything in a fight, but why penalize for the other armor's effects?  We work for this stuff because we want the convenience of having the popular spell effects at our fingertips without taking up a spell slot or using mana.. but lots of times they're hardly ever used because they take SO long to cast, and at the level the armor actually works we don't even notice reduction in mana from casting the real spell.  What could we possibly gain by losing a few seconds of casting time on non-aggressive spell effects?  Necros have the insta-invis thingie... I wouldn't want the same effect on the ES Helm since it's self only, though.. Just reduce the casting time a little.  One or two seconds casting time more than the actual spell will get the "we don't want this item to replace the real spell entirely" point across without making the equipment...less than desirable to use.<P>I like the idea of redeeming the Charm Animal line with the high-level charm that leaves you off the hate list when the spell breaks... I like the idea of a various pet at level 55.  Can we combine them?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Perhaps a very high level (59, 60) Pet/Charm upgrade that can -permanently- charm any animal in the zone within the same level range as regular charms?  I really don't see it being a problem considering what our lesser charms can already do..Come on.. we've worked for this.  Let us finally have fun with charm.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Plus it'd give us a little more of a variety like the Mages' Monster Summoning line.  Not like we don't have a variety to charm already, but it's hardly ever practical.<P>Question: Why isn't the Luminescent Staff luminescent?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I was all excited to get one and when I finally did - it didn't glow!  I just thought that was kind of silly considering its name and targeted level range...  I have to clear a general slot for a GLS or something when using it..<P><BR>Sorry for repeating anything, haven't had a chance to read the other posts before this one..<P>Just my 2 copper.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are a number of things which we are allegedly capable of doing, that almost never works or is pointless.<P>1.  Healers:  Post-50, we were forgotten.  I specialized in alteration in order to be a good buffer/healer/evacer.  RoK and Velious forgot this important role.  I hope the Test changes go live, for this will greatly improve this role.  I like to group.<P>2.  SoW:  An upgraded SoW would be cool, but not really needed.  I think the KOS effects of wolfform should be eliminated.  The exploit that used to take place, is easily worked around by simply eliminating any positive faction change.<P>3.  Charm Animal:  The problem remains that although we can technically do this, Charisma is so underused of a stat and so anethema to most of us (especially halflings that start at 50), that Charm is impossible to use.  Switch it to Wisdom or Sta (or other class stat, although no one knows why).<P>4.  Quests!  We need some.  <P>5.  Druidic armour:  We need items that make roleplaying sense (like most classes and races).  Some of the stuff that can presently be obtained, is just foolish.  There are easier ways to balance.  I'd love to have a set of druid armour shy of the planes, who's stats permitted me to keep my WIS at 200.  I've got 20 Wis in jewelry, I ought to be able to get 80 from a set of my specialized druidic armour.  As this is my most important stat, wouldn't my guild or an enchanter incorporate it into everything?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<BR>    Aside from the considered changes to Superior Heal, I would like to see the following considered:<P>1) An upgrade to Sunbeam. I find this spell, while useful, is just resisted too often and lasts too short a time span. I don't think it should rival a necro's Fear, but an upgraded form for higher level mobs would be nice.<P>2) Legacy of Spikes needs to be rethought. Just too high a mana cost for 20 damage.<P>3) Levels 39 through 50 dropped spells should have their locations and drop frequency reevaluated. Just too infrequent and on mobs that are way beyond the spells' levels.<P>4) Lower resists for Rain spell line.<P>5) Some minimal ability for a druid to draw mana from the natural surroundings. I wouldn't even mind if this could only be applied to group members (infuse mana).<P>6) Treant Form. A mobile upgrade to treeform that is non-terrain dependent.<P>7) Equipment that actually looks like equipment. My woodelf druid doesn't look much different at level 53 than he did at level 1.<P>8) Egress should be sold at a vendor. Both Egress and Succor need to be fixed with regard to clearing hate list.<P>9) Just dump Spirit of Scale and replace it with something ... anything.<P>10) Reevaluate exactly what is an 'animal'. Kunark has some glaringly bad decisions in this regard.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hope this gets read by someone....<BR>First I am wondering why when i get charmed an NPC can cast SoW inside yet i can't.  This is also true with all outdoors only spells I believe.  I understand us not being able to cast some spells indoors, but i think that NPCs should be stuck with the same restrictions.  I firgured that this would have been in the coding and nothing could cast them.<BR>I saw earlier someone posted that we were one of the least efficient casters in the game next ti hybrids, this is true.  Since we don't specialize in anything we do not get those great heals or DDs that others do which is fine by me &lt;heals are being worked on and i am happy with the way they are on test&gt;.  Maybe at 49 we could get something like Tanures Gift, where Tanure calms us and allows nature to flow through us, it maybe like clarity or a much lesser form of the necro's mana regen, and of course self only.  <BR>I would love to see some more ports, Absor did post we are the master of traveling i believe, &lt;i am sorry if i miss quoted you&gt;, It make sense to me to have a port to Surefall Glade.  We could port right into the Hollowed tree next to the Druid Master.  As is i think wizzys are very close if not equal in ports.  <BR>SoW II would be nice.  Enchanters got Clarity II why not SoW II.  <BR>Healing needs an upgrade and i think you realize this.  I just want to support what you have done on test.  As it is now 2  Druid/shammys can not heal a group in many areas when it takes only one cleric.  I think what is on test is great.  I am not sure if the lvl 60 spell you added is needed, i do not know it's affects yet.  Chloroblast and Sup heal being bumped up and easier to cast seems it would be good enough.  <BR>I noticed on the Wizzy Talks they were upset about the spell animations, well it's the same for Druids so i hope the would be upgraded as well.<BR>I know armor is not much of Class Balance but it would be nice for some lower lvl gear that looked different yet still gave some stats we need.  As is most 30- Druids look the same, leather look.<BR>It would be nice to add a Woodelf/Halfelf.Halfling Robe look.  You all did a great job adding Robes to the Druids inventory but only Humans can use them.  So far they are the best items i can see for a druid and only one race can use them. I am curious to know why Druids don't get the highest Wisdom Items in the game, or atleast the highest wis items for our lvl.  We have the least chance for AC which makes us much more caster based yet we don't get the caster items to go along with it.  <BR>Thank you much for these talks i would have never thought of them.  You are doing a great job and I hope some of these issues are seen and addressed to everyone.<P>Blackelk Treehuggin<BR>Druid of Rodcet Nife<BR>Dark Empire Forever 8)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few more comments...though they may not be seen by Verant at this point.<P>I want to make an observation about the whole "overpowered for solo play" issue.  My druid was my first character, and I made it because 1) I was new to Everquest and wanted something kinda easy to start out with; 2) past experience of online games suggested I would be playing solo a lot.  Glad to say I have been wrong about that.  Love the game, and the interactions are all the flavor of the game.<P>Fact is tho, some players will want the whole dynamic open-ended online world, but are not planning to sign up with RL pals (can't imagine any of mine touching EQ, ah well).  We all can make a variety of characters and try out the unique skills of each.  Maybe it is because I don't play on PvP server, but I don't see what the big whup is if there is a class or two that is a more appropriate choice for those players who are not ready for guilds etc.<P>I know representatives from every other class are about to chime in and say "no fair, you're already too strong, what about us?"  Well, make a druid.  Try it.  I have played different character types and KNOW I am not an even partial melee character.  I am also not a healer.  Or a particularly good nuker.  I can solo animals well in zones where I can kite safely.  This means that for certain level windows, yes there are good exp opportunities for me. There are places that are always bad for me to go to.  This seems to be true for most classes.  That is the way it is.  <P>But I also see many casters soloing real well with a decent pet, which I will never have...Paladins doing real damage solo on the undead...etc.  Most classes (and yes there ARE exceptions) have times and places they solo well.<P>On porting, I wish Verant WOULD put in free instant port points for non casters...you notice most druids and wizzies are anonymous...it is for a reason.  Usually not 10 min goes by before you get a tell begging for a port...and sometimes they expect you to come to them to.  It sux not to be able to port when I am not playing my druid, but there you go, it is something druids do.  If Verant were to wipe out the port economy, I would be thrilled.  Honestly, you don't make THAT much money from it, and what it costs you is play time and experience...a bad trade in my book.  I play the game to hunt mobs and get cool items, develop characters, group with cool people, complete quests, etc., not to be a taxi for money.  I did not even realize druids COULD port when I made mine.<P>And man, do I wish I had quests...ANY quests...that I could have done in the mid levels.  I have done many non druid quests just because I like them.  Now I am gonna have more to do in the 46 to 60 levels than I have had in the first 45 levels of playing.  Don't care what the quest is...even did the quest for the useless plant pet spell...because it was a quest.  Reward me with marbles, reward me with faction (and some exp)...I don't really care.  Though some mid-level not-entirely-pathetic armor would be nice too.<P>Yes, I would love to not be so nearly useless in a dungeon, and yes the healing thing really sux (tired also of having annoyed accusations that I am wasting mana when I blow all my juice spot healing a tank while the cleric saves up for the big heal).  Secondary healer is just not fun roll play...if you think it would be, try it and be sure.  Would also love decent cold based damage spells since so many things fire resist.  And would really like the very useful things that were gonna be in Vel but aren't (group camo...i mean c'mon all the casters would like someone to be able to do this in one shot rather than the messy way a group gets camoed now...same for group enduring breath).<P>Still think the whole no sow in dungeon for balance issues highly, highly questionable.  I know it is Verant's game, and they don't have to explain, but so far, can't fathom it.  And none of the responses I have seen have said anything more incisive than "c'mon forget it they will never do it for balance issues" or "you are already too powerful."  EVERYONE would like to be able to be sowed in dungeons.  Who can cast the spell is no different than before.<P>Finally, to the first point again, solo play is just plain dull.  I am usually reading a book or annoying guildmates with chatter when doing it because it sux to sit there alone taking on safe fights and having to do a full mana recharge between fights.  There is really no risk that I will chose to solo over grouping if I had more value and could more easily get in on more dungeon raids.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a druid as my primary character, and really my only character.  I only have time to play one, and since I love wolves, I picked a druid.  I am now level 40, and I have to admit, I am having a harder and harder time getting into a group.  I hate soloing because it is BORING.  I would rather go to Greater Faydark and buff newbies (and I do when I get bored).  Everyone I know has a druid, and I almost always end up in a group that has other druids.<P>I wish there was some more distinction between druids as there are so many.  Is there any way there can be spells that are specific to the specialization you have chosen?<P>Also, is there anyway there can be some distinction between all the wolf forms?  It never matters that I wear, what weapon I'm using because I always look the same.  This gets terribly boring for roleplaying purposes.  Can the wolf forms at least be slightly larger the higher the level, or maybe a brighter white, or something?<P>I really have no issues with the spells we have, I find most of them useful, except the charm animal spells, which are only very rarely useful (admitedly they are sometimes helpful for bad pulls).  Regeneration is nice, and I use it all the time to try and help the cleric save some mana.<P>All I really want is some distinction between the different wolf forms, or maybe that each druid can somehow pick an animal, and instead of wolf form, they could pick bear, tiger, etc.  but that it would be a permanent choice (kind of like specialization).  I use wolf form all the time, but there is no distinction between a level 40 druid and a level 29 one with wolf form, we look exactly the same.  Can we please add some interesting new graphics, or SOMEthing?  Sitting graphic, howl command?  Please =)<P>  Guld Muddypaws<P>PS<BR>Is there any way I can get some equipment which turns my paws mud colored, hehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally I think *fixing* Faydedar will make this epic too easy the way many people say to fix it. The whole quest to that point is easy. Venril Sathir drops 2 stones everytime he dies - alot of people say that is hard but little do they know that if they are in Karnor's when a guild who does him often is there they will probably be looking for rangers/druids in zone to give them to. Thats what my guild does at least.<P>Alot of people say the Jade Reaver is hard - hard? Go clear the black reavers in CoM a couple times and you will get one - heck you might get two or three in a couple times there. Compare this to enchanters who need a rare drop from Hate... we have cleared Hate 6 times in a row with no drop.<P>Literally the only hard part is Faydedar - *if* Verant were to fix Faydedar there would be too many druid epics... Maybe fix Faydedar and change the Venril Sathir stone to a rare drop or a not so common drop? I believe it once was but druids/rangers were upset that it was so rare etc... But look at Wizards and Necro's needing very *rare* drops from gods. <P>If Faydedar was to be fixed it would only be right to make the VS stone rarer and possibly the Jade reaver rarer as well. <P>These are epic weapons they don't want half the server running around with them. Personally I don't either ... I worked hard for my epic (yes I am a druid who has my epic) without Faydedar being such a long camp my whole quest would have been simple ... possibly completed within a few days. That is not what I call epic.<P>As far as spells - <P>More groups buff spells that actually stack with other classes spells. I am not asking necessarily for Natureskin to stack with HB but possibly even Bladecoat line of spells to be targetable? Something that simple would be appreciated by the tanks in your group.<P>The whole idea of new heal spells is great - not having an upgrade from Greater heal till 53 is a bit of a joke looking at when we get it and all our other heals. <P>Lower the fizzle rate on our heal spells - whats the use of even having them when you can fizz away 2 bubs of mana before you can get the spell off on occasion - usually though 2 or 3 fizzes is normal. This doesn't help me in the *group* atmosphere that I prefer. <P>Presonally I think quad kiting is a cruel joke to other classes. Lightningblast line of spells should have less range than they do now. That would end that real quick.<P>Verant likes grouping? How about actually making a druid want to group? There is hardly anything class specific for us. We have very little choice in armor, jewelry, weapons. Alot of 50+ druids are still wearing their gatorscale legs and splitpaw gloves. <P>We have so little choices in items to be well equipped we look the same as we did when we were level 2 in our patchwork. So to look different to look less noobie we switch to crappy Velious dropped Tizmak type armor.<P>Oh we have quest armor now too from Thurg - oh great - it too looks the same as Tizmak. Why can't we look a little different if we work hard for the items we get? Besides that the armor is ridiculously hard to come by. In dozens of Kael raids I have only seen one peice of erroded leather drop. <P>Back to Kunark armor - on my server not one single ES breastplate has dropped. We have about 10 Donal's BP's, several Cobalt BP's, sheesh we have maybe 20 DW BP's in the bank - how many people actually play paladins?<P>Otherwise our class is fine. We need no changes - for the most part we are overpowered.<P>I think a good portion of those replying to these posts don't even have an idea of what it is like in the higher levels. There is nothing that needs to be done but possible nerfs to the druid pre-50th. After that though we slowly become nothing more than a port out - we offer very little to our group and because as I have heard from many druids most of us don't even know how to group becasue why? Why group when quad kiting offers more experience and the same amount of loot?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry to post yet again but i have been thinking.  <BR>The problem with being a druid is there is always someone that can do stuff better.  If someone wants Buffs, they can a shaman, if they want heals they can a cleric, if they want Evacs then they can wizzies because they can nuke better.  We just don't have alot to offerin groups.  Our group spells are nice, but not great.  The thing that is nice is we can nuke and then throw a couple heals.  <BR>We need someone to offer the group that no one else can.  It does have to be super, just something to give us that edge, the push over the top to make us a little bit wanted.  But i can't honestly think of what that wouldn't infringe on other classes areas.  I just don't think there is anything you could give us, everything is taken and we will always be stuck at second best which is never a first choice in a group.  <BR>Can you think of something??????</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>quad kiting for 2 bubbles of mana? What level are you, what ungodly twinked gear do you have, and what bugged low hp mobs are you doing this on.  I've never seriously quadkited because throughout my career I found it more trouble than it was worth.  It always took either *all* my mana or just enough more than all my mana so I had to med while kiting.<P>I would also like to request that you people *think* about a suggestion before you make it.  Adding a slow to snare? making rooted mobs unable to attack? Do you have any idea how overpowered and abusable this would be?  <P>To the person who asked for "treant form" mobile treant form without the terrain limitation.  There is no tree in the global. That is why you can only become a tree if there's a tree in range of the spell.  Doing this would require adding a tree to the global, which would make for some mightily out of place looking trees, depending on which tree model they used, and what zone it was in.  <P>And to the person who complained about people wanting feydedar to be triggered.  Of course you don't want that to happen.  You already have your epic.  You may think that the epic is easy except for that point.  Unless you compare it to other epics.  Ragebringer, Spear of Fate, Water Sprinkler of Nehm-ankh, Celestial Fists.  Yes you may have cleared hate 6 times without getting the vampire dust, but in those 6 hate clearings how much armor dropped?  Lots.  Great fun for an entire guild.  The druid quest requires.  5 rare forages.  Killing 4 50ish dark elves.  Camping greens for untold hours for 9 rare spawns.  A rare drop off of black reavers.  Killing a level 55 froglok.  Killing Venril Sathir.  Camping Feydedar.  Not to mention lots of legwork and silly subquests.  No other epic quest requires having a second account and a dedicated connection to have any chance of completing it in this lifetime.  I'm glad you got yours, really I am.  And maybe making it a simple triggered spawn is a bad idea.  But, if you didn't have your epic, would you really think that a 400 hour camp was appropriate?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I realize that this subject is already well hashed over but I will try and make a few brief points for consideration.  I am assuming the intention is to make Druids more useful in groups, more useful in raids and reduce thier ability to solo or certainly not increase it.  I am all over that.  (I leave the actual efficiency of Druidic soloing to the reader, it is amazing at some levels and truly aenimic at others.)<P>1) SoV spells.  These are actually spells that *could* aid Druids in getting gourps.  They are just plain unavailable.  Even with the aid of spoiler sites (WHICH SHOULD NEVER BE REQUIRED TO PLAY THIS GAME.) I find these spells to be unattainable.  I joined Velious at the level of 34.  I have spent 95% of my time there since that time, making level 45 in the process.  I have enjoyed the area mostly but even knowing *where* the spells can drop, I have gotten none except the bought spell.  The early Ro line might make me feel like I am diong something in the group.  Perhaps that is the old Shaman in me.<P>2) Equipment.  Is it really needed that the most prolific class in the whole game should share all of its decent (not even top-end but also most of the top-end) equipment with every int caster that walks?  Should not a Druid, a leather based class, have a higher base stat (wisdom) *and* a higher armor class than the pure int casters?  I am not saying that a Halfling Druid should hit the wisdom cap as easily as an Erudite Wizard.  I am saying that he or she should be able to do so as easily as a Human Cleric and with better AC than an Enchanter.  /shrug The equipment choices really are few and they are spread amongst many.  We need to have Sol Ro quests and it is silly to not implement them when Druids are a large part of the player base. (caveat: I don't care anymore, I have hit the cap and will move on into the end game area cheerfully.  It just annoys me when this class's quests all occur in the local tradezone.)<P>3)  Define me.  Look, the master of all, comander of none thing is nice but only for so long.  Druids cannot do a single thing in the post 50 game that another class cannot do better.  For comparison look at this: <P>Warrior: tanking and "now new damage dealing like a god!"<P>Rogue: damage output marginally superior to all and unique skills like lock picks and trap detection.  Defined by corpse recovery and specific situation raid uses.  These are impressive but IMNSHO, worth the trade-off.<P>Monk: ditto on raid damage and general damage plus pulling (true mastery)  A low-level raid can work with a high-level Monk pulling.<P>Ranger: Tracking and damage (split but tracking tops at least) good functionality but somewhat weaker in a raid situation certainly.<P>Paladin: Another hybrid, unmatched taunt in my book.  LoH defines perhaps, I define tham as uber-taunters when needed.<P>SK: perhaps the taunt as a play can do, plus nice class-specific Equipment (perhaps underpowered in groups)  Defined by solobility as a tank.  If otherwise, educate me.  Certainly *great* exp group members.<P>Wizards: ***** as you will, unmatched fast damage. Defined by this and planes TPs.  Solo power at later levels and gimmes in raid situations, more are always welcome.  No one will ever say that a wiz is sucking lag.<P>Mages: CoH! Sad that this spell defines so much, but the spell is godlike.  Also, unmatched damage over time in a group through the pet and DD. Weak if pet not used.<P>Necros: Summon Corpse line and great group DoT. (literally and they provide good extras.)<P>Enchanters: Adding efficiency to the tanks and to the casters.  Surreal addition to any group.  Generally defined by the crowd control but this aspect fades over time in many areas.  They move from godlike to demi-gods.<P>Druids: Defined by utility.  Great outdoor group members until the upper levels, then useful healer/buffers but not preferred.  Sub par nukers and, while strong DoTers, this strat is not a useful group tactic.  Buffs are overwritten by Clerics and Shamans and are far too costly in mana.  Defined by powerleveling skills only outmatched by the Enchanter.  Exceptionally powerful in very specific situations.  Paired with a Necromancer (or Enchanter) and Rogue (or Ranger/Warrior), makes an unmatched exp group for several levels. Top-end in small groups, somewhat functional in full groups and useless in raids.<P>Bards: The ultimate exp group addition.  Rare and incredibly handy in high-almost crazy raids for resists.<P>Clerics: Great to have in any situation.  I cannot imagine why they fell unneeded ever.  Deinfed by Ressurections and healing.<P>Shamans: Slow, debuff defines here.  buffing is exceptional but largely a wasted effort until very high levels.  Certainly a class that comes into its own but one that suffers the Necro fate of 1-2/ raid is plenty. Defined by Malo and Tigurs I imagine.<P><BR>Hmm, I have rambled but these are my opinions I suppose.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think being able to port to Plane of Growth would be a bad thing, unless it was a self only port.  There really is no reason for a Druid to ever want to go to Plane of Growth.  It's fun to walk around and /hug tunare but there's about as much to look at as in a walk across west karana (and like twice the size *ug*.)  There are only a few quests, most of them near impossible to complete.  (Gauntlets of Earthcrafting looked nice... until i found out who Derakor the Vindicator was).<P>A port to PoG would serve one purpose.  Easier access to the plane for guilds planning on raiding it.  The little bit of appropriatness from an RP standpoint would be completly obliterated by how the port was actually used.  It would be used to more easily raid the plane of growth.  That plane is easy enough as it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alright Bear with me here for I am tired.. while writting this... I seriously hope it is read.. I've played a druid to lvl 49 and became VERY discouraged with playing it. Reasons? Simple.. 46+ is raid lvls... I really didn't start raiding till lvl 49... for the new spells I THOUGHT would be useful...Alsa... they proved a joke.... I've been to the Plane of hate Mostly... Why? Because of the way you need to get out.... take a TPer... Kill him/her in a duel... Revive... Loot all but one item.... Gruop with 5 people... port out... revive... group port... repeat till all that can't gate out... are out... then loot and go... As for the rest of the raid? Went pretty much like this.... Snare.. call snare... sit... repeat... Nuke? Jea!! right!!! Cast Starfire &lt; for thoes that don't know a 612 point DD fire spell &gt; If I was lucky even With that Magic ect Debuff cast on it... be lucky if I did 200 points... and more than 50% of the time.. resisted outright.... Ice? ( 612 point DD spell cold based with a short fire Dbuff ) almost 90% of the time Resisted.... Can't DOT... mob stand a chance of Poofing ( that was SUPPOSED to have been fixed ) Healing? I was lucky if I could heal enough for the guy or gal to take 1 extra hit.... and if I was summoned to the monster.... didn't take much for it to drop my health to danger lvl... Yea guys.... Druids are great outdoors.... and great to have at low lvls... Quad kiting... Snare... Ect... but uuummmm... What happens higher up? We become forgotten.... mostly unwanted... and barely Usible.... In dungeons.. all we are wanted for is our Evac... The ONLY reason I got my GEBs was because I could Evac ( was the ONLY reason I got in the group ) For all of you who say druids are over powered.... think again... yea... we can solo to 50 - 60.... but only outside... and it becomes VERY slow going post 45... druids only shine at lower lvls.. the higher we go.... the less we are wanted...The ONLY reasons I gotten into groups post 50 is A: if the group didn't have a healer.. or buffer.... or needed and Evacer.... otherwise I spent hours looking for groups... even groups that had an opening said we are fine without you... only to 5 minutes later invite another class... So this is a few Ideas I've thought about (some complaints) about druids.... most have prolly been said... but I will say anyways<P>1: We port anywhere but Planes... why? Espically the plane of Growth... IT was made a portal? WHY? the plane of Tunare made a portal in? Somthing wrong there.... Espically seeing as we dun get any other planes ports like Wizards<P>2: Staying on ports... The only port I really see that is neeeded is one in or around Surfalls.... This is a DRUID/RANGE run forest!!!!! and with North Karana being the closest port.. going to places like Halas... or even Qyenos is a long trip.. even for druids... as for GFD... the port from Butcher Block isn't that far a run.... and ya don't see a wizzie spire in Butcher do you? <P>3: DD spells Fire based.... ummm ok.. fire is natural.. Granted... but is also THE SINGLE MOST RESISTED DD CLASS IN THE GAME... now that in and of itself isn't enough to call for a change... even though Wizrds get things like Ice Comet... we aren't wizards... but... isn't lightning more natural?  and we only get basically 2 Lightning based DDs... Careless lightning at 19.. for a whole 99 points... and Fury of the air... for 250 points &lt; not bad but it's more for it's stun than it's damage &gt; Wthe rest of our Lightning spells... are AOE spells.... why not add some other lightning spells... espically ones we can use INDOORS... Places like Sol B.... and ESPICALLY againt Naggy... Our fire spells are still usible.. but drasticly reduced.... Atleast look into our DD lines.... <P>4: Buffs... we have 3 buffs we can use.... one owned by only 2 classes... SOW... the other buffs... out skin line.... and out Str line are commly over ridden by cleric and shammies.... and it bites.... and waaaaaaay to few... Druids are the MASTERS of animals.... I walk by a red grizzly and it smiles at me.... a Shammie walks by a red con Grizzly.. and it'll tear him to shreads.... But they get the animal lines... turtle skine... cat feet... Spirit of the bear... Snake charm spell... Spirit of the wolf... I'm not saying they shouldn't.. and I'm not saying Druids she get all shammie buffs... but I think it would be nice if we did get a few more we could use.... <P>5: Definatly a Mana regen of sometype.. and this just isn't Druids... this goes for Clerics as well... around lvl 20 Druids and clerics melee become pointless.... unless you are OOM and the monster is running.... We are basically pure casters... with a Paw of Opolla in one hand.. and another Wis + item in the other... Shammies can still melee long after 20... and can take hits with heavier armor... and thier MULTITUED of buffs... espically with thier Quest armor... gives them very good AC for a casting class... yet they also benifit from a health/mana swapper.... I really feel Clerics and druids deserve somthing.... <P>6: I also agree with equpiment... a lvl 49 druid looked damn near the same as when she was lvl 5 in full leather.... the only REAL defining thing we get is the BCP.. and even then it is passed up for other things like Urthork now &lt; which looks like leather &gt; or the Tree Weave &lt; which looks like leather &gt; Why can't higher lvl druid LOOK higher lvl like every other class? Heck!! even a Druid decked out in plains armor looks like a freaking mid lvl ranger!!!!! please... allow for a few things that make a high lvl druid... LOOK like a high lvl druid...<P>7: As for armor and equpiment.... druids definatly get shafted.... we have NO real lower end quest Armor... NONE!!!!! When I say lower.. I mean like Warriors Crafted.. Paladins Ro ( can clerics wear that also? ) Rangers Ivy etched... Shammies Tometic... NEcros shadowbound....Rogues Raven scale Ect.. and I know what you are thinking... Not all classes have quest Armor.. yer right... Mages don't.. except they have quests to help them get more powerful pets.... Enchanters quest for good wands to aid in trouble... Wizards? Hello.. ICe Comet Ect... Monks? Well many weapons added... and drop armors like Cresent in Dalnir have made monks SERIOUSLY more popular...and it's just tireing to see all these quest happening... everyone always complains about Druids camping other classes quests? THAT's BECAUSE WE HAVE ALMOST NONE OF OUR OWN... and thoes that we do have? TOTALLY BITE... go to Alakazams and see fer yourself...<P>8: Range slot... ohhh yea.... this is really useful on druids.. I've seen lvl 40 + Druids running around with a Preserved Split paw eye still in that slot... where shammies get Spears.. NEcros get Daggers.. or other stuff... seems like all classes get decent things to place in thier range slot save for yup.. Druids.... Why do we even bother having a range slot for druids? <P>9: Forms... This kinda bugs me... Treant For is intresting... and can be done... because the modle if you check should already be in the world server seeing as treants can be found in several diffrent zones.... but in truth.. I dun see a need for it... Wolf form is well enough... and I think ( you prolly going to laugh at this one ) Shammies should get Wolf forms... and Druids should get bear form... druids ARE the master of animals... and if Shammies are so intouch with animlas as to have a ton of spells named after them.... then Spirit of the wolf would naturally lead to a Wolf form... but whatever you do.. PLEASE make sure you cover Enchanters... else you spawn a Millios posts complaining about being shafted with no new illusion spells.... <P>10: pets... was this a crule joke? a lvl 50+ player... summoning a pet... 20 + Lvls lower than the summoner???? what the heck good is this thing?????? Might as well use a SKs Skele pet!!!!! least it can Duel weild in high lvls!!!! Seriously... I thin the idea of being able to charm animals with fear of charm break/aggro is a good idea.... with a line of spells &lt; or change the ones that exsist &gt; Where You cast the spell trying to gain control of an animal.. and no it does not have to be Ambily to you... any animal.. wether Griffon.. or Bear...wolf or bat if the spell works... the animal joins you as yer perminate pet untill you die or zone.. or tell it to get lost...and you can use things like how an animal reguards you.... and how high a lvl it is... such as a red con Scowler... you prlly won't charm... ( and if the spell doesn't work.. then it can aggro on you.. and attack ) where as a light blue/green bear... will more than likly join you.... seems like a good IDea... least to me... <P>Well.. anyway 10 thought about druids enough.. espically I'm about to fall over tired.... I hope you consider these.... would be nice to see a reply too... <P>Jadyn <BR>of LT   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To be different, let me preface this with some aspects of druids I like that shouldn't be changed:<P>* Tracking works perfectly<BR>* Forage works well too<P>Ok, now on to my suggestions:<P>* Group port to druid's bind location - we NEED this spell to reaffirm the druid's travel superiority!  I cannot stress this enough.  The class has been seriously diluted in the one area we were supposed to be special.<P>* Improved charm - our charm should NOT be based on CHA - it should be based on WIS or STR or some other trait that's more indicative of respect and control over nature, Improved Superior Camo (that actually works)<P>* Lots of outdoor pet spells.  We should be able to summon a Treant pet.<P>* Druids seem to be the slowest class I've seen to regain mana - this needs to be improved or we need some sort of cannibalize ability<P>* Don't nerf quad kiting - it's pretty rare anyway, and *extremely* dangerous for a druid to do in the first place. It's one of the few fun and challenging things a druid can do.<P>* We have too many spells which are effectively useless either due to bugs or bad design: succor, blizzard, breath of ro, fire, sprit of scale, scale of wolf, bonds of tunare (why the hell should this spell be so easy to be castable on the caster?  It's range is too messed up, it's useless) etc.<P>* Post 50 druids are useless in groups unless our strengths can be amplified: more effective group regen, more effective group damage shield, heavier str buff, faster heals - all this can be done without encroaching on any other classes<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alright. I made notes to comment on your post Jadyn, though mostly I skimmed it.<P>You want a PoG port? Why?  To assist in raiding PoG?  You want a PoG port for an RP reason but it would only be useful for a *counter-rp* purpose.<P>Nagafen is resistant to magic spells.  You should be a healer on nag raids anyway.  Cover some damage from the ae, and keep someone underpressure alive until the cheal hits.<P>Yeah we get no indoor magic based nukes.. but magic is resisted alot too.  Your level 39 velious spell will allow you to hit just about anything that isn't immune to fire with your fire nukes.  I think however that an interesting fix would be to improve the ratio of our lightning line to something similar to our fire and cold nukes, remove the ODO restriction, and remove the AE effect.  Would help stop quad kiting (which is really the only use these spells have), and would give us a magic based nuke.  Keeping the same mana cost and adding a short stun would be nice too, though casting times would have to be reduced to compensate (a 6.5 second casting time on a 1.5 second stun would be pretty pointless). <P>No mana regen.  Let me make this clear, apparently you people aren't getting the message.  WE ARE NOT GETTING MANA REGEN AT LOWER LEVELS.  Hear me?  Did that sink in? NO MANA REGEN. NO MANA REGEN. NO MANA REGEN.  One last time. NO MANA REGEN.  This is why.  The aim of the balancing is to balance the druid's group ability with it's solo ability.  Any new ability given at low level, where we are viable in both places, would be unbalancing.  Any ability that improves our solo ability would be counter productive.  Yes, we would all love self only breeze at 29 or 39.  Would this improve our chances of getting a group? Not really.  Would this improve our solo performance? Absolutly.  No mana regen unless it's post 50 when our solo ability fades considerably.  <P>We're not getting new forms.  Verant doesn't want to dilute classes more so we're not likely going to see bear form.  Treant form would be nice but would have the same restrictions of tree form (location) and couldn't have a treant model. <P>Shamen get "animal" spells because they imbue people with the "spirit" of an animal.  Their wolf is a "spirit" companion.  Druids deal with the actual animal.  That is why we turn into an "actual" flesh and blood wolf, why we get an actual flesh and blood bear (though it's not considered an animal... *shrug*  If there was infinate global space I'm sure that druids would get a form for every shaman spell that imbues someone with the spirit of an animal.  There isn't.  So we live with what we have.<P>That brings me finally to the pet.  The druid pet, while horribly underpowered, does what it is supposed to do.  It is a token pet.  It exists for a roleplay purpose.  Druids *should* have pets, but good pets, or even bad pets at low level, would be overpowering.  But the image of a druid suggests animal companions.  That is why we have charm, which for gameplay reasons has to be temporary and cause agro.  Making the druid pet a "true" pet would be overpowering.  That left options.<BR>1&gt; Enchanter style pet.  Trust me, you think the pet is bad now? Ask enchanters about their pets post 50.<BR>2&gt; Wizard/Cleric style pet.  Ask them how much they like their pets.  Very expensive, horribly inefficient, and as for wizards... a high 50's conjuration spell.... last conj spell they got was what? halo of light?<BR>3&gt; a token pet.  It follows you around, but doesn't do much.  Doesn't serve much purpose, except from a roleplaying standpoint.<P>I personally think we should get a powerful dot type pet.  400 mana summons a giant bear for 5 ticks. 200hp, immune to buffs, doubles for 120 at 30 delay.  Yeah it hits hard. but it lives at most 30 seconds.  Would seem better from a "Tunare! Send one of your children to aid me!" standpoint than a_cute_little_baby_bear00</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A definate problem with druids being able to port others to their bind point occured to me.  Plane of Fear.  Before it's popped after patch bind at the north wall behind the wall of fire.  Port out. After pop when your guild is on, port them all there.  Unless pathing has been changed a north wall break is virtually risk free.  You pull your first encounter.  This would trivialize the plane and you would see single groups clearing it constantly.  Possibly restricting it to melee bindable areas?  If you're bound in a melee bindable area (cities for the most part), you can port your group to your bind point.  Otherwise the spell would need some serious downsides to keep it from being overpowered.  Can you imagine the hole? Just bind past that hell hole known as the city.. all those virtually mob free tunnels leading down to the rev tower.  It's a good idea.. But the nerfing it would need to remain unbroken would probably render it about as useful as Succor.<BR>Make it level 60, cost 2000 mana, have res effects, casting time 30 seconds, reagent : diamond, and limit it to melee bindable areas and I'm still sure I could find a way to abuse it...<P>It would be fun for what it would allow us to do, and it would undisputedly make us the masters of transportation, but I don't see a way to implement it without making it more abusable than CoH is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a high leveled Druid on EQ, and have played many Druids from a multitude of games.  I personally object to the changes being considered.  <P>Druids are protectors of the woods, and therefore command lethal magics to preserve and keep balance in the natural sense.  Druids are not, and shall not by any stretch of the imagination be portrayed as a Cleric.  Druid heals are supposed to be "natural" like thru a regenerative process.  However due to the way EQ was designed I can see how they gave us some of the Clerical healing aspects.  <P>Basically heres what I would do for the Druids<P>1. Remove the castability difficulty on our level 53 Superior Healing<P>2. Add a "regenerative" line of healing instead of direct healing.<P>That is all.  Druids are just fine the way they are and therefore should be left as they are.

</FONT><HR>OMG Raenya, stop it please, please you are cracking me up!!!<P>Really though, come on guys listen to Raenya, this is not a Dr00d Ub3r dr3@mz thread, this is a class balance thread and the majority of what I have read in it has been for crap that we will NEVER get, that we should NEVER get, that would make us better soloers instead of groupers.<P>You know the #1 reason we don't get a mana regen spell?  Because we are damn good enough at soloing anyway...  Now if they 'nerfed' our ability to solo, I would be begging for some sort of mana regen, so pray they don't nerf us in that way.<P>Pet's yea we need a pet better than the one we get like we need triple attack or... I don't even want to say any insane upgrade for fear that somebody will actually think it's something we should get...<P>I agree with possibly added ports, to our home's i.e. G Fay and Surefall.<P>I like getting healing improvements, post 50 I hunt in guild groups very much, and would like some ability to help my clerics out or even heal my partner, Troll warrior that he is.  Please clerics know we don't want to take your job in any way shape or form...  At least I don't :b<P>Anyway, hopefully Alan can sift through all the dung posted here, and get to the really decent ideas, few that they are.<P>Joaquin Armillaria, 54th druid of E Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and clerics aren't always the master of healing in all rpgs, and druids aren't always weak in healing.<P>Try the darksun campaign setting in ad&d.  Druids are the healing class.  I would say that EQ borrows alot from that setting.  If you've ever played, or read that setting you will see some familiar terminology.  I'm not saying that druids should be better at healing than clerics, they shouldn't.  However, healing is the prime focus of the druid class (or as prime a focus as any class with no direct foucus can have)  We are priests.  Healers by definition.  There is no room for a "master of versatility" in the end game.   <P>And to the person who said they solo'd to 54 90% of the time.. and had been to 37 trak raids.  I find it highly suspect that a 54 druid could get on *any* trak raid, especially without the connections gained through grouping.  vox/nag and planes raids I can almost believe, but there are no open trak raids.  I have a feeling you made those numbers up to impress us... I don't think it worked.  <P>Doubtingly yours, <BR>Raenya Lupine 59th Preserver of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh,btw. insert flame here. You know what doesn't make you useful in those raids?<BR>Group chloro. Firstly I'll guarantee that that none of those encounters lasted long enough for a regen spell to matter, and if they did, on those trak raids you said you attended I'm sure that there was a 58 druid around to pass out RotG.<P>Damage shields.  No. I don't think so. When the mob hits you for 225 to 620 your 24pt damage shields doesn't mean jack.  As for your str buff, it's a whopping 1 higher than the str buff cast by JB arms, and I'm sure there are some parsers out there that can tell you exactly how little effect str has on damage output.  These fights are all short and the three spells you mention are only useful over *time*, so unless some of those planar raids were clearing the zone with one group I don't think you're adding to raids with those buffs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
