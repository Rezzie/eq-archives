</FONT><HR>No, Logan, bad answer, in that the FAQ is a politically correct spin on the real reason they allow twinking--revenue.<P>Sort of an "open secret."  But, to be formal and dupe some people, they've got to be less than honest whilst supplying plausible deniability.<P>I don't care that they are concerned with revenue, really, over quality of RP.  But it's irritating that this "leaving out the whole truth" tactic works so often.  And it's irritating enough that I feel the need, occasionally, to point it out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>He's probably also referring to the recent change where you could /consent another one of your characters to a corpse of another one of your characters and transfer items safely by yourself.  Instead of just making a /drag command, or /loot command, they changed /consent to only be able to drag.

</FONT><HR>I am not a big fan of twinking. I do give some items to newbies, but nothing that is going to give them a major advantage. I find nothing more annoying than seeing a lvl 2 Warrior in full bronze.<P>When you see a PC you should be able to tell that all of that armor and equipment was earned by that character. I don't care if you earned it all in your first and passed it on. The purpose of starting a new character is to learn all about that character, from the ground up, not skipping steps.<P>Twinking is akin to the kids who search the Net for cheat codes. You lose most of the pleasure of discovery in the game. <P>The biggest twinks I have received have been items at reduced prices (eg bronze for banded price) and those were because of my affiliation.<P>When you start a new character, you already know where most everything is and how to find and earn things. Why do you feel that it is necessary to look pretty or carry a big stick while advancing a NEW char.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I had a ranger, got him to 22, he had ssom, silvery, full suit of banded, bone, etc. Anyway when I created him, I thought they were more caster then they actually are. In being that his starting str was 68.<BR>I deleted him, and after a while, missed him, so I started a new ranger, this time with starting str in the 90s.<P>Needless to say I twinked him with the old ranger gear, anyone who thinks I should do it all over again can go climb a tree :)<P>A few twinks are level 50s who want to try a new class, so they twink em to get a taste of the class to see if it's worth the journey wihout investing the time into it. The other twinks are level 20s who decide to try a new class, not sure if they really like the one they are with. In either case they usually play for a few levels and go to another class. Twinking drives the economy. I'm sure we've all seen "trading a full suit of darkforge for caster gear" etc. <P>I love the idea of giving all your gear to a newbie would be considered generous, but giving all your gear to yourself is considered twinking, my many a negative thing.<P>I do twink (little stuff, like some pp, suit of armour, etc. backbacks, spells, etc. highest char is only level 35 so I don't twink with much), anyway, everytime I see another twink I say what everyone else says, "goshdarn twink" (goshdarn is being kind fer the boards :) But then I get over it like everyone else should :)<P>Verants stance on it is fine. The don't get involved as long as it doesn't unbalance the game.

</FONT><HR>LOL..<P>Newbie lvl5 player.. has about 1pp. of equipment on them..<P>Twinking lvl5 player.. has about 5000pp. of equipment on them (I've seen a lot more)<P>And you say it is not unbalanced? However, I don't feel there is any good solution except try to make the next game better. And to me it isn't just about balance. Here's my experience with how twinking make the game less fun for me:<P>I have a now-lvl24 paladin. At young levels I heard stories about a powerful sword called Ghoulbane. I started playing with a passion so that I might one day see this legendary sword and wield it. Not long afterwards, I see a lvl18 paladin wielding a Ghoulbane and some Ro armor...<P>I haven't had much passion about playing ever since then. Why? I enjoy challenges in the game.. and the rewards for them. What good is a reward that already exists in such numbers and at such low levels? Ghoulbane should be a symbol of a paladin that has taken the challenge of travelling to Guk and spending time and risk to get the sword.. not someone that has a lot of money or 6  level 50+ characters to camp items with.<P>But Verant is incapable of seeing this.. even though they claim this a role-playing game. There is more to a role-playing game than direct in-game combat balance. How about the overall game atmosphere?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You can please some of the poeple all of the time<BR>and<BR>You can please all of the people some of the time.<BR>but <BR>You can't please all of the people all of the time.<P>I think in Verants case in reqards to Twinking they please All of the people some of the time. There are proc level limits. Limits on the effectiveness of all gear. Dmg caps on levels. More than most things people just want to look good and thats probably the biggest reason they Twink IMHO. I like being duded up with my level 7 Enchanter wearing a SMR, Cowl, EBoots, Batskulls, Impskins etc. I dont want to spend time camping for a Skull of Jentra n crap like that. I dont want to worry about equipment at all playing my alts. You play the way you want and I will play the way I want. I prefer grouping also, thats why ALL my twinks are group classes (Cleric, Warrior, and Enchanter) and I am learning how to play each class as I level. Twinking saves me a little time. It makes me a little more effective in the group. Because I am relatively set the people that I group with who can use loot more get it. Another good thing is that I traded for and bought most of the stuff on my twinks, or else I camped stuff that was NOT camped. <P>It is all Jealousy and that is it. The guy whos main is level 7 that I group with jokingly says "I hate you" and then we talk about the game and strategy etc. Then I may offer something to him if he or she is a kewl person. I even dressed up a Human SK who only had leather, in a suit of Flayed Skin and a Dark Reaver I had layin around. I didnt see him complain. As a matter of fact he looks for me to play my twink when ever he is on.<P>Andaericus<BR>55 Luminary<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>BAH!  Twinking adds replayability to the game, why should the fact that a level 18 has a ghoulbane have ANYTHING to do with YOUR quest for one?  Anti twinking posts really annoy me.  Do you know how many people would leave the game if they eliminated twinking?  I'm not going to use the usual argument that it's all about jealousy, cause there are high level people that don't twink.  And more power to them, they found the class they liked right off.  Me?  It took a few tries, and getting a couple of characters into their 30's before I happened upon my chosen class.<BR>So, I sold the stuff from my 30+ chars, bought stuff for my new char, and now I'm very happily (and for the first time in a long time having real fun) leveling my twinked character.  If you don't like it I'm sorry, but I wasn't about to toss all that plat away, or not use it to help myself out...  I for one would have quit long ago if I couldn't twink.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"It is all Jealousy and that is it."<P>Well, since I'm pretty high level, and very capable of twinking, that's not the reason for me...<P>I'll agree tho, that jealousy is "it".  It's the jealousy of that high level necro who wants to play a warrior, but is jealous of all the other warriors who actually worked for their equipment AS warriors.  SO they twink, so they don't have to be jealous of the -real- warriors.<P>Anyone think that's a huge generalization?  Good.

</FONT><HR>Oh, P.S. - I generally don't have much of a problem with someone twinking a character with another character of the very same class (warrior to warrior) simply to redo base stats.  That's generally reasonable.  I can see it being used shoddily, like redoing it just to ease faction requirements, but overall the sheer loss of experience incurred keeps most people from doing this.  So no, I don't see that as a big deal.  <P>But I'd still prefer a game with one character per server.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
