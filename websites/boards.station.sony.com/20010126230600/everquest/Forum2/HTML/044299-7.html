</FONT><HR>Absor said:<P>I'm more than willing to test it myself. Tell me which NPC you are talking about and I'll have it looked into. But keep two things in mind, I'm only talking about high level NPCs, and if you do ALL the damage to an NPC (you or your pet) and go LD before it dies, the corpse might poof. That's not fixed, and might not be. Remember, we're talking about raids here, not necromancers soloing.<P>Ayama:<P>Any NPC.   Pick one.  I will kill it and the corpse will poof.   It is very easy to replicate.<P>Absor:<P>Well, that's my concern. In the last three months nobody has even tried to cast a DoT on anything that they think might poof, based on a problem that no longer exists. Based on a legacy of worry (and rightfully so) that corpses would poof if DoTs were used, nobody has been using them. So that makes fixing it kinda pointless…<P>Ayama:<P>Your listening and/or reasoning skills...sigh.<P>People say 'DOTs do not stick to any uber mobs', therefore they must have tried them...without success.  If you make it impossible for us to land a DOT, you have in essence fixed the DOT bug?<P>Unfortunately you have not.  Any mob I can land a dot on, I can make the corpse poof.<P>LOL And you wanna know if we can contradict ourselves and actually land a DOT on a 55+ mob when you know damn well its been made impossible.<P>Cute.  <P>Anyway this is degenerating into a 'lets fix DOT bug' thread instead of 'Lifetaps are also broken can you fix those since DOTs are broken and don't bloody land [at least not on Velious uber mobs]'.<P>Lets try and focus here:  Lifetaps need to land, period...no if and or but.  If you can't manage to do that for us, can you at least attempt a new argument on how we are useful?<P>So far no necromancer post50 has agreed with you, so if thats not a clue here is a less subtle one:<P>YOU ARE WRONG YOU DO NOT PLAY THIS CLASS AT THIS LEVEL PLEASE LISTEN AND HELP US SOON NOT IN FIVE MONTHS!<P>Thank you.<P>Ayama of Povar, 55 Necromancer<BR>Wanderers of the Stoic<P>PS Ask the dev team to give me a FEMALE title already, Heretic and Warlock=MALE.

Now, basically each necro = 3 more lures for a wizard.

Debuff, CoH, wait by the door.

</FONT><HR>Like three weeks ago, our guild was hunting guardian wurms in Skyfire for 55+ spell drops. We were 2 full groups perfectly set with all nessesary classes, and since those wurms arent 100% magic resistant, we fear kited them. Our snares and fears stick well after Malo lines, but still with difficulty. And since guardian wurms are level 59 to 60 and double hit for 530 damage per round, if you are summoned, you are usially dead even if well-buffed. So one of our shamans casted ebolt on wurm, was summoned and died quickly. Then 1 necro and 1 enchanter also died, but the rest of us killed this wurm succesfully, only to find no loot and no corpse.<BR>We hunted about 5 more wurms that day and some people still died after using dots, but wurm corpses never disappear anymore.<BR>So yes, this ugly dot bug still exists, and for some reason it cannot be fixed because we, necros can powerlevel people by dotting their mobs. But please expain me why wizards are allowed to powerlevel with nukes, druids/mages with damage shields, tanks with their melee and clerics with their heals but necros dont? Ever seen someone being powerleveled by high level druid? Even 5 necros cant rival one druid in this ability!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heya Absor.  Just wanted to make a comment on the DoT Poofing you mention that is fixed or still being worked.  It doesn't matter (like someone else posted earlier) no big raid will allow anyone to throw DoT's due to the past history of them poofing and all of the "alledged" claims that Verant fixed them when they weren't.  Even if you guys did fix the issue, why the hell would any raid want to risk the chance of an uber mob poofing?  Especially, when you ask a GM for help and they tell you "sorry, but it happens from time to time"?  You can bet that raids on my server are not going to allow DoT's anytime soon.  No one trusts that you guys can ever fix the problem.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>pertaining to what absor said about necros role as mana battery in an uber raid:<P>well for necros to efficiently give our mana to others then we need to Lich, and to Lich we need to drain the mob, therefore Verant needs to let us be able (though with some resists) to Lifetap uber mobs so we can fulfill our new role of "mana battery".<P>besides the point necros are a damage dealing class as is the mage and wizard, enchanters and clerics are more of a support class.  therefore necros sole role in any situation should be damage first, support second.  what's your malfunction in this understanding Verant?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, isn't it obvious that not one high level necromancer agrees with anything you have had to say on this subject?  you are making a stand against at least 200+ high level necros that all disagree with everything you say, don't you think you need to look into these issues and find a resolution from the things we have suggested?  none of us are asking to be uber, we are asking that you allow us to PLAY OUR CLASS like we are supposed to, which we cannot do on high level mobs.<P>Necros are a damage dealing class defined mostly by our line of lifetaps and dot's.  being a support class is at the bottom of the list of what we are, we should not be capable of only support functions when in an uber encounter.  we need to be able to damage those uber mobs because that's what we (just like wizards and mages) do.  what's the problem is seeing this when it is so obvious?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just going to briefly throw in my 2 cents on the whole DoT issue.<P>In FoH we ARE allowed to cast dots vs all uber encounters and are in fact encouraged to do so.  We've never had a corpse poofing issue that i can recall.  <P>HOWEVER you are all being fooled by verants SPIN doctors into arguing about corpse poofing instead of discussing the real issues.  Versus most / ALL velious encounters at most 1/2 dots will land on a mob.. usually Pyrorocur / Ignite.. sometimes Ebolt and rarely plaugue / cessation etc.  Now take into account that you might have 3 necros on a raid. 3 necros cant stack the 2 &lt;---- spells they can cast.  are ANY other classes this severely limited by the addition of another??  Absor said that the great mana to damage ratio of dots is what makes them so good and cant be stacked.... LOL sunstrike = 400 ish mana for 1600 damage in 6 seconds.. pyro = 400 mana for 2000 damage in 1min30 sec approx.  Add this to the fact that only 1 necro can do this 2000 damage in 1min30 seconds and you start to see the real point.  Adding duplicity of dots would actually be a welcome/good idea not unbalancing as Absor has suggested.<P>From reading this thread it is CLEAR that verant has no real idea of what goes on in the high level game and has no intention of fixing it.  They are satisfied with Necros being a class that can be played with your eyes closed while you play diablo2 on your other computer.  For all other classes that feel this way at raids (Ench/Mage/Druid/Wiz ETC ETC ETC) I AGREE that your roles also need evaluation.  Many necro complaints are also valid complaints of these other classes.<P>Please stop ignoring the REAL issues.<P>Xerexs the Jackass<BR>FoH </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor read carefully what I am about to say so that I am sure you understand.<P>I am a necromancer I have 2 well over 50 necromancers on different servers. I have always been a damage dealing class. One of the best. There isn't a PC class I can't kill in PvP and there didnt used to be any mobs I couldn't land a spell on.<P>Now  I can still kill any class in PvP but any of the uber GOD encounters I am useless.<P>Here is why. Pay close attention.<P>Raid happens, yes I can summon corpses when it goes bad. So they only need me when its OVER not during. This means I have no opportunity for any of the Uber loot. Because my slot is filled by a tank or cleric.<P>Yes Absor as you so grandly put it I can mana dump so I am usefull. <P>Raid happens, I attend, weeeeeeeee I can sit back and dump mana to clerics and such.  150 mana per dump every 8 seconds  god forbid the fight lasts long enough for me to be OOM. But I CANNOT replace the life it takes to make that mana. I use my life force ( you know the stuff in the little red bar that when its empty you take a HUGE loss in very hard to gain exp ) to make that mana. Now I just bond or deflux to replace that life so I can make more mana.  You show me what the h*** I am gonna tap or bond in an Uber encounter. Necro is now low life, mob attacks, Necro's A** is grass cause he has less than 2 bubbles of health and the mob hits him once. <P>So, to sum it up.  Tell me again what my role is in an Uber encounter?<P>If I am a support class, make me a support class like clerics are at Lvl 1. Not after 50 Lvls of being a damage dealer.  Clerics knew exactly what thier role was from lvl 1.  Don't take my role away after 50 lvls and tell me to be happy about it. <P>That is not right or fair.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You guys really need to stop your whining and look beyond your own class.  Every class provides one small aspect to a large scale raid.<P>Clerics provide healing and resurections as their major contributions, with their buffs being almost as major.<P>Necros provide dmf, lifetaps, mana, corpse summoning.<P>Bards provide resists, mana, and now runes too.<P>Chanters provide buffs, some resist debuffs, and mana taps with a bit of crowd control where needed.<P>Warriors provide damage and are the shields for casters.<P>Wizards provide damage when possible but highly resisted.<P>Rogues provide a lot of damage and that's about it, since they don't mitigate much of it very well.<P>Shaman's provide some real nice buffs, debuffs, and a few decent nukes.<P>... the list goes on.  You seem to think that every OTHER class has some major contribution, when in all actuality every class provides one small contribution that makes one big whole.  Perhaps you don't like your role, but who said other people like THEIR roles?  Do you honestly think most clerics enjoy ONLY healing?  Some do, but mostly all I hear is complaints from clerics.<P>Do you think us bards enjoy the fact that all we have to contribute is resists, damage mitigation from runes, and mana?  I sure don't, I know what kind of power my class has, but we're always considered inferior and/or subpar to the parent class.<P>Monks don't have it any easier, their expected to bring the kill in for slaughter when they have an interesting time enough as is trying not to die with their lack of hitpoints and ac (compared to other tank classes).<P>... again, the list goes on.  Stop whining about how useless you think you are and look at the big picture.  Yes, I agree with you, Verant needs to get up off their butt and fix that dot poofing bug.  But until they do, you damn well better start doing what people find usefull in you, because I've been forced to do it ever since level 32, and get dirty looks from people if I don't want to.

All the stupidly high level raidworthy NPCs are immune to lifetaps.  This all the necromancers can do is cast DMF, then sit back and wait for corpse recovery.  <P>But it gets better.

</FONT><HR>Desbarolis:  Not true.  First off you yourself mention lifetaps as our "role".  A huge portion of this thread is about how we can't even use lifetaps on them.  You mention "mana" but neglect to mention that it's such a small amount of mana over such a long time that it's completely insignificant.  You mention DMF as if it's in the same category as a shamans buffing ability.<BR>Yes, we are all a small part of the raid.  The problem here is that necromancers are such a disproportionately small part.  The outcome of a raid would not be affected AT ALL regardless of whether there were 10 necros along or their were 0 necros along.  Our contribution is THAT small.<BR>We can help out for a little bit at the end of a failed raid by summoning corpses and twitching the rez'ers, but most of us necros did not spend thousands of hours building up an offensive caster character to spend 90% of the high lvl game as clean up crew.  The raid aspect of the game is NOT a small part of the game post 50.  It is, rather, the ENTIRE focus of the game post 50.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>I think I have a possible cause for the corpse poofing stuff.<P>First off, under what circumstances, minus the 'dropping off the hate list' thing, can a corpse go poof, that people have mentioned here?  When you go linkdead.  That seems to be a very common one.  When you go linkdead, what happens?  you become an NPC.  There's other circumstances that this happens as well, such as when your charmed, and feared (note the [LD] above peoples names in both circumstances).<P>So here's the situation.  Necro goes on a raid, hits something with a dot, gets feared, dot kills npc.  Poof goes corpse.<P>You may want to try to duplicate this scenario, I've seen it happen before on stuff under level 50.<P>-Desbarolis -- 45th bard<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can the damn n00bies please stop posting in this obviously 51+ raid discussion thread? You *can't* make an argument because you have not had firsthand experience.<P>You have to be an idiot (who never was past 50) to consider the 10 uber levels so negligibly. They take nearly twice the experience points of 1-50 and take *a lot* longer to claw through. Even more importantly, to the level 60 necro, what percentage of his life is the endgame? 100%.<P>Even more amazing are the replies from people who insist that a necro who isn't effective in large-scale encounters because he "sucks." You must have played the necro class a lot longer than all the level 60s presenting actual problems on this thread. Right.<P>Oh and as if a level 45 knows what the hell a large-scale raid is.<P>This is getting out of hand and off the main topics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Even if Mages, Shamen and a lot of other classes got swacked in the 50+ game, Necros ate the most damage. The main problem is the post 50 spells. <P>Did you notice that NO pure melee class saw their role change after 50? While most of the casters saw it change, except for Clerics,Enchanters and Wizards (which are the only USEFUL casters in the late game). Though the Cleric and Enchanter post 50 spells are jokes, except for Clarity 2 and 96% exp Rez. <P>Who is the dumbass who designed the Kunark spells??? The 1-50 spells are EXTREMELY well balanced and on track for the class role. 51-60 spells are either weak, no use or from another class spells who don't fit with the class, with a few (and i mean A FEW spells on track).<P>Necros are good soloer pre-50. It is good. They are not good anymore after 50, not good now. A major change. Verant should do either<P>1) Create Group friendly spells for Necros<BR>2) Give them back the #1 Soloer spot (which they lost)<P>Not both. It would become disbalancing.<P>Next, fix bugs, by gods sake! And remove skellie illusion, so bad we can call that a bug too.<P>With dds acceptable, dots and the ability to create a pet who will not decimate the whole party Necros will be able to do something.<P>Fix Lifetap. The way of fighting of a class is very important. It's the lifesource of the class. Necros fight by toying with their own hps. They can't do it anymore. A resist rate of 60% would be ok. But 95% or so is too much.<P>I don't even play a Necro. My main is a Cleric. But every damn class must have a chance to play and have fun. Turning Necros into a mana battery is just plain stupid. If it was in the "Vision", this is ok, but stupid. <P>You did REALLY bad in desinging the 50+ spells Verant. You now have to change it. Don't say you can't. You can. So do it, and FAST, before the EQ Necro population plummets to nothing. <P><BR>  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044299&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044299&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
