</FONT><HR>  I would just like to point out that quite a few posts refer to issues not covered in the FAQ as far as a "Roleplay" server is concerned. <BR>   Actually, the FAQ seems to have quite a few loopholes in this area, focusing on enforcement and definition of roleplaying rather than what most of the RPers that post here are asking for...<BR>A label, nothing else. <BR>   Call it a "welcome home" sign if you will, for old roleplayers desperate for like company and new roleplayers curious as to what it's all about.<BR>   Why have you not responded to the many points which are not covered in your FAQ? Why wait for so long to close the thread? I have noticed that other threads regarding issues that are considered "dead" are closed relatively quickly. Were you actually reading the posts and considering a response, but never decided on an appropriate one? Or have you simply stopped listening?<P>I want to like you, Verant.<BR>There are many long lasting benefits to befriending the roleplay community here, you will find that they are exceedingly loyal and appreciative. <BR>Throw us a bone, we're not greedy dogs!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

This is not a threat Verant, its a simple fact, Roleplayers like to roleplay, and be in an environment that encourages roleplay. If thats not being provided in EQ they will find somewhere else to go.

</FONT><HR>I said before in the new topic I posted (probably on about page 50 by now) that any reply would do from Verant, as long as it was justified.<P>However, we are not satisfied with the FAQ answer because, not only is it not justified, but it is not what we are asking for.<P>To re-cap, we'd like a server tagged "Roleplaying Preferred". We don't need any roleplaying enforcements, special GMs, code changes or anything special. Just the tag please.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

NOthing.

Still nothing.<BR> They close down a thread ( without comment ) we start another one.<BR>We conduct a POLL on the boards indicating the number of people who support our idea. Still no comments either way.<P>The POLL indicates that there are a good deal of RPers that like our ideas, and I think we deserve an answer Verant.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>More likely they just don't agree with you regarding the solution, and feel that creating such a server in the face of overcrowding on regular servers would not be cost effective.  They may feel that such a tag would be a shout screaming to grief players and power gamers that a new server was available with easy pickings.  Perhaps they feel that regardless of assertion that "we would take it from here" in regards to enforcement of roleplaying, that the assertion is incorrect, and that there would be many, many petitions to deal with all the grief players torturing the roleplayers through purposeful OOC chatter and talk. <P>Maybe they feel they have communicated their reasons sufficiently and have decided to no longer discuss the topic.  <P>But if they were going to close off communication on a topic they usually add a line or two in the faq addressing it.<P>Oh yeah, they did.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There is a thread on the Wishlist board regarding a roleplay server which has been supported by many people, so the poll posted on this board did not even reach some roleplayers. I find it encouraging that more EQ roleplayers have been found! Some interesting points have been brought up on that thread, one of which I will relate here.<P>It was suggested that Verant could have a sort of report system on this server. If we see someone who is definitely NOT roleplaying, we can report him/her. After enough reports, this player's characters could be moved to another server more suited to his gameplay style. I can understand that people will say "but what if he IS roleplaying and its just a different style of roleplaying?" A person would only be reported if he was talking about RL things or people.<P>Anyway, all we really want is the server at the moment, maybe we can send ideas after we get it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>>>>Actually, the FAQ seems to have quite a few loopholes in this area, focusing on enforcement and definition of roleplaying rather than what most of the RPers that post here are asking for...<P>>>>A label, nothing else<P>I've addressed the idea of a "label, nothing else" before.  Unfortunately, it has been shown that without enforcement, some aspects of the player community would not respect the label.  <P>Take these boards as an example.  Flames, name-calling, profanity, and general discourtesy has never been "allowed".  In fact, rules prohibiting such conduct have always been part of the Station Terms of Service.  However, since these rules were not enforced, it wasn't very long before the board was dominated by it's former problems.  Only now, after we've expressly tied account status to the boards and enforced it by means of login restrictions have they started allowing for better discussions.<P>The same issue exists with the idea of an unenforced "roleplay only" server, and since the idea of an enforced roleplay-only server isn't feasible, it's not something that we can do.<P>-Gordon<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

All they are asking is a chance.  I am an occasionall role-player, as the mood strikes me, and would probably start a character on a role-play server for when the mood strikes.  <P>Suggestion to all roleplayers: If and when the next newbie server comes up, advertise the fact that, regardless of what Verant says, it will be considered a role-play server.  Tell all the websites, talk it up here, and in chat, keep people informed.  Even if they don't mark it, if the majority of players were role players, the rest may either join in the fun, or go elsewhere.

</FONT><HR>We have no doubt that there would be players who would wish to try and disrupt the server in the same manner as there are players that disrupt any server.  If they step outside of Verant's policies then they would be dealt with by guides and GMs.  If they do not and yet still try and be disruptive then the same methods YOU YOURSELF ADVOCATE for problem players on the PvP servers would be used by the RPers.  Peer pressure... does that happen to ring a bell?  <P>Your relating an RP server to these boards was picked apart before but I see you still cling to it regardless.  The many RP threads prooved that using mature discussions, by ignoring the wannabe trolls, and by peer pressure you can influence players to act in a mature manner.  We've shown this time and time again in each thread we've started on this issue and yet you still choose to ignore that fact.<P>I noticed you've steered clear of Spaz.2's thread on this issue though.  Could it be because the excuse you're trying to use here is already clearly addressed? <P>I am glad Shomino got a response to his question but I think it's pretty sad that you ignore a thread that addresses the issue in depth day after day after day.  <P>Morgian<P><BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Do 'Enforce' and 'Tag' sound the same or even read the same?  Not in the english language.<P>VI gave PvP'ers what they wanted, and that included code changes, rulesets etc etc.  So a tag, is that a real bad thing to ask for?  Are we really asking for too much?  <P>Time and Time again VI has said that EQ is a, and a quote 'ROLEPLAYING GAME'.   It said it on the box, they say it in the FAQ, they've told us that it is.  But, have we seen any RP support from them?  No, I don't think so.  If they think that the /lfg tag will help, then I am afraid thay are wrong.  yes it will increase the chances of grouping but not for roleplaying.<P>So, instead of canned answers, we need a solid answer with a solid foundation behind not, not an answer quoted from the FAQ.<P>GRRR<P>Thisto</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I think NOT. Then WHY do you think this will happen to a RolePlayer Server?????<P>The ONLY think I can come up with is that you think there are too many 'kids' and 'unrespectful' people on the servers. Well then, if a RolePlaying Server will really get those people to the new server also, wouldn't that be a great opportunity to get rid of those kids?????<P>Abashi, please don't compare pears with apples. IF YOU REALLY want to COMPARE the old messageboard with all the flames then COMPARE it with a ROLEPLAYING Messageboard!!!! See the difference??? The Roleplaying messageboards will never get heated by flames as the occasional flame is done in-character and everyone knows it is a character speaking and not the person behind it. In that way, RolePlayers have a far bigger Buffer against harassment then other players.<P><BR>Please give us the REAL reason Abashi, as the only single profound reason I did get was that by naming a RolePlaying server will say that the other servers aren't for RolePlaying.
