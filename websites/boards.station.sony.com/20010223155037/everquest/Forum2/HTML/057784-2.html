</FONT><HR>Pathing:<P>On this topic here are some dungeons/places where pets are not welcome or tough to use:<BR>Plane Of Hate:  Very tough to use and most raid leaders only allow pets for the Inny fight, and never when moving since the pet takes some ungodly paths and trains everyone.<BR>City Of Mist: Pets take rectangular paths very close to the wall where they agro things.  It is almost impossible to get the pet from one part of the zone to another without having your pet wander off somewhere.<BR>Castle Mistmoore: The whole zone is plagued with mysterious pathing problem, mostly in the castle and on the ranmp going up.<BR>Najena: Many spots cause the pet to not find the path to you (as you are standing near it) and repop somewhere on the first floor.  Linara parlone is heavily bugged when she charms someone, but that has nothing to do with pathing.<BR>Befallen: bottom floor large room with colapsed wall and 3 doors, pet cannot move here without running thru one of the doors then coming out of the other, as low levels it goes off and gets killed.  All for moving a little forward will send it running away.<BR>Kurns Tower dining room (top floor), no idea what the hell goes on here, things run away when you pull, get stuck then pop, run out of the room and come back.  Horrible pathing.<BR>Kaesora: Pet cannot follow in some spots even slowly, at low levels it's suicide, at higher levels a nuissance trying to figure out where your pet just went when it was right behind you saying Following Master.<P>There are a lot more...and I think pathing is the cause of a lot of problems for all pet classes.  MOBs and pets do not behave in a logical way and move in eratic ways biding to the flaws of the unseen architecture.<P>This problem is well known and I do not know if anything can be done...I hope there can be something done.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As to the post about starting another char, I got to 52 with my mage and now I can see that finding groups is almost impossible, soloing is getting harder and harder...I have created other group friendly chars (cleric and bard) and group more.  My mage is a farmer now for these 2 classes, and it is very unfortunate, because I enjoyed playing a mage, but without any real group value post 50 (save for the CoTH) no one wants a mage in a group, wizards do better damage, pets are not strong enough until the epic.  There is a serious power dropoff from 51 until epic.  Velious only made this more obvious.  It is unfortunate, but a short-sighted design rushed by holiday deadline ($$$) has not helped us at all.  I am waiting for something to help us be better at grouping and able to solo past 55... until then I am not holding my breath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings all,<P>I am only 44th at the moment, but I feel it necessary to post to support our class. I hope Absor realizes that although we may be few, we have legitimate concerns.<P>I'm not going to repeat the list of great ideas that have already been presented, but I do want to mention a few that I think need reaffirming. <P>Pet Control - Under most circumstances, I can keep my pet under control. But it would be a nice addition if there were commands to "force" the pet to do what we say. If I give my pet a target to attack, I want it to stay on that target until it's dead. No matter if another monster is pounding his backside. It will be my job to focus his attacks. This would help immensely when working in tight spaces and with enchanters. Along the same lines, it would be nice to have a "park it" command. The pet will not move even if I get hit. I appreciate him wanting to rescue me, but there are times he would better serve his master by staying put. If I need his assistance, I will command him to attack.<P>Mana Recovery - I'm still ok at 44, but with meditation capping out soon and our mana pool still increasing post 50, we need a way at higher levels to offset the additional down time. I think the mana bandages idea have merit. Balance would have to be worked out for amount recoverable and spell cast cost etc.<P>Research - My biggest complaint here is chain researching. I've spent a lot of money and time maxing my skill and gathering components and I don't have my 44th Earth pet due to failures. I'm 3 of 9 for 39th pet and 0 and 3 for 44th. Now I'm broke and frustrated. All I can say is I don't find this very "fun" (it is a game right?) and I'm already dreading the chain research for 49th pets. <P>Pet Health - The blue bar in our hp for our pets sounds great as long as group members can see it. I have no problems using report health, but it gets tiring having to constantly update my shaman partner as to the status of my pet. I can't see this having any effect on game balance, it is just a nice user interface enhancement.<P>Summoning - I agree that nearly all of our summoned weapons are useless. The only weapon I had ever been asked for was the SoR and that doesn't happen now since they fixed it. Considering how few spells we get, it's depressing that nearly 1/3 of our spells are useless. Proccing weapons seem to be the easiest fix... I would be happy even if they were pet only  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Link Death - Please, please implement your idea. Having to spend 10 to 15 minutes resummoning and medding back up after every link death is horrible. All this link death recovery playtime adds up to a considerable amount. Plus my group usually isn't too happy. If another class disappears, they can join back up and start fighting again ASAP. We have to summon a new pet etc to be effective. <P>And here is my idea contribution. I haven't seen it suggested yet. I have no idea how difficult it would be to code but here it is. Give us a spell post 50 that would allow us to assume control of our pets directly. Even if only for a short time (18 secs). Something like the Glimpse spell, but allow us to move the elemental about. Not just see through its eyes. This could be VERY useful in pulling a pet out of a fight or making a pet that is chasing a runner return when he is out of voice range, while avoiding nasty pathing problem areas. I think it would be balanced in that the Mage would still have to be protected while he is "in" his pet, but would make us less of a risk to groups. <P>Just to end on a positive note, I would like to say I am VERY happy with my magician. I have played every class type and a few into their 30's, but the magician has by far been my favorite. I hope Verant will help us keep our role and usefulness post 50 as we are pre 50. <P>Thanks for reading!<BR>Kractic Soulsummoner<BR>44th Magician of Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please re-read Solefarin's post. He did an excellent job.<P>I would like to add that I think Magicians need a complete overhaul. All of our abilities are farmed out to other classes. There is nothing that we can do, that another class can't, yet VI seems very stubborn about giving us other classes abilities or powering up our current abilities to make us stand out. <P>Everyone has pets now, our high level summons are given to other classes, none of our magician only armor drops are nearly as good as other classes armors, our DD spells get resisted all the time, in short no one cares about the Mage. Please assign someone at VI to specifically CARE about this particular class, since it is pretty apparent that right now, no one there does.<P>OH, and btw...<P>/raise</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DOH, I forgot to add this to my post:<P>Bind Wound:<P>Magicians, IMO, should be just as proficiant at Bind wound as monks at all levels, but if you do not agree, at least in line with the priest classes (why do they get it) post 50.<P>Makes sense for mage, and might actually help him, but a shaman would just cast regrowth and be done with it.<P>BW only heals like 30 a time with 100 skill anyways, which means that its about 1/3 of the skill, so it heals about 84 when it max's out at 252.<P>Magicians max out BW at 100 FAR before any other class (other than twinked monks, that is).  Until level 25, I had not even met anyone else my level who had it max'd, other than numerous magician friends.  We used it the most, because we had the best supply: infinite.<P>Why restrict the people who actually USE the skill and give it freely to the people who have NEVER used a bandage in their entire career.<P>Have you EVER met a cleric/druid/shaman who used bandages rather than heals or regens?<P>Niether have I.  Their time is better spent medding and then healing themselves than it is binding.<P>Since we cannot heal in the first place, and our regen is far below theirs, I for one would actually USE bandages when soloing to get myself back up to 50, even 75%hp, then med up, (and since we are inmanaefficient (woot, new word) soloers), by the time I am at full mana (from like 20m(yes, from killing ONE mob), I am also back at full hps (Phantom Armor now has some use at least)<P>I do this now, actually, but it takes me forever to bangage myself up to 50% at 33 or so damage healed every 7 seconds<P>please please please.  I am reduced to begging on this point, because, as opposed to the other topics I have discussed, I cannot prove beyond any reasonable doubt that we should, for balance's sake, get bind wound upgrades.<P>I can prove that from level 50 to level 60 our total offensive power increases a whopping 5%.<P>I can prove that a level 60 mob is 300% as powerfull as a level 50 mob.<P>I can prove that from level 50 to 60 a rogue's offensive power (from the back) triples.<P>I can prove that both warriors and monks double in offensive power from 50 to 60.<P>I can prove that our items suck comparatively.<P>I can prove that the fire pet is nearly useless, unless a level 60 mage wanted to clean out a low leveled dungeon, such as Dalnir.<P>I can provide logs of mages being flat out refused participation in "open" raids on three different zones and servers (a trak raid on Solusek, a VP raid on Veshaan, and a Howling Stones raid on Tunare).<P>I cannot prove that we are not supposed to have all of these deficiencies.<P>-Sol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok, just to sum up for absor, these are the concerns for mages ATM as i see from the posts.<BR>/bump me or add anything if u agree.<P>POST 50 PETS: do not appear to be as useful anymore. specially fire pet. do not appear to advance in line woith out lvl's anymore like they were pre-50.<P>MANA REGEN: we get none. mod rods are not really for us and are a last resort to get one last nuke off. <P>ROOT/SNARE: we get no "escape" spells. <P>NO INVIS WITH PET: i believe this to be major concern. seeing as tho the answer to the no root/snare is usually "you have a pet" running thru zones invis with no ow is not fun.  if we get no root, we should be able to keep our pet.<P>PATHING: major poathing isses on raids resulting in our pet's not being use at all.<P>RESISTS: on Malo line, DOt's etc...i get malaise resisted on green mobs  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>EFFICIENCY: our nukes are not as efficient as others. but we get pet to make up for it. however on raids where pet's are not welcome, our <BR>in-efficiency makes US unwelcome.<P>IMPROVED INVIS: why are we without it?<P>ARMOUR: our mage only items seem to be rater lacking for no apparent reason. Armour quests for high lvl characters have lvl 1 spells on them, or useless mid lvl spells.<P>LOSS OF IDENTITY: shammies have better malo spells. droods, clerics, chanters, necros, and wizies all have pets. <BR>Mokns get our summons on a bracer, many other classes get summon food/water. chanters get "illusion - Elemental" .<P>DD's AND BOTLS LACKING IN POWER: our damage pre-50 seems to be fairly balanced. post-50 is where we lose out. <BR>To qutoe from Prima's OFFICIAL strategy guide for EVERQUEST: Ruins Of Kunark (page 182)<BR>" Magicians also pack fairly good damage spells, second only to the Wizard, in fact."<P>Pre-50 this is true, post 50, we are out damaged by tanks. <P>USEFULLNESS ON RAIDS: pet is useless and as we have said, our DD power isn't that great anymore.<P>FIRE ONLY DD: his is unusual. We are master of the 4 elements, but can only make one element into a DD. strage.<P>DD VS. SUMMONED: This is REALLY silly. our specialzied Vs. summoned spells do less than the normal DD's. they should be doing like 50% more.<P>SUMMONS: I personally use Cornucopia, everfound, SOR, and colstone only. water stone occasionaly. all others i never touch. the campfire thing someone suggested sounded good. a couple of group useful summons would be good.<P>if i've forgotten some (im sure i have) just post em below.<P>final note: can PPL stop saying "Sword of Runes NERF"!! it wsn't a nerf, that swords attributes was a proc against summoned beings ONLY, not against everything. i agree it helped but it wasn't supposed to have been in there anyways. twas a fix, not a nerf.<P>anyways i would really like to hear from absor etc.. about their thoughts on this. ppl are saying the EXACT same things over and over and over. this says to me that EVERYONE has the same problems with the class. The main point i have senn is that the reall problem lies in our post-50 usefulness. it drops dramatically after lev 50.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Damm, Sol, nice post.<P>He's totally correct, Absor.<P>The problem is I see it (the reason we have been left behind) is that we are not constantly screaming to be an uber class.  We are reasonable, and we understood (or thought we did) what our class was about.  Damage, what we spend levels 1 to 50 training for, only to see how useless we are post 50, because of easily remedied restrictions placed on the class.  We are being rational about it, not screaming as we are probably entitled to.  And the number of our voices diminishes every month.  I guess that's why noone bothers to listen.<P>  You promised expanded abilities, raised caps, etc to all classes with the expansions.  We are not asking to be gods; we are asking to for our class to improve between 50 and 60, just like the other classes have been.  I don't see why this is so hard to understand.  Some of us hate to feel useless using a character we've devoted so much time to.  Surely you can understand this, Absor.<P>Thuriniel Zomm,<BR>Angry Mage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Something I thought of while I was playing EQ this afternoon.<P>Rather than implementing a "Pet Fear Immunity Spell", how about this.<P>Coerce<P>Level 34<BR>Mana: 100<BR>Cast Time: 2 seconds<BR>Duration: 5 minutes or 400hps.<BR>Recast Time: 10 minutes.<BR>Effect: The pet will explicitly obey the commands of his master while this spell is in effect, including ignoring attacks made against the Magician or even itself. However, it is not infallible - should the pet receive 500 hps of damage while the spell is active, it will be cancelled.<P>Dominate<P>Level 49<BR>Mana: 200<BR>Cast Time: 2 seconds<BR>Duration: 10 minutes or 750hps.<BR>Recast Time: 20 Minutes<BR>Effect: The pet will explicitly obey the commands of his master while this spell is in effect. However, it is not infallible - should the pet receive 750 hps of damage while the spell is active, it will be cancelled.<P>I can't begin to say how useful this would be, and in fact balanced. During a room break in a dungeon, it is generally chaotic: enchanter is mezzing like mad and people are getting slapped everywhere. It is usually the place of the Mage to hold back from having a pet until things are under control.<P>During a nasty pull or poorly timed repop, pets can cause trouble. There are in insane number of occassions when the pet acts under its own volition when youd prefer it not to. This spell line would allow you some control over it, without making the pet into a drone and hence maintaining the status qup for general pet use. In general play, a Mage would be ill-advised to use this unless it is genuinely needed due to the long recast time.<P>Secondly, after thinking about it for some time, I think this would be a fun and useful addition to the Mage class:<P>Summon Energy<BR>Level 55<BR>Mana Cost: 250<BR>Effect: When cast with a Modulation Rod in hand, the number of charges of Modulation is increased by one, as though the item was 'recharged'. A maximum of 5 charges may be held within a Modulation Rod.<P>This can pretty much be done now, by giving meleers etc in your party or raid rods, but its awkward and not very useful. There's no "free" mana involved here, and its in fact LESS efficient than just casting an additional rod.<P>It would, however, extend the role of a Magician as a storer of magic into the physical. Mod Rods are good, dont get me wrong, but at Level 55, does an additional 150 Mana really do that much in a pinch?<P>Another idea of course could just be a m rod upgrade, but this would be more fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are several classes that don't get groups.  I was in Lake of Ill Omen last night and there were several Rangers that couldn't get groups either.  Not a single group wanted a Ranger or Magician.  Maybe we should stop looking for groups that don't want us and start trying to form groups that are the unloved and unwanted classes, not letting the other classes in.<P>I realize that finding groups post-50 won't be a problem for me because of the guild I'm in.  About half the people in my guild are pet fairing classes.  It's unfair that some classes are left out of groups.  Magicians can offer lasting power to a group.  No one would need to buy food, water, bandages, or arrows.  Any other pet classes can have a continued supply of weapons when their pet dies.  If the damn tanks could ever figure out which one is going to get hit, we could offer a GOOD damage shield.<P>When I'm on as my magician, I don't want to be ANON because I'm proud of my level.  This also works as a henderance because the same people that don't want a magician grouping with them also bugs magicians for food, water, bandages, and arrows.  A group damage shield would be good for a magician because we wouldn't have to figure out which tank to cast it on.  The problem is that Verant would give us a little 4 or 5 point damage shield if they gave us any at all, claiming anything else would be unbalancing the class.  I think a GOOD group damage shield would help us a little in finding a group.<P>Also, the Malise line of spells is useless.  I, in no way, am willing to spend 60 mana on something that most likely will fail.  If this spell cost something like 10 mana, hell ya.  If Malise cost 10 mana to cast, I'd use it as a pulling spell, I wouldn't mind it failing sometimes in that case.<P>Ok, as someone mentioned, why in the hell are we limited to 100 skill limit with bind wound.  This isn't a really big balance or class issue, but it just doesn't make sense.  We use Bind Wound more than any other class in the game, including Monks.<P>The pathing problems have been in a lot of the zones since day one.  You guys at Verant should know by know where they are.  I attack a mob in Lake of Ill Omen and it turns and runs at full speed in the opposite direction.  In other areas, I'll blast a mob and it'll vanish completely.  In Najena, I'll sit down and rest after killing Magicians for my focus items and my pet will disappear.  I don't even walk around for this to happen.  After about a minute or two, my pet will walk out of one of the corridors.  If it wasn't for being so high in level, my pet would train half of Najena.<P>You guys also talk about areas that we don't visit.  Hello, it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.  Splitpaw is WAY too far from anyplace for classes without Bind Affinity to get a bind.  The entire island of Odus sucks, after about level 4 anyone there has to travel to Qeynos to get experience or die at the hands of the Heretics guarding the higher level spawns on the other side of the river.  Heretics have to leave at about level 8 because there is nothing left to attack.  Kerra Ridge has serious problems with trains.  I tried fighting there.  I would attack and almost kill one mob and it would run and pull others.  You would say group with someone, ok, WHO?, the last of the people left the island at level 8 and you need to be about level 12 to handle the mobs.  I see people in Befallen all the time, at the upper level.  It's not because no one can pick the lock or get the key, it's because the mobs are so close together down there the they can pick each others teeth.  Najena has a similar problem, too many areas where mobs are too close together.  Instead of giving us some tiny experience boost for fighting in the areas no one visits, why not do a survey asking us why we won't fight in those places and try and fix it.  As for Odus, there's very little you can do to fix it besides adding more zones to it.<P>Sorry for the length of the post, I had to vent a little.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     A type of spell that could effect some sort of control over the environment through the manipulations of the elements would not only be a defining ability of the mage, but a way to balance a mage's previous ineffectiveness in certain situations.<P>Control Water  Usable when in water (Swimming in the lake or ocean, kedge, various bodies of water)  <P>Control Earth  Usable in dungeons, where walls, floors and ceilings are dirt or stone, also in open zones, to manipulate the ground (earthquake, fissure)<P>Control Fire  Usable wherever a soure of fire <BR>(lava, open flames) can be found<P>Control Air  Usable wherever a large enough volume of air could be used forcefully<P>    Some abilities like this would be welcome by most players in the game, as they would not only benefeit the mage but finally give him something positive to contribute to an epic or large encounter, and many other different types of situations a mage could run across in his abventures around Norrath.<P>    This concept could be utilized in more than 4 spells, as different attributes of the elements could be manipulated with varying effects (e.g. gasping breath: an air element spell that deprives the target of oxygen.  Blistering winds: an air element spell that blows the target back several yards.  Solidify water: make a section of water solid like ground for a duration.  Whirlpool:  create a vortex that damages and pulls back the target.)<P>    You could also have different combinations of the elements working together in a spell, such as a spell that heated the water or air, or a spell that liquefied earth.  Spells made along these lines would be the types of spells that real masters of the elements could perform. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We need better pets, more pets with totaly diffrent abilities, pets that would be so extremly useless in most places, but in some places totaly awesome. <BR>Example: New Airpet version, hit for a quarter of noraml airpet, but cast its stun every 6 sec (instead of 12 like normal Airpet).<BR>I am sure there is many good examples of totaly diffrent pets.<BR>But overall our post 50 pets need to get better, since mages depend 100% of having a good pet we acctually get supernerfed post 50, especially since the new melee weapons are totaly got 100% upgrades, most of the best pre kunark weapons aint not even worth to use as twink weapons anymore, and our pets get to hit for like 2-4pt more at L60. This make us totaly useless against big mobs.<BR>The same argument works with our DD, our DD really need an upgrade.<BR>Char should max out at 790.<BR>SoS should max out at 995.<BR>Seeking Flame should max out at 1200.<BR>Ofcourse the manacost would be raised to match the dmg ratio.<BR>These numbers would be more fit DD upgrade, especially since the hp of kunark and Velius mobs in many cases doubled.<P>We need better item summonings, and please, this time make them unique to us and don't put them on the first melee armour you can think of. I want summoning that would want a mage welcome in a group. I am not exactly sure what items this should be, but some unique items would be nice.<P>As many before me have said, our item dropped stuf need a look over too...  Summon bandages..  Summon sword of runes????? A no stat staff with a L44 (then most people that can get the staff allready have a better version) self only buff that last 40mins and still take the same amount of Cats eye agath...   This is a cruel joke and nothing else. The sad part is that there is only 1 or 2 items that really are nice for a mage that is uniqe to him, compared to other classes that have alot of good items.<P>There also a few of our spells that need a adjustment.<BR>The Dots, you can adjust them by removing them  or make the L44 do 800 dmg for same mana and the L55 do 1100 for the same mana.<BR>We could use upgrades to our pet heal.<BR>We could use a higher level Mod rod, with maybe unlimited charges (but maybe 2min recast) , or atleast 2-3 charges.<BR>A fast casting verion of call of the hero would be nice too, 200 range, 3 sec cast. This might be a spell that might make a mage one wanted groupmember.<P>We I truly wish and in a way don't care how they tweek the classes is to make a mage a needed groupmemeber. <BR>The biggest flaw with EQ post 50 is that the game turn to a Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter game.<BR>Somthing is very wrong then nothing else really is needed, and if it is needed it is only one or two times during a raid or camp.<BR>A group without a chanter should be as effective as a group without one, ofcourse they would have to chose a diffrent playstyle, but in the long run both groups should get as much exp.<BR>Melee classes might have had valid complains pre 50 about they are to weak, but the balance issue now is much worse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmm might take some coding but...<P>One way to improve magician pets would be to make them be able to summon very powerful pets (IE much stronger than they currently are post 50), but only in an environment where it would make sense.<P>For example, in solusek B or in skyfire mountains, summoning a fire elemental would give us a very big and powerful fire elemental, while the other pets would retain the same strength as they do currenly  post 50. (could even make it so that the water elementals are weaker than normal in this environment, as a trade off)<P>In the hole, summoning an earth elemental would give us a very powerful pet.  Although summoning an air elemental would give us a very weak pet. (again as a trade-off)<P>heh, fire elementals wouldnt be too hot in velious but...not like we use em anyway<P>Now, to take it even further, some dungeons may have more power than others in a certain element.<P>For instance, lower guk/old sebilis seem like places where water elementals would have a slight advantage, where as in kedge keep they would have an enormous advantage. <P>Not saying this second part has to be done, but it should be considered because otherwise we'll run into some "no element" dungeons that are very popular for us magicians to go to (such as sebilis and lower guk) where we will see no <BR>increase in power.  <P>Another solution to this problem, however, would be to make the "monster summoning" pets rule supreme in the "no element" dungeons.<P>Anyway, just some food for thought to make the magician class more fun.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>    I've done some thinking about the weaknesses of the mage class in relation to many of the other classes in the game, and I have som eideas that would benefit mages and groups that invite mages.<P>    1)  To sidestep/eliminate the pathing issue with pets, you could simply have all mobs con indifferent to the pet (and only the pet).  No unwanted aggros even if pet is lost.<P>    2)  Mage dmg with dd's and bolts should scale up in dmg, efficiency, and reduced resistance to place him back between the druid and wizard.<P>    3)  Mage DOT is not in line with the character of a mage.  They never had one at lower levels, why do they need one at higher levels?<P>    4)  My suggestion on the root/stun issue with mages would simply be to simplify the pet types, rather than add new pets with new abilities.  For one, they should always be "better" than necro pets, as necros have many talents that mages could never hope to have, and thus don't need to depend on their pets as much.<BR>        a)  Eliminate earth and air pets entirely<BR>        b)  add hps to fire and water, and a cold-based damage shield to water<BR>        c)  Give magician root (element earth) and stun (element air) as spells, as opposed to spell effects by pets.<BR>        d)  Increase dmg output of the pets to scale up with other pc's post-50.  Pets shouldn't out-melee a warrior, but should come somewhere between a rogue and a ranger. (not counting backstab)<BR>        e)  Increase proc rate on pets.  It still seems a bit low, especially at higher levels.  I had an air pet dual wielding gnoll hide lariats, and couldn't stun a malised drolvarg even once.<P>    5)  The 2 sec emergency Decoy with a very high taunt is a good escape idea, and seems to be in line with a magician's character.<P>    6)  Malise-type spells shouldn't be resisted as much as they are, but your call.<P>    7)  Cool summoned items --  your call.  Mags specialize in dmg dealing via pets and dd's, the summoned stuff is secondary in my eyes.<P>    8)  Invis and improved invis is not out of line with a mag's talents (air based, not to mention the shadow men are invis, and reek of summoning   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  )<P><BR>    This is about all I can think of right now, some of it has already been said, some hasn't.  Thank you.<P>                               Jochan Galadar<BR>                                Tribunal Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>With all my time invested in EQ, and with a large part of that time invested in my Mage, I felt obligated to cooment.  I must say that I have read a lot of great things here by people that truly have taken time to learn and understand the Mage class.  I'll try to be as focused as they have been.<P>Pets:  Really not a lot that I can add here.  I loved the pre-50 pets, when you could get them.  I personally had to have a 53rd Mage make mine, when I was 49th, because I couldn't research worth a darn.  I mainly had avoided research because of the Chain issues involved, making it tedium for me, not fun.  And then it disappeared after 50, so no real need.  I actually wouldn't mind paying the penalty of having neglected it.  Look at putting it back in, and rethink some of the drops for post-50 pets.  54 Water comes to mind.  Maybe if we could research it, we would be a bit happier and feel we all had a shot on it.  As it is, I get offers from Mages selling their souls if I have a spare copy of that pet.<P>Fire Pets, post 50.  No need to add anything here.  Please look at them.  Amazing to me that this pet made it past QA, but I have actually found uses for it.  Well, I take that back.  I rely on the 49th pet in special situations (CoM for the Shaman Epic Battle).  52 has 0 use, except in Nektulos Forest where all the new Dark Elves are suitably amazed that anything that large and made of Lave can stink that much.  58 I haven't cast yet, as I am only 56th level, but I have heard in conversations with other Mages that it is no better.<P>Other pets post 50 could use some looks.  Alternatively, give us a way to keep them alive a bit longer, IE, Phantom Armor line castable on Pets perhaps, better heals (I can see one at 39, and another at 49 being ideal).  Also, since SoR no longer procs on everything, which I agree was a bug, add some Summonned No Drop Proccing weapons.  Make them situational if this helps, IE, one Procs Ward Summoned, etc etc.<P>Spells:  Yikes, this could get insanely long.  I think one thing that concerns me, and I know this can be construed as whining, is that everyone gets to summon everything now.  I still can't melee, backstab, or heal though, let alone cast SoW or buff people.  I think this was a good idea taken too far.  If the armor and gear would summon similar things without being carbon copies of our summons, this would have gotten better reception from the Mage community.<P>DoTs:  DoTs?  Why?  Okay, MAYBE I can make the leap here, I sorta do like them.  Except they aren't all that usefull really.  If we are paying the penalty of obscene casting times, up the damage.  I don't want to be a Necromancer, but if you are going to give me DoTs, make them effective, and not something to fill a spell level.  Also, they do have a knockback component.  Super, that means an extra resist, and if either fail, the whole spell fails.  So basically I cast a spell that takes longer, is resisted more, and does the same damage as the DD for that level?  Bleh is all I can say there.  I load this spell in exaclty one dungeon.  SolB.  Why?  Cause out Fire based are basically useless there, and I feel driven to fill all 8 Spell Gems.<P>Which brings me too....<P>Did I miss the other Elements?  And why base one entire line on Magic?  We are Elementalists.  We work the Elements.  Air, Water, and Earth (Although the Shock of line can be taken that way) have been left out of our arsenal.  Add them in please.  Some Water/Ice DDs or a Bolt even (Ice Ball), some Air stuns and DDs.  This has been mentioned, and bears restating.  It's that important to us as the 'Masters of the Elements'.<P>Overall pre 50, it's hard to touch this class.  Solo, group, self sufficient, it's a wonderful life.  Post 50 is not.  I have actually gotten tells that go like this:<P>Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01 tells you, "I see you are 55th, do you have CotH?"<BR>You tell Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01, "Nope, still haven't seen it drop"<BR>Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01 tells you, "Okay, NM"<P>When I got the spell, for an undisclosed ridiculous amount, now the conversations are this way:<P>Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01 tells you, "I see you are 56th, do you have the spell CotH?"<BR>You tell Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01, "Yeppers"<BR>Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01 tells you, "Cool, we are doing a Royals raid in Chardok and need someone to bring in late comers and re-enforcements.  Interested?  Can't use your pet though, too many trains"<BR>/ignore Uber_Raid_Coordinator_01 <P>Heartbraking to me to see my class reduced to this.  I feel like the Teleporter in Star Trek.  Move poeple around and never get the credit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Please look at adding more to this, or alternatively, making it so that other things measure up to the rest of the group so that we can contribute in other ways.<P>The Root/Snare issue:  Okay, my fellow Mages, you really don't *need* this line of spells.  You know when you have bitten off more that you can chew.  Simply leave.  Run, Gate, whatever.  If you stay to see if you can turn the tide of a close fight, you are making your own trouble.  I've made it to 56th without it, never really felt the need for it, and still don't.  Besides, I don't think it's ever going to happen.<P>I've mentioned a few new spells in passing that I'd like to see.  I won't pretend to be able to create spells for my class that are balanced.  If I had my way, we'd get a 1000 point nuke with an instant recast time and that cost 50 mana or so.  So I won't say what I want specifically, just generally.  As I already did that in passing, I feel no need to restate it.<P>Epic:  I'm close.  I'm darn close.  I need the Torch from CoM and the Staff from Inny.  So am I close?  I heard drop rates on the Staff went up.  Cool, I'll know soon, he's in my sights.  Torch is a matter of getting it to drop.  No biggy.  Was this epic hard?  Insanely.  I'm in a Guild that is one of 2, maybe 3, on my server that can clear Sky enough to get the Crown, which in my opinion is the hardest by far of any item to get.  Please re-evaluate the Epics, and I think all of them deserve to be revisited.  Not just Mages.  I know I'd be mad if I killed CT and Inny and got a stick with a Duck on the end of it as a reward.<P>Gear:  I could write volumes here as well.  Take the Ranger person off the Mage gear and get someone dedicated to at least an INT caster to make the stats on our gear.  As it is, looks to me that someone said, right before Gold on both Kunark and Velious, 'Oh, geez, anyone add any Mage gear?'.  Then you all ran about and tossed something together in an afternoon and called it good.  It isn't.  Please compare, ours with other classes and really ask if it is balanced.  And DO NOT NERF other classes, just make it an even playing field.<P>A bit of rambling, but Mages are prone to do that.  We talk mostly to our pets anymore, and even they aren't around all that long to give us solace  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  .<P>Fhyre<BR>56 Mage<BR>Bertox<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First, thank you for opening a forum for magician class characters.  As I have stated in other posts, I am an upper-40's player, so I cannot comment on class balance post 50.  As to the remainder...<P>SUMMONS:  We have some nice utility items and fixing the LD issue would make mages, other players, and even the trees happy.  Please undo the horrible LD nerf and restore some usefulness to our summoned containers, etc.  As to weapons, this continues to remain the biggest "spell" white elephant in the game.  To play on Churchill's words:  Never has so much, been done by so many spell designers, to accomplish so litte.  These weapons were/are a disaster, and clogging magician spell lists with such rubbish is sad.  Please sack the weapon designers and replace them with the folks designing all that cool warrior armor in Kunark/Velious.<P>RAIN:  Fixing the pet absorbtion issue will give some level of usefulness to a line of spells that has been misunderstood and fairly disappointing.  I would concur with most mages that the resists on these spells are outrageous.  I'm looking forward to working more with this line once the pet is out of the equation.<P>WEAPONS:  A topic so nice, I had to mention it twice.  Look in the dictionary under the term "useless" and you will find pictures of several mage summoned 2HB staves/daggers/swords.  Even Webster's knows the score here.  Stronger weapons, pets only, seems like a nice compromise here.<P>PET HEALING:  An upgrade would be very nice. Enough said.<P>IMPROVED INVIS:  It does appear that every other casting class has a form of this spell but mages.  This is squarely a balancing issue.  Please add this spell at the appropriate level on par with the others.  Thanks.<P>REGENTS:  It would be nice to not have to carry around a backpack full of regents for my armor.  A minor issue, but would help.<P>PET HEALTH:  I love the idea of a pet health bar that everyone can see.  It would be an incredible addition to the game.<P>GEAR:  This is definitely a balancing issue.  Please sack the folks designing the mage equipment in Kunark and Velious (probably the same folks who designed the "summoned worthless weapons" line).  I would also suggest these people be replaced with the fine folks turning out that cool fighter's gear.  Since you're adding all of our spell effects to warrior gear, perhaps you could give us a robe that lets us have a kick attack. *smile*  Seriously, the upper end equipment really does seem in need of some tuning.<P>I hope that Verant will take the time to repair these persistant shortcomings in this class.  As I see it, part of balance is not just giving a class similar numbers of spells, equipment, etc.  But instead, spells and equipment should be of use to the class wielding them.  <P>While I, like many mages have accepted that we are deprived of many things available to other classes (teleports, sows, escape spells like snare and root), we were designed to be the masters (I emphasize MASTERS) of summoning.  Of the three things mentioned in parenthesis above, the classes that possess those skills, in one form or another, also possess the pets we so cherish.  If we are to be "deprived" of the utility spells of other classes, we should be the undisputed entities of summoning and some of our summons should indeed be downright amazing.  I did not forstay running everywhere (often at non-sow speeds) and living with the idea that if Jaobner bites it I am usually not far behind, so that I could summon bags that eat items and weapons I can't give to a level 1.  Whoever designed the magician class seems to have treated the class summons like we had everything everyone else had and that summons were surplus, when in fact, we should be unparalleled in this field.  People should look at our summons and say "Wow, that is amazing, I wish I could summon those."  To wit magicians can reply, "Why yes, my hand grenade is a marvelous summons, but your ability to Teleport is equally amazing, I guess we are balanced, but in our own way."  I was happy to see you open a summons thread last month and I hope that something comes of it given it is what defines our class...And we seem to be lacking badly in focus here.  Notwithstanding all the issues mentioned, I continue to believe magicains have incredible potential (especially the level 4-50 game) and I still play magicians almost exclusively (since launch).<P>Thank you again for your consideration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
