</FONT><HR>I am sorry all of povar.  This server is just crazy. I bought EQ to roleplay.  My friends played on this server, so i joined it. I was not aware this was ONE of the servers that HATES roleplayers.  Many of GM activated quests are screwed up by our people.  Someone mentioned  the tiny SG quest. It had a story, and plot.  But high lvls decided HEY! I wanna kill them.  There was the recent Young Dragon quest.  The dragon told people to help it. Some people tried to find out.  Others were #%$##%ing idiots and  decided to attack it.  This was fine with me ...but many were HE, WE, Gnomes, and other races.  <BR>I dont know when i will, or if i will...or even if i can.  I will miss my friends alot when i leave.  This game is for fun, how I enjoy myself is through Roleplaying.  I was listening to some guilds one day, and they were saying roleplayers are ruining this game. They were saying this and that.  These were big guilds.<BR>Also why I want to quit is the planes/dragons.  These are OWNED by big guilds.  Infact they have days that a guild can go into it.  It's awful.<BR>One more reason.   Our server is so mean.  One day I lvl'd, soloed my way through thirty in lower guk and upper guk...well mainly solo'd it.  When i dinged ppl yelled at me.  Told me to leave the zone. Told me to go here or there. Told me I was to low lvl.  They just hurrayed some guy who lvl'd from harvesting items, but when I earn my own they yell at me... <BR>As I said I dont know if i will leave. Friends are important, and dont know if i could restart.  But I might. Many ppl will prolly miss me.  or hopefully.  One reason I want to stay is that i know ppl.  Also this server needs some RPers to stay. <BR>If I do I will also miss my 'give aways'.  If you are a newbie you prolly know what i mean.  I would go to a zone with ppl in the zone and give away stuff.  Stupid stuff from ringmail, money, to bigger stuff like bronze, magical items, and others.<BR>This is a roleplaying game. Some people should start.  Or at least not ruin it for us that do. I can stand a server with low RPing, but one that yells at the RPers is to much.<P>Grephyn Griffinknight<BR>Holy knight of the 31 circle of honor<BR>Darkbahamut<BR>Illusionist, of the 10th circle of deception<P>PS: Feel free to reply.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I totally understand why you are thinking of leaving this server, please dont though cause we need the few roleplayers here to bring at least some enjoyment to the game.<P>I have also sometimes tried to get yelled at or heard someone not liking the roleplaying factor on this server.<P>One example was in the guard room in high keep, (you know, the place where people is being writen on a list for like 6 hours to join the group there). Two warriors of the 20´th circle met and started greeting eachother in a noble and polity manner, and an unamed dwarf simply said "I puke at thee talking"...hmmm<P>I like roleplaying and I respect those who dont wanna roleplay (which is more than 90% of the population on this server) BUT WHY DO THEY HAVE TO RUIN it for those who would like to roleplay?<P>Please stay and keep roleplaying, put the unpleasent ones on an ignore list and explore the world with your fellow roleplayers.<P>Daeniz<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am going to stay on. This server WILL not ever be rid of us!  Roleplayers must stay. I know some people out there just to make life miserable .  I think postulate is a self proclaimed anti- RPer, but don't know if he was joking.<P>Brothers, sisters.  We must gather.  The forces are gathering, and we are weakening.  We no longer see eachother , we only see everyone as the enemy, unless we know them personally.  Gather! To destroy the evil.<P>OOC: I really think anon should have player guild tags.  I was once in a group of full 'roleplayers' , or thats what i saw with their names purple.  I got seriously yelled at for trying to roleplay.  I thought that name tag could help...guess not.<P>As some others said, its not the lack of RPing, its the admonishing and putting RPing down thats bad. Unfortunately the only true RP servers are the PvP ones.<P>Grephyn Griffinknight<BR>Evilbahamut<P>PS:Thanx to the people who replied, my RL friends, and other people who gave me tells.  I'd say their names, but afraid of embarassing them....heheheh.  Remember this game is for enjoyment.  I once ran through L-guk just to explore live side, and make a sell. I died twice , and boy is it fun hearing lots of creatures after you, and the adrenaline when your trying to find your corpse in a dark cave, no light...NOW thats whats RPing is about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, brother Grephyn is right.  If we leave, then they(Anti-Rper's) win.  We need to stay and Carry on the Flame of Roleplaying!  I believe that we, as a whole cohesive force can lick this and form a niche on our poor downtrodden oppressed Server.  My Warrior, Doromain would like to Pull as many RP'ers together to form a Specialized Guild.  Heart and Soul.  Those things which we as roleplayers Embody in our characters.  These Characters Live and breath in our minds, so why not in the Game.  We can then formulate and encourage roleplaying events of our own, and take part in the GM run quests.<BR>   I refuse to allow another travesty of the steamfont and Butcherblock Hammer Events happen again.

</FONT><HR>Greetings folks,<P>I wanted to say a few lines here.  Not meaning to offend anyone, so please take this post with a grain of salt.<P>I play on the Bristalbane server.  I have seen quite a few folks roleplaying here.  Even ones without the roleplay tag turned on.  I used to NOT like roleplaying, however did not become upset because others did it.<P>Since I have been on Bristalbane, I have learned to enjoy roleplaying.  I now have 5 of my 8 characters set to roleplay.  I have not set the other 3 to RP yet because I have not yet developed a background story for them yet.<P>I plan to visit all of the servers and spend a decent amount of time on each, to determine what my favorite servers are.<P>Right now, Bristalbane and Quellious seem to have my vote.<P>As a side not, Brell Serilus (sp) is said to be one of the un-offical roleplaying sites.  I have made 3 characters there, but have yet to bring them to life there.<P>I can keep you posted if you like.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately if Verant did do something , like getting rid of the jerk RPers, they would get only 50 players.  Exageration.  Lots of us are nice, and I try to help as much as i can.  I don't like seeing ppl leave this game, its fun, its like RL.  Unfortunately, in RL theres jerks to, and i hate to see ppl hurt in RL too.  I give stuff away, hoping ppl dont become greedy.  Very rarely do I get someone who begs me after my first time of giving.<BR>And I do  remember you Hapi.  Nice seeing you again.<P>Grephyn Griffinknight<BR>31st pally of Mithaniel Marr<P>PS: DO NOT read my rave about harmonium, it was very late when i wrote that, so didn't truly know what i was doing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum22&number=22&thisthread=000134&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum22&number=22&thisthread=000134&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
