</FONT><HR>Soooooo how long until you fine folks at Verant look into your precious vison and remove Celestial Elixer? This is the actual effect on the Breastplate of Stability. The actual spell is a 4 second cast for 300 mana. <P>How about instead of virtually rendering the item useless you could create a new spell that stops once the person is full HP? I know it would involve a little more work but should be mostly a copy and paste of Celestial Elixer with one health check. That would eliminate the "overpowering effect" that your developer posted. Shouldn't take your dev guys more than a day to implement. I mean we all know you guys dont test anyhow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know why VI even makes these notification of nerf threads... they don't respond on them, they don't do anything to react to the players complaints...  All it does is let some players vent and other players hop on the bandwagon with their low level character, contemplating quitting even though they're 35 levels away from ever obtaining an item they probably would have never seen anyway.<P>I do agree that the BP was overpowered, but a 1 minute cast time does make it useless (you could cast and med the mana back in that much time, with enchanter and bard aboard)  Why not put a symbol spell there instead, save the clerics some cash on reagents and downtime mana?<P>Then again, I'm just talking to myself here, since VI doesn't really care now that the nerf stick is coming down.<P>&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm pretty sure that everyone is sick of it. <P>All in all we suffer for your mistakes reguardless of how hard the game is or you want it to be. Bottom line is leave peoples characters and their items alone, you can nerf new drops. IE: Guise of the deciever.

</FONT><HR>Well ... <P>1) Yes as a matter of fact this BP must be nerfed i agree. <P>I don t know how you all are playing but i spend the last couple days getting XP in seb and i ended calling my PoG BP "BP of boredom" with a little bit of attention u can keep your group healed with it by using it 90% of the time using your mana for emergency heal on enchanter etc... With Clarity 2 and PoG BP sitting and medding is needed after and only after buffing the group ( can even do most of it for cheap with hero bond and naltrons mark / donal s leggs )<BR>Cleric isn t basicly the most "Fun" class to play this BP make it even more boring as it is right now . In Big Raids it s still usefull but much powerless . But ...<P><BR>2) It need to be "balanced" not nerfed to death !<P><BR>1 min casting time is INSANE ! i didn t really liked the changes made on Donal s BP but it could be worse ... 30 sec casting time isn t that bad ... not beeing able to cast effect on the same target for 7.5 min is a bit long but still "usefull" . 60 seconds for a CE on PoG/Quest BP when CH take 30 second on donals !?!?!? isn t it something wrong here ?<P><BR>3) Removing CE BPs from the game will just make every clerics more mad than they already are so why ?<P>since you nerfing it why taking it away from lots of us who could want it anyway ? <P>So in conclusion :<P>   1-&gt; make an "intelligent" nerf and nerf PoG/Quest BP the way you nerfed Donal s BP ( give us cleric a "It could be worse" feeling.<BR>   <BR>   2-&gt; Do not remove it from the game and frustrate so many people.<P>   3-&gt; Use your brain and TEST itens before puting them in the game ( unless u like crisis )<P>   4-&gt; Since we all know you don t really care about 1 2 and 3 at least make this new BP usefull and give it Aegolisme !<P>Rakarth<BR>55 cleric .Rising Ascension<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I really tire of this crap. I have always heard its part of the risk verse reward statement. Every nice reward a cleric has to look forward to gets nerfed so we have alot of risk with Crappy reward that gets taken away. Whats next you gonna take away our right to even cast dmg spells  because we are over powered. I'm sorry I play a cleric and I know i'm not over powered and i see it everytime I play. The fact your changing this and not giving those clerics with the BP a choice to change them out for the new ones makes you look bad. I sure wish you would fire those monkies they have working for you and try hiring some real smart people. Monkies are only good to pick there butts like the ogres.<BR> <BR> I will not be leaving this game over this nerf but I really look forward to the next game that takes your place. The people with games in the making are probably reading your boards and laughing their behinds off at you. Saying Hey look these idiots are so dumb they are chasing their player base away. They are sending them right to our door. But on a good side these companies are learning from your dumb ideas and unbalancing mistakes.<P> Oh yeah if your getting all your ideas for cleric armor from some idiot thats lvl 51 and in an uber guild then he is really stupid for making items he knows will be taken away. He probably makes them so he can tell his guild about them and they load their clerics up and use them to go kill the UBER mobs that most people dont get a chance or will never get a chance to see. Why must you continue to hurt the small people because you cant outsmart the big guilds. Thats wrong and you know its wrong so get a FREAKING CLUE.<P>/auction Petroleum Jelly. Cleric only. Effect lubrication. Give tells with offers.<P>Thanks for nerfing me yet again. <BR>A very Angry Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gee, I dont know about you but if you have had to split this thread three times in the past three days I would say you have most likely pissed a lot of people off.<P>Who ever the idiot was who decided that it was best that they put a one minute casting time on this BP has no clue. Being locked onto one target for the better part of a minute is an eternity. IN the time that it takes to use this spell I can cast it from my mana pool, sit down and med, and have more mana and free time than using the BP now. Did you even consider that the people who use the BP are no longer fighting orc pawns in EC? I have been on major encounters where the mobs are dealing out close to 2k damage per round. 300hp is a drop in bucket!<P>Absor do they actually pay you money to do this job, or do they pay you in fruit loops or chicken? As it stands now you are overpaid because your lack of forsight is going to cost Verant in terms of revenue.<P>Did I mention I think Shadowbane is going to be a really good game?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Firstly I would like to say that my main character is an Enchanter and although I do have a lvl 51 cleric I havent even got my Hate BP yet let alone a PoG BP. I am therefore no expert with respect to clerical duties post lvl 50. However there are a few point I would like to make:<P>1) There is an old saying in customer relations "Under promise and Over Provide". This basically means dont get your customers hopes up by promising them things to later disappoint them. The issue of nerfs is very similar. If you give someone something and then take it away they are going to be badly upset. Quite frankly after all the previous times that Verant have done this I would have thought they would have learned this lesson. But NO. They are so busy getting us to buy their new expansion they have not play tested it properly. Quite Frankly if Ford or GM released a car with the amount of testing Verant do they would have been sued out of business ages ago. Verant if you dont get this right people will be leaving as soon as the next viable alternative comes out.<P>2) The Veliuos uber mobs are way too tough without these BPs. They need to be nerfed in line, ASAP not in 6 months time when you get round to it. <P>3) Stop packing more and more HPs into mobs. All this means is that more and more people have to be in a zone to kill them. This causes LDs which you know all about, (but of course they are nothing to do with you, all our ISPs are at fault, they all just happen to drop at the same time!) Do something creative to allow 1 or 2 teams to defeat a situation and not just rely on mass numbers and brute strength all the time.<P>4) Balancing is a JOKE it doesnt address the most fundemental problem. The whole group game is geared around 3 main classes. Cleric - even after nerfing and giving druids and shaman heal, Warrior - some other melees will do, and Enchanter. Although now post 55 Enchanters are becoming glorified buff boxes and quite frankly the only classes required are a mass of warriors and a few clerics. Your vision has gone squiffy. Someone at Verant need to sit down and put on some glasses to get things back into perspective and SOON.<P>I have read most of these posts and to the person who said post 55 characters are a pain to Verant I would tend to agree or that is at least the impression they are giving. <P>Please someone send Verant to the optician to check our their collective Vision, before you end up running into a brick wall.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Well, my last few cleric friends should be headed out the door right about now.<P>About the ONLY way they could redeem this would be to introduce a group Aegolism on the new BPs...

</FONT><HR>I will start off with i am a 60 lvl Cleric and do have one of these BPs from PoG. I do not think that this item is overly powerful considering the level of MOBs fought in Velious. I have been in numerous battles since being the 1st on my server to obtain this BP. 5 Traknon raids 3 of which resulted in death and not one cast from BP. Giants in Kael where I was the only cleric left with a warrior at the end of battle, and yes was chain casting BP and OOM. Being that any general high end mob hits for more damage than the BP can heal time wise it only lead to certain death not the killing of a mob with warrior/cleric.The item helps no doubt, but does not define the outcome of battles won and lost.<P>The main use of this BP was saving downtime, allowing myself and other clerics to throw in occasional manaless heal thus saving downtime.<BR>The boring life of a cleric having to sit med, buff,med, heal,med is not fun. This item was more like a mana recovery item allowing clerics less downtime, somewhat like all the other caster classes have.<P>Changing this BP to a utility spell, such as Inv, Aegolism, or any buff wont solve the problems of downtime for the Cleric class. While these effects could be said to be handy, they defeat the purpose of the BP. DOWNTIME. <P>IMO there is only one effect that could be placed on the BP if it is to be changed. That of mana recovery. Make the BP like the mana robes that other casting classes have, thus allowing to save the mana needed to cast our spells. Along with this make CH a faster casting spell, 10 seconds is way to slow on upper end Vellious MOBS. <P>Second option make the BP effects Vellious only enabled, allowing Clerics to only use this in Vellious. Somewhat the way the manastone was nerfed.<P>Third option leave the BP alone, their is not many out there yet, certainly not enough to make a huge difference in game balance. The item is a no drop item and therefore will not be passed on in the economy of EQ unlike the manastone was. We have been told Risk/Reward in the past, now Clerics are just tired of all the risks taken being changed to no reward. Are there not items awarded for BoB series and GM events that enhance the classes that receive them. Is not every item in the game obtained to better oneself, also contributing to enhancing a particular player in a class?<P>Understand there is very little in the game that enhances Clerics performance. Our performance is where the enjoyment of the game is derived from. You have enhanced all the classes in the game either by dilouting other classes of their specialities or by placing Epics and effects on items through out the land.<P>If myself as a 60 level Cleric is no better off then the lvl 50 Cleric why bother to play and level. High end gear and effects for high level players is what this game should be about. Put a high end lvl useage on BP, dont nerf it as an useable item, show some common sense. Currently every effect on Cleric armor Stability/Quest/Donals is an effect that is useless, below the high end player base that it takes to aquire it, or lacking stats that would be beneficial.<P>While I adress this one issue, there are many more underlying problems with this class that also need to be addressed. That will come in other posts as Cleric issues are brought forward when it is time to balance this class. I hope Clerics will not be discarded here also and be the last class to be balanced. I wouldnt be surprised though.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The issue here is that Verant is looking at what Afterlife and FoH are doing and not realizing that 99.9% of the eq population is not killing every mob out there. Quit trying to trick up the .1% that is gonna defeat the game anyway. <P>Right now you have 2 problems. First what you are doing to clerics is wrong here. The donals nerf was reasonable. The first one. The second one Ok I can kinda see it. What you did to the pog one was wrong. You need to figure this out on the Test server. It is complete BS for you to bring that out then decide ooop we were stupid so you must pay.<P>Next you have another problem with your vision. I personally dont think there is one. You are far to reactionary to have a true vision. look what you have done to Necromancers. They are now leaving in droves. Trust me if they wanted to be mana batteries they would have become a bard or an enchanter. They are master of death - make them that once again. I know this seems off topic but it goes to the heart of the issue. <P>Stop using the live server as beta/test. If they would have had the item according to the "Vision" the first time they would not be upset. once you set off the nuclear explosion you cant recall the bomb.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The nerf is probably warranted on this breastplate.  To nerf it after being discovered, however, is wrong.  To not compensate those that put forth the time, effort, and money to obtain this item is even more wrong.  <BR>In non-epic encounters, this breastplate is very overpowering.  In epic encounters, though?  Questionable.  When MOB's are doing quad attacks for 350+ damage each, a 300HP/6sec heal just isn't gonna cut it.  The tank WILL lose this fight rather shortly.  With the recent healing/aggro 'enhancement', Donal's on epic encounters is just a short way to get to your bind spot.  <P>Verant, you need to think things through before implementing ANY item into this game.  We, the customers, are your bosses.  We pay your wage, we put your kids through school, we bought your house.  Many of us want to fire you over this (cancelling).  The almost constant incompitence Verant portrays is mind-boggling.  <P>As a shaman, I am constantly faced with Visionary (tm) items being brought into this game that compromise the very reason why I play a shaman.  <P>Here's an example:<P>Level 60 spell Avatar:<BR>+100atk, +100STR, +100DEX, +100AGI, etc.  Costs an emerald to cast.  This buffs lasts 6 minutes and has a 3 minute recast time.  <P>-This spell is the best melee buff in the game by quite a margin.  No shaman uses this, however, because of the silly duration, recast time, and component cost.<P>BUT, there are weapons dropping in Sleeper's Tomb that PROC this buff and no component is required!  Not only is this a kick in the face to every level 60 shaman from Verant, but it's also a staple picture as to how Verant does not think about what they do.  <P>I have never played a game in my life that has made the player base so upset due to failures in testing.  Manaless healing items are always destined to be nerfed to uselessness.  Verant has proved that time and time again.  <P>Just remember this Verant.  We, the customer, are your bosses.  Never forget that.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all, just some points from reading this new split of the thread.<P>1) I totally agree with Khalen, if this has to be nerfed to extinction the only effect I would be happy with is a mana regen effect.<P>2) Maybe this is a bit unbalancing for a lvl 46 cleric but at 60 it's not overpowered or unbalancing.<P>3) Yes it helps clerics do their job a tiny bit better, but isn't that what high level items are supposed to do?  Trucheon of Doom, Jaundiced Bone Bracer, Fungi Tunic, Cobalt BP, haste items, Hmm every new high end weapon and peice of armor from Velious, most epics ... all of these have a significant impact on the players ability to solo/group kill a mob a bit easier, however are not any more unbalancing than this BP. <P>4) Casters really get the shaft on ITEMS that help their class.... only items with effects can have the impact to a caster class as armor, weapons and haste have on a mellee class. <P>5) For the high end players that have this item it's the equivalent of deciding every high lvl warrior should be limited to using rusty weapons, the game will still go on but the fun will never reach this level again.<P>6) Didn't you guys say on the cleric boards that the cleric class was pretty balanced as it was?  What moron decided to unbalance a class you said was balanced by beating us to death with the nerf stick?<P>7) Clerics in PvP get totally screwed by anybody that has a decent MR and is similar lvl.... and I mean anybody because all our spells are magic based and we have no mellee.  Balance that!<P>8) A cleric with C2 can med for c heal in aprox. 70 seconds. With BP you can heal 4500 damage in 24x3= 72 seconds.  In a cleric/warrior duo they are equivalent without requiring the high lvl cleric to have C2 all the time. However BP requires 20 second cleric stun basically, while with C2 you can heal casters/supplemental heal.<P>9) Finally, how do you guys expect to fix the caster role in uber encounters when a caster at FM can't do 1% damage to him?<P>10) All these points are Valid but I want an official response on this BP from you guys.  I want to know why it is "unbalancing" or "overpowered" because your math doesn't warrant it.  (i.e. a lvl 39 cleric with C2 casting a lvl 39 spell called C heal on a high end warrior can heal the warrior infinitely as long as the mob does less than 300 damage every 6 seconds, and if the warrior is uber buffed he can take more.)<P>Again, please answer these very valid questions.<P>I hope one day the fun is brought back to the high level cleric game.<P>Gairloch Daimonios<BR>Lvl 59 cleric<BR>Eastern Keep<BR>Rodcet Nife Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why is Verant Interactive Nerfing the Breastplate?<P>Too unbalancing?<P>No not realy as other people have responded.<P>The main reason for it being nerfed is:<P>Time Sink<P>Just as with the Boat, With Gems,  If you are not leveling you will spend longer playing the game.<P>If you spend longer playing the game.  Verant/Sony still receive your $9.89 for a while longer.  Or they can keep you occupied until a new expansion comes out.<P>I have a Plane of Growth BP but rarely do I use it in combat.  Do you know how quick an enchanter can die in 20 seconds.  Damn Quick! <P>For topping people off after combat it is great.<P>But a cleric takes a different mind set than other classes.<P>We hurt with each party members death, and if by using the bp I kill an enchanter or wizard, Im not doing my job.<P>If you have an enchanter in your group they cringe at the thought of using your bp.<P>Sure you can use the bp in combat if you have a secondary healer. (I'm not a newb he he)<P>I have started enjoying the game until the last few cleric nerfs.<P>It even seemed to me things were improving. That verant was trying to improve customer service: I.E. asking what we thought was wrong, what we thought needed improving.<P>I am sadly disappointed in the latest turn of events.<P>Will this nerf cause me to Quit?<P>No.<P>My guild and friends have sacrificed too much to help me obtain my current Level/Items.<P>I might start to play secondaries more.<P>Just my 2cp.<P>Phyphor Dragonsbane<BR>56 Templar of Brell<BR>Karana Server<BR>Grey Hawke<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well this is really about the icing on the cake for clerics.  Start from the spells that got "more efficient" and absolutely less powerful. With the days of high mana items and Clarity 2 who is gonna not waste the mana to be buffing their troops with less effective stuff just to save a few bits of mana.  Even the Level 60 Aegiolism spell is only all the best buffs wrapped into one with maybe a few (very few) extra points on top.  Its only good feature is its duration and spell slot saving.  Still only as powerful as 3 other spells that the cleric already had and at least with the other 3 you can stage buff your tanks in an emergency instead of waiting for all the mana just to cast one of these.   <P>Now lets talk about the fact that the best spell in the game for a cleric is STILL a level 39 spell.  Yes I mean Complete Healing.... not even an attempt on upgrading this spell as been pushed around.  Sure there is a Complete Group heal but its only efficient in casting if you have 4 or more Tanks in your group who all lose health at the same rate.  Basically it would be a good recovery spell but if the party is in such shape that this spell is efficient chances are the cleric doesn't have the mana anyways.<P>Now what could have been done with CH?  Hmmm now this is hard... Lets think on this for a few seconds to come up with some alternatives.  Basically there are 2 modifiers left seeing as the power of the spell does everything else.  Time and cost.... SO PLAY AROUND WITH THEM.  How about an upgrade at level 53 or 54 to less casting time.... say 8.0 seconds instead of 10.0.  Add mana requirements to it if you like but you upgraded all the other spells why not this one.  Up the mana cost to 500 mana if you want.  Most people would find in the heat of battle that having AN OPTION to spend 100 more mana to save 2 seconds and most likely someones life would be GREAT!<P>How about at a later level... push it out as far as you want... even to 60 if needed but ADD it somewhere after the above mentioned.  Give me the 8 second cast for the same mana as the level 39 one OR give me 10 seconds and less mana... It just isn't that hard to come up with things to alter.<P>On another note the IDEA behind a Death Pact spell could have been wonderful if it had some gradual stages to make it even partially useful.  If you want us to be able to fight 300khp monsters don't make us use a restick and loot the corpses to get back into combat.  What fantasy book are you ever gonna read that out of... if you are going to NUKE the BP's because the make things SOOOO unbalanced knock down the hp of those ridiculous creatures.  <P>..." yea we didn't even need to use a heal really we just sent the tanks in and one by one hit them with a res stick let them loot and sent them back into the fight".... <BR>                        This sounds ridiculous<P>The cleric class altogether is probably one of the most non-upgraded class in the entire game.  The difference between a level 50 cleric now and a level 50 cleric the day the game came out is what? Equipment? A higher bandage skill? less fizzles but higher agro?  Stop me when I have said something advantageous... Oh sorry so the major difference is really equipment... okay so lets downgrade that... sure why not. (rolls eyes)<P>Ah yes... and we are supposed to be the bane of all undead creatures... woo hoo.. how?!  Because I can outright kill a mob with a spell and destroy its loot with it?  Wow a level 60 spell that can only be used against undead that doesn't drop nice loot.... oh wait... when kunark came out we were told that loot would be random. (shocked look) SO I can't even use this spell in fear that THIS may be the mob that dropped the supper rare item.  Level 60 spell USELESS! Well maybe you could impress a newbie by dispatching a spectre in one shot.<P>All in all the cleric is still doing what they have been doing since the game started with the same damn spell!  Complete heal... Res... CH..Res<BR>(goes into a trance)<P>Starts his cleric areobics... Stand Heal Sit Med, Stand Heal Sit Med, Stand Heal Sit Med.....<P>You want to add something neat... let us start blessing Bandages that give double health when used. Or bandages that cure poison and disease.. Let us cast spell on people that enhance other aspects of them besides HP and ac... let me have an undead damage shield, or make Mark of Karn useful again give me an aura of protection against undead like bard song work... make it a discipline or something. <P>Now lets talk about the reason for a cleric to have a fear spell.... it has one purpose... escpape.  A great use... but maybe somewhere along the lines you get a fear spell that makes the mob run and NOT WANT TO COME BACK IMMEDIATELY?<P>Okay enough about the cleric spells... I could go on and on about the useless hammer series spells that would be better off as summoned items that are equipable in your ranged or ammo slot that enchance your defenses or resistances but instead they are useless weapons given to a NON MELEE class.<P>The spells are ridiculous... dealing damage or harm in any way shape or form to undead is ridiculous... buffing hp and ac is the best in the game and the only variety in it is less powerful all in all.<P>Oh wait... since we are irritating the clerics lets buff up the heal spells for druids and shaman because they complain they can't get groups.  Well hell where were the shaman and especially the druids when we needed them between level 1 and 50?  SOLOING.... SOLOING by choice and not wanting any company.  Why?  Because they didn't need us... so now we break down and start changing the class to make them a useable healer because we are making the clerics want to leave the game?  How about fix what is broken and NOT everything around it.  " Oh ya know that table looks terrible in that room... maybe if we surround it with nice looking chairs it will fix everything".<P>Takes a deep breath... QUIT nuking our items and FIX OUR CLASS!  Allowing a level 56 res to be done be anyone capable of finishing the cleric quest is NOT THE ANSWER to making a cleric happy.  I just irritates the ones who worked so hard to get to the high levels.  If anything you should change that to a buff stick not a res stick, or make it castable by only clerics over level 56.  <P>Dwyvyrn - "FED up Cleric"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant:<P>If it's so unbalancing, remove it from the game. Apparently it's not right to allow people to keep the rewards as you indicate by the 1. Moss covered twig, 2. Jade Prod, 3. Manastone, 4. Donals BP, and who knows how many other examples. If there's one thing we deserve as customers, it's CONSISTENCY in the way we are treated.<P>Here's some messed up logic to consider:<P>These BPs were all nerfed because of the statement 'As long as the tank takes less than X damage over Y time, any encounter is trivial'. Well, guys that's pretty much how every encounter works in EQ. From moss snakes to level 60, that's how it works. <P>The BPs simply made X sufficiently large and Y sufficiently small to somehow cross the threshold of acceptability. <P>I challenge you to find out how many clerics it takes to cast CH as fast as the donals BP and stay on top of mana regen.<P>Ok, you've done that. Now you want the 'Complete Heal' buff for anyone who gets a complete heal from donals or regular cast. Ok, now you know it is a finite number of clerics casting CH in a cycle. According to your logic, this must be disabled somehow. Using your existing Complete Heal buff seems to be the logical conclusion to this.<P>Now I challenge you to find out how many clerics it takes to cast Superior Heal to keep the tank alive in the same situation. What do you know, it is a finite number of clerics. Well, I guess we need a 'Superior Heal' buff now also so that we can't have an army of clerics replicating a CH by just throwing more people at the problem.<P>...<P>You can see the progression here. Ultimately you will need a buff icon for each heal, and allow the tank to get healed only once per spell type (or not, perhaps you don't want the heal 'buffs' to stack). <P>Finally, the ultimate conclusion is, all encounters must be designed to accomodate a single cast of a single heal spell or your Vision is not achieved. That is clearly the progression these recent nerfs have indicated.<P>And it's stupid as all hell and you guys should just put it back the way it was.<P>As a side note, while I am not directly affected by the cleric nerfs, I struggle to continue enjoying this game while watching the pointless and senseless nerfs happen to yet another portion of my friends who clearly are on the verge of quitting over this, the last straw of many.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not here to debate the issue of whether or not the change to the BPs should take place.  Verant obviously feels that the change is needed no matter how much we, the players, feel that it will make the items useless.<P>The problem I see now is what to do about the change.  So I am going to offer suggestions to Verant on things they can do with this.<P>I think it would be wise if you offered those with the Pre-Patch Breastplates (PoG type) to exchange their BPs for the new type that you introduce.  Aside from the AC and stat bonuses of the PoG type BPs the change to the effect make the effect virtually useless, unless you can find a way to put in Item Recast times and then lower the casting time back to its original number.<P>So why don't we give verant "Reasonable" suggestions of what we would like to see on the new BPs (PoG type) so that clerics don't end up with Summon Food.<P>Verant probably wants to stay away from Healing Spells, untill they can code in Item Recast Times.  So all suggestions should bare that fact in mind.  The BP effect should have a focus on utility for the cleric.  To save them mana or time in performing a task.<P>The first suggestion off the top of my head would be to have the BP effect become "Bulwark of Faith".  Granted this effect is not as good as a healing spell but it would serve to save the cleric a considerable amount of mana, and therefore down time.  The spell is purchasable so its not like you would be giving persons with the BP an ability that every cleric of the appropriate level would not have access to readily.<P>My second suggestion gives the cleric a bit more of an offenive nature, and that would be to give the new BP the effect of "Mark of Karn".<P>My third suggestion is a bit more of a dream than I think verant would allow but it would be to give the BP the effect of "Aegolism" where no component would be needed.  The casting time on the BP in these instances would be 1min casting times to reduce the chance that it could be used to heal group members during combat.  It would, however, save the cleric tremendous mana regen and down time.  Even at a 1 min casting time, the cleric would save a noticable amount of time from the regen of the mana that it would take to cast this spell normally.<P>Thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>A DEFENSE OF VERANT...SORT OF<P>I must say that I have to agree with Verant's decision to nerf these items. The Clerics that have these items are so overpowered (ability to enable damage whether by themself or others) compared to any other class of the same level range. Because of this, I think they have no choice but to make this change. I do applaud them for making this tough descision because it is obvious that this type of decision will make certain people very upset (as it should).<P>My question is. How did this happen in the first place. We were told a long time ago by Abashi that they purposely do not allow individuals who play a certain class to do the development for the class??? Now we are told that the person who designs these items plays a high level cleric. I am not going to make bad comments about this person because its not their fault. Your Producers should realize that there are very few people who could play a class and then be unbiased enough to make good design considerations for that same class. Because of this it should not be allowed to happen.<P>It also seems very odd that Clerics would get an upper 50's level spell on one of these pieces where as other classes do not even receive any spell over 50. Does not this point to some serious overall balance issues? To me this one item should have sent up a HUGE warning flag.<P>We saw these same types of issues with the Epic quests and the inequities in the difficulty and rewards of the Quests. Rouge piece was fairly easy to get versus the Mage piece that is so difficult to get.<P>With all that said, My question is this...<P>Going forward how is Verant going to put steps into place to keep their designers on the same page? What are you going to do so there are no more yet to be designed "Cleric BP's" that need to be nerfed after they are created.<P>Once again I applaud you for making the tough decision, but implore you to take a look at your design process so that these errors do not continue to occur.<P>Hopeful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ,<P>Peredur</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wake up people, smell the coffee.  You should have all seen this coming.<P>Two classes define the high end game, cleric and warrior.  The other 12 classes have issues with this.  VI HAS to balance to a degree the game or it will not survive.  What can they do.....???  They have to revamp the end game to make most if not all classes viable.<P>It was very evident when they bumped hybrids that was an attempt to break the warrior grip on the high end game.<P>Now Clerics are having the same thing done to them with nerfs and druid/shaman upgrades.<P>Enchanters....guess who will be next.  (Seeing bard upgrades in the near future.)<P>On an individual basis, this hurts some players, but overall the game is helped IMHO.  <P>One thing you really do have to remember all you people who threaten to leave.  This is a game, eventually all games have an ending.  If all your enjoyment now comes from getting one item,  what will you do when you get it?  If you have 3-4 lvl 55+ characters, perhaps you are nearing the end of what EQ can offer you.  Remember its is supposed to be fun.<P>And for all the threats to quit the game, my server numbers keep inching upwards ever month no matter that there are now roughly 50 topics open for descusion which were going to "ruin" the game and have people leave en mass.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, well if you are going to nerf Clerics and Warriors because they are too group defining at high levels, at least throw us a bone at lower levels.  Especially warriors.  Its so much harder to level up a warrior or rogue for that matter than any other class its not funny.  After level 20 unless they are completely twinked out they can't solo anything for experience without a year downtime.  Clerics are pretty pathetic solo as well.  If you are going to make the good grouping classes weaker in groups, make them stronger solo... thats balance.  Druids and necros are the kings of solo, who cares if they are good in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
