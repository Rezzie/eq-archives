</FONT><HR>Absor, please re-read the Mage Thread. You clearly skimmed it, or simply didn't pay attention. There were many points brought up, over and over and over again, that you didnt even address. <P>As much as you might think the Magician class is balanced, you are clearly wrong. Try playing a Magician. Look at the armor and weapon drops for other classes. Look at how many of our spells end up on their armors. Heck they even get more of our higher level spells on their armors than we do.<P>But most of all, simply try a get in a group as a magician in the higher levels. It's fairly difficult. And once you are in a group, see how much "utility" you bring to the group.<P>Please please please, re-read the magician thread. You missed a lot of things, in your answer post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well Honestly this post of mine is going to come off wrong no matter what I do but here goes.<P>1. I am very happy that Verant is attempting to balance things.<P>2. I have no hope whatsoever that they will.<P>3. Given that I believe #2 I am not going to post about balance but rather ask for something that will make play a little more enjoyable ...and yes it may seem petty but heck im being honest =)<P>4. Surprisingly many posts for paladins mentioned appearence and item changes to make us look different. I know that on most of the servers the Shield of the Immaculate is fairly basic in appearance. I know you mentioned that some of the hate items would be looked at for appearance and i was hoping that this one could be looked at also.<P>I apologize if this post seems stupid to some but for me this game is no longer about the numbers and who is better at what, honestly I just want to have some fun and as uncorrect as it is today to want to just look cool..well..i want to look cool so there.<P>thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, consider doing something about certain Wizard spell levels where the spells are just truly sad.  Level 20 is a good example. Both the DDs ahve a stun which makes their resists horrible.  While these resist rates might be normal for a stun, they are really high for a DD spell.<P>I hear the level 20 spells are actually usefull when you hit level 24 and no longer have to rely on them for damage, but it doesn't seem fair that wizards basically go from level 16 to level 24 without a reliable upgrade to DD.  <P>I hear there are other levels with this problem but I shelved my wizard at level 20 so I do not know.<P>How about adding a simple, new, DD spell at level 20, and other such levels, to make that spell grouping slightly more useful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I posted this on an earlier monk thread. Keep in mind this was all from me so may need 'balancing' as far as timers, percents, and penalties go. I feel this way about it...I've done the creative part, now why can't Verant do the number crunching? =) I would like to see something like this happen for each class and would gladly post ideas for them as well...if I am being taken seriously that is.<P>This is what my post will focus on, giving monks more choices over how they do damage and having more fun along the way. Let's start by seeing where the choices begin and where they end.<P>-Point A- here you are and there's the mob<BR>-Point B- here you are (still alive) and there's the mob (quite dead)<P>We all want to get from point A to point B. At least I hope =) I don't want this to be greatly altered by huge damage increases or overbalancing skills. I would like to see How we get from point A to point B change. This is what I propose: making use of a popular martial arts idea of 'chi' or 'lifeforce' energy (make sure you read the entire post before drawing pre-mature conclusions). As with everything in EQ, there is a need for balance. I realize we cannot bestow monks with powers and not expect a downside. In hopes of having this considered for implentation, I have tried to make it balanced as possible.<P>I have created a set techniques that could be used from earlier levels and up to 60. I feel that what you learn should always be useful, no matter how early you gained that knowledge. Here is where we make use of the empty mana bar all monks carry around. The last thing I want is for monks to turn into hybrids and just carry around spells or have any association with having mana. But, since the mana bar is there we can use it to represent our 'chi' or 'lifeforce'. Each technique would cost a certain amount of 'lifeforce', but it wouldn't be a situation where you click a button and use X amount of your energy. For example, if you wanted to use the Open Wounds technique (this will be detailed later), you would charge it for X amount of time. The longer you charge it the better of an effect you will have and the more energy it will drain. As you drain your energy in preparation to perform the technique, you are more vunlerable to attacks and cannot be disturbed by damage or it will be ruined and energy will be lost for nothing. Basically, you are 'stunned' for the duration of the charging and will be free to move normally after executing the technique (barring the various side effects). Your energy will regain over time, but cannot be effected by clarity, bard songs, or other mana giving items or spells since a monk's energy is not mana. It's just that, a person's lifeforce. Your lifeforce could become stronger after gaining levels, but not by leaps and bounds.<P>These techniques would be usable only if both hands are free. They are meant for the true, bare-handed martial arts masters out there. I feel this would bring about an interesting set of strategic options. Do you choose to go bare-handed and use your techniques and pressure points (i posted about pressure points earlier)? or do you use your nice blunt weapons with good stats and procs? As I stated, your hands must be free to use a technique and there will be a time limit on when you can equip a weapon after using a technique..maybe as low as 20 mins or as much as an hour (starting from your last use of energy). Now let me explain a few of the techniques I've pondering over, inspired somewhat by the discipline concept and all those movies i've watched over the years:<P>-Shadow Fist Technique-<BR>1. The upside:<BR>A technique used to concentrate dozens of blows to be given within moments of one another. The damage of each blow would scale from 50 percent of your maximum fist damage to 75 percent of your maximum fist damage, depending on the amount of energy used to charge. The actual number of blows attempted would range from a few dozen up to several dozen, depending on the amount of energy charged. This would occur in a very short amount of time, about 2 or 3 seconds (the actual punching, not including the charge time).<P>2. The downside:<BR>After usage of Shadow Fist, your spirit is tired and will not allow you to execute any technique for 5 minutes and will not allow you to use Shadow Fist again for an hour. For 5 minutes after using Shadow Fist, your movement speed will be reduced by 15 percent up to 35 percent depending on the amount of energy used. The delay on your fists would be increased by 20 percent up to 60 percent, depending on the amount of energy used. I feel this balances out the nice damage output you could give to any single mob in such a short amount of time.<P>-Flaming Palm Technique-<BR>1. The upside:<BR>A technique used to harness the fire of one's spirit and focus it into tangible flames. While charging this technique, perhaps flames could surround the fists (similar to when casters begin casting fire dd spells, the graphics are there so lets use them). Each successful blow would carry 75 percent up to 125 percent of non-melee fire damage based (based on charging time) on the total amount of damage given by that melee blow. <BR>The bursts of fire that hit the mob after every few punches could carry a small fire dd graphic, it's there so lets use it =) This would last for 20 to 45 seconds, depending on charge time.<P>2. The downside:<BR>After the technique is completed all resists except fire will be reduced by 50 percent up to 75 percent, depending on the amount of energy used. This will last for 15 minutes. Also during this time your fists will need time to recover from the extreme heat and will only do 65 percent up to 85 percent of their normal damage, depending on energy used. Your lifeforce will need time to recover as well and will not allow you to use any techniques for 5 minutes and the Flaming Palm technique for an hour. The extreme heat has also left your defenses hindered. Your Ac will be reduced by 10 percent up to 20 percent depending on energy used. Also, dodge, block, and riposte will be slightly less effective. I feel this adequately balances the fire-based damage monks could dish to mobs.<P>-Open Wounds Technique-<BR>1. The upside:<BR>A technique used to exploit the wounds previously given to mobs. This technique would only have effect on mobs that have lost at least 10 percent of their total life. Starting after the first successful blow, each following hit would do a minimum of 5 percent up to 15 percent extra damage than the previous blow, like a crescendo, depending on charge time. This would top out at a certain point, however, doing no more than 3 times the fists maximum damage on any given blow. This technique would not carry from mob to mob. It could be used on a single mob until it dies or the time expires on the technique. It would last 10 seconds up to 30 seconds depending on charge time.<P>2. The downside:<BR>After using Opens Wounds technique, you cannot regain health for 1 minute via healing spells or natural regain. Your lifeforce will not allow you to use any technique for 5 minutes and Open Wounds for an hour. From all the mess caused by exploting wounds, your aim is greatly hindered. For 15 minutes after using Open Wounds your ATK is decreased by 15 percent up to 25 percent and you are more likely to blocked, dodged, parried, or riposted...the severity depending on the amount of energy used. I feel this balances the nasty amount of damage possible.<P>Now that I've explained 3 of my Techniques, I'll explain further on their general states. These 3 could be learned by monk guildmasters and their could be hidden monk master in the lands that would train you in other techniques. They could be available at low lvl's, maybe starting in the teens and range up to 60. The negative effects of techniques will stack.<P>I feel that this could increase the effectivness of monks, but due to the risks of the side effects, would not be overbalancing. This would give monks the opportunity to use strategy instead of targeting a mob and pushing auto-attack. And most of all...it would be fun.<P>Rlaiel Riptide: 56 former human monk of Tunare<BR>Relh Butterfly: 30 iksar monk of Vazaelle <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor your handling of the mage class issues is deplorable. I cant help to think that you did a VERY half hearted attempt to understand our class. I feel you merely skimmed the mage thread and did not fully try to understand the issues we have. It is apparent that going into the mage talk you already had your arms crossed and had a negative predeposistion to our class "It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class". <P>Here is what I belive to be proof that you are not in tune with the mage class "Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group" LOL - have you tried busting out a pet in PoH? I guarantee that accross all servers the majority of raid leaders will ask you to not use a pet. <P>"The class talk threads have been closed. So please come to the new ones to continue the discussion" - Where are the new ones? You are way off on the mage class, YOU need to be addressed, where do I go to do this? I presume this is not the right forum for the mage issues. <P>"But, please, let's remain focused. There isn't any great need to repeat what is on the list already just to agree with it" - Noted, I will<BR>however remind you of the ones that did not make it onto your list. <P>"Instead, focus on things that I missed that are important, or correct mistakes that I've made" - Again where do I go to address all of the mage issues that you left off your "list" and the ones that you just flat out got wrong (lvl 29 fire pet instead of 49?). <P>I understand that you have a complicated job at this point, dealing with all of the issues that other classes have. However your current analysis of the mage issues is , well,  less then satisfactory. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> First off, Absor talks about changing the graphic on rage of Zomm being something important to mages. Okay, I guess he brought that up as an example to illustrate that mages can talk about anything that they want to on the thread. <P>  The mage thread is posted, and alot of mages all posted some great ideas. If someone read all the threads, it would be noticed that about 95%( with the other 5% being people complaining about the epic) of the mages all wanted the same things. None of which was to change the graphic of the unused rage of Zomm pet.<P> Absor posts his list about what is being brought to the design team. Wait a second, he is posting that mages want the rage of Zomm pet's graphic changed? Why do I now feel as if he did not read the mage thread that well? <P> It would be nice to have the post 50 mage pets have new graphics, but it would be so much nicer to have a far more useful pet.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, here's ny bit of common sense regarding whatever they call what VI does for the theoretical "class balancing" or was it "The Vision"...? <BR>Vision? hmmm vision of what... the vision of some VI employees having prefered classes in-game, where they tend to get "JEALOUS" of other classes they "personnally" don't care about or like? Please clarify on this... lol<P>Okey, here we go. As i said and repeat again today... Please do NOT touch ANYTHING that is working as intended or not broken. For Heaven's sake, specially STOP the nerfing of the rogue class. <P>I'd like to see nerfs for druids and necromancers get put on the table... what restraining codes could be put in to make sure these two classes CANNOT solo as easily as they do now. <BR>I mean, if they are now looking at making the rogue skill sneak worth nothing by nerfing it so that rogues can no longer rely on that skill to move stealthly around, then make darn sure to make the druids and necro spells be resisted as the enchanter spells were about one year ago, at initial game release... that seems only logical.<P>Actually, let's make all the caster spells resisted like 70% to 80% of the time, why not? That'd be a cool nerf no?<P>When looking at the fact rogues had to wait one year to get a very basic and should-have-been-part-of-release skills related to poison, then all the other classes should not get even the slightest improvement for AT LEAST one year, see how the rest of the world, the non-rogues out there, would accept or react to such a negligence.<P>Secondly, those whimpy whiner classes that get to influence the game design by being sooo numerous, after all, for most rangers and monks, necros and druids, which represent a large portion of the population on every servers, by complaining on other classes out of jealousy, etc... I say Verant should seriously consider the feedback they get and NOT accept any comments or complaints from classes that are not directed at their own class. <BR>EG. Monkeyboy, a monk, realizes that a rogue can do more damage than him when under the proper situation.... <BR>"oh no no no! this cannot be, i gotta be the best out here... hey monkey friends, let's pass word around and complain on this... Hek let's shout this injustice that we cannot be best at everything and bring that already extremely low rogue population to extinction from the server ok? <P>And don't deny it VI, I have been in that exact situation in the past, i witnessed this happening and what happened? we saw VI nerf the piercer damage dealt out by rogues.<BR>The current Class Lists shows again this kind of thing since most "improvements" presented for the rogue class are nerfs that will remove efficiency or change the way the skill was working before, was working fine mind you... but now that this new "keep consistency" idea comes out, they decide to either break the skill apart.<P>Last thing abotu keeping consistency, rogues are considered as being a pure mellee class packing magical capabilities like poisons and invisibility through Hide skill. But if the rogue's ijnvi drops when zoning, then two options come clearly out for ensuring CONSISTENCY is upheld, either rogues get to remain invisible through zoning, or all invisibility spells from casters should also drop when people zone. <BR>Seems only fair that consistency be kept...<BR>what's good for one is also good for the other.<P>Toegue Shadowhound<BR>Rogue of 36th rank<BR>Dark Brotherhood of Brell Serilis<BR>SolRo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

All I see of monk requests is for them to be able to do more damge etc... why, an assassin jumping you from the shadows and backstabbing you SHOULD be able to kill you right out, not a monk because he supposedly can use martial arts... monks should see their damage brought to a minimum if you ask me, they got FD and Intimidate and a bunch of other skills to compensate and ensure they will survive where others will not, stop complaing or asking for more. Has the nerf caping/reducing the piercer damage of rogues been removed yet? now THAT is not a fair thing. so JumpyJellyBean, continue jumping jelly beans and take your so called techniques to your mama and ask her to give you a good spanking LOL<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>okies JJB, i repeat myself again, DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING THAT IS WORKING FINE. simple basic thing. Monks are very good as they are, they have no need for anything else, but some other classes have been neglected very badly, so before adding something that is not needed really, they should start making the taunt for warriors work as an example lol poor them, that's about their only usefull skill along with their having many HP, come on man, think for a sec here. I could not care less what you've played before. but look at classes that were neglected or put on the backburner for a year (like poisons for rogues). they are now thinking of removing functionality on the sneak and hide skill, as well as the Evade skill? and you got the nerves to ask for monks to have something to have MORE fun, not that monks don't already have VERY MUCH FUN skills to play with. be fair at the very least lol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>sorry if i gave you the wrong idea, friend, your post suggests very good ideas, no arguments here. But the fact that monks are ok as far as i am concerned, and to a large portion of eq players out there also, makes me think that before they make an already immensely fun class to play MORE fun than it is, they should begin by making the not so much fun classes that people have complained about more fun, that is all i am really saying friend hehe. <BR>Example, rogues have complained ALOT about the ridiculousness of having to farm green mobs for endless countless hours to get poison ingredients, then have to make vials, then has to.... etc. and get a non-stackable poison vial. All the poison system has been wrong since day one, all rogues have commented on it, put in suggestions and very common-sensed improvements to the entire process... but they will instead make sneak a harder less usefull skill, oh wow! <BR>But when shamans started complaining about their potion making costs and the fact that potions should stack, what happened? You remember? we now see stackable potions. Where is the same request but for poisons? Who knows.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hehehe just read an above post of you JumpingJellyBean. and i answer to your request for creativity that it has been done, but it feels like some classes are disliked altogether by the developers or their bosses that prolly play EQ all day from their work offices in VI, and so instead of making the creative ideas come through on certain classes, they break alot of class functions and come back and "fix" them, not by using the creativeness people have suggested or commented on, but they remove what they initially had given that class before they broke it with a patch or expansion.<P>P.S.: I too am a writer, artist and designer, engineer as well, so yea, i got lots of creativity friend hehehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor!<P>One worried magician here if i may say so.<P>Not to be rude Absor but to me it seems you have ignored the single most common trouble with mages lvl51 to 60.<P><BR>Our offensive powers(Pets) post lvl50.<P>I see you state over and over again how we mage's will not get any more escape capabilities or defenses because of our offensive powers.<P>Im ok with that Absor thats why i chose to play a magician.<P>But you havent mentioned at all in your mage class summary our pets post 50.<P>You see pets post 50 arent almost at all any improvement from the lvl49 pets, i wont go into details here as it has been covered very well in the class thread.<P>Their increase in  cabability compared to lvl49 pets are next to nothing, which is sad considering that to get to lvl60 is like lvling to lvl50 twice again.<P>So im asking you Absor to atleast look at pets post 50 compared to lvl49, and test them to find out what im saying and alot of other mages post 50 say, they need to be reworked in some way(all post 50 pets not just the fire pet).<P>By that Absor i mean either reduce the mana cost or make their abilities better compared to lvl49 pets(Hps,dmgoutput,offensive skills,defensive skills).<P><BR>I beg of you Absor to atleast put it on your list that you send to the devolopers, just so we have a chance whomever so small.<P>Well this post was supposed to be small, alas i care too much for my class hehe.<P>Best Regards<P>Rary Darkweaver<P>58 Conjurer<P>Mythic Legion<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well...<P>I don't think this post will do anything for the rogue class.<P>The rogue class talk thread was started and Absor said in a round about way..."I know nothing about rogues..but I am gonna nerf them..."  Even though all the rogues stated that they shouldn't and even gave ideas that would be good and only thing that went through for sure is the nerf on the patch....<P>That is all I have to say about that</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I'm an unhappy warrior at this point.<P>Before the servers went down, I logged on and saw the patch message, and how after 500+ warrior posts telling you that TAUNT wasn't working properly, you NERF the taunt part of weapon procs.  Do you know what that did?  It singlehandedly destroyed our epic weapon.  It's too slow to taunt with, the procs were the saving grace, the only reason we could use it.  Now that's gone.  It's going to be damn hard to look my guild in the eye and tell them my epic weapon is in the bank.  But that's better than watching them die on a raid because I can't taunt.<P>So anyway, when I log on later, I'm going to Rivervale.  I'm going to kill the halfling grandmother.  And the halfling child.  And the halfling father.  And it's going to feel good.  Because I'm pissed.<P>Good thing those halflings are very very very green...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059156-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059156.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059156-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059156&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059156&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
