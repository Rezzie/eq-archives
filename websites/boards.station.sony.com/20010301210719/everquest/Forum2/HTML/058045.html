</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I am glad you listen to us when we told you about how much we die.<P>However this spell in its current form would not be used by the current enchanter population.<BR>I wanted to give you some feedback while yu have time to refine it.<P>recast time.<P> There are several spells that we have that see limited use because of there recast time. As an enchanter we have a larger spell pool to pull from than any other class. We already constantly swap out spells in order to do our job. Having a long recast means that in order to be useful you have to keep it memmed all the time and that removes flexability from spell slot. We cant afford to do that.<P><BR>Reagent cost<P>Two peridots? When we explained that enchanters needed higher ac and defense caps to survive.(we die more than anyother class a real xp handicap) We didnt envision this spell. Two peridots is way to much cash considering the the effect has a short duration. All runes unlike symbols wear off the first time you get hit. <P>Total rune strength<BR>When facing monsters that quad for over 200 This isnt going to do much. Rune 5 and berzerker give us just as much.<P>A fast casting ae memblur would do the trick if it actually did erase the hate list.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's a level 55 spell.  So first of all using 2 peridot (of which all 55 enchanters probably have at least one stack of 20 if not two at all times), at a cost of 21pp, is essentially insignificant.<P>1000 HP isn't bad; it will keep you alive, and, more importantly, uninterrupted, long enough to cast an emergency spell.  Not as good as Divine Aura or Harmshield, but OK.  Casting time of 1 sec is nice.<P>The killer is the spell slot.  There just aren't any free spell slots for this type of spell.  Saving your life is fairly irrelevent.  It's a rare 55 enc that doesn't know a 56-60 cleric; death is just an inconvenience - it's not worth a slot that could be used for a spell that helps the group.  Most high enchanters don't even mem gate; they certainly won't mem this.<P>So the cases where this spell could be used:<P>1) Situations where if the enchanter dies, the whole group will die.  Probably, an attempt to break a difficult area.  But it means everyone sits there after the enc mems it, until his spell slot lights up 10 minutes later, you break, then unmem it and replace it with something useful.  Kind of useful, but a bit tedious.<P>2) Quests (esp epic quest) where you have to get in, do something fast, and get out, hopefully alive.  Or soloing.<P>On the other hand, if this were a clickable item effect, it would be quite cool - say the item that currently casts rune IV - this would be a whole lot more useful.  You'd need to keep the 1 sec casting time, though, and the 10 minute delay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I don't play an Enchanter, but, this spell doesn't look that bad to me at all!<P>Seems to me that like most spells, it will have a situational use.  And if you use it even just once in a while its better than not having it at all.<P>I compare it to Divine Aura, a spell I employ frequently as a cleric.  DA gives me 18 seconds of Invulnerability, but renders me unable to cast spells or attack during the same period.  In an emergency situation, it can be a lifesaver.  It has a 15 minute recast delay.<P>This spell has an expensive reagent cost, which will somewhat limit its usage, but not terribly so for the level.  It has a 10 minute recast delay, which is superior to DA.  A fast cast 1000hp Rune could save your life, maybe buy you enough time to get off a Mez or Gate or memblur or whatever might be required in the situation.<P>My suggestion would be to employ it for big breaks, when you would most likely need a lifesaver jolt like this.  If you cast the spell, then unmem it and replace it with something you might need more when you are settled in place.<P>I don't see why people are so quick to condemn new spells, they may not be perfect, but they are usually not completely useless.  If you don't a particular spell, you don't have to scribe it after all...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just love it when people say "I don't play an enchanter but this spell looks useful".<P>I won't buy this spell.  And if it is a drop spell, I won't roll for it unless it is absolutely thrust upon me.  Why?  I won't use it.  Period.<P>In order to do effective crowd control, every slot is needed.  Now that enchanters are becoming buff machines, that means not only am I doing crowd control, I am buffing melees.  Boon of Garou, Long recast.  Enchanter spells have long recast times such as stuns and nukes.  If you have to use that spell slot the recast time makes it impossible to do your job effectively.<P>Whoever pointed out that you could use this spell to gate has obviously never played an enchanter or grouped for that matter.  You don't gate out on your group, not if you want to keep grouping with them.  Also, you rarely if ever have gate memmed, there just aren't enough spell slots, period.<P>This is a clear example of Verant's design team looking at the problem as clearly stated by many many enchanters and delivering the wrong product.  Look at the root cause of the problem Verant, not the end result.<P>Root Cause = Aggro too high, MR too high<BR>Dying = End result<P>Ok, knowing this information, where do you come up with a 1k rune, self only, 18 second duration Rune?  Did you guys somehow confuse the messageboards and read some other classes thread?  Did the team that thought this spell up talk to the persons involved in reading the threads?<P>Bah, the game is so skewed now to melee I see the enchanter class becoming another support class for melee types.<P>The enchanter class is very fun and challenging.  I have enjoyed playing it until you get to a zone or dungeon that has super high MR mobs.  <P>I know that Enchanters are not required to do dungeons.  I have been on many dungeon crawls without an enchanter as a druid on Tallon Zek.  Enchanters are rare on PvP servers because, quite frankly, they suck at PvP.<P>A good enchanter will allow you to excel and succeed in situations.  A good enchanter will cut downtime and make the group most efficient. By crippling the Enchanter class, is this VI's roundabout way of "slowing down progress"?<P>After getting killed by mobs that resist Mez, stun root repeatedly I can't help but wonder if VI has designed certain mobs to pop that are out and out, "chanter killers".  The whole design of this mob is to kill the enchanter.<P>One time in velious on a pull, I had not casted a single spell.  The pull completely ignored the rogue, tank and druid (who had just snared) and started wailing on me.  Couldn't stun the mob, couldn't blur, nothing.  Was weird.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In its current incarnation, no I wouldnt use this spell. However, change recast time to something sane, Lik 90 - 120 seconds and you damn skippy I'm loading that spell for SITUATIONAL use.  Folks, stop *****ing and moaning and crossing your arms while huffing and puffing.  The only two problems are the regeant cost and recast time. Personally, I can live with the reagent cost.  The recast time, well that MUST change for anyone to use it.  Maybe Verant wont change it and we'll end up with yet another page 50 spell but I hope that if people offer CONSTRUCTIVE criticism then we'll get the spell in a usable form.<P>Also, anyone who thinks that after a significant reduction in recast time that they will never use this spell is selling them short. There ARE times when you can use it. Will it help in every situation? Nope but to say its a page 50 spell after a reduction in recast time is silly IMO.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've also got all the ranting out of my system as well.<P>But the truth remains, this spell is CRAP, of little value to anyone.<P>And BTW, before I pull my hair out over this, rune spells DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT, allow you to cast spells without being interupted.<P>I can't count the number of times I've been bashed or otherwise pushed back due to melee attacks while I have a rune spell up, and I lose concentration on the spell.<P>10 minute recast time?!?!?<P>HELLO!  After I load essential spells needed for croud controlling, I have ONE, maybe TWO slots (if I don't load theft of thought or boon of garou) left.  And with those slots I have to do all my buffing and spell swapping with.<P>I simply cannot give up another slot to a permanently memmed spell.<P>And lastly, the whole logic of this spell is absurd!<P>It only lasts 18 seconds, so, a person would use it either just before, or during a time they are taking extreme damage from attacks.<P>HELLO?!?!?<P>If your under attack, it means your already at the TOP of the aggro list, and now your going to cast a 1000hp HEAL on yourself?  (Rune spells count as HEAL spells, to those who don't know)  Healing yourself for 1000points is just gonna make the monster thats beating on you THAT MUCH MORE pissed off.  <P>You might as well just save the 21 pp and save everyone else a lot of trouble, save your cleric a lot of mana, and go ahead and die.<P>Now, if this spell was some kinda mem blur damage shield that caused monsters to mem blur each time they hit you, MAYBE, and I stress MAYBE, it might have some LIMITED value.  As it is now, its just a very expensive way to piss off monsters and give you 5 seconds more life before you die.<P>My mind boggles at the obvious lack of understanding Verant has about enchanters.<P>Pahbi<BR>56 Chanter<BR>Solusek Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I just talked with the fellow that does spells.  Due to other potential changes, it seems that this new Rune will probably not make it to the live servers.  So you no longer need to worry about it being over costed or useless.<P>But the idea was a sound one.  A very fast casting spell that any enchanter worth his salt would be able to get off, designed to help them survive an assault long enough to be healed or to get off a stun or for the enemy to be taunted off.<P>It was a good spell, and a great idea.  But it's probably not going into the game.

</FONT><HR>Alan, I think I see where you're going with this, however your take on the arsenal of a 'Chanter is why there is an issue...and why there will be CONTINUED issues if this is also the way the design team thinks.  <P>A fast-cast spell that will keep us from dying long enough to be healed or stun.. is an absolutely WONDERFUL idea.  However, look at the part of EQ where this is going to be used: the 55+ game.  Stuns don't work at this level.  Our spell slots are filled with buffs and with the long recast time, we can't "swap," because after you mem a spell, you have to wait the recast duration for it to become available.  That means, we're down to 7 slots available.  Also, if we're being beaten on, self-heal (the way a damage shield is seen by a bad guy) is the LAST thing we want to do.. all it means is that the tanks can't taunt,  we will continue to be pounded on, and the cleric will be the next in line if he *does* manage to keep us alive. <P>An idea for you, if you want to go down this route, in keeping with the Enchanter's role thus far:  an unresistable stun that lasts like color flux, 2 or 3 seconds.  If you want to control the chain-casting, fine..keep the long recast time.. keep the fluffin' reagent, too.  I'd cough up 21pp every 10 minutes to get something off me long enough to get a memblur or for the tank to taunt, you betcha.  <P>Here's the thing.. understand the Enchanter a little better.  Like the Bard, or the Rogue, we bring atypical skills to the table, even when we have to adjust, like in the High-magic-resistant land of Velios.  An emergency "stay alive" spell is great.  The runeshield isn't the way to go about it.  Nice thought, just not quite enough thought on the implementation or the use.  <P>However, do please keep trying. *grin* <P>Nolija Ghrim<BR>Enchantress of Rodcet Nife. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, you are correct, the idea is a sound one.  Unfortunately, its implemenation is not.  It boils down to the recast time for me.

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Do not take all these angry reactions the wrong way, but yes, this was not a useful spell. I agree VERY sincerely with your (Verant/the spell designers) line of thinking. <P>The 10 min re-cast time itself is not really the problem -- the fact that "re-cast" includes the "Memorization" period, between you memming the spell for the first time, and the first time you are allowed to use it -- THAT is the problem. <P>What caused the angry reactions here, is very simple: If the designer/programmer who created this spell, played an enchanter actively, at the lvl where this spell was designed for, he/she would KNOW this. -- ANY enchanter who plays at this level WILL KNOW THIS, NO EXCEPTION. The frustration, the anger, is because we feel frustrated that changes -- or proposed changes -- are made by people who do not know what it is about, to play an enchanter. <P>I'm a dedicated enchanter, and I like to think I'm a good one too. I have never had Gate memorized in a combat situation. I use ALL spell slots, ALL the time. I cycle my buffs, and swap them out. I would NEVER EVER have room for an extra spell slot for a 10 minute refresh spell. No decent enchanter ever would. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Conceptually, maybe it might have had some potential.  (Thought I still can't imagine where)<P>However, healing yourself for 1000 points damage,(casting RUNE is considered healing, Absor) is just going to make the monster a LOT more pissed off, and after it eats through the rune shield, it will simply kill you.  Adding a 1000 points of healing to the agro of Tashania makes for a monster that is simply not going to let you live.<P>Also, your assumption about stunning is rather shallow, quite a few monsters, especially ones this would likely be used with, are unstunnable.  In case your not familiar, Absor, Giants, Wyrms, Wyverns, Flux Hounds, dragons and most uber encounters, are all unstunnable.<P>And any monster that is stunnable, can generally be stunned without the aid of a 1000 hp rune shield.<P>This coupled with the fact that it takes up yet ANOTHER permenent slot, makes it simply unusable and unpractical.<P>What exactly where you all thinking?  Tash the monster, then cast this rune shield, then hope the shield lasts long enough for tanks to taunt the monster off of you?<P>Something is also made rather obvious, with the concept of this spell:<P>The Live team is simply not familiar with the problems and challenges faced by high level enchanters.  This more than anything else, saddens me the most.  <BR>Rotgut<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058045&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058045&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
