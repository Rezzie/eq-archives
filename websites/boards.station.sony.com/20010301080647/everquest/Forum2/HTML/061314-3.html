&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've played EQ for about 2 years now, I've 14 active characters, most in their teens. I'm the first to admit that I'm not the typical player. I'm not a number-cruncher; it doesn't interest me to kill 4,965,221 identical mobs to achieve 1/20 the experience necessary to acquire a new ability or something interesting. It doesn't interest me to associate with 5 mindless jerks who are identical to the 5 mindless jerks I associated with for the last 4,965,221 mobs. My top character has been level 40 since august of last year. Because about that time I realised that I wasn't having fun spending 90% of my *day*, not just my playing time, medding, blasting, or recovering my body, and started looking for other classes to play. But every time I started another class to play because some aspect of it interested me, that aspect would be changed or eliminated before I got to a point where I could enjoy it. I had gotten my enchanter to level 20 before I discovered that enchanters can't mez giants. I've also heard that there are zones in kunark where creatures can't be charmed. /sigh. My current favorite is a lvl 17 bard; people keep telling me that they can't solo at higher levels, which will suck, but at least they have something to offer a group of mindless jerks. I've taken to ignoring nerf patch announcements, becaus all they do is make me miserable; Verant is going to do what Verant is going to do and my only option is to quit. <BR>I'm not an RPGer, I've discovered. I don't CARE if I have 589 hitpoints vs 588. The calculations to maximize my mana or defeat Nagafen bore me. I considered doing quests, which seems to reflect my playing interests, but all the quests are either: 1) impossible solo (translation - for those outside of a guild), 2) have rewards which fall far short of the risk/effort required, or 3) require activity so closely resembling the med/blast/corpse-recover of xping that it's no help. My main char is a 6 and 3/4 year old baby gnome wizard with a lisp who wants to be a barbarian when he grows up; my human bard was orphaned travelling from qeynos to freeport and raised by wood elves. My recently re-created rogue is a dwarven stone mason, travelling to follow the work, who's a rogue not because he's crooked but because he's poor and honest (look up the definition of 'rogue' in the dictionary if you have a problem with this; screw D & D.) My gnome enchanter is named Flyn Bittwiddle, who greets everyone with "Greetings Program!" <BR>In creating these backgrounds for my characters, I've become less annoyed with the nerfs when they come about than I used to be. The evade nerf is pointless to me, for example; I often forget to try it, anyway. If they'd allow my bard to sing to the shout channel instead of shouting, I'd probably be a happy non-camper(at least until the power players start griping about my role-playing.) Even so, it's been my experience that the vast majority of nerfs are not particuarly detrimental, and those that are are soon modified. I'm still trying to figure out the nerf that prevents bard's from singing selo's indoors (druids can't because their power is from the outdoors; it's not unbalancing because druids have things to offer that bards don't, and selo's indoors can often prove deadly. Some places you don't want to be forced to run by a groupmate. But I've learned to live with this nerf.)<BR>While people I used to group with fly past me in levels, power-xping one or two characters at a time, the time I spend in-game is far more rewarding, IMO. Instead of sweating how I'm going to work around a nerf, or where I'm going to xp to make my next level, I start by deciding what character I want to play today. Unfortunately, the xp-driven nature of EQ will require that my poor-but-honest rogue will one day have to give up his grimey banded armor for sleek black armor, just to have enough stats to gain enough levels to explore new areas. It would be nice if six months from now I could explore the expansion areas I've already purchased but am not willing to suffer the hours of CR required to explore with my lvl 40 wizard. <BR>It's a shame Verant wouldn't let me create npcs or quests. I think I'd have a lot more fun than chasing xp and griping about/defending nerfs.<BR>Are you listening, Verant? 8c)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Maybe not at the higher levels, but, um, yes you can solo using heals.  Been leveling my cleric solo from day one.  He may only be sixteen, but I can solo him just fine on heals.

</FONT><HR>Okay.<P>I think I have a fairly unique perspective on this.  I am a 37 Warrior, who's levelled up two 50's clerics.<P>The change has been unbelievable.  In the few days since the change, I tank a heck of a lot less now.  I'm usually running around trying to get the monster off the healer.  It's really sad.<P>Verant needs to realize that certain things don't enhance the game, they just make it more annoying.<P>And as for the wit who thought the game would be more realistic if the mobs instantly went for the healer...  Maybe they could also periodically do absolutely nothing, because they were in the bathroom or getting a soda out of the fridge?<P><BR>             Megann Mantamer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I find it ironically odd that such totally opposite reports are flooding in about the new clerical agro. I actually truly wonder if some of the "I'm having no problems" reports here are real.<P>Why?<P>1) I truly am a player, but I don't play a Cleric. This doesn't mean I don't see and feel the repercussions of what these changes do to me as a player. I am an Enchanter who depends on the life and safety of my cleric... or I die (as if I didn't enough already).<P>2) I have seen what CH and mere Divine Light does to a Cleric. I have seen same clerics die, in VERY experienced, capable groups. I then very shortly afterwards see "LOADING please wait". If I wasn't already disenchanted with my enchanter, I totally am now with my lifeline cut off.<P>3) I have seen this problem in all 50+ situations, from CoM, to Sebilis, to the Royals in Chardok since patch. It is ALWAYS the same. What does this mean for we the players? Longer raids due to multiple CR. Exhaustion, Fatigue, boredom and definately frustration.<P>4) What is the new tactic? Clerics don't heal. I'm totally serious. If you die while engaged tough crap. If your cleric thinks it is no-win with you dying he will kamakazi him/herself, but this will be rare.<P>What does all of this mean? The game is finished. People don't pay to play things which let them down forever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, Absor, if you're watching this thread, I've been playing my Cleric the whole week since that patch was released.<P>How many times have I died because of healing aggro, and nobody could taunt off me?<P>Sebilis: 4 times<BR>Chardok: 3 times<BR>Hole: 0 times (Old world hate lists are weak)<BR>Kael: Too many to count.<BR>Western Wastes: 2 times.<P>Why?  Because you made the cap on 51+ monsters too dang high.  Here's an account of my time in chef, in Sebilis:<P>----------------------------------------<P>Our group consisted of a level 59 Shadowknight, a 51 Enchanter, a 51 Shaman, a 56 Necromancer, and a 53 Monk, and myself, 55 Cleric.<P>Part 1) Debuff spells on ALL casters (including hybrids) no longer taunt with the potential they used to.<P>Problem: ShadowKnights can no longer taunt off casters/Clerics as they used to. Originally, before this most recent patch, it would take one disease hit from a Shadowknight to get a frog off me. Now it takes 2 Shadow Vortexes, and at least 2 Disease Clouds, maybe just an original TAUNT.<P>How would I get a frog on me so hard, that I couldn't be taunted off of? Read on:<P>Part 2) Healing spells now generate more hate than they used to. Complete heal now is designed to generate hate per amount of HP you heal.  (Not 1 hate point per 1 hit point, but the more HP you heal, the more hate is generated)<P>Scenario/problem: - 59 Shadowknight is a Troll, and I'm guessing with full Cleric/Shaman buffs (which he had), he had about 3900 HP. Around 780 hit points for one bubble left. So, I start a complete heal around 1.5 bubbles, which is roughly 1170 hit points, leaving me 2730 hit points to heal, and to generate hate.<P>After I complete healed this Troll for the first time, the krup summoned me, and proceeded to bash on me. I tried to get some remedies off on myself, but it wouldn't work. I turned on Divine Barrier, and usually when you do that, the mob goes for the next highest person on the hate list......Well, I guess I was it.<P>Even with Divine Barrier on, the frog proceeded to attack me while invulnerable. The Troll ShadowKnight then threw a shadow vortex, and I'm still being whacked on. Then threw a Death Shroud (I think that's what it's called. It's an upgrade to shadow vortex), and the frog still proceeded to bash on me. Divine Barrier wore out, and the frog was still hitting me. I then had to use divine aura.<P>One disease cloud later, the Shadowknight finally got the krup shaman off me. After I clicked off Divine Aura, I complete healed myself (Had 2640 HP, and 1 bubble of health left), which was a mistake on my part, and the frog then switched targets from the  Shadowknight, to me.<P>I then died.<BR>-<BR>-<BR>-<P><BR>Absor,<P>When you guys at Verant expect this game to be fun, I don't find dying every time I heal a tank, fun.  This game is being destroyed by your latest patch.  My account status is still "cancelled", but I still have billing allowing me to play.<P>I won't renew my account until this is fixed, or compensated for.  Compensated you say?  Oh, perhaps giving priest classes 252 defense now, instead of capping us at 200.  This would be perfect compensation for the ALREADY ridiculous hate cap for 51+ monsters.<P>This<BR>Game<BR>Is<BR>No<BR>Longer<BR>FUN!!<P>Fun is what makes me want to play games, not stress and discontent.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You bring up a valid point which is that the exp group think hasn't changed too much. Yes there is a bit of increased agro and you have to watch it slightly but all and all exp tactics don't have to change much accomodate this recenty nurf.<P>What I fear are those battles agaisnt hard hitting mobs where clerics basically have to chain CH a single tank just to keep him alive. Huge elemental in BW comes to mind. Way my guild kills him is to have primary tank who has all the agro and then 3 cleics chain healing remedy (or similar spells) with a 4th cleric chain casting CH. With these recent changes i fear the cleric CHing wont last very long. Don't think this effects only this fight. There are many mobs in velious which hit so hard the only way to beat them is to utilize similar tactics.<P>Once again i think verant missed the ball (who's surprised?). Yes purhaps CH was just a tad overpowered in exp settings but all the epic/final/raid battles were specifically tuned to account for it (why else have mobs hitting for 500+). Now verant has gone and made a change that will only slightly effect exp situations and yet drastically changes raids.<P>The only way i can see to get around this nurf is to double your clerics so each only has to take half the agro. Problem with this is that  most raids are already cleric starved. 90% of canceled raids in my experience are canceled due to lack of clerics. To double the cleric requirement on these hard raids (which already required alot of clerics) is just plain stupid! <P>Like all things we'll just have to see how it plays out and wait for verant to come to their sences.<P>Mysthyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, you want feedback?  here goes, from one who has played his cleric since the patch...<P>0-50 mobs, not really much change here.  Complete heal is definately taunting more, but not to an extent where it can't be handled if you work on it hard enough (never used DA, DB and Atone as i have been since the patch).<P>51+ mobs, something you did to the code is not working right.  Esp for Velious mobs and Ubermobs (Trak, et al).  We've been trying different things since the patch, and cheal == dead cleric.  For Non-Ubers CHeal is THE Area of Effect Ubertaunt, and a LOT harder to deal with, depending on magic resistance.  High magic resistance = dead cleric.<P>CHeal has been moved to the last page in my spellbook, never to be used again, save for very special occasions when i know i'm gonna die anyway, or until this gets changed to not be as high a taunt, or until my cleric can handle 2-4 mobs beating on me for 150 quad hits, summoning me all over the place if i try to run.<P>Why don't you do 3 things, 1: change Donal's breastplate to cast INVIS instead of Cheal, and 2: just remove CHeal from the game if you think it's as unbalancing as you apparently think it is, and 3:  Re tune the mobs in Kunark and Velious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I usually for exp am in Sebelis and since the patch I have had to keep DA and DB up at all times if I don't I'm dead. I usually have to heal off the pull or break right away insta aggro on me so have to DA right away after heal. Depending how much I have to heal during fight is about a 50/50 I will have to DB, It seems impossible to get stuff taunted off me otherwise. I have died already a few times before I was doing this.<P>I think maybe its a bit extreme I think somewhere in the middle of what it used to be and what it was might be better, or have it where the tanks can taunt mobs off in a reasonable amt of time like before they kill me =)<P>Sumer<BR>57 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;The only place where it really seems there might be a problem is at the very high end game, with the very hard hitting NPCs.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Yes, I believe that's what we've said from the start.  Most of the posts indicating no problem concern situations where no one expected a problem.  But now the very parts of the game which were already way out of whack are worse.  That's the point.  And there has not been the slightest mention of any retuning of the boinked out high level game.<P><BR>A couple questions:<P>Why was this not tested on the test server?<P>Why did we go through this charade of exchanging views on the cleric class with no mention of this impending major change?

</FONT><HR><BR>Well in regards to the patch i agree something has to be done to make it more fun for the clerics and one thing i thought might be to make pathing realistic. What do I mean by this is make it so players are no longer treated as if though we are insubstantial by mobs and they cant pass thru us then have mobs check the path to there prefered target if they cant summon if they find a player in the way wich would create a block for its path to the cleric it wont change its target instead it will continue to attack whoever is next on the hate list. But it will continue to check its path to prefered target or the 1# person on hate list untill it can get to him or someone generates enough hate to take the clerics spot on the hate list. For a summoning mob they would have to check the pathing around itself to make sure there is actually room for the cleric to stand before summoning if there is no available place for the prefered target it then checks paths for a way to get to him and if none are found it bides its time untill it has room to bring the cleric to it walk to the cleric or the cleric is replaced on the hate list by somone else. This would not change the way Ch taunts but would allow Melee classes to do what there true job is provide protection to those who cannot fight toe to toe because a mob should not be able to walk thru me or my friends to reach somone it hates and if we surround it and block all its possible paths to a prefered target that is more realistic and also more challenging considering knock back effects on spells the constant moving and jockying for position in a battle etc. Another way to handle the aggro is to place a cap on how far up the hate list a cleric can move maybe the #2 position so that the mob will continue to fight the person who is providing it with a clear and present danger untill either that person dies flees or what have you then it would turn to the offending healer for retribution but seriously yes healing does make it more likely that the creature will be killed by its attackers but if there is a warrior or group of warriors siiting there trying to remove its head shouldnt it be more worried about the damage it is taking not the damage that it causes being healed<BR> Third would be to work out a way that in a large scale raid situation involving many players and healers that all aggro from heal spells be divided amongst all healers present because when you think about it there are in some encounter 50+ players on one mob with maybe 10 or more healers present how would the monster really be able to keep track of who casted what all he should know is there are healers present and they must be dealt with and when you consider how many heals are cast in an average uber encounter it really wouldnt be long till all the healers are at the top of hate list. All these ideas are just off the top of my head and my spelling and punctuation is atrocious i know but they are just something to think about. My personal favorite is realistic pathing which would allow people to physically block a monsters path to the cleric and there fore saving his life , not lowering the clerics postion on the hate list but just making the mob have to deal with them for first and after all if someone moves the wrong way and opens the path the cleric will be hit and possibly killed and in large raids or hectic fights mistakes such as a step in the wrong direction will happen often.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am in shock.<P>I just spent the morning in Dalnir running from mobs engaged in battle with other groups. Greater Heal will cause a mob in another group to aggro on me when I heal my own party members. Perhaps I have missed this feature in my earlier play but my recent experiences at the giant fortress in FM lead me to think otherwise. The proximity of groups at that site can be close enough that I think I would have noticed this before (the patch).<P>For a 33rd cleric, some of the stategic evolutions I foresee clerics at my level taking are (1) loading their 2nd or 3rd best healing spells for combat, saving #1 for post-combat 'revive' and (2) groups will need adequate spacing to prevent a freshly pulled mob from beating on a cleric in another group who's healing tanks before a pull. I can only imagine how this will affect spacing on plane and high dungeon raids - if a cleric ever steps foot in one again.<P>What this effectively does is make healing spells AOE DD's (dang nice ones at that!) but the cleric has little hope of surviving if the surrounding mobs can pummel the cleric to death before the peelers save him. And we know what happens to groups who depend on a living cleric to survive a battle... I hope Verant will examine the effects of the clerical aggro changes a bit more closely. If what I saw today is a balancing effort I am curious to know what force they were trying to offset with such a dramatic change.<P>But I'm sure all the necros are ROFL as us clerics cry about getting nerfed...<P>GHunting<P>Armeedoc Curesall<BR>33rd Dwarven Cleric<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Level 55 Cleric here and probably for not much longer...<P>I just could not believe the changes that were posted on the patch message when I read them.  I resisted the urge to finally give up being a cleric and give them a try in OS last night with reets and jugs.<P>In our rather large group of people I DID notice the clerics dying more, especially the cleric in the pull group where the cleric had to CH the puller or peeler.  I was not in that group but in my group I could almost guarantee that if I were to cast Divine Light I was gonna be summoned.  It wasnt even funny.  That is my experience with the hate changes.<P>Now for the "fixes"<P>Why the heck did you go and supposedly make the fizzle rate less on Remedy when the Clerics were BEGGING for the fizzle rate in Divine Light to be lessened?  Remedy rarely fizzles for me so making it easier to cast is totally transparent.  Divine Light is where the problem lies...it is totally frustrating to fizzle three times in a row before you finally get it off and end up spending 2 bubs mana just to successfully cast 1 spell and hope that you havnt burned too much mana up to keep your tank alive.<P>The giving of a remedy class heal to the shamans and druids nearly made me finally throw in ye old clerical towel.  Why?  Lets look at the big pisture here...with the improved healing abilitise of these classes the druids and shamans are now going to be more effective healers for a small xp group than a cleric will.  PLUS druids and shaman can solo for xp whereas post 50 a cleric is TOTALLY dependant on a group.  Effectively you have seriously inhibited a cleric from getting a pick up group for xp as I forsee people wanting a druid or shaman.  This is based on the fact that those classes get one or more of the following that clerics dont have and contribute to a groups success: snare, DOTS, SOW, haste, pets, TP, DD or DOT casting armour (which by the way is manaless so more mana can be devoted to heals), or cannabalize as a way to regain mana, and invis.  What does the cleric bring?  Heals and hp/ac buffs and rezzes.  The druid or shaman can contribute so much more to a smaller group in essence making the small group more effective.  The only thing I am good for now are large raid settings where I dont get xp and I spend hundreds of plat on gems for buffs.<P>SO now here I am as a cleric I am finding it more difficult to get an xp group so I am not gaining xp, my bnk account is dwindling because the only thing people need me for are big raids, but ALAS I cant get into xp groups to get the money to buy gems so my bank account is near zero.  <P>Thanx alot, the changes herein definately made my class more enjyable to play.<P>Gylok<BR>55 Templar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Any CH cast by a cleric means one of two things...a the cleric runs around like a chicken w/ its head cut off because they are getting beaten and the warriors and other "taunters" try to taunt mob off w/ no luck or the cleric sits there like they should and gets beaten on with the taunters unsuccessfully pulling the mob off and hoping that us rogues can aggro enough so that the mob will turn.<P>Basically now I as a rogue cannot evade b/c if I do the mob looks around sees someone w/ a one handed blunt and licks its chops as it proceeds to destroy the cleric.<P>The only solution w/ this is to do one of two things:<P>1. make taunt actually work<P>2. remove the changes<P>Since I know #2 wont happen why is that you reduced taunts effectiveness? And can you please make it work again.  <P>I dread getting past 50 where now every group will want 2 clerics and that will leave one less spot open for everyone else...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yep there sure is.  The new tactic is if celetstial healing won't keep em alive, then let the tanks die.  A click of the rez stick has no agro and no mana either.  Hell, nukes have less agro than remedy now.<P>Are clerics needed for groups and raids?  Yes, more than ever.  Do people want to play them anymore?  Um, sure doesn't seem like it from the other posts.<P>At least clerics wear plate and have 2 invun spells.  I feal for the druids and shamans.

</FONT><HR>I don't think the point here is the change in aggro per say, I think it is the fact that three years after the game goes live we have a change so drastic that it has changed everything. How can Verant make a change to the amount of aggro caused by heals and at the same time reduce the amount of taunt that the tanks can cause. The combination of these two items has forever changed the game mechanics. Some may argue that the change is good while others are steadfast on the other side of the arguement, but the point is that a change like this never should have happened this late. I find it hard to believe that Verant just now figured out that something of this magnitude was broken. I have seen Verant make changes that I have agreeed with and changes that I didn't agree with but this is one change that should never have been made.<P>Please for the sake of the players, put it back the way it was, and please avoid making these drastic changes to a game we love. The game may have been created by you but it is ours now.<P><BR>Buku<BR>Lanys Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Seeing that Absor has graced this thread with his presence once, lets hope he continues to visit.<P>The Healing aggro change is _under_most_conditions_ (i.e., pre50th level) not as bad as people make it sound.  Sure, I was playing around in the DL last night, and in 14 hours of play, saw only two deaths, both clerics.  But both of them could have been avoided if the clerics were more used to dealing with being aggroed (in one case, the cleric emulated a newbie and ran off trailing the mob, heading for the zone, making it impossible to either root the mob or heal him..and didnt make it).  Now, before you start flaming me about not understanding the higher game, let me get to my point.<P>There are three different issues regarding healing aggro:<P>1)  Encounters involving one or two mobs that are below the 50th level cap.<BR>   The new aggro rules work fine here.  This is undoubtably the situation that was being considered when the new rules were designed and 'tested' and they make sense here. Aggro is higher, but manageable amd the encounters are not super deadly.<BR>Solution:  None needed, although fixes applied to the following solutions will affect this situation as well.<P>2)  Encounters involving many mobs that are below the 50th level cap.  Note:  there are many areas in the world where this situation is unavoidable.  Single and double pulling is NOT possible in all areas.<P>    The new aggro rules DO NOT work under these conditions.  The problem is that a 1000 point heal generates MANY TIMES more aggro than does a 1000 point nuke or 1000 pts of damage.  Scenario:  Party beats on mob 1, while mobs 2-5 are mezzed, rooted or allowed to beat on tanks.  After a while, someone needs a heal (could be the tank, could be the chanter,doesnt really matter).  Cleric heals injured person.  Mob 1 has cleric elevated to a higher aggro, but this is offset by previous damage.  Mob1 _might_ aggro on cleric, but can be taunted/ damaged off.  Mobs2-5 ALSO aggro on cleric, but have no offsetting hate list and thus cleric shoots to the top.  If they are free to attack, they do so and the party has NO WAY to get them all off.  And, even if they do (re-mez, for example)...As they beat on Mob2, a new heal is necessary.  But not mobs3-5 have twice the heal aggro they did earlier...Etc.  By the time you get to that last mob, it has the cleric on a hate list equivelent to ALL THE DAMAGE THAT THE PREVIOUS MOBS DID (because all that damage had to be healed at some point).  This hate list cannot be offset by simple damage or taunting, and can only be offset by mem blur or Atone (and may require MANY atones, as the mobs dont always cooperate in their positioning).  Thus, this situation CAN be managed with great difficulty...and if the cleric has to cast several atones, he isnt healing or medding and may not be able to get off the next heal when it is needed.  <BR>Essential problem:  HEALS ADD TO THE HATE LISTS OF ALL MOBS HAVING RECIPIENT ON THEIR HATE LIST, BUT DAMAGE AND TAUNTS ONLY APPLIES TO THE ONE BEING HIT.<BR>Proposed Solution:  Heal adds to aggro, but at a 1:3 ratio.  Under this rule, although each heal will add less aggro, as the cleric casts several heals, his aggro on the unengaged mobs will still be going up, resulting in a more dangerous situation for him (which was your goal, no?) while not inflating his aggro as currently occurs.<P>3) Post 50 Mobs.. The problem here is, as has been pointed out earlier, that the mobs to damage to the players many times faster than the players do damage to the mob.  But the heals HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE MOBS DAMAGE RATE. And, even if you spread the damage out over several tanks, unless you have more clerics than tanks, the damage get re-concentrated BACK onto the clerics.  Thus, to restate the same situation: <BR>     mob damage &gt;&gt;&gt; player damage<BR>     cleric healing = mob damage<BR>     therefore:  cleric healing &gt;&gt;&gt; player damage<P>     Even if you have twelve tanks and four clerics (for example)<P><BR>  So how do players successfully overcome heal taunt?<BR>Solution:  Add a higher level version of the DA line which has a hate reduction capable of offsetting the CHeal aggro.  This seems like a logical spell and is completely in keeping with the existing spell lines and the changes being made to the hate lists.  Obviously, some clerics will still die if they cant get that DA off within the three seconds they have (2 sec recovery from casting and 1 sec to cast, more or less).  Sure, clerics will still die occaisionally, but at least they will have a fighting chance.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a 51 cleric and have to say in the 2 nights that I played after the patch the difference was VERY noticable. I should point out that I wasnt actually aware of the agro increase until after I played.<P>I spent those 2 nights in Karnor's Castle. Basically it seems that CH is now an abbreviation for Cleric's Hammered, because thats what happened every time I cast it. Don't cast it I hear you say, well ok, but I might as well be a druid or shaman then, and have there wider range of spells. <P>After 2 deaths for myself and 4 others in my party, I sent a tell to a friend who was in PoG a level 60 cleric, who also stated that his guilds clerics had suffered many deaths and many deaths associated with the loss of the healera. He told me of the changes, and I was pretty angry about it. I decided to call it a night and try again tomorrow with a fresh mind.<P>THe following day I found myself being constantly pounded on, at one point someone dragged a train over the drawbridge (we were in Left moat) as I cast remedy on a caster in the corner, and the whole train came, from some distance away, and piled into us. As usual it was the poor chanter who died. We suffered a significantly higher number of deaths that night, and I have not played since. <P>I've quested, Ive rezzed the odd person, camped a few things with friends. I cant bring myself to play with ppl of my level in an xp environment. I cant stand knowing that my only defining spell (CH and yes it is pretty much our only unique one now) is now too dangerous for me to cast. If I do I will most likely die, my tank will die, my gruop will die. Wouldnt be so bad if my "plate" armour actually performed like plate armour and not like cardboard, but it doesnt it just looks nice. Use DA and DB I hear you say, well sorry but once every 15 minutes isnt going to mean a thing if your group pulls anywhere near the number mine do. Hmm whole thing smells of timesinks.<P>Seem to me this game already has far to many timesinks to slow us down, some might say to stop us levelling etc. Camping for days to get some crummy item for a quest, or a mob that never shows. That part of the game has always depressed me. Id prefer to see more complicated quests over inane camping. Hey come see this cool game, yeah Im playing a cleric and Im sat on my ass for 36 hours straight waiting for something that might show, cool huh, erm no. Sorry I digress. <BR>Now they make sure we die more, to further slow our rise to the upper levels? I for one find myself less and less drawn to play EQ and especially my cleric, whom I dearly loved to play in the past. Im sick of Clerics "special skills" being shared but us never seeing anything but downgrades. <P>Now as a cleric Im made to feel lousy and stressed because I know full well I can no longer do my job to the standard I once did.<P>ON a final note with agro, I have done LARP, thats live roleplay and been in a few simulated battles, so I like to think I know how you think and react in these things (yeah Im a freak etc  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ).  Now can anyone at verant honestly tell me that if you were in that situation for real, please imagine for a second. YOu are fighting, you are outnumbered. AS you fight one, a person begins to heal, you quickly turn and hit them in hope of stopping it etc. Meanwhile a huge musclebound barbarian is hacking away at you with the biggest most oversized sword you ever saw, its literally slicing pieces off you. You hit the man stood there doing nothing? Or you turn and fight/defend yourself against the man hacking seven layers of skin off and calling your mom a gnoll? I know if it were me Id do the latter.<P>I could go on all night, but I won't, thanks for your bandwidth  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>I have a character on test I use to try out changes and upcoming reworks so I can be prepared for them on the live servers.  I thought that was what test was for, was I mistaken?<P>  You make a change to the way you calculate taunt for CH and the way both the patch message and the way every blue name after trys to explain the modification you all ignore the way you created CH.  You ignored the way healing Taunt works.  Right now CH post 50 creates the Agro of landing a 2k dot on the mob or whatever your cap agro is on it prior to that is is 800.  CH is a 10k heal it doesnt check the amount of points the target needs and only send that.  It dumps massive hp at the target.  The target is healed to max hp.  Low level heals always agro on the hp sent by the spell not by how many hp the target needed. So the logic posted on your "PATCH" is broken.  Is the logic in your Code? <P>I have posted numerous times discussing the way CH has worked at its core and how low level heal taunt works, I then incorporated all information posted about this change.  I have yet to see a blue name respond in any meaningful way to those posts.  Basically a Heal creates taunt on 100hp about equivilant to a 100pt dd, GH does the same only 300hp.  The calculation was broken to accomodate CH because VI coded CH by just making it a 10K heal.  That is why DeathPact does not work since it doesnt do 25% heal like was announced since you dont bother to calculate 25% of the target  full health hp and apply them.<P>I think you created a logic error in your healing taunt code in an attempt to adjust CH agro.<P>If you are not going to do anything constructive Absor, Abashi, et al when reading these threads dont bother to post to them.  Your class discussions were worthless.  You failed to even look in depth at what many of the most troubled classes were saying. (Wizzie, and Cleric are among the best examples)<P>How about coming out and giving a full disclosure on the decision to Nerf CH at this time.  If it was broke it has been so for a long time.  I think the decision has nothing to do with a bug fix and more to do with High end game slowdown.<P>Clerics are broken.  They were broken before this patch and they are more broken now.<P>What part of <BR>"LOADING PLEASE WAIT" <BR>is entertaining or fun.<P>Tfodthog Tmfof<BR>Furious Cleric fed up with incompetent VI rhetoric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
