</FONT><HR>KEEP YOUR STINKIN MANA SONG! <P>Yea thats right, the new level 20 mana song, you can keep it. The LAST thing in the world Bards need is another mana song. The MAIN reason I rarely play my 51 Bard anymore is I refuse to be nothing more then a mana battery. Rest assured thats all Bards are from 32 on. <P>I am not going to invest anymore time in a class with a bad exp penelty, high agro, low hps, low damage output etc. Just to be a battery for selfish casters? Not what I had in mind sorry.<P>Heres a better idea. REMOVE ALL MANA SONGS!<BR>Yes thats right or at least pretend to remove them for a second.(Do it for real for all I care) Now, ASSUMING YOU HAVE NO MANA SONGS WHAT IS A BARD ACTUALLY GOOD FOR? At low levels many things, at high levels nothing. This is what you need to think about when balancing a Bard. Why would anyone want to group with him, especially since they suck so much exp.? If you did remove the mana songs a Bard could probably never get a pick up group again.<P>Bard haste and slow songs should be MORE powerful then Enchanter and Shaman spells. This would be balanced by the fact the effects only last 18 seconds max and every pulse raises your agro.<P>Adding a Bard to the group should take a load off these class's, not conflict with them. An Enchanter or Shaman should be thinking "Hey I dont have to keep hasting the tanks every few minutes, we have a Bard" Same goes for slow spells. That would give them more mana and time to play with their DDs, DOTs, and stun type spells too. It would be better for everyone. When I play my Monk I hate having to constantly ask to be hasted every few minutes. If Bard haste was any good that wouldn't be needed.<P>Dont even THINK about nerfing the Charm line. The 39 song should have the mana requirment REMOVED as a matter of fact. This does nothing to prevent soloing, just ruins the crowd control use. I can solo easy with 3 chants on a macro and sow, or 2 chants and selos. I have used more then a bubble just doing crowd control on a single bad pull in Karnors castle though. Seeing as it takes 40+ minutes to get from OOM to FM, this is clearly not fair to Bards. <P>Isn't it ENOUGH penelty that the song lasts 18 seconds max then the mob quad hits me for 120s between charms? Bards don't have enough hps to get away with that very long. Bards dont have stun, root or mem wipe you know. Bards get tore up when THEIR charms and mezs break or are resisted.<P>The 27 song was never ever overpowered. If it was you would see more Bards on the servers then any other class and they would be soloing all the time. Druids and Necros clearly solo much better but I dont hear nerf crys about them. <P>The fact is 90% of the Bard out there group most of the time. This is because its easier and faster exp to group. If soloing was easier/faster exp, more Bards would be solo most of the time, like the Druids and Necros are. <P>The reason Bards alway fear or kite mobs is simple. They have no choice. At 51 I cant go toe to toe with a level 35 mob, which is pretty sad. Most other class's simply destroy a mob 16 levels below them.<P>To the guy asking for our songs to buff pets, are you nuts? The pet class's are outragously overpowered as it is, they need no Bard songs. Pets aren't usually used as tanks in high level groups anyway, they are just extra damage like a dot spell.<P>I want to do crowd control again (effectivly, not the way it is now). Restore the lulliby song to pre nerf status! It never ever came close to an Enchanters god like crowd control powers. I want to take the haste/slow load off the group again too.<P>Give me SOMETHING useful OTHER then mana battery. You can keep that, I don't want it to be the Bards defining characteristic. Mana should NOT be the only reason people want a Bard. It should not be the first thing people think about when they hear the word Bard either.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is a point, put up with the anger long enough to see it.<P>To balance bards you have to either nerf chanters or make bards much, much more powerful.  Chanters surpass bards in all areas groups look for.  Frankly, I don't think verant will do that, they're too afraid of their precious chanter community getting upset.  I don't want to hear that we have melee, so everythings ok, our melee sucks.  Go compare it to melees and priests sometime, its closer to a shamans melee skill than a paladin.  Thats ok, though.  Bards aren't about melee, we're about song.  Oh, manaless, you say?  Yeah, I'm sure, as a chanter, its hard to keep clarity 2 on the casters and haste on the melees (espescially with manaless epic w/ better manaless haste than bards).  And they don't drop if the chanter has to mez a pull.  Time is the mana of bards, you spend it on your songs, and theres not much of it to go around.  (I'm not asking for more time, more time would only be useful with more song slots, and I'm not gonna ask for that either.)<P>Improving our melee is a cop out.  Improving our mana pimp abilities gets us nowhere.  You *must* balance us with enchanters if you want class balance, and those changes must be in song.  This haste stacking bull is pointless.  We're looking for BALANCE not an upgrade, to balance things, your pros must equal the cons. If bards had better (not stackable) haste than chanters, do you think it would be balanced?  Do you think chanters class as a whole would be worsened by not being the masters of almost everything a bard does?  In the vision, bards are made for group buffs(mainly melees, casters dont benefit from many bard songs), the problem is simple, the vision sees bards as jack of all trades, master of none.  You have to decide between either the vision, or balance.<P>one last thing before I go, something thats always annoyed me, constraints on song, to make up for the fact that they're manaless:<P>Time: Duration of songs will never allow more than 4 standard duration songs juggled at a time, and only 3 unless you've got timing I've never seen before.<P>Party Only:  Well, thats obvious, again, I'm annoyed that I can't bring better haste to my group in some plane raid, because some chanter already got them with their non-group only, manaless, epic weapon (tky VI ^^).<P>And, the third limiter on songs:  The vision.  Jack of all Trades, Master of None.  Lets face it, if The Vision worked, we wouldn't be here.  Our songs will always be limited to some other classes cap because of the vision, yet despite the 'jack of all trades' bards *have* developed their place in a group as a chanter look alike.<P>So, I don't ever want to hear anybody say again that songs being manaless is an advantage, its a requirement of the code for the songs to be manaless.  We must be CONSTANTLY singing because of duration factor.<P>Ok, I'm ranting, summary:balance bards and chanters.<P>end<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've been reading through this and the previous Bard threads and the overall message seems to be the same.  Bards are not happy about their role in groups post-50 and many believe that they have none at all. Haste and slow songs stacking would lift the spirits of many post-50 Bards who find themselves undesirable for raids. Since the Bard is considered to be a "group-oriented" class, one would think that they would be useful in a group.  Unfortunately many Bards feel - and I would have to agree with them - that Enchanters and Shamans are much better suited to groups than they are. One Enchanter or Shaman can cast long lasting buffs on 15+ people before requiring to meditate, whereas a Bard can buff at most 5 people - in his group! - and has to continue to sing to keep the effect up. If the Bard had better buffs than Shamans or Enchanters that would be okay, but that is not the case.<P>I can't say that I don't like the idea of upping our defensive skills or about adding a new song (even though it is a mana song...), but I do not think this solves the balance issue at all. To be frank, I do not care if I have better defensive skills or a new manasong, it will still not make me wanted in raids.  I would much rather see an increase in our song's power than our melee power.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>must... add... one... more... whine<P>ok, here goes:<P>if you DON'T want to make haste and slow stack, even though you should, because Bard haste/slow sucks alone.  sometimes, its not even worth doing, because you'd be more effective just chanting a damned mob instead of hasting a pally for example.<P>if you don't, then how about this:<BR>1. make mana song A LOT better than clarity.  lets face it, in its current form, its not as good, because bards often don't sing it in battles, so faster mana regen occurs only part of the time.  greater mana regen would make up for this difference.<BR>2. improve Bard mezz ALOT.  The AE Mezz, target mezz.  lower resists, decrease casting times.<P>if you won't make it so bards can play along side chanters, then let us be sufficient replacements.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I got creative.  I have the simplest fix ever to balancing bards.<P>Make the duration of songs scale with level.  So by level 60 you should be able to comfortably mix 6- 7 songs at the same time.  This shouldn't be too difficult to code.  put a + C * Level multiplier for the song duration next to each song duration.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I will grant that reading multiple threads on various classes would be a time consuming affair.  Yet if the whole becomes too hectic to handle, posting a small note stating something like "Since too many threads have exploded at once, I wish to concentrate on &lt;class&gt; since I feel they are in greatest need of help.  I will return to your class in the near future."  At least this gives the readers a sense of being read, instead of potentially ignored.  Also, if Absor or whomever does go this route, they should return in a timely fashion - a few weeks at best.<P>Since this is the bard thread, I should state some of my thoughts on the matter.  While only 29th level, my nature is more along the lines of being a battle bard.  Thus parry and riposte I could use _now_, not at the beyond 50+ stage.  While test server has the bards with defense equivalent to the fighters, perhaps it was answered and I missed it, but is this ~only~ the defense skill or the whole gambit?  That is, dodge, parry, and riposte are also equal?<P>This might be the issue with us bards in general - since we can cover various angles in time of need, posters state how they see themselves.  We do not have an underlining unity except in name.  While I state I am a battle bard and twist songs for group battle, I have seen other bards be more personal and twist songs only for themselves.  Other bards are healers in nature, others might attempt the enchanter angle, and still others do the charm and solo route.  So each and every one of us state this is what is wrong from their point of view.  But what is the main aspects wrong with us?  Reading about the high end game being broken might help me in the future, but what about me personally _now_?  How does a newbie bard feel about themselves?  Everyone's opinion should count no matter how little or how much time is invested.  If we cater to a select few, we are hurting the whole.<P>Just an opinion, of course.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Axlrose - Bristlebane Bastard Bard...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This probably applies to other classes but my character is a Bard so I'm going to post it here.<P>Would it be possible to add an NPC to towns that we could give a "donation" to and they would then Bind us.  The Priest of Discord may be a candidate but would be hard to reach for characters that are KOS.<P>Priestess Caularia in the Temple of Life in Qeynos is an example of an NPC that casts a beneficial spell for the donation of a diseased pelt.<P>This may seem minor but I am getting very annoyed after calling out for a Bind for ten or twenty minutes while the surnamed robe-wearers run past me at the gate because Binding is beneath them.<P>This is unbalancing because of the time I have to waste either waiting for a bind or running from across the continent on a corpse run.<P>It's also unbalancing because there is nothing outside actual combat that pure casters need from melee types.  If there was, they may be a bit more inclined to help us out.<P>I understand that if I were in a group getting a bind shouldn't be a problem.  But, if I'm not in a group to start with, I would have to travel to the hunting grounds, join a group, then convince the group to let me and one of the finger-wigglers run back to an area where I can be bound and return. <P>Thanks,<BR>Drent of Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A slightly different take on the 'mana battery thing'<P>I know you are probably tired of hearing about how Bards don't want to be a mana battery.  You may be harboring the idea that this is simply a gameplay choice or peer pressure.  However, the mana-battery-syndrome is a result of a number of issues which, if properly balanced out, will remove the problem.<P>I'll illustrate this through an example. I was playing in Velious hunting the walruses and the walrus-man types in the company of a necromancer.  She asked me to not sing the mana song but to snare and pull etc.<P>She wanted some mana song but not continual - so this isn't a peer pressure situation.  However, the difference in effectiveness between my snares and in particular my ability to control extra walruses (low blue to me) that wandered by and HER ability to control them via the necro dot/snare/fear casting was huge. She had resists but if she stuck one in 2 spells it stuck for 30 seconds or more and we had time to finish off the first foe.<P>Outdoors without camps or line of sight issues with mobs i usually pull with Fufill's for the Tashan effect.  Then I'd snare so she could fear.  Due to the resist levels I was unable to do anything but snare and try to Fufill when I could.  When another  mob would wander in I'd try to charm it (if it were a low blue) since barb mez isn't worth the time compared to charm (since it lasts such a short amount of time and is resisted so often).<P>My charms were resisted well over half the time and lasted an average of 3 seconds ... finally the necro had to save me by fearing one walrus which was eating my lunch as I tried to get it under control.<P>So I looked at the numbers on the spell lists for mana costs and I realized what  most bards have long realized.  IT IS VASTLY MORE EFFICIENT FOR ME TO NOT EVEN CAST ON THE MOBS BUT RATHER TO GIVE THE EFFECTIVE CASTER MORE MANA.<P>It isn't a matter of peer pressure or laziness but rather good tactics. The casters are so much more effective that there is not much point in wasting song cycles on trying to effect the mobs.<P>That's why there is apush for mana battery use - we can't do enough to make using our other spells as viable as allowing real casters to use more of their spells.<P>Granted this isn't an absolute rule and it depends on party composition etc. but it is a very hard tactic to deny in many situations.  And it's boring .. just thought I'd throw that in.<P>What we need is a return to the thing that makes a bard - the ability to do meaningful crowd control at ALL levels from 16 to 60.<P>Not the best but effective enough to be the second choice would seem reasonable.<P>In addition, the dev team needs to realize that most bard songs DO have a mana cost. In the virtual mana you aren't returning to the casters/healers AND in blood.  Bard mana is mostly paid in blood (aggro) - my hits are what race down as I play, the question isn't whether I'll be OOM but OOhitpoints and thus unable to contribute a spell.  While I'm chain casting snare 12 times in order to keep it more or less on for 30 seconds i'm being beaten on - draining mana from the healers to keep me alive and running the risk of dying for what is essentially a no-cost spell for a ranger or other snare-enabled class.<P>So.... my suggestions:<P>1) lower restists on Snare, Lull, Lullabye, Mez, Charm lines to roughly half what they are now.<P>I know this seems insanely high but the gap here between use and non-use is HUGE. These things grow increasingly weak as we progress in levels and thus we become harder and harder to justify as doing anything other than  mana song.<P>2) lower resists for other bard songs by a reasonable factor - perhaps 10% - to compensate for the aggro effects which are still extremely punishing.<P>3) Let bards bind - not gate but bind.  Bards are the mid ground between melee and caster and really don't fall under the hybrid umbrella - having one of the useful transport skills seems more appropriate than having none.<P>4) Check out the many previously mentioned stacking issues - frankly I think that the stacks aren't that serious but enough high-level bards seem concerned that I'm willing to concede it ought to be looked at.<P>I know this comes late in the thread - probably too late but I hadn't seen the reason behind being a mana battery explained yet and thought it was worthwhile to add.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I hope you have time for one more comment.  Can you see if the design team will consider adding two more chants, one for poison and disease lines?  Should deal damage comparable to the other chants, and drop resist's for them.  I ask for this because I'm getting to where I'm normally twisting four songs during combat (except during largescale raids ... keeping two effects going during a naggy raid is enough of a headache, let alone 4), and the only dot's I now have available to me are area effect if I want a 4th dot.  Also, see if they wouldn't mind changing Fufils Curtailing Chant to have comparable damage and magic resist reduction to the other two chants.<P>Doggod,<P>Your just not playing to the best of your own abilities then.  You *could* be doing a lot more, but your not trying hard enough apparently.<P>At 47 I can deal in excess of 1400 damage a minute without touching a single weapon.  You say we can't deal damage well?  Taking only their melee into consideration, I'm beating level 60 bards for damage with that.  I'm also beating equivelant level rangers, sometimes warriors (depending on their equipment), and doing about 50-70% of the damage a monk would deal.  I think what our class needs is for the resist's on our songs at high levels to be dropped, because that is my main source of damage, and should not only ramp up in damage better as I increase levels, but be'n that it *is* my primary source of damage, it shouldn't be limiting me because it resist's a lot, same as with wizards.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Have to agree with the post about dropping bind from the discussion.<P>With the number of classes that can bind, there is no need for another.  You hae to pay a penalty somewhere and I think this is one of them.  Not being able to bind myself or someone else is just a trivial item compared to other things that need fixed with our class.<P>IF Verant gave us bind, I would have to go and find a quest somewhere to change my bard from an agnostic.

</FONT><HR>1)I always use instruments so I've noticed out hand-to-hand skills are terrible.  My skill is 100 and at level 35 I hit for a max of about 8.  Please adjust this, I might as well not even punch any more.  Are there any useful bard combat gloves out there?  I don't know of any that does not make since.<P>2)We get one song per level, but many of our songs are rarely used.  In fact I twisted pretty much the same three songs until level 30.  That seems very strange to me and not very exciting.<P>3)Please have the level 32 mana song put an icon on the screen so the party members know the effects of the song are influencing them.  This would also aid in twisting this song.<P>4)Our level 34 mana song can not be twisted with any other song, that makes it useless since when we are not fighting everyone wants us to play the level 32 mana song for faster mana regen.<P>5)Our TAUNT skill is pathetic when I need to taunt a MOB off another party member it is almost impossible.  My only way to do this now is to charm the MOB.  From levels 1 to 25 we can't keep the MOBs off us, after that I can't get there attention, even our mezs don't make the MOB forget about the other party member it was chasing.  Perhaps we need the TAUNT skill or a song with an extremely high aggro value but without the charm.<P>6)Getting TRACKING at 35 is an insult, now that I am glued to the party after level 32 it servers no purpose.  We should get tracking shortly after rangers get it.  We are a great pulling class until level 32.<P>7)Make instrument switching more doable.  I don't use hot keys for my songs, so I really don't see how I can switch instruments.  How about a hot key for switching instruments?<P>8)I am not worried about my melee skills.  I my option bards should not be using weapons anyway, instruments are our forte.  However it would be nice to get some DD songs at lower levels that harm individuals instead of AE.  Shout is okay, but we can not continuously sing it, why is that?<P>9)So many weapons for other classes...so few instruments for bards.  I have had the same lute since level 1, that's pretty lame.<P>10)Some of our songs should get upgrades at higher levels.  For instance how about our level 6 healing song?  Party members have so many hit points that the song is basically worthless for healing.<P>11)I agree with some of the other posters in regards to the number of songs we can twist should be increased in higher levels.  If this is not possible consider adding more songs like the level 34 mana song (which does mana regen, Jig and healing), but do not reduce the effectiveness of each component of the new song.<P><BR>Jazlen<BR>Bard of 35 songs<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, just to respond a bit...<P>The most important things are song stacking.  Our songs should either stack with all buffs or be of equal or greater power to same-level buffs (because we can't keep them going all the time--they will drop in combat--and we can only do three at once, and most other classes can do other things besides buff).<P>The PREFERENCE is to have them stack with all buffs and debuffs (and have our debuff resist rates SERIOUSLY lowered); then we'd be able to group with other classes without anyone stepping on each others' toes.<P>Tracking at 35 is fine.  You're not glued to a group at 32; if you let yourself be glued to the group then it's your fault.  I frequently roamed Frontier Mountains looking for blue /conning rare guys to kill.  Didn't find too many but I could look and I could sometimes win against them.  <P>Charm at 39 needs the mana component removed or reduced.  It is resisted quite a bit in Velious.  I've blown a full bubble of mana on a single blue /con trying to charm it.  No, it wasn't charm-immune, I found out later...when I found out it was low enough for the 27 charm to stick.  The level 39 Charm is actually resisted MORE than the 27 charm, just it has a higher level cap and uses mana.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Couple of thoughts:<P>Spells vs. songs: Spells have an inherent advantage, they last... songs require an active bard in the group... I cannot stress the advantage this gives too much. To give a concrete example: how often do party members of a bard ask for Spirit of the Wolf? Selo's Accelerando with any drum is undoubtedly faster, so why do people who have it available want SoW? So much so that they'll beg passing druids, in fact...  I'll tell you why, because Songs require that the bard be close, and playing the particular song you want at that moment.<P>Now... I picked Selo's as an example, because as far as I know it is the ONLY song that is better than equivalent spells in effect! Which makes every other effect we can accomplish both worse statistically, and worse due to the limitations of songs.<P>So... to BALANCE this problem, either you have to change the limitations of songs... allowing a song to affect as many people as ask within a zone for as long as you play it... which is ridiculous and isn't going to happen, or to make the statistical effects of a song BETTER than the equivalent spells in order to make them more desirable to party members. The final alternative, is to let them enhance the effects of the spells themselves... in other words, let them stack.<P>Personally, I'm in favor of making songs better than spells. I can only use two or three at a time (using any more exceeds the effects of the first, making sure that every song in a 4 song cycle is dropped for one pulse, in my experience... so that really doesn't count as "successfully twisting 4"... heck, I can twist 8 songs at once, doesn't mean that more than 3 are "up" at any one time.<P>This means I can pick two or three effects... and have them active. Plus throw in an emergency change up, like a Pixie Strike or something, which will drop all my songs for one pulse in rotation. That's it, that's all I can keep up.<BR>So, unless the casters in the group have only 3 types of enhancements to cast, my having BETTER versions of the effect is not going to keep them from being useful. Plus, this is assuming that I'm not trying to do any damage.<P>From my observations of the way coding changes take effect after patches, I'm guessing that upping the song effects would be easier and less problematic than actually making them all stack.<P>Stacking, would be the most elegant solution, allowing us to actually help groups with our songs to the point that they feel we are valuable, without giving us any real extra ability to make another class angry. Of course, it would probably cause a lot of headaches as it created (or recreated, in the case of past-de-enhancements to the class) programming conflicts between different songs/spells.<P>On the other side: Damage dealing for the bard class should be looked at objectively. With average weapons, we do absolutely pathetic melee damage... which really is fine with me. I don't want to do damage with weapons for my later career as a bard. I view them as a crutch for the young. Yet, we need to be able to dish out some damage somewhere.<P>I want to do damage with songs... and obviously we are supposed to do that, since we have several songs the cause damage. However, from all I can tell, our damage-output is incredibly low compared to other classes. <P>Which class should we be comparable to? We can't keep up with the melee classes in terms of rate of constant damage, and we certainly can't compete with the casting classes in terms of single-strike damage. We have a lot of damage-over-time songs, but they're inferior to spell versions, too. Even our last-chance, high level, blow 800 mana song seems to be universally reviled as laughable and useless.<P>All I ask here is, that you consider finding a point of comparison: Pick another class which you feel we should be equivalent to damage-wise. Then seriously look at the damage they can put forth over time. Then take a good look at the damage bards can put forth: taking into account that if the creature is worth experience to us, and we have maxxed out our requisite musical skills, it will STILL resist at least 1/3 of the time, usually more. Then compare the two, and give us an honest assessment of whether you agree that we need to be adjusted.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to respond to Plundar's post here, because I disagree quite a bit with him on a few issues here ...<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>2)We get one song per level, but many of our songs are rarely used. In fact I twisted pretty much the same three songs until level 30. That seems very strange to me and not very exciting.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Investigate more what your songs are doing.  Up to 20, there's not much to twist.  Up to 20, your a melee class, but between 20-25 (roughly) your a melee with not much else you can do.  There's not enough stackable songs that help enough to warrant twisting them from appearance, but over time things can make a big difference.<P>For instance, chant of battle gives AC to the tanks, level 7 heal song heals their health at probably around 9-12 per tick while standing, which over the course of a minute is 90-120 health.  Perhaps that doesn't seem like a lot, but it does help save mana for heals, and counteracts shaman canibalize and necromancer lich spells.  Also, guardian rythms gives ac as well, though it's not stackable.<P>I could go through a couple others, but like you said not much to do.  You want my opinion though as a high level bard, don't change it.  I realize it was hard for you to get through it, I felt the exact same frustration.  But for every one of us that went through it, how many who weren't good enough to cut it quit playing?  We don't need bards that just 'get by' by only playing mana song and swinging their SSoY's around like their actually doing good damage in the high levels, I and other bards only want people in the ranks that know their stuff.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>3)Please have the level 32 mana song put an icon on the screen so the party members know the effects of the song are influencing them. This would also aid in twisting this song.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>I gather from this statement you've never been in a large raid situation.<P>If they were to do this, then mana song would no longer stack with itself.  Currently, 5 bards and 1 cleric gives that cleric mana back quite rapidly, making a buff line move quite a bit faster.  This was intended by Verant, and those of us bards who've used the tactic of having multiple bards for extreme mana regen don't want it changed.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>4)Our level 34 mana song can not be twisted with any other song, that makes it useless since when we are not fighting everyone wants us to play the level 32 mana song for faster mana regen.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Personally I don't like using it, but you can twist 1 tick of this + 2 ticks of mana song ... using this with seven stringed lute from Maestro of Rancor in plane of hate gives you nearly twice the mana regen you would have gotten with just mana song alone.  I personally am not the type to stand around just doing mana regen though, I tell my group mates to learn mana management, or they'll be oom all the time, because I'm not going to let them rely on me to provide mana all the time.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>6)Getting TRACKING at 35 is an insult, now that I am glued to the party after level 32 it servers no purpose. We should get tracking shortly after rangers get it. We are a great pulling class until level 32.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>You need to break outta the mold then.  If people want you doing mana song during downtime, or while someone else is pulling, fine.  Don't even start it during a fight, even if they request it, except in emergency circumstances.  Allowing them to think that your going to play it anytime they want gets you going down that road to being a mana battery, and it's a hard climb back to the top.  Personally I end up being puller quite often, so having tracking is very usefull, and my groupmates know how to manage their mana enough not to need clarity or me singing mana song for them.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>7)Make instrument switching more doable. I don't use hot keys for my songs, so I really don't see how I can switch instruments. How about a hot key for switching instruments?<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>You ought to use the hotkeys then, if you ignore the ability to be able to make hotkeys that are capable of making instrument swapping easier, then you have no room to complain.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>10)Some of our songs should get upgrades at higher levels. For instance how about our level 6 healing song? Party members have so many hit points that the song is basically worthless for healing.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>I disagree here.  The main strength of this song is that it stacks with all regen songs, and is usually nearly as good as most of the regen spells other classes receive.  You should see a tanks health climb with chloroplast + level 7 song + level 47 song with just a gypsy lute.  It's sick to see it all when your using seven stringed lute.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>11)I agree with some of the other posters in regards to the number of songs we can twist should be increased in higher levels. If this is not possible consider adding more songs like the level 34 mana song (which does mana regen, Jig and healing), but do not reduce the effectiveness of each component of the new song.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Solution to this one: Either a discipline that makes songs last one or two ticks longer, or by level 50 or 55 some songs if not all last an extra tick.  Just ONE extra tick would allow me to twist 6 songs.  I'm thinking it could be extremely cool at 55 to increase it by 1 tick, then have a discipline that increases them yet another tick at level 60, or better yet, upgrade puretone to not just increase song strength, but increase duration by 1 tick.  Imagine memming your 8 best songs ... *that* in my opinion would be a true master musician.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> The bard epic weapon has a proc called 'Dance of the Blade'. This is a group buff. However, it does not stack with the new enchanter velious spell, 'Boon of the Graou'. Or rather, when Dance is up, Boon can't be cast over it. However, if boon is up, Dance can be proced. <BR> The simplest thing would be to make these two effects stack. The short duration, long recast time of garou makes keeping both up extremly tricky.<BR> This is our epic weapon effect.

</FONT><HR>You're doing an awesome job Absor.  Thanks for the patience to read all of these posts.  I didn't have a chance to read them all, so pardon if this is redundant.<P>1) Remove the haste component of lvl 57 song rousing rondo.  Then it could be twisted with lvl 54 celerity song.  As it is now the haste is so slow that it does not seem to be an upgrade at all.  Maybe it wasn't meant as an upgrade, but because it has haste component it seems like it is.  I realize it raises str, attack and provides damage shield but all in all pure haste (celerity) seems better.<P>2) Remove the time based restriction on 56 level songs Highsun and Midnight.  Are there any other spells that are time restricted like this?   Just wondering why these are.  They dont seem to be so awesomely powerful that it would really matter.  As it is now, hardly any bard would keep them memmed since they take up 25% of your spell slots to do so and have 50% chance of not even being castable.<P>I think this especially goes for Song of Midnight.  It would be nice upgrade to level 26 fear song, but because its not usable half the time we cant use it really.  There is hardly any reason to ever use this song instead of lvl 26 song.<P>3) I wish level 55 bombastic bellow had faster recast time.  222 damage isn't really that much at level 55+ anyway so I rarely have it memmed.<P>4) Remove instrument requirement for occlusion of sound.  Then simply make it do less without instrument like most songs.<P>5) It would be nice if level 57 mana drain song would drain more mana.  As it is now you can almost med faster than I can drain.  Wis/int debuffs certainly helps but in the entire scheme of things not by that much.  Now if this were AoE then that would be better I suppose.<P>6) Level 49 shield of songs is a great song, but the noise created is kinda annoying.  Sounds like an alarm clock.  A lot of people complain to me about it.<P>7) It would be very very nice if enchanter mezz would overwrite bard mezz.  As you may know, if bard mezzes mob then enchanter mezzes the same mob, the mob becomes unmezzed completely when bard mezz wears off.<P>8) It would be nice if clarity, clarity II and HP regen could be cast over lvl 55 mana song.  It's really annoying trying to coordinate dropping song before casting these spells.<P>9) I don't have the Ervaj line of songs yet, but it seems to me that requiring an instrument isn't optimal.  Seems like it should be like most songs, more haste when using an instrument, less when not.<P>Don't have any comments on 58-60 level songs since I'm 57 level.<P>-Dumaine<BR>57 Bard <BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just another thought,(I am sure it has been mentioned, but when you have to speed read things so your Boss doesn't get mad at you, you miss a lot  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">) <P>What about Double Attack for the Bards?<P>Give it to Bards at 34th lvl and make it cap at 200.  <P>I feel that by giving it to Bards at 34th lvl you are giving them a wee bit more Fire Power when it comes to grouping then just twisting songs (Which can get rather dull some days).  Bards will never be on par with Fighters/Rogues/Monks/Rangers when it comes to damage dealing, but that extra added damage will always help.  Not to mention with the lower cap on the Skill it insures that bards will never be able to out Taunt Any of the Above mentioned classes unless the Bard goes with an all Instrament attack, and even then it is still "ifie" that the Bard will out-taunt any of them.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Double attack would be too much at lower levels in my opinion. Really, until level 45 ish I think bards are fairly well off, even overpowered to some extent.<P>Once you start getting into the mid to high 50's, the mobs that partys fight at that level are so hard, and have so many hitpoints, that the extra offenseive damage of a low capping (100 ish) double attack would help. <P>With better group buffs, better song stacking, and some better level 55-60 offense options, Bards gain the utility that the class once had in the lower to mid levels.<P>There are other options to making our offense better, but low cap Double Attack is an obvious choice with a predictable outcome if it were implemented. <P>Bards would still miss a ton, due to our low offense/attack skill, but we would have a few more chances to hit.<P>If there really is NO chance that the Bard class will ever get low cap D.A., even at level 60, then at least we need to have our offense/attack skill raised to a level to where we can land more hits with our dual wield alone.<P><BR>Aanani<BR>Paradigm<BR>Sol Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been thinking and rethinking about the issues posted here and have come up with a wish list song that would be balancing and make bards have a very comfortable role to play in lvl 50+ boss encounter raids.<P>Basically it's a luck song,<P>What does it do?<P>I don't know how the back end combat system of everquest works exactly but i'm pretty certain it has a random number generator that rolls for hits, damage, resists, dodges, and all that sort.<BR>I think the luck song should make all the things that are rolled for have a slightly higher chance of success.  In effect a bards group has all their abilities made better during the duration of this song.<P>I realize this sounds unbalancing so let's balance it out a little.<P>First off the percentage increase shouldn't be grossly high anything above 10% would just be sick.  Maybe a 7-8% increase would be optimal.<P>Second let it use a lot of mana.  Maybe a 3rd of a bubble limiting this song to 15 pulses before the bard goes out of mana.  With a bard that can sing 3 songs that 45 song cycles going at 3 seconds a song that's 2min and 20 secs of fighting at most that the bard can keep this buff up for.  <P>Not only do i feel that this song would be an unbalancing yet desirable addition a bard can add in a raid, it also mixes very well with the rp character of a bard.<P>Just a humble sugestion.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor..<P> Since time is comming near for you to end these talks, i would like to do a summary of things that I think should be added to help balance bards in the game post 50+.. here we go!<P> 1) Bard melee is the answer, for the "high Level" Boss mob encounters where the monster is not affected by magic and has to be defeated through melee power. <P> 2) These boss mobs are red to any player! They are 63+, so no player is on equal "footing" with the monster. Due to how level effects spell success, it is not practical for casters to be able to do as much damage to the monsters with massive health over 200K in some cases. So the fights are long, and melee win's the day.<P> 3) Bards are not balanced with other "group buffing" casters. All characters will be buffed prior to the fight and need none of a bards buffs (due to stat, and haste caps). The bards contribution in this situation is his/her melee ability and Mana regen for the casters who are using mana.<P> 4) Bard melee needs to be increased at high level so that they contribute more than a manasong. In such a case, it is more likely that a high leVel raid will look for a "true melee CLASS" to take the spot of the bard. <P>Solutions..<P> a) Bard weapons need to do more damage. Review of some of the weapons available to the other melee classes, and add "BRD" to the ones who fit the need (higher damage) and useability of the bard class. I think many "SHD", and "RNG" weapons, may fall in this area.<P> b) Bards sing and dance.. I see no reason why a bard would not know how to "KICK". This adds a way for bards to do a little more damage, and help bring up their melee contribution at high levels. Give this skill to bards and tweak it as needed (a cap of 155 to start sounds good, have it gain levels the same way Dodge gains levels to 155).<P> c) Bards have a short coming of Heath. this is simular to how monks don't have as much health as Warriors. Give the "BLOCK" skill to Bards. This will aid in the defense area, and falls in line with what a smart bard would be doing, knowing he/she could not take that heavy hit. it should be capped around 75-100 like our parry skill. It will not help our damage, but it "will" allow bards to melee marginally better against the monsters like the boss mobs in velious who will hit our AC due to their levels alone, and our lack of health makes us a liability to the raid if in melee range. This will help.<P> d) Low level bards did use Shields.. But many don't actually use them anymore due to the huge loss of melee ability. (and our melee ability at high levels suffers greatly). Allow bards to "BASH" with a shield (note: you cant bash, and kick at same time, which is normal). This is an ability that i think we should have had all along. We should be able to get fairly high in it's use. The trade off of using duel wield is not balanced for a bard who cant use a shield to bash.. nearly all other melee who use a shield get to bash with it.<P> e) Bards should get regular crits. This shows the skill of a well placed hit and is totally random for warriors and Rogues (one of our parent classes). Since bards are limited to 1 hand weapons, this is one way of adding some melee damage ability, without giving too much. Due to the random nature of regular crits, and the low damage of our hits, it will not add too much damage, but enough to make it worth while.<P>Summary...<P>  Bard Balance is needed in the "melee" side of our class. Originally our songs were thought to make up for our lack of Melee ability, but with the expansions and the increasing difficulty of the encounters in EverQuest, our songs could not overcome our lack of physical damage in high level encounters, where our songs are not needed and a melee class is. Increasing the "options" and abilities of melee available to a Post 50's bard will balance this out. It's up to verant Dev team to determine how much.<P>Thanks for listening.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055105&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055105&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
