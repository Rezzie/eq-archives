</FONT><HR>"But, be honest with yourselves and with me, is this really that much more than an inconvenience? Does fixing a bug that affects two songs warrant taking the servers down for several hours for our entire customer base? We don’t think it does."<P>To be completely honest, I do not think your bug affects just "two songs".  <P>It affects your entire customer base -- at least those who play characters that group with bards.  <P>It affects every spell that non-bards must cast upon bards and bards' groupmates to keep them alive.<P>I regularly group with a druid and a warrior.  They rely on the speed of Selo's + Drum.  <P>They do not rely on the speed of Selo's + Drum just for travelling long distances, although it is often used for that.  <P>My partners primarily count on the speed of Selo's + Drum to escape Bad Situations.  <P>Selo's + Drum is a group equivalent of Divine Aura, Feign Death, Lay Hands, or a better comparison, Spirit of Cheetah.  It allows not just the bard, but everyone grouped with the bard, to outdistance a Deadly Mistake.  <P>Even if group members are nearly dead (you know, the one-pixel-of-health-and-walking-at-100 stones-encumbered-speed), Selo's + Drum can speed the wounded to a safer locale where they can rest, heal up, or gate.  <P>Selo's without a drum will more than likely leave grievously wounded group members in a motionless fetal position on the ground.<P>In our exploration of the game, Selo's with a drum has allowed the three of us to escape our curiousity and experiments: "Think we can take a [insert hard-hitting mob of your choice here] yet?" "Let's find out!" "Uh oh" "Owch" "EVAC" "I can't! I'm being hit!" "Taunt!" "I'm trying" "RUN"<P>This bug does not just affect two songs and the usually complacent members of one class.  <P>It affects everyone who groups with a bard.<P>It also affects Spirit of Wolf, in a roundabout way.  Selo's is a song I've always had up while playing a bard.  Since I discovered the benefit of playing Selo's with a drum, I've never *not* used a drum.  <P>However, since Selo's does not function as it should with a drum now, I see no point in playing it. I might as well memorize a song that ISN'T broken that can benefit my group.  <P>And now the druid I group with is stuck wasting her mana (mana that she would normally spend on DoTing, Snaring, or Blasting) on casting Spirit of Wolf for the entire group, rather than relying upon the manaless superior speed of Selo's Accelerando with a drum.<P>Now she has to spend more mana on healing and evacs, too.<P>"Does fixing a bug . . . warrant taking the servers down for several hours . . . ?"<P>Hell, you guys were the ones making the mistake. Be honest with yourselves. Don't you think you're obliged to fix your buggy software immediately?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kenning:  Nope, your comparison is not applicable.  You haven't been knocked down to a L1 spell.  Selo's isn't your sole reason for existence.  Your analogy is WAY off base.<P>Tholarion:  Every single one of the threads is alive without any of my comments.  The percussion bonus is a convenience.  I haven't backed off that at all.  We disagree, but that doesn't mean I have to play your class to know this.  As other bards in this thread have said the SAME THING, clearly I'm not the only one.<P>And I'm not tossing around idiot or child, as that would border on flaming.  I have indicated that certain conduct, claims, arguments and responses have been idiotIC and childISH.  Yes it's a fine hair to split, but it is there.<P>Again, specialized knowledge of your class is not required for any of my points:  1.  Starting multiple identical threads is childish.  2.  Demanding a 10 hour patch when another is imminent is selfish.  3.  Selo's isn't broken, only diminished to a debated percentage.  4.  There are other things that bards can do while the other bugs are being addressed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"For now, I'd rather not take the risk."<P>There you go, YOUR choice is now not to take the risk. Its that simple, you know there is a problem and so your either deal with it until the next patch or you don't play your bard.<P>There are people posting silly comparisons to other classes abilities here. Look at it this way: <BR>IF tracking (one example given) was broken during a patch there would be lots of people on these boards complaining but Verant would still not re-patch if that were the only post patch bug. They would wait for other bugs to surface (they always do  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) and then do a patch to fix all of them at once.<P>There us no need to complain to Verant about a problem after they have confirmed it. A single thread pointing out the problem would have been enough.<P>If Verant bring down the servers just to patch this single problem you will see even more upset people on this board complaining about it. Maybe you could try talking to those people about it if that happens and explain what was sooo major that the servers needed to come down again right after a patch. Then you would see those people that do not think this is a HUGE class killing problem.<P>I'm not saying this situation is not a problem, it is bad that Verant have a lot of errors in their patches. However please try and think about more than just yourselves.<BR>I bet the emergency patch is at least 5 hours too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All we are asking for is a posted date of the next patch, and soon.  You cannot call the drum bonus just a convience when I only use Selo's with a drum, since it is too slow to be useful otherwise.  Sorry, but I consider SoW unuseful for most of the tasks I perform for my guild with Selo's.  Hope that does not deflate the egos of druids that thought bards just used Selo's as an inflated speed SoW.<P>Also, try to tell the 18 people I had to tell last night that we could not recover their corpses because of the drum bug on Selo's that it is just a convience problem.

</FONT><HR>"I am know what bards get from the enhanced speed their drums give them for their movement songs. I would argue that the speed without them, however, is still faster than Spirit of Wolf. I understand that you are all used to a greater speed. But, be honest with yourselves and with me, is this really that much more than an inconvenience? Does fixing a bug that affects two songs warrant taking the servers down for several hours for our entire customer base? We don’t think it does."<P>Absor this post troubles me. This is the first time in 2 years I have posted here but your brush off of this issue irritates me. The fact Selos is still faster then sow has nothing to do with anything and totally irrelevant. If you think this is just an inconvience you truely have no understanding of the class IMO. Saying be honest with yourselves is basically saying we are not being honest. As has been stated by other Bards I find it presumptous of you to tell me how important a song is. I have over 70 days played as a Bard. I seriously doubt you have testers with that much exp. in the class. I know Ester the tester was given a 50+ Bard and never played the class. She said so at the concert hall. <P>I think most people miss the point of this issue. You guys knew about this bug. The test server people reported it before the patch. Yet you still choose to introduce the bug. Why? Thats what I want to know. Why? <P>You stated "Does fixing a bug that affects two songs warrant taking the servers down for several hours for our entire customer base?" Let me turn that around. What was so urgent in that patch that it had to be released with a known bug? Was it just a deadline? Was it deamed so important to fix root overwriting snare that you guys said to heck with the bug? Were you desperate to change the disiplines? It makes no sense to introduce a new bug when trying to fix a bug that people have been dealing with for 2 years now. If you make new problems while attempting to fix another problem you have accomplished nothing. <P>So why did you guys knowingly introduce a bug? The only conclusion I can come up with is it was an attempt to deflect attention from the selos not overwriting root nerf. Rest assured that is a nerf too, working as intended or not. It was in ill thought out nerf too. Root is not "silence 15' radius". Root in no way stops a Bard from singing so it made perfect sense that selos overwrote root. You guys ever think about what a Bard will use now when they are rooted? AE fear of course. So now instead of bringing one or two mobs to a zone, all hell will break loose with the fear song. I'm sure all the people in the zone are gonna be glad you guys fixed that. <P>So again, why did you guys introduce a known bug instead of postponing it till you got the patch right?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The continued use of ridiculous extremes only makes your position look even less valid."<P>With no reasonable time-line for the fix... I am using my personal experiences to validate my position.  Levitaion was broken for 3-4 weeks... pixie strike was broken for 10 months... the graphics on the drum models are STILL broken after 2 years, and 2 upgrades.  No, Phelan... the extremes are not ridiculous, they are reality.<P>"See, Verant wants to make you folks happy, just not at the expense of the 98% of the players that don't play bards. 5 minutes isn't a problem.  10 hours is. Diminishing returns and all that."<P>Who is quoting the ridiculous extremes Phelan?  The patch on Tuesday took 10 hours, and included extensive changes.  To compare a change to one class, 2 songs, and say it will result in 10 hours of downtime... BULL****!  What if it was only 10 minutes... 15 minutes... 20... but 10 hours to patch this bug?!?!<P>"I've grouped with plenty of bards in 16 months, and I think I've had the benefits of Selo's twice."<P>So, you yourself will be affected... that's another non-bard that feels the nerf.

We don’t think it does."<P>Ok, being honest, do you think inconveniencing an entire class of players in the game for an indefinite amount of time (there isn't even an ESTIMATE of when the next patch will be) is justifiable over taking the servers down for a few hours, especially over a bug that was already known before being patched to live?<P>Here's my comparison.  You are an innocent man in prison.  The judge knows it.  You can't be let out until a new trial can be scheduled and they can't tell you when that will be.  They won't, however, call an "emergency" trial because that would inconvenience the people that might have to serve on the jury for a few hours.  After all, being locked up isn't any more than an inconvenience, is it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

By the looks of things, that's leaning heavily on not.<P>The only thing that will end this circular debate is a patch to fix the mistake.  Argue amongst yourselves all you like.

</FONT><HR>Phelan42,<P>Perhaps semantics is the problem. You think of something likely to kill you or cause major adjustments of playstyle as an inconvenience.  <P>For example, bards can't solo effectively w/o Selo's w/drum.  I personally died in MM due to this bug.  Pulling is not nearly as nice a bard tactic w/o Selo's.  In addition, the poor man's crowd control tactic of running around in circle's while your group takes care of a single mob at a time is not doable for SoW speed Mobs.  Downtime is increased during travel.  <P>Ok, so bards can still group but can't solo.  Ok, we can group but can't pull for our group.  Ok, when a pull goes wrong we can't do poor man's CC (for those under lvl 27).  And finally, we can die when we try to run away.  In addition, travel is slower and playtime therefore reduced.<P>Those are the facts.  You can call it an inconvenience.  You can call it crippling.  Just words, different denotations.  To you, it isn't a big deal.  To the people who actually play the class, it is.  Most of us wouldn't argue it otherwise.<P>Questions for Absor:  <BR>ETA on next patch?<BR>GM lvl Rezzes if we die due to this bug?<BR>Will there be a text notifying all bards of this bug when they log in (for the casual player)?<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
