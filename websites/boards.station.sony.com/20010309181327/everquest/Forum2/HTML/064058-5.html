</FONT><HR>Well, I figure why not add my 2 cents in here and maybe I'll have the good fortune of having someone rip me apart... If nothing else it'll be interesting to see how I'm dissected.<P>As far as the original post, I'm not really sure if I believe the poster was merely posting observations or trolling, seems like a troll to me with the "VAK" disclaimer on it.  <P>Regardless, this thread has been hijacked.  Bloodsage, if nothing else has succeeded in pretty much completely taking this thread over.  If that was the intent, then Congrats, job well done.  If not, a small suggestion, re-read your posts, Bloodsage, and notice that although you call people's actions stupid and similar negative terms, the accusation is implied that they are therefore stupid for making them.  So... You, also, are attacking people on a personal level, whether it is intentional or not, it is obviously perceived that way.  You seem to have an excellent command of the english language, so why do you not make use of it, and choose some less inflammatory words?   Just a suggestion.<P>Oh yeah, I have to agree with Bloodsage, even if not with his presentation of it.  You buy the game, you play it, you have fun...  If you don't have fun, leave.  If you feel you HAVE to have this item or that item, or that you HAVE to reach X level, then you probably should do just what's described in the original post and take a break from EQ.  Assuming the original post wasn't a troll, I think all that's happened to you is that you got a little overly involved with EQ, happens to many, and the vacation has helped you realize this.  By your own admission there's a good chance you'll still play EQ, just hopefully now you'll realize it's just a game and that if it causes you stress, something is wrong.  An fantasy game IMHO is meant to be an escape from reality.  Where your daily stresses are forgotten for a while, and you just kick back and enjoy being someone different than Mr. 9-5, Joe-Aviator, Disgrunteled Postal Worker, whatever.  <P>and lastly...<BR>Go Navy, Beat Army (and Air Force)  <BR>-couldn't resist, heh, flashbacks of my days as a plebe <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>Sciek </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sciek:<P>Smart people can do stupid things.  Rational people can do silly things.<P>That's the distinction some fail to make.<P>Calling an action stupid or silly is not the same as implying the person is stupid or silly.  I once picked up an aluminum skillet that had been in the oven for 3 hours cooking a ham--without a mit.  That was stupid and careless.  I am not, however, a stupid and careless person.  Stupid, careless people don't live long in my profession.<P>See the difference?<P>precision:<P>Reference my sidebar with Goladus on pages three and four, and you'll find proof your generalizations are false.<P>As for the rest of your strangeness, it's hardly productive to debate if you refuse even to discuss anything other than your perception of my motivation.  Which, as I have stated, is irrelevant, and you've provided no insight how it could be otherwise.<P>Guess what?  I don't care whether you like me or not.  Sorry to break it to you.<P>Learn to discuss things rationally, then come back.  Your willful inability to distinguish between discussing a person and discussing an idea or a behavior is becoming tedious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since Bloodsage has so thoroughly hijacked this thread, let's deconstruct his first four posts:<P>Post 1:<P>"Anything that needs a built-in excuse up front isn't really worth arguing with; it's already admitted defeat."<P>&lt;An interesting, although not really on-topic generalization, had he left it there, fine&gt;<P>"GQLLFM."<P>&lt;His patented inflammatory throw-away line, added only for the purpose of ticking off the original poster.&gt;<P>Bloodsage succeeds in his plan, the original poster is now ticked.<P><BR>Post 2:<P>"Ah, last resort of those lacking the self-discipline to quit by themselves: flame others in a lame effort to be banned."<P>&lt;A double ad hominem insult, asserting that the poster lacks self-discipline, and calling his post lame.  Typically, the statement is utterly contentless and does not in any way address the original post.&gt;<P>The lame virtual equivalent of "suicide by cop."<P>&lt;Another insult.&gt;<P>"You chose to characterize anyone who might take issue with your self-pitying sour grapes as a VAK. . .pre-emptively.  Sure sign of a weak argument backed by shaky self-esteem."<P>&lt;A good point, laced with two more insults (self-pitying, shaky self-esteem)&gt;<P>Don't throw stones unless you're ready to be bopped yourself.<P>&lt;His patented, parental, throwaway flame.&gt;<P><BR>Post 3:<P>"Sorry, but this isn't _your_ thread; it's a public discussion."<P>&lt;Yet another parental lecture.  The leading "sorry" is added for the sole purpose of being irritating.&gt;<P>"And I choose to take issue with your immature characterization of anyone who might disagree with you as a VAK."<P>&lt;A reasonable statement had he not insisted on including the word "immature".&gt;<P>Don't post your ideas in public if you can't handle disagreement. And don't preemptively insult people if you want a polite discussion.<P>&lt;Another parental lecture.  And the argument of a bully - if you don't want your nose punched, don't put it in front of my face.&gt;<P><BR>Post 4:<P>"So. . .you've discovered Truth, and it's all Verant's fault you don't enjoy the game anymore. . .and anyone who disagrees with you is a VAK spouting propaganda."<P>&lt;As I read the first post, a snide mischaracterization of what the original poster actually said.&gt;<P>"That about sum up your alleged insight?"<P>&lt;Yet another unnecessary and gratuitous insult.&gt;<P>"Had you wanted a flame-free post, you shouldn't have flamed from the start."<P>&lt;Yet another parental lecture.&gt;<P><BR>If you wonder why people on this board think you're a jerk, Bloodsage, please pay attention:<P>You insist on responding to posts without discussing in any way the content of the post itself.<P>You assert your own superiority by insulting everyone who disagrees with you.<P>You insist on lecturing people about how to behave.  A brilliant psychological play if your intent is to make them resent the way you're treating them like children, an utterly pointless way to make people pay attention to anything you say.<P>It took you until your FIFTH POST on this topic to say ANYTHING about the actual content of the first post.  And even THAT one was laced with insults.<P>You badly need help with anger management.  Developing a few interpersonal skills wouldn't hurt, either.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kenross,<P>Thank you for your valuable insights into my personality.  I'd act on them, but they're completely off base.<P>You, as so many others around here, _still_ fail to distinguish between argument, behavior, and person--which leads to most of your mistakes in identifying ad hominem arguments.<P>GQLLFM, for one, is neither mine, nor patented.  Its allegedly inflammatory nature is hardly sufficient grounds to excuse Drakezius' follow-up.  Had he been interested in conversation, he'd have 1) not put the preemptive insult in his orginal post, or 2) explained what he meant when someone took issue with it.  <P>He derailed his own thread, sorry.<P>You may read the original post in a different light than I do.  Others may, as well.  That would be a nice basis for discussion.  But if you're looking to indict ridiculously out-of-bounds behavior, I suggest you look to those who've actually derailed this thread into a discussion of me.  I, unlike Absor, do not get paid to put up with that kind of thing, and I choose not to.<P>I don't care if you don't like me.  I don't care who you are.  So, please, feel free to keep your opinions about me to yourself: had you the reasonnig skill you claim, you'd know you have no chance of guessing correctly in any of your characterizations of my motives or personality.<P>But thanks for participating.

Just because he's hiding behind an anonymous ID doesn't give him the right to continue to slam, insult, bash and argue with every presentation.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I just spent about 20 minutes reading through this thread. In my infinite wisdom, I have come to this conclusion: this thread is gay.<P>Everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) here has discussed nothing of any content or value. Talk about oral feces.<P>You know, that's the problem with message boards, everyone is all talk. We can flame each other all we want, but that really accomplishes nothing. <P>Also, I detest all the insults thrown back and forth from essentially invulnerable positions. Each one of you is free to talk $#!t without any consequences since you can safely lurk behind your computer screens while countless miles of cable and wire stream your insults at one another at a keystroke. Cowardice. Adults can discuss without insult. Maturity allows one to resist stooping to insults when being insulted. I'm not perfect either, I catch myself falling back into that grade school mentality sometimes too, but come on people...give at least a half-ass effort here.<P>People always talk big behind a stone wall. I guess that's why I always loved one-on-one contact sports like martial arts and boxing. There's nowhere for the opponent to hide and all cards are on the table. You win some, you lose some. <P>Get in the ring and spar if you want to pick fights people. Put some hair on your chests.

</FONT><HR>Bloodsage - Your tortuous attempts to distinguish between argument, behavior and person are nothing but self-rationalization.  Over half of the sentences you have typed in this thread (and you have typed quite a few) deliberately insult someone.  An ad hominem attack is one where you attack the person rather than the idea; the fact that you occasionally wrap both an idea and an insult into the same sentence does not nullify the ad hominem nature of the insulting piece.<P>Were you the master of English comprehension that you seem to believe you are, you would have realized that I did not say that "GQLLFM" was patented by you; I said that the insulting closing line was patented by you.  Check this thread.  Every post of yours ends in an insult or a condescending statement.<P>The way I read the original post, he was not saying that anyone who disagreed with him was, by definition, a VAK.  He was anticipating that VAKs would flame him.  And he was correct.  This would have been a reasonable thing to discuss (as it would have been reasonable to discuss the much more lengthy remainder of his original post), but you chose to either:  a) ignorantly or b) deliberately misinterpret it so you could satisfy some peculiar ego need of yours by flaming him and derailing this thread.<P>Your posts are arrogant, pedantic, supercilious, insulting and hypocritical.

You could at least be truly passionate, as Drazekius was, or show some slight imagination or creativity.  Shoot, even a little garden-variety eloquence would suffice to raise your drivel above pale mediocrity into something resembling flair.<P>Since when is your interpretation of Drazekius' message the only valid one?  If you'd bother to read the thread, you'd see that I'm not the only one who interprets it that way.  You'd also see that Drakezius confirms my interpretation in several places.<P>And why is it my fault Drakezius lacks the self-control to explain himself when challenged, rather than simply going off, as you have done?<P>For someone pretending intelligence, you certainly have a gift for committing each and every offense you're attempting to chastise others for.

</FONT><HR>hehe<P>Well, you can't argue one fact with bloodsage - he has plenty of time to read/post on these boards.<P>But anyways, I digress.  I actually stopped playing for 9 months.  It was quite wonderful.  Got married, had a daughter, changed jobs...quite a bit if ya think about it.  <P>Then, some old friends asked me to play with them again - begging actually.  I caved and now i'm stuck again.  Oh well - I guess that the closest thing to Everquest is some sort of addictive drug. <BR>Hard to quit but when you do you really are much more happy.<P>I try to play with moderation these days, and it works well.  You really can't enjoy the game to it's fullest unless you power play.  All the quests, items, raids, etc require enormus(spelling?) amounts of time which I just do not have.<P>Well, if you ever stop playing long enough to not care to come back you'll know exactly what i'm talking about.

But it is sad.<P>Play the game. Enjoy it. Quit when it's no longer fun.<P>What's so hard about any of that?<P>Why is it so many people are trying to strong-arm Verant into adopting their own personal vision of what EQ ought to be?  That's ridiculous.  Make suggestions, sure, but threatening and whining and pouting and posturing is absurd.  It's not your game.  Write your own if you want that kind of creative control.  <P>I only wish more of the quitters were serious, because then server populations might become reasonable again.<P>Hate to break it to you, but not everyone shares your particular philosophy about never debating anything and being rude to the company from which you want something, while expecting them to treat you like a spoiled princess in a bad mood.  Yeah, I know, it's tragic.  Seriously: quit your textual sobbing and move on with your life.  Accept that there are certain standards around here--different from those you hope to impose by sheer force of whining--and that you'd be best off adopting a more "when in Rome" philosophy.<P>I'm sure Sony will be crushed when they find out you've quit sending them $10/month because you didn't like someone on their message board.  That's laughable.  I can barely type for chuckling. . .and it's all your fault, you, you MEANIE!<P>One thing you can do, if you'd like to fit in a bit more, is simply change your nick and return with a different attitude.  Guaranteed no hard feelings that way.

</FONT><HR>I never post around here (a quick search will show this is my first in a long time) but I read it often.  The original post was a very well-thought out post, you're struggling with how you have recognized how much of your time this game did suck out of you, and your thoughts on where the game is and how kinda 'nice' it was not playing Everquest.<P>Enter 'Bloodsage'.  I can't name a thread I don't see this guy posting on, all hours of the day, every day.  The guy obviously doesn't work, and apparently either has a very sick connection to this game or maybe just wants Verant to hire him to be their PR guy.  Whatever his intentions are, it's fairly obvious, he has a problem.  He obviously isn't playing EQ much, since he posts here literally all day long.  An unemployeed, disillusioned, defender of a game that he really has nothing to do with.  Today's youth really has little to connect to.<P>This isn't a flame on Bloodsage, it is just a sad observation.  I'm quite frankly sick of seeing this kid come back with some unintelligent resposne every time someone hints their displeasure with EQ and/or Verant.<P>My advice to you Bloodsage:  Find something better in your life to gear such energy towards.  I'm sure you feel 'important' because of your posting frequency here and your name is plastered on many of the threads here, but really there is a lot more to do than play this game (which I'm really not even sure you do).<P>I unfortunately can't be on here daily (or even 5+ hours a day) so I can't get into these flame-a-thons with you (nor would I drop to that level), but really, get a clue.<P>Like I said, not a flame.

You may, sir, just hang your head and walk away. I don't. Nor do most others not skulk off and suffer the indignation. Indignation coming from another customer that doesn't like how we type, we speak, we spell, we use grammar, we present ourselves? What next? How we look? What we wear? What education level we have? What nationality we are? Where does one draw that line of discrimination, of trashing one for their performance?<P>We AREN'T here to be graded by customers. We are here to discuss issues with Verant.

We shouldn't have to accept snide come-backs because we are deemed not worthy in the great debating universe. <P>ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yelling until you're satisfied, indeed.<P>Where do you get the idea I'm a pushover as a customer?  I assure you, I'm the customer from Hell.  I'm a stickler for contracts, and I expect to receive exactly what I pay for, in the manner in which I've been led to expect.<P>Oddly, EQ is doing quite well, despite the legions of piteous whiners wanting a customized version of their very own.<P>And, if you'd read the thread carefully, you'd see as many people agreeing with my interpretation of the original post.  Along with a lot of drive-by Bloodsage bashers.  Which is fine, but blaming me for being bashed is just silly.<P>Finally, there's this:<P>&lt;&lt;We are here to discuss issues with Verant.&gt;&gt;<P>Wrong.  We are here to discuss things with each other, and perhaps a blue name will pop in once in a while, either to make an observation or to ask for input.  You seem unclear on the whole message board concept.  It's both frustrating and hilarious, in a Keystone Cops sort of way.<P>Your insistence that the rest of the world conform to your standards of conduct, rather than adapting your behavior to fit the situation is puzzling.  Didn't you mention, at one point, you're European?  Seems an odd attitude, if true: it's just so "ugly American."<P>Nevertheless, I wish you luck in your crusade to look out for everyone else's best interests.  We've all been waiting for someone with your vision, your fortitude, and your steadfast nature to help us rise from the chaos into civilization.

</FONT><HR>&gt; The behavior you suggest would get you<BR>&gt; physically removed, and probably arrested, from<BR>&gt; any place of business on the planet. Yelling <BR>&gt; until you're satisfied, indeed.<P>You assume so much. No where did I state that I would continually yell in the line-up. <P>I'd raise my voice if ignored. I'd probably do it a second time. I'd stop short of a YELL. I'd next demand to speak to a manager/owner. After that if nobody would give me the time of day, I'd move the issue out of the business into the world of businesses that take care of such issues. Be it a newspaper, a Better Business Bureau, A States Commercial Division, and in extreme cases, a court of law.  <P>There's many ways to shout/yell and be heard without going into a tirade as you suggest and get thrown out.<P>*I* think I have a solid issue. Maybe I'm out to lunch. I think that although I'm the only one that has taken the hard-line here, that many others by their posts on this and other threads, agree, enough is enough, stop with the belittling. Now it's up to Verant to decide if I'm a "worthy" customer, or if they'll just ignore a customer that has a complaint.  It's the same decision that every business needs to make. Maybe I am expendable. Maybe the next person is too, and the one after. I'm quite confident that before everyone is gone, someone won't be expendable. I'f I'm not worth their time to discuss this concern I have, they certainly aren't worth my money. Same decision that we as consumers make on a daily basis when we go to make a purchase. I tend not to frequent places that don't treat me with respect and don't give me the time of the day, when I'm a constant customer at an establishment. Most people are like that.<P>You don't know me. You don't know any of the people you continue to attack and belittle and steal away their threads. Same thing as we don't know you. You can say you are X, but honestly, we've all had experiences with fake personalities on the 'net, you could be anyone. We have no way of knowing, nor you of proving it.  <P>That's not to say you are lying, I'd say you are who you say you are. What it does though bring up is, why do you do it? Why do you feel the need to get that little dig in on everyone you disagree with? You don't know us, you never will, what's the motivation?  Please just stop doing it. That's all we are asking. I don't think it's too much to ask for.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Doh!  That arrow should point to The Vowelless One, above.<P>Straithlin,<P>What you are forgetting, in your apparent zeal to save us from ourselves, is that _your_ interpretation of what the rules ought to be around here doesn't matter.  Not even a little bit.<P>They've been explained to you.  I've done it.  Auric did it, but you whined there, too.  Yet you fail to adapt, and insist, ever more shrilly, that it's wrong not to cater to your ideas of how things ought to be.<P>Sheesh.<P>Really, do you think I'm some teenager who lives via videogames while being supported by his parents?  I'd say the evidence points to me being who I say I am, but then I'm rather biased.  But it would be an interesting quest for the more rabid Bloodsage-whiners to see if they can find anything inconsistent in my story.  I post quite a bit, so if I'm lying, it shouldn't be that hard to trip me up.<P>You don't get to dictate policy, here.  Verant does.  And has.  And some of us choose to accept it and operate within it, rather than whine about it because our feelings might get hurt when someone has the dastardly gall to disagree with us.  Accept it.  Work with it.<P>You almost had the key, but you fumbled it away in your clumsy attempt to call me a liar without coming right out with it: no one knows you, or can know you, here.  Who care's what anyone says to you?  Why are you so desperately attached to your ideas that you can't handle the possibility of disagreement?  Why do you put your RL self-esteem on the line for a video game?  Who cares?<P>Remember the Crack Suicide Squad of the People's Liberation Front in Monty Python's _Life of Brian_?  That's what your gesture increasingly looks like.  It's comical, at best.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; They've been explained to you. I've done it.<P>And that means What?! Nothing. I don't want your interpretations of the rules, because your explanation means nothing. Not a flame, fact. It's Verant's rules, they will give the interpretations. I'm NOT going to judge what to do or not do on these boards based on a customer telling me.<P>I want Verants. I've read what Auric said, now I'm questioning what he said and want clarification. I want to know why they think it's okay to get digs in on fellow customers.  You know, it's not against the law to oppose a decision that you feel is wrong, and it's especially not against any laws to question how a business treats you as a customer and how those customers interact.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
