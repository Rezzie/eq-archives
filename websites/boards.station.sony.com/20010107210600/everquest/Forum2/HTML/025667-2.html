</FONT><HR>I prefer to have people ask if they can inspect.  I've found that when I'm out adventuring, people might accidentally inspect and when it happens occasionally, its not an issue.  When I get into a town however, things change.  <P>9 times out of 10, the person inspecting me follows up with a beg for my extra armor or weapons or cash.  Its mainly for that reason that I like to be asked first.  I despise people who beg and expect me to give them anything because they are too lazy to go out and get it themselves.  Sure, I look good in my Ro armor, but it doesn't mean you should inspect me and then beg for my leftovers.<P>I also think someone above summed it up nicely.  If you see someone walking along, you can see what they are wearing without going into any detail.  Inspecting is tantamount to grabbing them and peering intently at their clothing/underwear and jewelry to see exactly what they are wearing.  Its rude, especially when you do so without permission.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Inspecting CAN be useful, but players should have the option of not allowing their characters to be inspected. Easiest way to accomplish this is with a consent box.<P>Most of the rude inspections would immediately stop if this were done simply because the inspectors would know that the answer will be a resounding NO!

Its a fascination, a hobby, and something people understandably get attached to and emotional about.

</FONT><HR>1) If every item you can wear or hold in the game had a 3D model and was visible on your character, AND had its own unique look, then inspection wouldn't be necessary in most cases.  You would be able to tell the difference between a SSOY and a SSOM just be looking.  But, because there's a limitation on graphics, the inspection feature is part of the game.<P>2) On a blue server, if the inspection message were taken away, you wouldn't know if you were being inspected or not.  Why?  Because it does not affect your gameplay.  Now, because there IS a little message displayed when someone inspects you, you get all bent out of shape about it?  Why?  It doesn't affect your game play.  How is doing something that completely does not affect your game play or does not interrupt you in any way considered rude?  Sitting down next to you does not affect your gameplay and does not interrupt you in any way either... is THAT rude?<P>3) Yes, being inspected multiple times and getting that message spammed all over your text screen is rude.  But since there is no need to inspect someone multiple times within a short span of time, I submit that it was a deliberate act to annoy you, and thus rude.<P>4) You can't stop me from inspecting you.  All you can do is run away.  But that will make me even more curious to see what you are hiding from me.  So I will wait until you are medding, in a fight, or AFK.  And if what you are hiding from me is THAT important to interrupt medding, a fight, or being AFK, then I will be even MORE curious as to what you are hiding from me... etc  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>5) As someone mentioned above, most of the time I inspect someone to see if they can use something I have.  So if you don't want free phat lewt, the best thing you can do is back away when I try to inspect you.  I'll go give the uber weapon to the newbie next to you who DOESN'T think he's too good for me to inspect.<P>6) I repeat, on a blue server, the only clue you are being inspected is the message.  You are overreacting to a silly message.  It does not mean he's got his hand down your pants.  It does not mean he's checking all of your clothing labels.  It means he is trying to determine what equipment you might have equipped, which he would have been able to do just from visual identification if EQ supported the graphics necessary in the first place.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It gives me an idea of things I might need or could buy.  <P>Those who become irritated when inspected are just whiney, spoiled brats.
