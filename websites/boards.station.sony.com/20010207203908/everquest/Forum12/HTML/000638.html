</FONT><HR>Why are wizards worth while?<P>I play a level 57 Magician on the Innoruuk server, and I'll tell you exactly why wizards are worth while... Lures. You know, that little nearly unresistable line of spells that wizards get at high levels? As a 57th Magician in Velious there's some *GREENS* that reliably resist my spells. Wizards are landing full dmg nukes on REDS. Wizards are the *only* class that can *reliably* land full dmg nukes on the big badass mobs with the nasty resists. No, not even necro stuff lands, as I've heard quite a bit of complaining about resists from my high level necro buddies... not to mention with Atol's Spectral Shackles, Wizards can reliably solo.<P>Morpherios Pendraggon<BR>Erudite Magician 57th Circle<BR>Guild Leader of Fortress of Honor - Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all.<P>First thing's first. I am a wizard of the 52nd circle on Lanys. I am fortunate to be in a big guild and get groups. I enjoy and often use AE tactics to get the job as a wizard done. Having said those things, I believe many people who talk up wizards miss the point. Sure wizards get some bombs, but can they get in groups as easily as other classes? Sure reputation and skill play a large role in getting a group, but people are discounting the difficulty that wizards have finding groups. To those that believe that nothing is wrong with the class be honest. When you are setting up a group is the wizard class a must have? Is the wizard a very good have? Or is the wizard just better than nothing? It's not about evacs, or the occasional bombs. It's about the ability of wizards to interact with their peers in meaningful ways. Sadly, VI's limited imagination is crushing the wizard class. Please no posts from people that don't play wizards and just think we are fine. Play one. Play a wizard from 1 to 50+ and just see how often you get groups relative to other classes. Please don't speculate on the damage a wizard can do vis-a-vis other classes. We know how much damage we do and it's a useless fraction of the hitpoints that mobs have now. I'm not saying no comments unless your a wizard. But unless you have played one, don't lecture other wizards about damage. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agreed with u all and I agreed more as Eltain mentioned, i am lv 30 wiz, int 147, do u know what I feel on my low level wiz? it's little sxxk. why? Wiz is cast based char I believed, so, if the Mobs(blue) resisted your spell often, what the Wiz supposed to do anyway. I have no idea why they resist the spell sometimes, is it supposed to be no resist while fighting a CON blue mob that what i want to say, i feel very bad cos I felt I can't help my group mate to bomb down the mob and save their damage time. MOB RESIST MY FIRE BASE SPELL sometimes, if u are saying that many mobs is highly resist the FIRE BASE SPELL, then why those spell still EXIST anyway.<P>I am totally feel WIZ IS SXXK anyhow. May I ask a question, WHAT THE HxLL WIZ gonna do if the mob resisted the spell or do partial damage, how wiz can be survive in a group with this sxxk resist? (I am only talking about the CON blue mob)<P>Thank you!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pure opinion:<P>I agree that wizards need a few more perks.  I believe that the wizard was intended to be the absolute KING of damage.  I mean, unmatchable in a damage/second contest.  They pay the price for it, with the low AC, low HP, difficult quests for near necessary items and all that.  Yet, a magician and his pet is often a more enticing addition to a group than a wizard.<P>I play an enchanter myself, and though I used to hear that at higher levels the wizards were the only ones that did any real damage, it does not seem that way.  I've made it to level 46, and more often than not, it was in groups with tanks and a healer, or tanks, shammy and healer.  I never noticed any real advantage to trading one of the tanks for a wizard.  Though this may be, in part, due to the fact that we'd wound up with some pretty poor wizards, who could only succeed in getting everything agroed on them, or breaking mezzes.<P>However, I don't advocate lifting a good spell or trait from another class, and grafting it onto the wizard.  If the wizard is helped, I think it should be with something innovative and creative.  Something fancier than I can think up at 5 AM on a Monday morning.<P>Hey, does anyone else who's read this thread completely through think we're dealing with individuals that hit all over the IQ table, from top to bottom??  Or is it just me???  Where do I hit?  Middle?  Bottom??  <P>Charmed, I'm sure</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a 16 Wizard on the Karana. I agree we need some perks. Once we get to lvl 51 and higher we kick ass. Like someone said before our spells are hard to resist. The only problem with us is... LVLS 1 - 50! Its impossible to lvl. I've been on lvl 16 for 1 month(i have been working on my pally though). We are middle range when it comes to class greatness. For instance I dueled one of my friends. He was a lvl 16 Ranger. Were both pretty twinked. All I had to do was root him down then start blasting. I took him down to 10hp. I was lagging so I didnt see his life bar going down so I blasted again and he died. He got really pissed off but at least I got the little thing that says "Darba has emerged victorious in a duel to the death." Lol. Anyway we have some really good things that others dont. Like our teleporting. Some say druids are better but thats not true. Some druid circles have guards around it. Wizard teleports are a pyramid with nothing around. Yeah ok thats a long enough post. Hehe.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here it is folks the summary of what is wrong and right with wizards:<P>Taking this used as a wizard of 50th lvl with 200 int and all apliciable spells:<P>This wizard has 2100 mana on the nose, now that means that in 41 seconds he can dish out 5575 damage, if he gets no resists.  But he will get resists because it is impossible to not get resisted at least partially on one or more of these casts, which is fine.  Now he is down for 9 minutes or more regaining mana (yes i know if he chain cast that hed be down waitng for rez not medding) so lets say this whole process takes 10 mins to cycle.<P>Now to make it sound less impressive, take that over the course of an hour, with no resists and not getting killed.  He will dish out roughly, 35,000 damage per hour with no resists and not getting killed.  That is not impressive take a warrior at 50 duel wielding Yaks, (again no warrior at 50 duel wields yaks but...), he will do roughly 800 damage per minute which works out to 48,000 damage per hour.  Ok now look at the variables the warrior will have STR buffs speed buffs which will add another 30-50% damage on to that.  What does the wizard get?  Clarity if hes lucky and Harvest every 10 mins.  Now the warrior has done roughly 70,000 damage and the wizard, well well say clarity shaves a minute of each barage, 50,000 damage.<P>You see this is what i think, a warrior has a million buffs to enhance his method of dealing damage, where a wizard only has his spells mana pool clarity and harvest (mana song if you happen to have a bard, but, in any fight like this he is too busy singing Resist songs).  The best solution i have heard for this?<P>Give us a contingency spell, allow us to cast the contingency, make a new box like our buff box appear, and let every spell cast after that go into the box, or until we hit a close button.  then when in a fight if we cast contingency, allow us to click on one of the pre cast spells and it will go off with no mana exertion.  This will not so much enhance a fight with a boss from velious but would give us an edge to be used in pre-velious enviroment.<P>Now as for Velious Mob Bosses, make harvest2 let it be cast more frequently, and have it give a small mana increase say 450 mana max.  <P>Regarding the previous suggestion im pulling this out just cause the idea was really cool.  Since EQ is such a group based game give us a group based harvest.  Allow it to be cast every 5 mins, and give us 150-200 mana per group member.  Even with a full group this will only return 1000 mana max which for myself at lvl 50 this will be less then half my mana pool, more like 2 bubbles.  <P>Also i have heard of % based damage spells by mobs HP, although not very feesible, this would be amaing at putting us back into use on velious.<P><BR>Just some suggetions, Please tell me what you think,<P>Laer<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Due to how taunt works wizards cant do any more damage per second than any class.  In fact we end up doing less.  If we do significantly more damage than the main tank we get aggroed and commonly killed.  Unlike magicians with an earth pet keeping the mob off them so they can chain cast (not always reliable but better than our root) they end up outdamaging... naturally the main tanks outdamage us or we would be stomped.  Yeah yeah, they click the taunt button but our nukes still get us stomped and we certainly cant chaincast. Now, maybe if our nukes were ultra low taunt we would then be able to outdamage everyone in the group.  Low taunt nukes CERTAINLY would not be a pvp issue but would help us out a lot in grouping.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm a lvl36 wizard myself,been soloing from lvl1 to lvl26, died lots of times due to root does not stick the mobs/lack of mana to blast due to lots of damage blast is being resisted by the mobs(all blue mobs).  I also have been in groups when I'm lvl27 to lvl31, I find that the damage that when we blast on &lt;(blue mobs)-mostly full damage but (yellow/red mobs)-full damage rare(yellow),little damage done or being resisted totally(red most)&gt; blue/yellow/red mobs which have been down to half of the hps.  But I died LESS when in groups though :P Heard that when we wizard reached lvl35, our damage blast is not being resisted so commonly on yellow or red mobs, but I never get to experience though.<P>Let's see, some of you said that we need pets?<BR>Why do you think so?:-<P>Necro- They can buff a little haste on their pet & darkness,fear,dots the mobs but if the Necro don't fear, pet can't hold the mobs long too.<P>Mage- They can summon haste items to give their Earth pet(used mostly when Soloing as they have lots of hps) to increase the haste effect, damage shield the pet then send their pet & maybe start blasting(less damage compared to Wizard so won't aggro the mobs much) if they feel like it?cause their earth pet can root so when those stupid mobs hiting on the pet, their hps is also start dropping due to the damage shield that their master have given to them.<P>Enchanter- They can buff their useless pet into a formiable pet as giving them all sorts of buffs too. Most importantly, they can always mez if something goes wrong  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Wizard?- For example, wizard get to have a pet so what kind of pet do you want? <BR>Necro's pet? Wiz can't fear  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> <BR>Mage's pet? Wiz don't have damage shield to buff <BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Enchanter's pet? Please!!! They are useless if not for their master super buffs & I don't think Wiz will ever get those  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Cause pets can tank for us? Pets can delay some time for us to gate? If so, why not request for a long time endurance root to root those mobs? & we wizard get to have Aoe snare too at around lvl29.<BR>& now Wizard can snare & root & blast.<P>So I think that wizard needs most is a long time endurance root & a less resistant/high damage dd which is more suitable for us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Lastly, I know that my message is kind of talkative hehe but it is all what I'm thinking about  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> & all of the above examples is my opinon only.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess I qualify to post here,, I do play a wizzy. A level 22 wizzy, he's my secound attemp at creating 1, gave up on the first at lvl 14 and started over.<BR>That said, I do agree with most of the posts by actual wizzy players and belive that some changes would be nice. The taunt issue is IMO probably the best place to start, It doesn't do any good for to have a spell at lvl 22 that 175 dmg if I get beat to death the first time I cast it (including if it is resisted and often is), The same applies to AoE spells, the main mob might stay on the tank but the other proceed directly to the wizzy.<BR>On the quest being difficult, I dont mind difficult, but most are impossible at the lvl intended without you take a group of much higher lvl peeps. I might add here that we are not the only class that suffers this dilema. It would be nice if VI would make the quests a little more possible.<BR>Perks? fix the taunt issue and we wont need any perks. 1 or 2 would be nice though. Like maybe Invis-vs-undead? With only classes getting it, most of us end having to pay a shaman well for potions.<P>Just my opinions... <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, it's not power we lack, it's really stamina. Power (i.e. Force/Time Interval) we got. The problem is the game is set on a longer time scale which requires long camps, and a wizard is like a sprinter. All his juice goes in just a few seconds. Some people want more mana to make us last a little longer, some people want the nukes to get bigger so we last a little longer, but it all adds up to the same thing.<P>We're also basically defenseless, which is where some guys start asking for things like pets. Frankly, I'd just rather have improved roots that didn't just stick the mob in place. Things like Paralyzation or Turn to Stone, Time Stop, whatever (i.e. no casting, no movement, no nothing). It just seems like a more appropriate defense than adding DOTs or pets or other stuff that really belongs to other people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Example of how wizards are underpowered.  I am 43rd level wizard on Drinal.  I went into Kurn's tower to help a friend get his corpse.  A mage, necro, enchanter, bard, rogue, warrior, shadow knight, monk, paladin, ranger, cleric, shaman, or druid would at 43rd level be able to drag a corpse out.  If they get jumped they can melee even the druid can melee a low end skeleton.  Well as a wizard I had to use a bar of mana per mob to kill.  Not knowing my way out I had to gate and felt like a coward.  Any other class in the game would have gotten that corpse out but I couldn't.  I feel like deleting my wizard.  <BR>This is just one example.  They go on and on.  Something must be done to make the wizard a better class.  So far the best idea I have heard is time stop, paralize, or something along those lines.  If your going to pay the ultimate price shouldn't you get the ultimate prize?  That is what I was lead to believe when I made the wizard and now I find there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  <P>You want the truth Verant? You can't handle the truth.  Make the wizard better for god sake!<P>P.S.  A mage of 43rd could clear kurn's without casting a spell but a wizard has to spend a bubble of mana to kill one mob.  How is that fair again?  You tell me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When I started playing EverQuest my 1st character was a wizard.  I descided to play a wizard because they were supposed to be the dammage kings.  My Wizard is now 30th level.  I use him for a taxi for my guild, and a package deliver boy.<P>Wizards need work.<P>   I have since created a shaman, a monk, a necro, an enchanter, and a warrior.  All of these classes are WAY more fun to play than my starting wizard.  Also, having played other classes I can now understand why NOBODY WANTS A WIZARD IN THEIR GROUP.  "They are a one trick pony."  Every other class in the game has multiple tasks that they can perform during a battle.  Wizards can only med, and Nuke.<P>   There is also the problem with the level cap on resists.  If you are in a good group that is fighting reds then a wizard is completely useless.  They are the only class that is now totaly and utterly useless, except maybe to evac if there is a problem. Most groups would rather have a druid.  They can heal, evac, and fight if needed.  Try to fight with a staff of the wheel in you hand... <P>   I know this is just *****ing, but I really would love to play my Wizard again, but he just sucks, is not fun to play, and can not get in a group.<P>My 2 cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think I have a good handle on this, as I play both an enchanter (40th) and a wizard (20th).  I'm sure you all know that an enchanter outside of Velious never yells LFG more than once.  So far, my wizard has been in groups three times; each time was with guildies.  Plenty has been said about why wizards have trouble getting in groups; I feel no need to add more of the same.  <P>Frankly, I created my wizard to primarily solo with, and to eventually level him into a guild planar taxi.  (Not likely he'll ever be used as such, as they'd rather have my chanter along.)  Still, the Wizard can be a fun class to play so long as you don't expect to group, or have constant fighting - just count on the infrequent battles, then plenty of time to fold socks.<P>SoulFrost DeDanaan<BR>40th Enchanter <BR>Order of the Jade Dragon<P>Rhian B'Zorch<BR>20th Wizard<BR>Order of the Jade Dragon<P>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<P>     I play a 40 Wizard on E'ci.  I agree that Wizards could use a bit of tweaking in terms of reducing down time.  (I also play a Necro and a Mage - neither of which has nearly the same down time as my Wizard.)  I also agree that Wizards have more difficulty getting groups than, say, Enchanters or Clerics.  However, for the most part, I am satisfied with my Wizard character.  If you know what you're doing, soloing (especially at higher levels) is easy.  (It amazes me how few Wizards use their Yonder line of spells.  A crucial escape spell for soloing.)  In groups, the primary job of the Wizard is *not* to deal out massive amounts of damage quickly.  If you play your Wizard that way, it's no wonder you can't get a group.  The Cleric is always healing you, instead of keeping the tanks healthy!<BR>The job of the Wizard is to (a) slow the mob down with Root/Snare spells and STUNS, (b) help drop the mob quickly from Berzerk health (about 50%) to fleeing health (about 20%), and (c) in DIRE emergency, chain cast to taunt a mob off a nearly dead party member (like the Cleric &lt;G&gt; ) and use Root/Stun or Yonder (if outdoors) to escape the thing after pulling it off someone.  Keep a damage absorbing shield (Shieldskin, Leatherskin, etc...) on to help you survive if you have to do (c), or if you just get jumpy with the nukes.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>     However, I do have suggestion for improving the desireability of Wizards in group situations. One thing would be better Evac-type skills.  For example:<P>(1) Have more Evac or port locations, closer to dungeons.  Evac is pretty much useless in Velious - it takes forever to get back to where you were before.<P>(2) Have a group type Translocate spell, so you can port the entire group to your bind point (say, right outside the dungeon that you're crawling through).<P>(3) Have a form of mob teleportation.  Ie have a way of porting a monster AWAY from the group; a kind of reverse Yonder.  Would be VERY useful for over-pulls, over aggroed mobs about to kill someone, etc...  Basically useful in situations where a Mez would be used, but not *quite* as useful as a Mez.  Wizards are masters of Teleportation, so this kind of mob control for Wizards would make sense.  It also would be quite a bit less useful for soloing than a true Mez; would only help with over-pulls.<P>     As for down-time, solo down-time is expected.  Verant has said that you should suffer long down times if you choose to solo.  Down time in groups isn't nearly as bad, *IF* you know how to play the class.  Harvest was a boon to the class, in spite of everyone's complaints about it.  However, having some way of increasing mana regen, or storing mana for later use, would be a good idea to explore.  Just not sure how to do it in a way that isn't over the top...<P>     &lt;Relinquishes the soap box&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>wizards can solo in outdoors areas only.snaring and kiting similar to druids.our root line of spells are useless except to root and run.at 52 i am forced to solo low blues or high greens for experience now.velious is totally out of the question due to the fact verant decided those mobs should have more hp's for their level.if you find a wizard there he was dragged by friends in a group or he's farming greens.i feel we need our spell's mana usage reduced or a major increase in our mana pool.as far as our use as evacers,they take way too long to cast and ussually the mobs are all over you by then.i think they could reduce the time by half to make them effective.our lure line of spells are nice but use too much mana to be able to solo with them.our ae spells don't become useful til 55 and have to have a good chanter then to use it.we do get a pet though at 59.hehe but it dies before it can do any real damage.considering the mana and component it takes to cast it,i doubt you will see one used unless for show.well those are my opinions.we need improvement or norath will not see many wizards online.try doing a who all when you organizing a raid on naggy.the list is pitiful.the only true thing wizard's have is plane of hate and air port spells.once a guild gets a wizard that high then then park him on shelf.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Not to mention that same ice commet can still hit me for full damage with 150 cold resist is that suckage or what hell no. As a chanter if someone has 150mr what can i land on him nada nada not jack squat so stop whining about your class sucking and learn how to play it and btw the wiz who was *****ing about not being able to solo high blues guess what noone else can hahahaha. At least you guys have close to 3 dmg per one mana ratio try playing a class where u dont even have 2 dmg per mana ratio now tell me your nukes suck i think not. So stop whining as i said earlier and suck it up and learn to play the game every class has its strengths and weaknesses learn from them and see wich ones are best for you..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have read many of these Wizard posts and I agree with most of them - we are a drastically underpowered class with the changes made to the game in the RoK and SoV add-ons. We also do not live up to our Verant definition for all to read right here on everquest.com.<BR>All that aside, this post is for everyone that has a Wizard they no longer play due to group uselessness and/or frustration. Go get our quest spell called Concussion - the Brian Bite Scroll. Yes, this quest will require much help to complete and is a bit frustrating itself but it will drastically change the way you contribute to a group. How? Concussion has the exact opposite affect that the Taunt button does for tanks. This has allowed me to USE the BIG dd spells without even getting touched by the mob, regardless of it's health.<BR>Sure, Wizard's need a lot of work. But in the meantime use what we have at current and get as skilled with it as you can if being a Wizard is what you really want. That way when we are balanced out with all the rest you will automaticaly be of high skill.<P>Faelin<BR>51 Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IMHO.. <P>The Wiz class could be easily fixed by VI, without nerfiong other classes, without giving us abilities of other casters, without pets (which, I, as a wizard don't want anyway), and without a major reconstruction of the character....<P>1. Decrease the Mana Used by Most AoE and DD spells. This way we do not need breeze, or anything like that. The Wizard is a 'master' of magic, it seems sensible that he could cast more often, and more effieciently than the other caster classes. <P>2. Allow us to have two more spells in our quick casting slots, this will enable us to have a couple more spells at our disposal than the other classes. Again, Wizards are 'masters' of magic. They should also be permitted to have a a benefit that no other class has in the area of magic casting. That would be an easy such way to do this. <P>3. Increase the damage absorbtion of the 'Shieldskin' class of spells or add a few Wizard only items in game to increase our AC above that of the other casters (Non-Armored casters, anyway). Such as a Ring that is AC only. This way a ring such as a +INT would have to be given up to use this additional AC. <P>I don't think this would be too hard to add to the game. The extra spell slots could be added in Full Screen only, like the additional buttons where on the main windows and the socials. <P>That would be great.. <P>Wondering how many Wizzies agree.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, Wiz may be great on PvP servers. But against NPCs with far over 10k Hp we go under against a pet class or a tank, and yes enc have no pet, they dont need to do any damage to the mob, all they have to is having controll over the mobs. But Wizards have only one think to do: "Do damage to mobs". But at fights that last about 1 min per mob, becauce they have so many HPs the less damage a wiz can do is a laught. And if a wiz is nukeing it he will have a long (even with clarity) downtime that makes the nuking even worth.<BR>I played my Wiz up to 53 now, and I LIKE HIM. But now in velius and even in Kunak the damage i do is nothing compared with a tank.<P>All other char i have played is a Warrior to 30, but a friend has many high level char and i can compare my wiz with his char. And i dont know why groups still invite Wiz to a group. They are THE weakest class of all. I dont see any other class that could be more useless.<BR>There is only one think wiz have that no one else has. Plain TP.<BR>And no wiz want to go on Hate for drops. Some wiz on my server go real nice offers for a port up, becauce no wiz want up on hate, nor stay there after the port up.<P>Aridian, level 53 wiz from 7th hammer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>sorry for the yelling and caps lock on my start off post for this subject. anyway just wanna say in case anyone wants to know as the starter of this subject i play a wizard on pvp server vallon zek named arlaman and well in simple terms lvls 1-51 is hard as hell and of course all us wizards know that.i agree with the mana regeneration and less mana towards spells to decrease our downtime but would it be so much to ask for a pet of some kind i don't think so we are wizards for gods sake we should be able to summon something jeesh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are highly desired group members. They have excellent damage dealing spells, teleport spells, and some crowd control spells. They are also the key to the Planes, which is the destination all players eventually want to go- and cannot get to without a Wizard. If you don't like playing a Wizard vote with your feet, and quit playing one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a magician of some standing I can say wizzies do NOT SUCK!!!!<BR>my spells get high reissts unless i cast malsoi AT POINT BLANK RANGE in the mobs frikkin FACE! Then I can land stuff and even then I get resists<BR>(talking about blue stuff here at 52)<BR>Wizzies get a range of spells, mages only get fire and magic: guess what, many mobs are resistant to fire/and/or magic! As for Uber mobs...hehe, all I can do is chain cast pets and DS, I couldn't nuke em if I put me hand up their backside and cast Char :&gt; Oh I finally got to nuke Vox 5 times cause there was such an amount of tanks on her casters could go to town, that was nice  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I only managed to drop 175 hp on her the time before, and my pets get feared off a hell of a lot. Do wizzies suffer that?<P>Ever tried soloing Skyfire? Sheesh I JUST managed to kill a wurm with pet and my mana at a sliver. When I got aggroed while crossing DL my wizzy pal just snared the mob and off we went, mages don't even get a SNARE OR ROOT and your complaining?!<BR>Wizzies rock, however I think they need a 20% DECREASE in mana costs so they can DO more  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Hide behind pets, em, YES!! DOn't have uber nukes, snare, root or cool TPs. And od't YOU hide behind tanks? Get used to this, mages EXCEL dealing with greenies in dungeons, I've often had wizzies admiring the fact I can stroll through SOlA without going OOM cause Jibober smacks butt, but oh boy in places with bad pathing...*shudders*<BR>Eachclass has value. Yes Wizzies are weakened against Velious uber mobs.. WHO ISN'T?? Velious SUCK SUCKS SUCKS cause of the hyper inflation of mobs. If it wasn't for that I'd love it, Tower of Frozen Shadows is simply wonderful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a wizard and I am of the 54th season, <P>I can stress the importance of what a wizard has to offer. Yes from level 0 to level 49 appeared to be our best levels. With the introduction of Ice Comet this basically made us a wanted addition to any group to help take down the high level mob. <P>As for our new line of lore spells, well all I can say is they are not what you think they are. We get resists out the wahzoo with these. I have spent numerous hours medding to just regain what I lost on a resist. Something needs to be done with our spells. We are not usfull in groups, we spend the majority of our time medding, medding and more medding. <P>our AE spells can not be used in any type of dungeion when your in a complete group with an enchanter. This spell wakes them all up and causes the group to instantly get killed. I dont see the point at all in having area effect spells.<P>And for the comment on Ateols Specktral shackles, yes this is a good spell and yes we can quad kite mobs. But this is only usefull from levels 50 to 53 maximum. At level 54 and upwards I would like to see any wizard quad kite or even kite one mob with the low mana pool that we posses. We not longer can solo and groups are a must. <P>Verent seems to think that group exp. is as good as soloing if not better. Well that is hogwash. I have soloed all my life as a wizard up until level 53. They have made it almost impossible to get exp at any level above this without a group. <P>For the past month I have been getting groups in all dungeons and let me tell you this. We stink, we stink, we stink. Our stun spells no longer work, our lore spells get resisted, and our man pool is not there any more for us.<P>When I can watch a druid of the same level kite mobs in skyfire and I have a hard time getting one down i find this unbelievable.<P>Call it balance? I call it an injustice.<P>Verant Fix us or get rid of us.<P>Give us more damaging spells with lesser mana use, and fix our stun spells so they work, and drop the AE spells they are totally useless. <P>Also to note, fix the darn Brain Bite spell it is 100% resist in velous.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
