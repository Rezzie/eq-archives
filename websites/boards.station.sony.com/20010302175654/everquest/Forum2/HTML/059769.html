</FONT><HR>I am absolutely stunned.  I had to re-read the patch message four times for it to sink in.<P>Absor do you guys have ANY concept of what you have just done?<P>"Druids, Shaman, and Clerics: <P>--- Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids. <BR>--- Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles)<BR>--- New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for clerics.<BR>--- New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch.<BR>--- Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and Torpor. This will allow them to stack with all other spells, save<BR>spells of the same type (Heal over time). Prior to this, all heal-over-time spells followed the same rules as regeneration spells.<BR>--- Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy.<BR>--- Lowered recast time on Wake of Karana"<P>I have no idea why you included the word cleric in the title.  This was all about druids and shamen.  I guess I should thank you guys for fixing the relatively minor stacking issues with the celestial line.  Remedy used to have about a 2% or so fizzle rate for me at 55, is it now only going to fizzle 1% of the time?  I don't suppose you considered looking into Divine Light which was the problem (around a 35% fizzle rate) and is not a 56+ spell so won't be affected by the other changes.  The only thing I can fathom is that the difficulty was lowered to match chloroblast so the  druids won't have a fizzle problem when they get it.<P>So basically what you have done is returned to what you referred to as the healing 'balance' where druids and shamen got the same capabilities as clerics, just a few levels later while leaving the only better healing capability clerics have that is better shackled to a 35% fizzle rate.<P>Complete Heal you say?  First of all it was never the 'defining' spell of the cleric class as many here seem to think (it was actually Remedy if anything though the changes to debuff aggro may have made it less so, amazing how things affect each other in unpredictable ways).  It is an efficiency tool, nothing more.  Any other cleric tools can be used to keep someone alive, just not as mana efficiently.  But wait there's more:<P>"Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed."<P>Roughly translated "While we had the clerics on the ground with our boot to their necks we thought we'd grind it in a bit and nerf complete heal as well"  Heck you even made it harder to taunt the mob off us in the process.<P>And the final kick in the pants you give the single most numerous class in the game yet another heal at 60 (I assume the rough equivelent of Divine Light).  Guess what?  That one IS a post 56 spell meaning it WILL gain the advantages of a reduced fizzle rate unlike Divine Light!  Heehee, its almost comical.<P>You have reduced the cleric class to nothing more than rez mules.  Their is simply no longer any reason to have one around otherwise.  You failed to take into account the sheer number of druids in the game (other than giving into their incessant whining).  You completely ignored the increased utility of these other classes bring to a group and therefore their desirability over clerics.  You never understood the concept that there is a minimum amount of healing capability required in most groups and given away that capability, much more than that capability I might add, to the most numerous class played in the game.<P>I tried VERY hard on these boards to ask you to please take this in steps to insure you got it right.  Instead you jumped in with +9 Nerf hammer and completely destroyed a class.<P><BR>Ezrick Blackpriest<BR>level 55 rez mule<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quit overreacting. When the biggest, most successful guilds in EQ aren't 80% warriors and clerics, then you can come back here and whine about your class.<P>Thing is, you don't have to be A LOT better than the next class in your specialty to be useful and necessary. You just have to be compellingly better.<P>Take defensive tanks vs warriors for example. There's not a big difference now, but that one word: Defensive. That makes all the difference.<P>Complete Healing, Celestial Elixer remain two of the most amazing and cleric-only heals in the game.<P>Try not to be such a Chicken Little.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Get over this clerics.  This was a much needed change.  Gheal is a JOKE at 35 and up and you know it.  It seems you would be happy if ONLY you could heal at all.  Check it out guys, we are priest class too.  Sheesh, as it was before if you are a druid you are needed for one thing only at higher levels, evac, since wiz actually have better porting that the druid who was SUPPOSED to be the "masters of travel" most of the time we have a hard time getting in groups.

</FONT><HR>I will always agree that a parent class should be best at what they do.  However, when you look at these changes in addition to the aggro/hate list changes you will see that an increase to Druid/Shaman healing capability is necessary and most likely you'll be working closer with clerics so that everyone stays alive.  They gain these spells at later levels as Clerics, therefore if you only look at level 60 then yes, it seems odd.  But until they reach the capability of having these spells clerics will *still* be tops.  And I'd hardly call it a "few levels later"... post level 56 is no cake walk to level 60.<P>You're worried about being attacked?  At your level you're hardly the only healer on a raid.  Besides, I'm SO tired of clerics complaining of boredom, this should shake things up a bit.  I don't recall reading anywhere where it says mobs are harder to taunt off a caster.  I read the patch message over and over, I just don't see it.  Please point it out, since I play a caster I'm interested in knowing this.  But the point is that there is now a cap to the amount of hate we will generate with our spells... I see that as a good thing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi ezrick<BR>Yep I know ya its hanabal hehe dont let the name fool ya.Hehe i agree with ya 100%. And to all ya ppl saying stay wait and see future patches bring stop being such VAKS. Sorry if that sounds rude. But to be honest i dont care anymore you can go stick your head in the sand and say you dont see how these changes will effect clerics but most clerics dont have that option.LOl to be honest from more than a month ago when the threads about healing started poping up on these boards I could see this coming.Maybe one thing will come out of this it may be the straw that broke the back of most of the clerics out there and if so a super drop in the class my prompt  Big V to look at the class I doubt it but it may happen.And to warriors I feel your pain.They say its a class game but to be honest with everyone getting closer to the center of the road i cant really see that comment as true more than not it should be called a skill  game like UO or AC instead it fits the game better now with these changes.

Why heal you, then die and spend 2 hours doing corpse recovery when I can sit back, let the dr00d heal and 56 rez you for free?<P>That's the new dynamic.  They've just made the cleric class even more boring.  Before we would med med med heal med med heal med med rez (which was fine with me).. now we just sit back and chain click-stick-rez...  No need to even med anymore to do our part!  Woo hoo!  They have nerfed clerics in order to make other classes more valuable.  I would rather have CH completely removed from the game than this nerf...<BR>A cleric will no longer be measured by his ability to keep his group alive anymore.  A cleric will now be measured by his ability to keep HIMSELF alive so that he can rez everybody.<BR>Are we still the best healers?  YES, but better healing = better dying now, so why risk it, unless you LIKE doing corpse recovery...<P>Everybody needs to start a rogue alt now, simply because the average time spent on corpse recovery is going to skyrocket...<P>I can tell you one thing... I'm going to be using Root / Atone a heck of a lot more now... and while I'm busy doing that and wasting my mana, the other mob will have obliterated my tanks.<P>Did verant change game dynamics?  Yes, and not just for the cleric class.. for ALL classes.  They made it CONSIDERABLY more difficult with a lot more downtime...  <P>AND LOOK AT VELIOUS!!!  Before it was all hack-n-slash and heal, since mob MR is thru the roof...  Now VI has made even the healing portion more difficult!  Are you planning to nerf classes until Velious becomes immpossible and then work from there?!?!  Look at this velious scenario...<BR>A group is in one of the uber velious dungeons and the tank pulls 3 mobs... chanter can't mez.. so what happens?  Everybody assists the main tank, so the other 2 mob's hate list are virtually empty.  The mobs beat down your main tank so fast you have to cast a bunch of short heals successively... on the first heal... cleric is dead.  Why?  Because chanter can't mez, and you aren't going to live long enough for the other tanks in your group to come taunt 2 mobs off of you.  You're puller is dead for sure because he's going to have the original mob on him while you're getting beat on by the other 2.<P>And for those of you who are saying, "QUIT WHINING".... let's just see if you're saying that when you end up doing corpse retrieval for 6 hours on your next 10 hour raid because your clerics were the very first to die.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Speaking as a cleric of the 47th season, I respectfully offer that I'm not sure you guys quite get it.<P>Druids and Shaman healing, I have no problem whatsoever with this.. its about time, maybe with a more efficient backup healer I can do more than sit on my backside while the group gets the fun of battle.<P>What has me, and many other clerics scared, and should have druids and shaman concerned also, is the increased aggro our heals will cause.   I cast C-heal and restore 2K hp, the mob suddenly feels like I did 2K of damage to him.  Ok, fine and dandy.. but in addition to adding this little gem, warriors and meleers now have to work harder to taunt the beast off me?  D-aura and D-barrier only last so long and if the tanks can't pull it off me, I'm dead, they're dead and the mob has a 6 course dinner..<P>Thats what has me concerned.. <P>For now, I'm adopting a "Wait and see" attitude, which is something I recommend the rest of us do as well..  But I won't lie to anyone and say I'm not going to be casting my Complete Heal without carefully typing /LOC so I can find my corpse the first time..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The lvl 60 druid heal spell was given to druids because despight all their abilities they had nothing to do on raids against high resist mobs (seams like most of them are now-a-days). Now when druids are on a raid and their dds won't stick, their buffs are passed over for cleric ones, their ds for mag ones, their dots uneffective the druid can now be usefull by keeping casters alive with heals. This won't effect the exp group area very much since most druids won't reach 60 and therefore wont get the spell AND lvl 60 druids don't spend alot of time in exp groups.<P>Clerics will still be desired over a druid for primary heal spot and thats a fact! the 2.47 hps/mana efficiency druids now have just can't compare to the 10+ efficiency clerics can yeild.<P>Mysthyl<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/hail<P>Doesn't bug me that druids and Shamans get the heals at a lower level. What does bug me is that tanks taunts are not going to get me off that tank. As an example if I start casting CH when the tank is between 2 1/2 - 2 bubs of health left then I'm going to heal about 2600 hitpoints. Assuming the tank has between 3K and 3400 hitpoints. Now that's put at the top of the list on the hate list. Will take a bit for any one caster or tank to get to the top of the list again. This can be taken care of with a chanter in the group and casting memblur or if a cleric in the other group atones. If either one of those two are not in the group guess what. No CH for anyone. Lots of remedy and using reso as a heal. Thanks alot VI really appreciate.

Post 50 is is generally a single group dungeon camp.  90% of your time is spent in these type groups grinding out the huge volume of xp required for each level.<P>There is a finite amount of healing required for these groups.  You don't bring a second cleric along, you don't need him.  One is more than the minimum amount of healing you need under most circumstances.  What Verant has done is give the most numerous class in the game the capability of meeting that finite healing capability in most groups while still retaining all the other capabilities that make that class desireable.<P>Assuming you were comfortable that a druid or shaman is capable of keeping your party healed, meaning no one is going to die, in your routine hunting group why would you have a cleric instead?  With a druid you get dots, sow, evac, dd etc thrown into the deal.<P>Clerics are not dead.  No one is heading to a dragon raid without them.  You won't find a druid as a primary healer on a Chardok Royal raid.  Nor will a shaman take that job when you go to take down the Myconid King in Sebilis.  Unfortunately that is not what we do on a daily basis.  We kill the dogs in Solb daily not Naggy.  We kill run of the mill sarnaks in Chardok every day, not the Queen.  We kill froggies in Seb everyday not the Spore King.  It is these daily groups where clerics will no longer be needed and certainly not desired when a druid or shaman can do the job and so much more.<P>I liken ressurection for clerics to summon corpse for necros.  You don't go out of your way to fill a group slot with a necro because you might need your corpse summoned.  When you need your corpse summoned THEN you go looking for a necro.  It does absolutely nothing to help them find a routine group, though it might get them invited on large raids.  Rezzes will be the same way.  We don't plan to fail, we deal with it when it happens.<P>Ezrick Blackpriest<BR>level 55 Rez Mule<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have zero problems with the improved healing powers of druids and shamans, however, I think the increased aggro of heals was too much.  I might even be ok with that if taunt worked better but it doesn't and I don't think it will be improved in the future.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059769-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059769-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059769-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059769&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059769&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
