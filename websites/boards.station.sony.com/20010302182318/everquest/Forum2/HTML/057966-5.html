</FONT><HR>Wither said:<P>I had already a troll sk with full darkforge and jboots and some jewelry on a server i sorta quit a while back. He was lvl 16 at the start of the evening.<BR>I hung out in EC and bought him a mace of shadowed soul for 5k pp plus mith staff (i sold all my warrior stuff who'd been my primary on this server -- hadnt played there for a few months). So anyway with minimal effort -- say a 20k pp -- i had my trolly equipped.<P>**full darkforge and a MotSS at level 16?? I didnt have full darkforge until around level 40.<BR>Untwinked Warriors have full crafted by 30 if not sooner....<P>**for a little more plat, a warrior could buy an iksar BP.....  Level 16 warrior in iksar BP, full Crafted, and lams would solo quite well as well...<P>I made 4 lvls in overthere in 6 hours. Just cut through stuff. I figure I can get to 30 by the end of the weekend with fd and gather shadows. If I really wanted 50 in 2 weeks max, all soloing. Not a group touched. And thats the difference: if I really wanted to solo a warrior I couldnt,<P>**Um, I had little trouble soloing my warrior at level 16 without twinking at all..... thats right... he started with NO money.... and it was a brand new server...  oh and my warrior is a Half-elf...  AND this is before Kunark came out... its about picking your targets and knowing your strengths.....<P>even with much more expensive twinking, theres just no way to recover hps efficiently.<P>**you have never heard of bandages??  my Half-elf warrior used LOTS of em....  ive heard twinkers use Rubi/Iksar or the lucky few use a Fungi Tunic.<BR>Indeed, the most efficient method of recovery for even a troll SK is bandages, if you have the money.  (buy them from mages if possible... store bought ones are not cheap... even hear you can tailor em now)<P> Now, I know i'm giving an example of twinking, and usually I dont twink, but I just wanted to see what was possible. I'm pretty sure that with enough plat you could twink an sk to 50 in 12 days played.<P>**first off, I found warriors and SK balanced pre-50... but I played them without twinking....  at 16, my SK could fear kite, but it wasnt exactly efficient...  in fact, at 16, It took longer to med the mana back for fear kite than recover the HP lost to tanking the thing to death.....(you just got your first dark and first fear at 15)<P>**I would love to hear how your soloing at 16 is diffrent than a warrior at 16... how is the SK better at this point??  at 16, warrios have dual wield and double attack (granted dual wield is still lesser than 2H at this point due to it not going off much)  SK can fear kite, but their downtime is prolly greater by using their mana than by just tanking....  SK CAN lifetap at this point, but even a full tank of mana doesnt even heal much more than a bub even at this point.<BR>(my SK was 40+ before they added taps)<BR>Likely you tanked and killed VERY easily die to being hugely twinked... the MoSS covers the SK's biggest weakness... the iksar BP would fix the warriors biggest weakness at that point....<P>**due to most hybrid making the point that post-50 is the real problem, your post is of little relevence to this topic....<P>Brik</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow I strongly agree with this one.<BR>Warriors are the damage takers and I'm sorry but hybrids should NOT have the same defensive capabilities as them.<P>Also I've wondered about disciplines for a while.... whats the point of using the ones that take an hour to recover from? That means you'd have to play 6 hours or more to make any use of something you've gone 56 levels to achieve. These need to be changed.<P>BUT about your item gear... I'm sorry I disagree completely.... we're a new server and just about every tank I see has cobalt of some kind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, my point about soloing and groupability and the post 50 game is this: you don't balance classes 0 to 50, then stop, then rebalance 0 to 60. Game design and class balancing is a 0 to 60 issue. It's also true that everyone is better off by grouping post 50. But the spells hybrids add are equivalent to a huge boost in versatility, and versatility means power. <P>The ability to solo means that you can always gain exp. It meanst that, while you wait for a group, instead of having to sit waiting for a group, you can lessen the tedium of shouting for group. The ability to snare/root means you can solo in dungeons while waiting to group. And the idea that bandages equate to the hp recovery that hybrids have isn't a serious arguement.<P>I can give you a concrete example. It's pretty late right now. I have a lvl 49 warrior on Tholuxe Paellis, a relatively new server. Right now, as I type this, he was looking for a group in Sol b; there were like 4 people in the zone. 3 were a lower lvl window group, another a lvl 53 sk soloing bnb with his snare. If I were a hybrid I could at least do the solusek kobolds due to the snaring ability. As a warrior I simply gotta call it a night. Yes I coulda logged on earlier and played -- but sometimes I like to log on to eq for just a bit and play. Soloing capable classes have a big advantage there. <P>You could say: versatility is meaningless at high lvls when in-group power is all that counts, or even "raiding" power is all that counts. But that's neglecting the 0 to 50 road that *every* player travels, and which classes like clerics and warriors and rogues pay their dues, so to speak. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You may think your critical/crip blows are useless but that time you do a crit/crip for 500dmg (which happens now and then at that level) you actually do 30 seconds of a Paladins damage. <BR>900-something AC at 55 ain't to good.. You are so dependent on your plane/Kunark armor that you won't even look at other options (and I know there is other options for a Warrior at that level). <BR>Remember that a Paladin/SK with a unbuffed AC at 1k have to sacrifise all his other stats just to hit that golden 1K ac..<BR>I totally agree with you that Cobalt armor drop need to be improved and I agree with you that Verant should compensate Paladins/SKs/Rangers defense/offense with spells instead, but if it do the same as increasing defense/offense I see no point in putting it in spells..<P>At your level Paladin/SK/Rangers spells don't do much to blue mobs, and have bairly any effect at all at even cons and higher.. You can still do your damage and tank, even though the mob is 5 levels higher then you, but remember that a Paladin/SK/Ranger cant do that, due to the low caps and resisted spells.<BR>You also notice the HP advantage Warriors have over hybrids and you mention 200hp difference unbuffed. I can't agree with you here.<BR>I looked on castersrealms player information and I found out that Paladins/SKs have in general 20-30% less HP then a warrior at 55. This gap will of course be less with buffs, but will still end at 15% difference (600 difference with good buffs). <BR>I'm not sure, but are you asking for a 50% hp difference? Even at 35% it will unbalance the game completely, and there is no way a group will invite a hybrid tank to take the damage, due to Complete Healing..<P>The defense increase you are talking about is not yet live, but I hope and believe it will go live, or else you will stay as an obsolute class with no other option.<P>Slitz Jawbreaker<BR>55 Paladin of Raging Fury<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors shouldn't be asking for anything. This is ridiculous. With RoK warriors got EVERYTHING in the melee department, and they hybrids you like to crap on got jack.<BR>Sk/Pal have only double attack, ONLY double attack, this is utterly useless against mobs post 50 when your miss ratio is even with or not higher than your hit ratio.<BR>Our spells, a reason for having crap melee? I dont' think so. I don't see how 610 points of DoT dmg over a TWO MINUTE period at lvl 50 qualify as anything worthwhile. Not to mention heavy mana cost, and high resist rates.<P>The higher a pal/sk goes in level, the weaker they get in comparison to the mobs that they're *forced* to fight in order to gain reasonable xp and loot. We get Weaker. Warriors get Stronger. And you're complaining. <BR>We don't get better melee, kick ass offensive AND defensive disciplines. <BR>You do.<BR>We don't get anything but more spells that our parent caster classes were using against mobs 20 lvls ago, if not more.<BR>Sk/Pal is a MELEE class, with some spell backup. SOME spell backup. We hardly qualify as casters, and we damn sure don't qualify as front line tanks in the endgame. <BR>Give US a break.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well a few things i would like to talk bout and put my 2 copper pieces into this forum.<P>I will not repeat what alot of people have said just a few ideas which are mine and i would like to share.<P>Hows about say a damage shield to the Undead that clerics and Paladins get? starts from say 4<BR>and can perhaps go up to 20-24. Stack that with bash and double attacks and i think Paladins can have something to be proud of.<P>My second point. Paladins are holy warriors who eventually wield the holy blade of their god.<BR>Fiery Avenger in the game illustrates this methinks. Now what exactly is Fiery Avenger? IT's a combination of Goulbane and Soulfire. So it's nice as it is now, but a small attack bonus when against undead or a double-tripe raise in effect of the proc against the undead, now that would set our epic apart from others.<P>Finally i'd like to thank you all for your time and nuked eyes while viewing this post.<P>many thanks<P>Technomancer Holyvengeance<BR>38th Paladin<BR>Sentinels of Justice <BR>Tallon Zek Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well Daeyuth,<BR>am playing my paladin now for a bit ( started april 99).<BR>First answer to Sprite 7 said :Till now I didn't see your point 1. is correct.<BR>Correct me if I am wrong but at the beginning of my play LoH was instant-cast, non-interruptable and the range was app 5 times higher than now.<P>Hmm let's come to taunting, as long as i weilded a Arbitor and didn't had Divine Might up i didn't taunted that good, in my opinion the only thing that taunts really good is a proc, am weilding a Som right now and have with Divine Might 2 procs now, sometimes warriors have difficulties taunting the mob away, but good warrior (even lower lvl ones) still have no problem. Hmm you said that disarm is not good at all. Do you know that sometimes disarm is working better that taunt to make the mob aggro, like pick pocket.<P>Damage making and Critical hits, well i don't know what you do wrong but I know a few people that like their critical Hits especially with 2Hded weapons. highest crippling with the epic i heared from were 1100 or 1200 with 1!! swing, only rogs can do that much damage if max double backstabb appears.<P>well now let's come to get Dmg, well what you said with the AC thing is nice but I have a few Plane parts and a few DW parts and am using a shield which brings me to 940 AC with selfbuffs, had a 51 warrior in my Handroom group last friday, he got app. onlz 2/3 of the damage i got if the mob was on him cause of dodge parry and riposte (asked him about his AC and he was 80 below mine).<P>Armor rarity: You are correct Cobalt is very rare and expensive, but indoclite is dropping quite often, the max at one day (on which I was at hate) was Legs 3x vambs 2x bracer 1x helm 2x gaunts 1x and boots 1x, If you compare my maximum day Valorium: Bracer 1x boots 1x that was it.<P>being forced to dual weild and not able to solo:<BR>Well, Warrior have some ugly 2H weapons, like zealot incarnine, felhammer, truncheon of Doom, only to mention the common. Highest crippling with Felhammer I saw on a 54 warrior was 580 or so. Soloing: I saw a guy solo in Sebi without a problem, Warriors are Item dependant like every melee exept monks, he had superior stuff, first he slowed the mob with truncheon of doom than he dotted him with BF and gave him the rest with the Rune proccing sword, he only lost app 1 bub or so on a dark blue mob.<P>To make one thing completely clear  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif">)<BR>I LIKE MY PALLY AND WILL EVER PLAY IT)<P>Doomchaser</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I know people who do the quests just for the heck of it.<BR>Darkforge... Every piece requires rare drops from Cazic.  (Compare to Rogue... Drops in Cazic, no quest needed.)<BR>Ro Armour... Every piece requires an uncommon drop from a Sand giant, 4 common drops from fairies (you end up KoS before you're half-way done.), an uncommon drop from hard to get to gargoyles in Mistmoore, a rare drop from uncommonly spawning clockworks in Sol-A (Spent enough time there to see Gabbie AND the EXG spawn twice, got two Melatite... and we killed EVERY clockwork that spawned at the castle.  Also ended up KoS.) and finally, two bars of enchanted plat for each piece.  (I can buy a pair of Crafted gloves for the cost of two bars of enchanted plat.)<P>Oh yeah... Paladins also have to have great faction with EVERY Paladin guild AND with the Sol-Ro temple to get their armour.<P>Yup, I see balance there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057966-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057966.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057966-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057966-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057966-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057966&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057966&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
