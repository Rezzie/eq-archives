</FONT><HR>Personally, I dont think VI as a whole thinks the harvesting of these emeralds to be an exploit. Otherwise they would have hopped on it like a cheeseburger in a Jenny Craig meeting. We all know how quickly Verant fixes anything they think gives the players an edge, and the tactics of how to harvest these emeralds has been posted for a long long time. Uber guilds have been saccing mules and and alts since the spells first came out. People who have been quitting the game have been taking sacs since then as well. <P>This whole issue came to a head because 1 GM thought it was "immoral" or some such. What Verant needs to do is make rules for everyone. Not just the players, but for GMs as well. These rules need to be posted in a FAQ like manner so everyone can read them. This way its across the board for the entire game. Nameing rules, Essence Emeralds, everything. One server GM may allow it, another may not. How consistant is that? And how fair is that? <P>If this is an exploit, it is the very first time I had ever heard anything about it. Its been in practice since the spells came out and should remain so. It hurts NO ONE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>graverobber, yes a sane player *will* give up 4 hours of exp or whatever for a char he is playing. Offer him enough money or items. That's the whole point, the spell is intended to have a high cost, not a cheesy one.<P>to sorsashu, yes a player has the right to do what he wants with his exp and gear when he quits. Verant has the right not to give him the option of doing sacrifices by how they design the spell to work. They should design so he can't use his exp that way and fix it to match how they wanted it in the first place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What about the person who wishes to delevel to fight Vox or Naggy,as has happened in the past? Well you can lose exp by jumping off cliffs OR sacrifice to a Necro to give him emeralds. Seems if you do it one way. It is ok. If the other you get a warning!!! Makes no sense to me at all.<P>If it is your character, and if you wish to delevel for ANY REASON that is your decision and no one's else's. If a necro makes 1 or 100 essence emeralds from it who cares? So now a necro can res 100 times, a Cleric can res all the time. No exploit at all. <P>How can it be an exploit using a spell they give you, and the other person accepting it? <P>More importantly if it is than Varant can make the item LORE or a new item LORE2-3-4 etc... Limiting the number you can have to 2 3 4 etc..<BR>Till they do that than it is a spell to use if you can find a willing character to do it with. I don't care if they drop from Lvl 59 to Lvl 46 if they want to do that. <P><BR>What is the gain? Oh the Necro can now res himself or another to avoide exp loss, the same exp loss someone gave up so the Necro can avoide their own exp loss. <P>That is what the spell is intended to do, and if someone leaving the game decides to go out in a blaze of glory and help a friend doing it. Than by all means more power to them both. <P>BUT DON'T you dare say it is an exploit. It is a choice made by a person who spent month builing a character up to those levels, and as long as they are playing their own character, they have a RIGHT to be sacrificed if they wish too. <P>If NOT REMOVE the spell from the game or LIMIT it to a set number you can carry, and make it Lore(1 2 3  etc) NO DROP. <P>Until that time no one can say it is wrong, unjust, immoral, etc... it is their choice. So leave them alone. What they were doing effects no one in the game at all but the 2 persons involved. <P>I would agree they should make the emeralds NO DROP, to prevent a stolen account from being sacrificed then the evidence sold around the server. Beyound that, Varant made the spell, they allow unlimited use. Seems you are PLAYING by the VISION because you are using the spell as they allow it to be used.<P>Calebe<BR>Level 57 Magician<BR>E'CI Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>GM was out of line.  There is no rule against doing so.  If Verant wants to stop retiring characters from being sacrificed repeatedly, they need to change the programming on the spell.  Make emeralds lore, no drop, or mark the player so they can't be sacrificed 2x somehow.  Personally I think it's a great way for level 53 pallys to make some cash.  Hell, I might even do it soon as I'm 52.6 and the score is Naggy 1 Rianne 0.  Also 3k for one night's worth of xp is pretty good ROI if you want new items more than you want your next level.<P>GM has no business warning someone for use of the spell until Verant makes a clear statement that it can't be used repeatedly.  It is not specifically listed as an exploit, and is not even remotely covered under Verant's definition of exploitation, which is using the pathing or terrain geometry to kill mobs without risk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Celeb, you say "What they were doing effects no one in the game at all but the 2 persons involved. "<P>Not true. There's a lot more in the game to consider. For example, if they let rangers have a button to get level 60 by pressing it, it would only affect them, right? No. You would have a server filled with people who made level 60 rangers affecting you.<P>If I suggested giving, say, any guild over a certain size nearly 100% reses whenever they want, it'd only affect them right? Wrong. Part of the game is that all the players have the same difficulties so none level very fast over others (without the appropriate price like a high level spending time to help).<P>Retiring chars giving a ton of essence emeralds would do something similar, unfairly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If essence emeralds for a friend are more valuable in a player's eyes than their character's experience it is because of that player's opinion. It is not a bug, exploit, or unintended design.

</FONT><HR>Datathief, you're missing the point. The designers intent, and forcing players to care about certain things, are not the same thing.<P>The point is, for example:<P>Verant *did not* want some level 60.5 char to sacrifice the .5 level down to 60.0 for essence stones. That's why level 60 chars can't do it. Finding a way that lets a 60.5 char end up at 60.0 with a bunch of stones, by going below 60 and then back up through ressing the level 60 corpses, does the same thing and is against the intended use. It's a flaw in the design that players are able to do it at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The thing is, Necros have been asking that these spells and this particular reagent be revamped. Someone suggested making it a quest to get the essence emerald and make it either a chargable item, or make it so you only need one ever. 3 spells make up the entire line up for the essence emerald reagents. 2 of which are junk. <P>-A 1000 mana influx for the Necro, which by the way is a little less than one third of the mana bar. If youre in such dire need for that much mana, chances are youre gonna die anyway.<P>-A 1100 point Lifetap. The way Lifetaps work nowadays its highly possible this spell could be resisted. And no Necro with half a brain uses Lifetaps for damage only. Lifetaps are used to regain health lost during the fight and from Liching. <P>Both of these spells have a 10 minute recast time, meaning that once you mem it, you have to wait 10 minutes for it to cycle, so youre sucking up a spell slot for a much more useful spell just to use one of these spells. <P>The only decent use for the essence emeralds is the rez spell, Convergence. Even then, this is not a commonly used spell simply due to the reagent. It is emergency tactical spell use only. Rezzing fallen clerics and the like. <P>If someone out there wishes to delevel their character, meaning they no longer wish to play it at all and would rather see someone else gain from this rather than let the character rot or be deleted, then why not? Comparing a button to gain level 60 and Sacraficing someone a couple levels is no comparison. You are overestimating the power of these reagents by doing so. They are not the ultimate in spell reagents, on the contrary they are the most underused, most expensive, biggest pains in the butt for any class to gain as far as reagents go. <P>Chances are this Necro is going to horde these emeralds like they were his only prized possessions. He will use them sparingly for only those rare occasions in which a cleric(a true rez specialist) bites it and nobody else is able to help. A Necro, SK, and Monk are probably the only classes that would survive on a Plane break. If at least one cleric doesnt get camped out in time, this means one of them has to run back in and attempt another camp. With this rez, that is not needed and after the mobs have cleared the Necro can then rez 1(thats one) cleric, and he can take over from there. Now I dont know about you, but usually clerics can make it out in time, but theres always that slim chance that they might not. So you can see the rarity of use for this spell and reagent. <P>I seriously doubt this necro is going to go kite in Skyfire using these emeralds, and I dont think hes going to rez low levels in Oasis either. So you see, it has no bearing or effect on anyone elses gaming experience. <P>People are making this into an issue of how Verant intended the spells to be used, but where is the intended definition of use for this spell posted by Verant? Where does it say it has to cost so much plat, or so many rare items for this spell to even be considered? It doesnt. Its left up to the players disgression. And if such a player comes along that doesnt care, then so be it. Its their right to willingly give up their "essence" to the Necro for whatever price he deems worthy. Be it free or for 2pp, or even 1000pp.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This kinda reminds me of the 52 fire pet "exploit".  Abashi once said the post 50 fire pets had an intended use...finally figured out how to get a bunch of mana off of it.  People complained, next thing you know, they nerf it.  No one to this day has found a use for the post 50 fire pets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056942-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056942.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056942-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056942&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056942&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
