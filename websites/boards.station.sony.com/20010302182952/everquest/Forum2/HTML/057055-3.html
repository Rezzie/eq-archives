</FONT><HR>Blah:<P>Sorry, did not mean to tread on sensitive wizard toes. I wanted to compare bards with all or any classes, at a couple different levels, but only got a response on a 60th level wizard. So I went with what I had, just to compare.<P>I admit it probably isn't a really good comparison, but it's all I could do with the information I had. I'm not even sure that the 6000 damage figure is accurate, since it was from someone else's post.<P>All I was trying to do is figure out a comparison range for different classes, with bard fighting capabilities.<P>-------<P>Now, as to the "master of damage", "master of healing", etc etc titles that were once applicable to different classes: I think it's high time we gave those up. Due to tweaks in the game over the past couple of years, these titles are pretty much a historical curiousity, and not much more.<P>I think, somewhere along the line, that Verant figured out that they had to keep every class pretty much equivalent at all levels to keep the game playable. Now, by equivalent, I mean "able to generate a like amount of experience in a set period of time"... whether they've accomplished this or not is debatable, but that does seem to be where everything is always headed. Otherwise, why would we be discussing "balance" at all?<P>------<BR>I can see more research is necessary... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Desbarolis, whatever you might say about charming in dungeons, etc, an Enchanter can do it CC better. There is no debating that. <P>I have been playing a Bard in this game since mid-beta 3..well over 3 years now, and until last May when the 39 charm song was added, Bard crowd control was limited to the low levels. <P>It is nice to have a higher level charm ability now, but it has hardly been some class defining Bardic role in this game like you want to make it out to be.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Fair enough, but when I started playing the game, bards had the ability to be good at crowd control and whatnot.  (btw, cap on charm is lifted, rumor has it)<P>Personally I rather like being able to deal high amounts of damage with just songs, but it annoys me a little that our songs go up at the exact same rate (damage-wise) as they did pre-level 50, whereas everyone else's power is increasing by much larger amounts post 50.<P>Certainly a wizard is in the same boat post 50, as their spells are highly resisted, and it takes them a very long time to regenerate their mana.  In velious, their nearly useless against the big stuff.<P>As for it being a class defining trait, at the outset of the game, your completely accurate that it was not something that was originally intended.  But as new things are added, it becomes a class defining trait, like it or not.  The cap on charm at 51 I was unaware of, but being able to do crowd control was a very good thing in my eyes.<P>As you said, when going on big raids there will be shaman's and chanters galore out there to handle crowd control and buffing, but I'm looking at our class on a more single-group basis, where there doesn't have to be a chanter present if there's a bard.<P>I think it'd be nice if we had more things like occlusion of sound, debuffs on the enemy to slow it down, lessen it's damage output, etc.  I've been playing the part of a 'battle bard' for over 30 levels now, being a mana battery isn't what I want.  The fact that people are rooting for better melee abilities instead of making our songs actually not suck just annoys me.  We have SO many usefull songs in our repertoire that are made useless, whether because their resisted too much on high level creatures, or because they won't stack with another class.<P>You make them stack, they'll say we're overpowered, and nerf something else.  I'm completely convinced of that.  If they'll make it stack and not nerf it, I won't argue.  But I think they will, so I'm against it.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>What you cite as a weak way to play the class (swinging weapons, singing regens and buffs) is one of the main roles of the class. always has been. In most cases that is primarily what other classes want from a Bard, like it or not.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Scratch buffs from that list, they won't stack.  Weak way to play a bard, and I see it day in and day out: level 1-40 bard, full lambent, dual wielding ykesha's, singing mana song and using chains to stop things from running.  You've been playing a bard for how long, and you don't think that's a weak way to play your class?<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>At the high levels, a Bards role degenerates into regen battery. Currently there is no choice in the matter. Buffing, Melee, and certainly CC fall by the wayside as the other classes get SO much better at those things than you will.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Aye, and that's what I want changed just like you.  Making our melee abilities better won't change that.  Making our songs not be resisted so much might make us usefull enough that people won't say 'sit in the corner and play mana song until we need you to take a deathtouch'.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>When you get some levels behind you, and start fighting in the truely hard zones, you will find that all you have left to you is the role you seem to so hate. <BR>You will have outgrown the cap on charm, and will most likely have more Enchanters and Shaman around than you can shake a flute at, all doing the tasks that used to make you feel usefull.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>You could have songs that are twice as good as all the shaman buffs, and people will still take the shaman or chanter buffs in large situations, unless the bard is playing on a T1 line (and even then, from my own experience, being in a raid of 30+ people attacking a single target and twisting more than two songs is a headache and a half), the reason: the bard will get so lagged from everything that happens (turning off the chat filter doesn't stop your client from being spammed with the information about who hit what and got hit for how much damage, and who casted what and did how much damage to this or that.) that the bard tends to run into problems such as songs sticking, or wearing off early because the client was unable to inform the server that the bard wanted to start playing another song, then songs being stopped late when the server's instruction to stop playing a song finally makes it through when you were already in the middle of starting the 3rd song down the line.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>At that point you very well may be wishing that you had fought here in -these- talks, to improve our melee, and scale our buffs to a level worthy of useing, and not wasting your time proclaiming your particular style/level of play to be the Bardic high ground.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>My style/level of play is that of what I learned from other people, not my own.  I never made those claims, and I said as much.  I'm good at what I do because of other people, not because I'm just naturally good at it.<P>Speaking of class defining traits, we were never intended to be anything more than a light melee class.  Verant will never make us as good as any other hybrid or pure melee class when it comes to melee skills, and that's because of how powerfull they perceive us to be with our songs.<P>My argument here is to make our songs as usefull as Verant thinks they are.  Making our melee abilities better does not accomplish that goal, in fact it detracts from it, as they will consider things on a whole, and if higher melee skills AND increasing our song's usefullness makes us overpowered, they'll either leave it as is, make melee better and leave everything else sucky as it is now, or leave our melee skills sucky and actually make our songs do something usefull.<P>Yes we get some usefull and fun songs post 50, but our class was intended to be able to have use for all our songs all of our life.  Not in all situations, definitely, but still in the majority of situations, i should be able to use more than 2 or 3 songs pre-50.  If the majority of my buffs won't stack with other classes due to weak haste components not stacking with a shaman/chanter, or because it's an ac buff, or because it's a rune, or a regenerative spell ... for example, cleric rune won't stack with 47 regen + ac buff.  I had a cleric hit me with the 44 rune, and then started playing that song.  I saw no icon appear, and then when the song wore off the rune was gone.  Kinda thought that was stupid.<P>Anyways, if bards can get stackable buffs, even if they take a hit in performance (perhaps the songs can be designed to give a lessened amount of haste if stacking with a haste buff, but their normal, or perhaps even a higher amount, if their not stacking with a haste buff), and nothing else gets nerfed, I won't argue with it.  But I argue against it because I think they will nerf other stuff.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi =)<P>I have a 52 mage and a 45 bard in the Quellios server.  I have practically stopped using my mage, because i love the bard class to pieces.<P>Now my primary concern in all of this is the defensive skill of a bard.  Heres the problem.  Ever since around level 31, i dont get hit in groups that much, which equals to my defensive skill being stuck at  around 170 or something, while my offense, and all weapons sills are over 200 now.<BR>Then when we do get hit, BOOM we get hit for almost max dmg because our defense is not up to par with our level.  We cannot say, solo tank the mobs at this level.  Nor could we say be the only tank in our group to raise defensive skill, cause the cleric will be oom before long.<BR>Two solutions i see for this and i am not suggesting both be implemented, just one of them to negate the other:<P>1)  Make our defense raise faster, and make us more defensive post 50.  Meaning raise caps on dodge, riposte and parry, or lower riposte and parry to a lower lvl.<P>OR:<P>2)  Like somone suggested in this thread, make us more offensive.  Only bad thing about this last one is that being more offensive means being higher on the hate list, and hence gt hit way too much, something our defense cannot bare.  <P>So, in my opinion we should become a more defensive class.  We dont have incredibly strong offensive melee abilities, so making us more defensive in my opsinion is the way to go.<P>In no way am i suggesting making us as good as taking hits as a primary tank.  No.  I understand that would unbalnce things, because warriors have their roles, and we have our roles.  Bards arent ment to be a primary tank.  But make us more tankish like pallys or rangers...maybe not as good tanks but close the gap between us.  Really close.  They have their spells, we have ours.  They hit harder, we hit not as hard.  <P>All i ask, better defense and a beter ability to take hits.<P>Thnku for making this a great game<P>Wolfganng<BR>Bard of Tunare<BR>Forgotten Ways<BR>Quellios Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few quick thoughts<BR>Undergod, this is a board for people to share their thoughts, and when others ridicule them for that, poeple will be less likely to share a good idea. Pointing out a flaw you see in a idea is jsut fine, but riducluing people for them is jsut a bad thing. <BR>As towards the problems of a tavern teloport, instead of a utterly random prot, it wcould jsut take you to a specific tavern in each city, versus anywhere in the world.<BR>As well, I like the idea of raising defense skills like parry dodge, and so on. There isnt a need for another tank in the game, but the ability to defend oneself better wouldnt necessarily offset the balence as much<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You've been playing a bard for how long, and you don't think that's a weak way to play your class?"<BR>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>The only "weak" way I see to play our class is by not adapting your group. That goes for just about any class.<P>Ever since the Plane of Fear opened in Aug of '99, I have basicly been on nightly guild raids...twisting utility songs in that lag you mentioned.<P>I can barely even remember what its like to play a Bard sub-50. It was an entirely different game back then. A level 40 with 2 yaks? I was level 48 when I got the first one on my server around mid july 99. Hell, Twinks and Alt's didnt even exist yet. Its been that long since I regularly did the 6 person group thing.<P>Look, I only play this game to kill the big stuff. If there isnt a Dragon to kill or a boss mob up, I have zero reason to play...and trust me..when there are 35+ other well played guildmembers around..it doesnt leave a whole lot of options for a Bard...And I know *zero* 55+ Bards that arent doing frequent guildraids.<P>There is no "right" way to play a Bard. You adapt to the group the best you can. In my case, that is to sing mana, play buffs/resists, and dual wield.   <BR>I will agree that those are very weak options, given the current power scale and the almost total lack of use for most buffs with Shaman and Enchanters around, but those are the -only- options left open to a guilded, high level Bard.

In these levels you will invairably be acccompanies with good taunters or on large raids. My bard barely gets hit. Aggro list manipulation is part of this...it's no good saying that your defense caps are too low if your twist a full set of high aggro songs and stand nearest a rooted mob =). Rangers have to learn to minimise their aggro to survive, and so should we. We don't need a defence raise, and it makes no sence in the RP way of things for us to defend as well as a pally, SK or warrior.<P>A clockwork poison type song is nice but has no effect without a rework, I believe, because of the way mob targetting seems to work.<P>A memblur song might be nice.<P>Also, can we cut down on the use of CAP SHIFT; it's very difficult to read and akin to shouting.<P>I believe that the only way a 'pub TP' would ever be considered was if it was 'self' only.<P>Siranui<BR>&lt;Tides of Destiny&gt;<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tribunal has so few highlevel bards and that kinda shows there is a problem with the class. Bards are GREAT for big raids twisting their resist songs against those nasty AE fears and AE damage spells, but in the everyday grouping they lack something. They should be made more viable as replacement for enchanters instead of just being mana feeders. <BR>Also make their instruments work as good weapons so they don't have to be bystanders when they use their instruments for optimal song efficiency. Making their weapons simulate different instruments would also be a viable solution.<P><BR>Laen Spinesplitter &lt;The Companions&gt;<BR>57 blackguard<BR>The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have tried to explain this before, with very poor results.  Bards are not hybrids, they are pure casters, plate wearing casters like clerics.<P>Melee classes:<P>Warrior, Monk and Rogue:  Dual Wield(2 hands) X Double Attack(2 attacks) = 4 hands worth of offense  (note that monks and warriors can also get the 4 hands of offense by double attacking with a two-handed weapon)<P><BR>Hybrids:<P>Paladin and Shadow Knight:  Two-handed weapon X Double Attack = 4 hands worth of offense<P>Rangers:  Dual Wield X Double attack = 4 hands worth of offense<P><BR>Pure casters:  <P>Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Necromancer, Wizard, Magician, and Enchancter:  Two-handed weapons X one attack = 2 hands worth of offense<P>Bards:  Dual Wield X one attack = 2 hands worth of offense<P>Now lets look at hit points.  There is no doubt in anyones mind that a naked and unbuffed bard's hit points are much more caster like than melee/hybrid like.<P>Please stop refering to bards as hybrids, not even the other hybrids mention bards when they talk about hybrids.  It is obvious that bards are "pure casters" as intended by the vision, and since that is obviously the intention, there is no need to make us lesser than our so-called enchanter parent.<P>As a side note, what would our melee parent be, we have such a diverse set of low level (some so low as to be useless or nearly useless) that it would be hard to definitively determine our melee parent.  For those of you that think it is rogue, guess again.  Rogues cannot track nor wear plate.<P>The plate was probably given to the bards to make them survivable.  Due to the continuous singing (casting) we draw tremendous amounts of aggro.  Having decent armor class keeps us alive.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>The only "weak" way I see to play our class is by not adapting your group. That goes for just about any class.<P>Ever since the Plane of Fear opened in Aug of '99, I have basicly been on nightly guild raids...twisting utility songs in that lag you mentioned.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Exactly.  My comment a few post's ago was more to do with someone saying that charm sucked and wasn't usefull than any particular way of playing a bard.  I change what I'm using on a regular basis, sometimes sitting mid-combat to mem different songs, fighting against time to get a dispell off before too many people go linkdead and such.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>I can barely even remember what its like to play a Bard sub-50. It was an entirely different game back then. A level 40 with 2 yaks? I was level 48 when I got the first one on my server around mid july 99. Hell, Twinks and Alt's didnt even exist yet. Its been that long since I regularly did the 6 person group thing.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>It's a sick world out there.  When I was level 30, I ran into a tweaked out level 37 bard with dual ykesha's, full lambent, and such.  I thought I'd have some fun, so I challenged her to a damage contest.  Me twisting 3 dot's, her using whatever she wanted (she bellowed and used her ykesha's).  She barely beat me, what with a ~12dd, 75dd, and the melee she was doing, and I was 7 levels under her.  I thought it was rather sad that a bard not using any weapons, swapping instruments & doing fufils/ddd/chords, nearly outdamaged her.<P>These tweakers think they are magically turned into good bards simply because their now a blue popsicle with ykesha's, and their not.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Look, I only play this game to kill the big stuff. If there isnt a Dragon to kill or a boss mob up, I have zero reason to play...and trust me..when there are 35+ other well played guildmembers around..it doesnt leave a whole lot of options for a Bard...And I know *zero* 55+ Bards that arent doing frequent guildraids.<P>There is no "right" way to play a Bard. You adapt to the group the best you can. In my case, that is to sing mana, play buffs/resists, and dual wield. <BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>I want that changed just as much as you.  Personally, if I can dual wield a singing shortsword (god that's going to take forever, what with competing with warriors adn casters for my scales, let alone getting trak guts ... /sigh) and another decent weapon, get songs not to resist so much on me, that's about the only way I'd desire to be meleeing.  Otherwise, I'm quite happy going all instrumental. <P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>I will agree that those are very weak options, given the current power scale and the almost total lack of use for most buffs with Shaman and Enchanters around, but those are the -only- options left open to a guilded, high level Bard. Hence the reason I took issue with your post.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Well, in my first reply to yours I should have stated that my reply was aimed at someone who said charm sucks (and others that are quite usefull ... he actually said resist songs suck!  lol ... oh dear), so I was showing him how someone a little higher up than him was able to make extremely good use of that song.<P>Personally, I don't think we need more melee abilities, I think we need less resist's on our songs.  Our main source of combat should be focused around our songs, not around what equipment we can get to make our very mediocre melee skills at least average instead of down-right crappy.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards are Hybrids.<P>No other caster can dual wield. No other caster has as large a selection of weapons and armor as the Bard. <P>In regards to SKs/Paladin and double attack. Double attack has a higher chance of going off, but will never give more than two hits. The damage of the weapon is much more than that of a 1h'er if it is of similar level range. In other words, SKs and Paladins get two attacks not 4. Albiet they do alot of damage compared to a bard dual wielding.<P>The 15th level rogue skills bards get are as useless in my opinion. Bards are a hybrid of various melee and caster classes, but is not a half and half like the other hybrids appear to be. More like 5% 5% 5% etc... In some cases the 5% is effective, in most cases its a joke. <P>Bards melee weak compared to any melee or hybrid class. All bards cast weak compared to any hybrid or caster class. <P>The four hand offense argument doesnt really stand its ground without more definition.<P>UNDER_DOG<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Top Ten Reasons Bards Suck!<P>1:  You can easily max out resists and still keep decent ac unlike pre expansions.  <P>2:  Bards also cause massive amounts of graphic lag because vi has always refused to allow folks to turn off the graphics from songs completely.  With the recent bugs caused from high level mob lag where tons of folks get dumped off the server and killed the reasons for not including bards is obvious.<P>3:  Pixie strike is still hokey to take seriously.<P>4:  Chains is laughable because while it's great in a pinch it just takes one failure to kill the group.  And in the newer dungeons dying deep in is a bigger problem than experience loss.<P>5:  Clarity is good, but having to wait to 55 for C2 is sickening.  54 is a nightmarish level to be forced to overcome with a crippled class for 1 song that doesn't really make the class into a must have for anything.<P>6:  Mele .. hahahaha.. HAHAHAHHAHA...  hehe.. whew (clutches aching stomach)  My enchanters 39th pet outdamaged my bard at 52 easy.<P>7:  Defenc...Loading Please Wait<P>8:  Constant nerfs are disheartening.  I got tired of finding songs working differently all the time with no announcement.  By the way the whole root stacking with snare "enhancement" was aimed directly to nerf bards ability to break root with selos.<P>9:  Haste.. it's mostly worthless as it won't stack with any other haste casters better versions.  The party still gets the stat buffs, consult your local shaman to the usefullness of those.<P>10:  Pain.  Hurting wrists, constantly having to pound on the keyboard to keep 3 songs up is a carpal tunnel nightmare.<P>Vmlinuz Gateslayer 56th Templar<BR>Listener Luckytune 52nd Minstrel<BR>Vmlinux Gateslayer 45th Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Under_Dog,<P>     All melees and hybrids get double attack.  Pure casters don't.  Furthermore, as with most pure casters, late in life melee is meaningless anyway because bards do not have weapons out, they are using their instruments the way casters use their focus or int/wis/mana gear.  Bards in combat do about the same melee damage as a druid or a cleric who is using a two handed weapon.  It is only fair to compare all without shield, since the shield is an option that the character chooses whether or not to equip.  <P>     If you are trying to compare the damage that a bard does in melee favorably to a paladin or a shadow knight on the basis of we both get two attacks, you must be kidding.  Because neither class gets dual wield, most will opt for a two hander that rocks (an option that bards don't have and even if they did have that option, they would get only one swing) or take a class specific  one-handed weapon like an ebon mace or moss which has its stats based on the fact that the class can't dual wield.  If the developers thought of bards as hybrids, we would also have similar class specific weapons that we could dual wield.<P>     As far as armor goes, our armor selection is similar to that of clerics, but no one is accusing clerics of being hybrids.  Plate, shield, and other items make make cleric armor every bit as effective as bard armor.  (As a side note, Donal's was so powerful that it has been nerfed twice.  Do not expect the same treatment of the Singing Steel Breast Plate.  The "effect" is so pathetic that it is virtually useless, making it by far the worst of the Kunark breast plates.)<P>     Finally, if there is any doubt in your mind whether or not bards are hybrids, please go to any hybrid message board where other real hybrids are discussing hybrid balance.  Most messages do not even mention bards, which tells you what I have known all along, even the other hybrids do not consider bards hybrids.  They fully understand that a bard has worse offense than the defensive hybrids (paladins and shadow knights) and worse defense than the offensive hybrids (rangers).  Deep down they may know that bards are hybrids, but, they know that bards act like casters.  If a bard is tanking in the 40's or 50's because the main tank went down or is afk, the results are usually catastrophic.  Even a ranger can keep a group alive while the main tank is afk.<P>     What I am basically saying is that since our skills are set up like we are pure casters the arguements that our songs should be weaker than a shaman or enchanter are ridiculous.  What we gain in the ability to instantly buff an entire group is lost in the short duration of the song and the fact that it is useless to buff others outside the group.  That is already a steep price to pay, lets stop paying it in song power.  Either make our songs stack, or make our hastes as effective as an enchanter, our slows as effective as a shaman, etc.<P><BR>Dilbis Xll &lt;Balefire Clan&gt;<BR>49th Bard Tarew Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Allow me to summarize the things from this thread that I have either stated or learned.  Absor, if you have gotten this far perhaps a this summary will be of use to you.<P>1) Bard players tend to really like variety. That is, after all, one of the greatest attractions of the class. Hence Bard players will tend to really really hate becoming 'Johnny One Note' at higher levels - even more than everyone else does (since a narrowing of role is an unfortunate result of the game design).<P>2) Bards have the potential roles of reducing downtime, buffing in combat (and at least the healing song will always stack in combat where it functions like a 1-200 point hit point buff), aiding in travel and corpse recovery, meleeing, using damage songs, snaring, and doing crowd control (arguably snaring is a form of CC. Oh .. and being a mana battery.<P>3) Due to the increasingly ineffective nature of the bards songs - buffs not stacking or being so much weaker than commonly available buffs, high resist rates and limited options on crowd control and snaring, lack of hit points or defensive skills to limit tanking, lack of damage dealing capability that scales with level (gosh i wish i'd get more than a wince when i play - i'd really like to konw i'm doing something) - bards tend to be shoved increasingly into the mana battery role as a matter of not only peer pressure (from the casters) but simple efficiency.<P>4) I think some examination of buff stacking is in order - the bard damage shield stacks for instance - one idea would be to<BR>*create a new buff line similar to a group fire fist - a damage 'sword' if you will adding 6-10 (at a guess) fire, ice, poison, or magic damage (based on song) to the party attacks*<BR> - this would be a great group support ability and not unbalancing since all melee would profit from this.   This adds strategy to have the write song up - removes some worries about stacking since this is ability should have few things to potentially conflict with and it would give us a much desired song since the damage done by the party would be improved by a significant portion (though not by as much as upping haste an additional 20% since higher level attacks hit so hard).  Twisting heal, damage shield and damage sword would provide a lively and useful melee bard option.<P>5) adjust the resists on the crowd control songs - currently Lullabye, and the intermediate charm, mez and chains are resisted at an insane rate resulting in chain casting of a single song and huge aggro on the bard.  Frankly a resist rate of about half as much would not be wildly out of line. (and yes I know how much half a much is .. it's a lot but even then these songs would not be as effective as enchanter versions but would be effective enough to provide a viable option)<P>6) I'd like to see more Crowd Control options. I see this as the most interesting and critical role a bard can fulfill.  Obviously step 5 goes a long way towards fixing this ability but how about a new strategy option for CC?  For the upper level charm and mez consider this option if you will.  As long as the bard has mana, does NOTHING else and gets past the resist have the charm last until the bard stops singing (Or moves, or is hit or runs out of mana etc.).  This is clearly not an option for all circumstances and probably requires a new song since the function of the old song is still valid - but the idea would be to allow an option, a new strategy which in some situations might be the best possible thing i bard could do for the party.  I think a 2 creature limited AoE targetable Mes would be the meaningful mesmerization counterpart to this concentrated charm.<P>Just a thought for something new and interesting - but then ..i'm a bard .. i like choices.<P>7) I think the defensive upgrades on test are a nice idea<P>8) Last and most controversial point : either double attack or bind (self only).  I know this is a dead horse but i'd like to see Bards either tipped into the more melee role with a little bit of double attack ability (150?) OR treated as more of a caster with dual wield and given one of the travel convenience spells - not gate but Bind self.  By the words of VI bards generate the most aggro and bardic hits and ac are more in line with casters than fighters - so toss us either a bit of bind or a bit of attack to balance us with the other casters or fighters (however you view us most).<BR>But as I said this is probably a dead horse and I'm not going to say we have to have bind (especially considering there are supposedly a lot of more bind spots coming) - I'd personally rather have some double attack even with a low cap since melee is a useful and enjoyable part of my gameplay. (of course additional damage is additional aggro ...)<P>well this is probably a done thing by now but here is a bit more to chew on and possibly spit out.<P>thanks for listening Absor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If it wasn't for the fact I play a bard, I'd probably get a kick out of the fine jest Verant has played on us with our epic weapon.<P>Here we're even more rare a class than rogues (though rogues have recently seen a small upsurge in population, their still about the 2nd least played class, bard being the first ... which, IMO, is a good thing ... less people to compete with for equipment), and we get one of the most difficult to complete quests out there.<P>Regularly casters and warriors argue that bards shouldn't be allowed to get red and white scales, regularly other melee's whine about wanting to be able to make a red dragon scale tunic (furthermore lessening the chance of us getting our scale), not to mention that the amygdalin tendril, trak guts, and phinigel autropos' spine are all rare drop items (as are the red and white scales)<P>I know some of the other epic quests are harder in some ways (poor mages ... quillmane is camped 24/7, spawns now roughly 2 times every 3 hours, and drop rate has increased slightly, and yet getting someone to actually tell them where to find quillmane instead of just ganking him and taking the cloak for themselves is an excersize in futility), but with a majority of other classes you see difficulty because of a bottlneck npc that everyone in that class wants to kill and get an item for, and it's only that class trying to get the item.  Not so with bards.  I have to compete with warriors who want an amygdalin tendril (was a pretty good weapon pre-kunark, and still an 'alright' weapon), compete with warriors for the red scale, compete with casters who want the white scale ...<P>I've been on almost every single nagafen raid that has been scheduled now for about 2 months, and have seen ZERO scales drop (though it is possible that one was taken and no one told about it &lt;shrug&gt; ).  So now it's made worse, not just because i have to compete with another class, but I have to compete for an item that drops so rarely that seeing him die as much as I have and not having seen a single scale drop is enough to drive someone insane!<P>Please, absor, if you have any sympathy in your heart whatsoever, increase the # of items that can possibly drop off nagafen (max seems to be 3-4) and make scales (white and red) a little more common.  I don't want scales to be made common and end up with only 1-2 other items that drop off him to be dropping, that will make other classes feel like warriors and bards necessities being placed above theirs.<P>If you want a bottleneck, fine, make the green scale drop less often ... bards already have a bottleneck with trakanon's gut strings.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok to the guys that said Bards arent Hybrids.<BR>We ARE hybrids.  The definition of a hybrid is something that is a mixture or amallgam of two or more things.  In the EQ definition, its a class that can do what two or more other classes can do, they can do it pretty well, but not at par with a pure class.<BR>We get things from pure casters, fighting abilities from a warrior, rogueish abilities like pick locks, sense traps etc, ranger abilities like track etc.<BR>We are the MOST hybris class in this game, plain and simple.  Ive had many many converstaions with 55+ bards in my server, and they all agree on this.  If there is a class that deserves to be called hybrids, its the bard class.<P>Now in regard to my earlier post, somone answered that the defensive level we have does not matter post 50 that much, because other tanks can taunt pretty well.  Kudos to you for bringing that up.  Yes it is true, even at lvl 45 i have noticed that our dmg taking is highly reduced, even against multiple mobs.  But my concern, besides what ive stated before is this.  Like is said, post 40 it is EXTREMLY difficult to raise your defensive skill, given the fact that you are almost NEVER hit.  Meaning that even though we have a defense skill cap higher than 200 (and according to the test server we might even get a cap increase), most never reach it, according to my personal experiences, and conversations with other bards.<BR>Now, to what extent is a high skill cap useful if you canot even get near it.,  And i have tried everything.  Even though ive gotten hit in combat, soloed stuff blue to me (not kiting or anything, but straight melle, if i get low on hp i run, i just want to get skill up), and tried other things, i have not increased my defense since level 35, and even with that its still at a level 32 defensive level.<BR>Now i might be wrong on this.  This is more of me asking for an opinion from you other bards out there.  How did you raise your defense post 40?  Any ideas that could help me in this would be apreciated.  But if others have had the same problem as me, i think we should get a way to raise our defensive skill a bit faster, just as fast as our offensive skill.<P>Thnku for listening<P>Wolfganng<BR>Bard of Forgotten Ways<BR>Quellios Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>As of last sunday, I quit my bard (and maybe even the game).<P>Why did I quit?<P>1) Impossible to find groups. I spend 90% of my time looking for groups. Bards just aren't required... and definitely can't pull their own weight.<BR>2) My arm hurts. Honestly, I'm sick of going to bed with a sore forearm. <BR>3) You're virtually worthless on raids. Noone needs the extra resists... and have equip and regular buffs to bump them to the 200 range in MR and another stat. All I do is mana song the clerics after rezes (we don't have epics), and that's pretty much it.<BR>4) I don't pull my weight in groups. I can honestly say that adding a bard to you group is not worth it. A bard is a luxury sometimes. Unless you don't have an enchanter, you pretty much are worthless. The ONLY time bards are really good is in a heavy tank group with no enchanter (for speed and attack buffs), OR in an all caster group where you mana song full time.  Neither of those groups are well balanced, and generally are fairly limited and crappy groups.<P>Obviously 1 is the biggest reason, and 4 is just minor. I can honestly say (and you could probably ask anyone that knows me), that I am an awesome player. An awesome player who plays a bard just doesn't have much to work with... the ONLY reason I am wanted around is due to my organizational skills, knowledge of the planes, and my ability to kick butt... all of which I can do as a level 2 sk just as well. : P<P>I'm sad to give up my bard... I love my wood elf look... I love selos... and I love being able to use all sorts of items. I just can't justify wasting my time, effort, or tendons on my bard anymore.<P>Good luck all, and I hope that verant helps out some of the remaining bards before the rest of you move on to bigger and better things.<P>-Cueller</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I was hit a total of less then 10 time. Thats right, there were only 10 times I actually got smacked for damage.

</FONT><HR>Sylok,<P>While our skills may be shared with different classes the hybrid term is used to refer to classes that have melee and casting ability.  A shaman is NOT a druid/enchanter hybrid (healing and spirit of the wolf from the druid/haste and pet from the enchanter) but instead considered a pure caster.<P>Sylok said:<BR>"we get things from pure casters"<P>Yes, we do, however, getting their melee skills and a caster's hit points is not what I would consider a great gift.  Bard songs have such a short duration that they are entirely different from normal magic.  For instance, an enchanter only cast clarity on a warrior by mistake, but bards sing clarity songs to warriors all the time.  A shaman only hastes a mage in error, but mages are continuously recieving the benefits of bard celerity.<P>     Our songs have such a short duration that we can not buff and inflict damage like most casters, we have a choice, one or the other.  our other choice is to go half way, provide a little defense and a little offense, but all other casters can go on the offensive once the party is buffed.<P>Sylok said:<BR>"fighting abilities from warriors"<P>Not exactly.  Our fighting ability as I have noted in previous posts is most effective when not using an instrument, which is often the worst way for a bard to fight.  But even when we are using weapons, our melee damage output is comparable to a caster, not a warrior.  Once our hand to hand hits 100 it is capped.<P>Sylok said:<BR>"rogueish abilities to pick locks, sense traps, etc"<P>Well, at my level there are not to many people asking me if I can break into Befallen for them.  I would say that a bards so called rogueish skills are some of the most useless in the game, with skill caps so low, that other than corpse retrievals in newbie zones, I would not even notice if the class did not have them.<P>Sylok said:<BR>"ranger abilities like track etc."<P>Or a druid ability like track and forage.  There is skills overlap among the caster classes.  However, that overlap does not make a caster a hybrid.<P><BR>Bards have paid the penalty too long with marginal melee skills and nerfed songs since it would be unfair for them to be as powerful as casters.  If the songs are going to stay crippled, at least give us the offense/defense/hit points of a hybrid.  My preference would be to fix the songs to bring them into line with power level of a caster.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057055-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057055.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057055-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057055-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057055&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057055&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
