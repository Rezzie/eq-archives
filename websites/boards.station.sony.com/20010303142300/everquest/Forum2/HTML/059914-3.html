</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>It is important to immediately grasp that PvP in EQ is different, fundamentally so, depending on whether you are playing on the teams servers or RZ.  The starting rules are different on each server, and so the problems are different.  You will hear from the players on TZ and VZ much unhappiness about crossteaming while that on RZ will be mainly about item loss.  Different rulesets lead to different priorities.  I'll try to just hit the general comments.<P>PvP in EQ has several general shortfalls.  The first is the melee/caster problem.  Melee classes require close quarters to hit their opponents, casters do not.  Consequently, casters have a much higher damage potential in a situation where latency is a factor.  Consider that a small amount of lag combined with the predictive displaying of position built into EQ causes the melee player to be out of melee range with his opponent, while the caster is not so constrained.  Consequently, even though in a duel between a caster and a melee the fight might be close, in an unplanned PvP situation, the melee class is almost always at a disadvantage.<P>The second general problem revolves around targetting.  It is understood that Verant has chosen not to make LOS a necessity for casters in PvP, even though it does require it in PvE.  This, unfortunately, leads to quite distressing problems for melee classes.  Casting through walls, completely out of line of sight and range of any possible retribution, makes casters again supreme.<P>Gate, in and of itself, is a massively unbalancing PvP spell.  The ability to remove yourself from danger is granted to some classes and not others.  It also happens that those classes are the ones that are most able to deal damage in PvP most effectively and are least reliant on the equipment they could possibly lose.<P>The ever increasing power of casters in PvE does not scale properly in PvP.  DD Spells which are able to do 600 HP of damage and pets that can out melee tank classes do not compare properly versus classes that are hitting for 60 points a hit.  Pet classes are very unbalancing to pure classes that lack the ability to root/snare/fear.  Channeling skills in the 200s means channelling gate spells through hasted melee classes with 20 delay weapons duel wielded.  The extra 30 HP gained by a melee class does not compare well to the added power of the next line of spells.<P>The ability of almost all casters to selfbuff, either with a damage shield or a HP buffer/barrier  of somesort, places a huge burden on melee classes to become dependent on dispelling items.  As an example, attempting to fight a caster with the skin or rune line up requires spending multiple seconds repeatedly pumicing buffs, all the while absorbing damaging spells, before actually being able to damage the caster.  When comparing the effectiveness of classes in PvP, do not compare fully buffed x vs fully buffed y.  Episodes like that happen rarely.  More often than not, you should compare fully buffed x vs unbuffed (pumice) or partially buffed (PvE setup) y, as one side is prepared for PvP, while the other is not.<P>Lack of clear, enforceable guidelines in PvP have led to multiple standards being enforced, ranging from no enforcement, to rigid enforcement, to enforcement of only some standards.  A good example is "loot and scoot", an action that is not codified, is enforced rarely and only through direct GM intervention.  As stated earlier, there can never be too many Guides/GMs on a server where the main problem will be interplayer, rather than mechanical.<P><BR>Problems specific to RZ fall mainly in the risk vs. reward category.  The risk to any class requiring gear to operate at any level of effectiveness is out of proportion to those classes requiring little to no gear.  For example, most pet classes and classes that can dot/root require little in the way of items to allow them to garner xp.  Melee classes, on the other hand, do not share such a luxury.  Naked casters regularly farm geared melee classes who are attempting to get XP with no potential loss to themselves, and are still able to get XP with no potential losses, assuming they were attacked.<P>Personally, I think PvP mechanics broken beyond repair in EQ.  The balances in the game are designed for PvE and PvP is an afterthought.  So be it. Instead, the way to fix PvP is totally through personnel.  Increase your guide/gm staff, get clear protocols and prosecute the people who regularly break your posted guidelines.  This will remove the worst aspects of PvP (zone killing, root/training, corpse camps).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I belive the easisest "fix" that will cater towards the broad masses and towards the roleplayers are coin only loot. The hardcore PvPers and griefplayers will scream otherwise but VI stop and think a moment how many of those will you have left when Shadowbane comes, 5% if your lucky.<P>Basically the PvP system in EQ is broken and will never be fixed, coin only loot will allow more to take enjoyment in PvP as they actually will start to fight back instead of running frantically bagging there prized possessions.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>with properly implemented PVP EQ could seriously be a fantastic game and even possibly shrug off the challenge to it's player base coming from DAoC and others.<P>1) Complete the game - by that I mean apply the factions to the players.<P>Instead of silly and artifical teams and a red/not red outlook have it work off the faction system.<P>Based on race AND religion - so that a human necro is on the innorouk team for instance not the human barb erudite team.<P>Fix this and you'll have a FANTASTIC game - assuming you can get the mechanics balanced.<P>But if you wanted to be a 'good' troll you could be one by earning enough of the right factions and by going red to your old faction.<P>2) Remove the common tongue from all non-humans<P>3) make everyone play only one race per account per server (or at worst one faction per account) so that htere is no cheap spying<P>4) have the gods take an active interest in the faction warfare since most of it will rotate around their religions - have them come to the earth a bit and lead some armies or send folks on quests.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm where to start....<P>#1.) Remove Binding of non city zones for Casters. One of the biggest problems in PVP is casters can bind in the zone where they PK. So no matter how many times you try to remove the predator they Only have to wait for Memming and Medding to go killing. All melees are required to Bind in Cities, Casters should too IMHO. <P>#2.) Bring back Pre Nerfed Pumice for Melees, make it a new stone that is Self only. But Melees are at a huge diadvantage since Pumice was nerfed.<P>#3.) No Spell should be Unresistable in PVP, and with the new Druid healing enhancements, you have now made them practically Unkillable. I plan on seeing alot more Druids on RZ soon.<P>Just a few thoughts<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here goes--<BR>Having played on both Vallon Zek and Rallos Zek, I will address issues on both.<P>Vallon Zek (perspective of 47th dark elf warrior)<BR>-------<P>1.)  Grief play.  There are people out there who just can NOT deal with PvP.  When something happens involving PvP, eg: they are kicked out of Karnor's Castle by a group of raiding darks and have had their source of experience compromised, they turn to "dirty" tactics.  Not long ago, after controlling Karnors honorably for quite some time, our raid was broken apart by the training of Gorenaire to the KC zone, and many were left with experience loss deaths due to it.  This is a fine example of greif play... and there are MANY MANY more.  Corpse Camping (bannable, but action is never taken, and rarely witnessed... and understandably so, you can't watch 1500 people at the same time)is another.<P>2.) Immortal Healing.  This is major lame crap.  Outside of Nektulos Forest/East Commons zone point, the dark elven newbies and human/light newbies constantly war, but every so often, a light (or even dark) twink is brought along with a level 50+ healer keeping him alive and pretty much making the twink invincible.  <P>Guild battles with crossteamers--it's very frustrating to engage in PvP with guilds who have both lights and darks, and having the darks keep the lights healed.  We can do nothing about the darks; we can only keep on the lights.  Whereas, they have an unfair advantage over us, brought through crossteaming.  This needs attention of SOME sort.<P>2.) Out of Range healing is a bad issue as well, but one that has to be dealt with VERY carefully.  There are examples of a level 50 cleric following a low level 15-20 player around with the intent to kill everyone in the zone.  Thats an example of a bad situation, however...<BR>I, a 47 warrior, am grouped with a level 45 cleric, and am attacked by a level 55.  The cleric in my group will heal me, but his healing will be out of range.  It's unreasonable for the cleric to walk up to the agressor, press autoattack to see if he's in range, then go about his business.  "ok, just checkin".. =P  <P>Aside from that, I have no other issues.  PvP on the teams server is MUCH more fun, because I can wear nice armor into combat and not worry about replacing them.  It makes for a MUCH MUCH MUCH more friendly environment than Item Loot.<P>That's important, so I'll say it again.<BR>Not having to worry about replacing items/getting ganked for your items makes for a MUCH MUCH MUCH more friendly (and thus, enjoyable) environment than on an Item Loot server.<P>Rallos Zek issues, from standpoint of a level 50 wood elven bard.<BR>------------<P>1.) Item Loot.  My one and ONLY problem is item loot on this server.  It is the reason I migrated over to Vallon Zek full time.  It is the reason of MANY heated arguments, MANY stressful nights of replacing things, MANY players giving up in frustration.  <BR>Problems with Item Loot:<BR> a.)  Players can "gank".  A gank, for example, is a player who can deal damage fast and deadly (Casters, for example, or Shadowknights) sits near an area (portal, zone line) waiting for players who've been hurt in the PvE portion of the game still wearing all their items to zone through.  They then do a powerful amount of damage in a short amount of time.  Loot the item, then leave the area.  <P>What does this leave the player with?<BR>They lost an item.  That's saddening, and disheartening.  They had a PvP experience they could in NO way enjoy.  That's frustrating.  They were killed and lost something that will take a lot of money or time to replace.  The prospect of replacing that isn't a good one =(<P>The attitude on Rallos Zek is really rather hostile.  Players who lose items are angry, go off in ooc/shout/tells, corpse camp as revenge, train, etc...  MOSTLY because of Item Loot. I feel strongly that this should be changed on Rallos Zek.. Very Strongly.<P>What would come of changing it to coin loot only?<BR>Well.  yes, the risk of PvP will be minimized in the *VERY* few cases where players are met on equal terms.  But the majority of PvP ends in ganking, or group pounces on a single player ending in a death and the agressor's gating/running away.  And always when Item Loot is concerned, players are left heartbroken and missing something.  (provided, they have something that can be looted... level 50+'s running around in a mixture of shin and other no drop items isn't too uncommon on Rallos)<P>Implementing Coin Loot will lighten the atmosphere of the server, will make PvP a bit more frequent, and will provide an enjoyable PvP environment.  <P>Thank you, and good luck.  I hope you read through my essay =P<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dammit, looks like I owe Jochomo enough Guinness to kill him in one sitting. Thanks for the attention, Absor!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>I have a 41 monk and a 45 druid on Rallos, as well as other chars ranging in levels all over (but below those 2).<P>Some of the more important issues I believe would be (in no particular order)<P>* insert code to reduce the skills of delevelers to be the normal cap for that level.. if a 40 rogue delevels down to 12 he shouldn't still be able to fight like a level 40, and he sure as hell shouldn't backstab for 150+.  There has been a huge surge in the number of deleveled grief players in the last few weeks, and it's keeping good people from coming to our server.<P>* replace egg-shaped pumice on the vendors.  Removal of this item was a virtual death sentence for many a melee character. With Egg shaped pumice, they stood a chance.  Without it, they are at a severe, severe disadvantage to casters, especially sow classes.  As a small bonus, pumices are a great money sink for removing plat from the economy, preventing inflation.<P>* "tourism" from other servers plagues our newbie grounds with morons looking to victimize anyone and anything.  A player should be able to at least roll a character and zone in for the first time without having his newbie spells ganked away from him before he can even scribe them.  I suggest letting newbie chars remain blue until level 4 or so, when they automatically turn red.  This will let new players get in, get their feet wet and get a feel for their surroundings without the constant agony of idiots with names like "whyisfenninrodown" standing at the newbie bind point siccing pets on every level 1 who appears.<P>* Portal camping is a constant problem, especially at the Greater Fay wiz spires. People are attacking players as they drop in but before their client registers they are there and hands over control to the player.  I suggest introducing code that makes a player pvp-disabled until his first keypress or mouseclick after passing through a portal/circle/evac/succor/etc spell. <P>* post a current list of things you are not allowed to do on the official website (like rules regarding corpse camping, and other exploitative activity) and include the URL for this rules page in the rallos Message of the Day.   I've had to explain the rules to countless numbers of new players who just didn't know that what they were doing was against the rules.<P>* decide once and for all whether killing someone in a bank is allowed or not, then introduce code to enforce it.  I suggest making a bank area a conditional non-pvp area (kind of like arenas are PVP areas), with the condition that the person in that non-PVP area is only non-pvp if he has not cast any spells nor turned on autoattack since zoning in.<P>* do a server split, allowing /movelogs for the people who wish to move their characters to a rallos-rules server with coin only loot.  Keep Rallos the way it is.  This will allow the choice for people who started playing rallos and had large amounts of time invested on characters here before coin-only servers/team servers were even conceptualized to be able to retroactively have that choice.<P>* since guides/GMs are not allowed to guide on the servers on which they play, rallos has a lot of guides who came from blue servers and are uninformed about the idiosynchrasies and special rules pertaining to rallos.  I suggest instituting some kind of "special PVP server training course" for blue server players who guide/GM on the PVP or PVP-teams servers.<P>* a faction system is good idea, but as it was previously implemented it is flawed.  Institute an aggressor/murderer flag system so that the aggressor in a mortal struggle can be dealt with without faction hits for those who put him down. Also, change the faction hits so that they affect religion instead of race.  A human paladin shouldn't lose faction with human paladin NPCs for killing a human necromancer.  This scenario was the case in the old faction hit system.  <P>* increase the threshold for Z-axis position updates on the PVP servers.  Even increased as they are, running over hilly terrain still causes the "run in circles" bit, or charging up a steep hill or levitating off of it makes a caster impossible to follow (and invisible to those below) while he can then cast with impugnity upon his target.<P>* even the slightest amount of latency makes melee characters completely unable to attack moving characters.  This problem stems from the fact that autoattack is checked at both the server and client end.  a moving player will be seen a few feet behind where the server thinks he is, so if you attack where he seems to be you get the "Your target is out of range" message from the server. However, if you then move ahead to where the server would think he is positioned, your client overrides with its position checking saying "you can't see your target from here."  Change over positional checking for melee attack to the client or move "see your target" verification to the server. Either would fix this.<P>* currently, players cannot cast on mobs they "cannot see" to keep them from casting from safety on the other side of a wall.  This is good, but it stops short. It needs to be applied to player targets as well.  Currently a player can be cast on regardless of whether he is on the other side of a wall or not, provided he is in range of the spell.  This should be addressed.<P>* rights looting a slain player should be given to only the person/group who killed him, just like with NPCs.<P>That's all I can think of at the moment, but I'm sure others will post their concerns as well. Thanks again.<BR>AJ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. Melee's have a serious problem hitting people on the run. Though they may see on their comptuer they are right next to their victim, LAG makes them miss. You need to increase the melee range on melee's against pvp'rs. You also need to increase the cone of influence (the visual cone you need to have on your screen to hit that person,) else casters can dance around melee's and the melee can't hit them.<P>2. Do NOT make items in bag lootable. You will run into a problem where melee's can be disarmed and their weapons looted, or they stand to lose their backup weapons (like their 2h'r when they using their 1h'r).<P>3. REMOVE the artificial LEVEL difference bonus when spells are resisted against. What I mean is that Casters 4 levels higher then you get a BONUS against your resists. Example, a level 60 wizard will do full damage more often vs a level 56 necro, then level 60 necro with the same resist gear. While Verant finds it useful against monsters, it DOES NOT work well in pvp.<P>4.

</FONT><HR>where to begin?!<P>well to begin with I play on rallos this is where my concern and point of view are coming from.<P>Ok first off a list of official PvP rules!<BR>the rules on what is acceptable to one GM is an exploit to another, put something down on paper (and the website) please. it will help GMs by hopefully reducing petitions and help players by actually knowing the rules!<P>Now on to mechanics<P>1. AE spells and attacking your own pet.. I dont understand why you can attack your own pet on PvP, reasons for this are? secondly AE spells make them not harm your group and group mates pets.<P>2. Line of sight, again I don't understand why you can target someone in a bank run up a few floors above them and unload, if you tried this on a NPC you could not see your target so why is no LoS required for PvP? this is just one example there are many other problems with LoS as well such as being in a dungeon casting AE's on a group engaged with mobs in another room while not having to worry about aggroing NPCs because you can not see target(NPC) however you hit the PCs, who can not if they are melee have a chance to hit you back..<P>3. Loot is broken everybody knows this, (however i believe it is getting less broken with all the available no drop for melees) <BR>Nobody likes getting an item taken be it their patchwork tunic or their GEboots, but if the only solution is coin only then PLEASE NO! there must be some consequence to death and that consequence is a large part of what makes the pvp fun and exciting.<P>4. OK this is a wishlist sure its not gonna change but as an enchanter as my main and in the mid 50s I am almost helpless as everybody has 150+MR but suppose i do get an Mez on somebody who has just attacked me.. I keep them enthralled while i steal all their mana and am going in for the kill.. well while i had them Mezed they are sending tells for help, bagging all their equipment, and meditating! how can you do this if you are stunned? so no sitting while stuned this includes all mezes and WTYH line.. <P>bah i could go on forever with problems enchanters face in Pvp like charming (mobs) but i work around it as I have all other problems.. but please fix AE and put up rules, i dont think it's so much to ask<P>Thank you for reading this<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I honestly think a larger GM presence on the PvP servers would greatly reduce the exploitations and such.<P>My own personal want is to have more GM's available and online.  I understand that it may be difficult to get GM's for Rallos as there are SO many complaints and petitions.  But I truely believe this would alleviate a lot of the problems we now face.<P>I also think we need a more concise and clear rule set for PvP servers.  One that is VERY clear as to what you CANNOT do on the PvP servers.<P>This coupled with a more prominent GM presence would really help.  Ayup, I do believe that these are the most needed things on Rallos.<P>I understand that other players have many other issues and for the most part would like the ability to take a /movelog.  Maybe you should allow those playes to move along?  It would make them happy and allow them to enjoy the game, as the seem to no longer enjoy their gaming experience now.<P>Thanks for opening up hte discussions Absor, much appreciated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with a lot of the points people raised so far, and with regard to VZ people really should solve the immortal healing problem, and should change the teams, since the former 4 teams are now pretty much reduced to lights vs darks.<P>I would also like to point out that all the problems that people associate with RZ (Zone ganking, modem pulling, portal camping, grif pk'ing, delevelled players, 6 on 1 gankings) are all a consequence of item loot.  None of the above things are particulary fun to do for the ganker, most pk'ers enjoy a good fight a lot more than they enjoy killing someone who zones, but they know they have better chance of getting loot by attacking someone unprepared or in an unfair way, rather than getting a good fight (which is very rare, as most people are either naked and then fight to the death, or clothed and then gate/bag and die) which is almost impossible under the current ruleset, since there is too much to lose.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick one.  <BR>what I'm about to say sounds extream but please try it on the live server before you think I'm lying about it.<BR>High level PVP for Enc. requires us to Tash and  recant magic twice before our spells would have a slight chance to stick on a blue con.  MR for high level tanks are way too high for Enchanters to do anything.  With rogues doing 1k damage or more with 1 backstab, It's really not PVP anymore.  I've seen a 60 rogue(cuick) kill a 60 wiz(quantumphish) in 1 BS and the wiz wasn't even sitting down.  We only have magic based attacks and we are usually bait when it comes to PVP.  Aside from tash, I can't think of a spell that will stick on a even con player at 50+.  PVP at high level is a "melee only" concept.  Please look into how MR is scaled in PVE vs PVP.  Eventhough I don't think there is anything that can be done because EQ is designed for PVE, I still appreciate that you listen so when the nerf stick is whipped out the next time, you would have some considerations as to what you are doing to us minorities<P>Psyclum Stormwielder (Enc) 54<BR>Psyclume (Wiz) 47<BR>Psyclim (brd) 35 <BR>Psycle (mnk) 18</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't PvP much, just kill the odd Darkenbaner that assaults me (or gate) but here are my opinions:<P>1- PvE spells: Give us people who play the PvE game a switch to toggle on/off our AE spells so they don't affect players, because since they hit group members so are COMPLETELY unusable in PvE encounters, giving some classes such as mages, wizards, druids a disadvantage compared to blue servers.<P>2- Enforce the policies such as no portal camping, bank camping, corpse camping. It happens all the time, yet there is NOTHING that can be done, because by the time your petition gets up the queue, the person corpse camping you is long gone.<P>Aurore Akengro<BR>~Seekers of Divinity~<BR>RallosZek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Issues and possible fixes. Not all may be appropriate and I'm not sure which ones I would have, but they are just ideas that I think may help. <P>1. No level loss. Delevelers are a problem.<P>2. Make zones and portals safe areas. Port/zone  camping is an issue. Also make players safe for a minute after dying OR gating, from players only.<P>3. Change conning system for players only. Mobs can stay as is, but any blue cons should be in range and any red cons should be out of range.<P>4. Permanent guild tags. Im tired of doing 15 guildstat's every 5 minutes.<P>5. Maybe a faction system, as long as there is an aggressor flag. <P>6. 51% damage rule. may cause more grief players but there are already a ton that just snare you when you run from a mob. At least they wouldnt be able to loot you if they just saw you low and nuked once.<P>7. ENFORCE RULES AND THE PNP. GM's do NOTHING currently about any rule breaking or exploiting<P>8. Might have to go coin only. Hours of camping for items just to have them taken is irritating. Items drastically affect your performance so you need them.<P>9. Maybe instead of coin only, you can either do quests to change items into no drop, or you can tag 1 item no drop for every 5 levels. So at level 60, you can tag 12 items no drop.  6 at 30 and so on. <P>10. Implement a /bag command, where all worn items drop into bags as long as you have room available.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How to fix "delevelers":<P>I have been part of the management of a pk based MUD, there are easy ways to program fixes for delevelers.<P>Quite simply right now damage is based on your skill in that area, for example backstab is based on the skill of around 100 (if maxed) for a level 20 character.  If that person delevels down to level 10, they still have a skill of 100 in backstab, therefore they are still having their damage output based on their skill of 100.<P>Fix option 1:<BR>Make it so that when you lose a level you automatically go back to the max skill level for the new level.  For example if I am level 15 with a 1hs skill of 75, I die, lose a level, drop my 1hs skill to 70.  If clerics can't use their spells for level 15 if they are level 14, why should warriors be able to use their level 15 skills at level 14?  If in the above example, my 1hs skill was 50, I drop to level 14, my 1hs skill would remain at 50.<P>Fix option 2: (preferred IMHO)<BR>Have the damage calculation tables provide a simple "if" statement when determining damage output.  IF skill&gt;max_skill_at_level, then damage=max_skill_at_level * modifier, ELSE damage=skill * modifier.  I do not believe this would be that difficult to implement.<P>Aalavar refuses to play PvP servers until this is fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail Absor,<P>Thanks for taking an interest.  There was a thread several weeks ago requesting a new GvNvE, Diety Based, Team PvP server.  You might want to check into it, if it is still on the board.  It went for about three thread splits.  Lotta good info on it, concerning PvP.<P>On the teams servers:<P>1. Crossteam immortal healing and buffing against members off your own team, during PvP.  Stop this.  Itis, in my opinion an exploit of the server machanics.  It allows a player to inderictly do damage to thier own team without, any risk of repraisal.  Very frustrating.<P>2.  Zone control.  The Teams server PvP has become to a great exent, a fight for who stays in a zone and who has to leave.  Either code in extended ressurection, torpor effects that last for an hour or make the Loot and Scoot player rule official VI policy.  Effects or Policy to be affect players level 6 and higher.<P>3.  Give the GM staff a definite set of rules for PvP play.  Guide Fleschette on Vallon has a good grasp of how play should be handled.  Currently CSR personnell will differing answers to the same question.  Some even give answers that apply to the blue servers only and are disregarded in PvP, according to the PnP itself.<P>4.  Keep the 8 level limit on the team server or expand it as levels increase.  Group PvP demands that a broader range of levels be engaged when fighting PvP.<P>5. Item loot.  Inventory slots only, including containers.  Item looting that includes equipped items favors the casting classes when, weighing the risk vs reward in PvP.  Protecting the equipped items of players, balances this.  Allowing inventory slots to be looted adds a greater reward/risk and will bring back some of the feel that Vallon lost when, it was changed to coin only.<P>Class specific:<P>1.  Prevent the "Hide" skill from being defeated by the "See Invisible" spell.  It is one of the difining skills of the rogue.  In PvP the Hide/Evade skills are almost worthless.<P>Have more but, I gotta run.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>   i'm really glad to see you're giving some attention to PvP issues.  I play a very happy gnomish rogue on rallos zek.. level 31 at the moment.  I'm quite happy with pvp.. now that i've advanced a little.  In the lower levels the advantage is very highly on the casters.. but it seems to now be shifting.  As a rogue i have no problem dealing with casting pks... and i have no problem pking casters.  There are a few issues, howerver, that would balance the low and high level game out a little more.<BR>-<BR>They are.. as follows:<BR>-<BR>1) bring back egg-shaped pumice to vendors. golem wands are a pain in the butt to camp.<BR>-<BR>2) make it so that if 51% or more of a player charachter's life bar was taken away by an NPC rather than a PC... nobody gets to loot.  This would prevent people from "ganking".. but it would keep group pvp in tact.  (i don't mean that 51% or more has to be done by one PC.. but by any number of PC's.. not sure if this would be hard to code or not)<BR>-<BR>3) pvp servers deserve MORE *competent* gms than the pve servers... not less. Enforce rules such as loot and scoot.. no spire/zone/bank camping.. and no bind rushing (die.. spawn.. run back.. kill the person who killed you).. on all of the pvp servers.  If someone is found violating these rules.. give them an un-removable debuff that lasts for a month of EQ time.. and lowers all stats by (their level + 1). (or just plop a big fat juicy warning on their account and summon them to jail for a while).<BR>-<BR>4) this is kind of a wish list thing.. but restore pickpocketing versus player charachters to rogues.

</FONT><HR>Hi,<P>There has been alot of talk of dropping item loot on Rallos Zek.  I am favor of coin only or would like to items that are tradable but not lootable.  I mean make most things NO LOOT.<P>I understand that this would piss alot of ppl off.  I would lke to suggest that a new type of item be introduced in to the game, a HOLY GRAIL, if you will.  An item that is lootable and sought after.  It would be cool if these items bonused and entire team or guild.  They should be trackable and about as rare as quest items.  It would give something for ppl to kill over and hopefully put an end to the killing for profit mindset that exists on Rallos Zek.<P>~Ioness<BR>Necro of Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have read this entire board. The two suggestions I have seen that I like the most:<P>1) Make anyone in your level range con white (oh boy this would add some spice to the encounters, plus it would give you even more reason to be paranod about letting other people know your level. And just think about the meta-games you could play trying too fool people. Gotta love it)<P>2) Doing something about delevelers...I like keeping them at their highest PvP attained range.<P><BR>This fixes alot of the problems, and adds something to the gameplay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All About Loot<P>Item loot is only good policy if it presents equal risk to all, and is free from exploitation.  There are just too many opportunistic ways to take someone's item with zero risk to yourself.  Do I really need to list them?  Well, okay here's a few.<P>Find someone low on health.<BR>Attack while bagged.<BR>Camp a zone or portal.<BR>Attack in a large group.<BR>Exploit line of sight issues.<BR>Ninja loot a player who was killed by another player.<P>Okay, maybe the above would be okay if there was a way for the victim to get retribution.  For the victim to strike back using the above tactics and get their item back... but stolen goods are always bagged, so there is never retribution.<P>Unless you can fix all of the above and more, item loot just isn't a viable option.  If you want to fix all of the above that's great!  But, somehow I doubt it....  As it exists, item loot has no place except for those who fight using the above tactics.<P>~Inkantra<BR>40th Enchanter of Rallos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all I'll comment on Item loot vs Coin loot.  I dislike the idea of coin loot, not because I'm greedy for loot, but because no one cares about dying unless they lose something, whether that be experience, or gear.  Yes, you argue they will lose money, but how many people actually care about money?  And how often is the money you carry around enough to make you mad enough at the person to want revenge?  Its completely useless to kill a person who comes back over and over again and doesn't care in the slightest if they die (*cough* Reefman *cough*)  Who will suicide, and /q out to get the dmg bonus and cause exp to others.  They have nothing to lose, and can be completely effective WITH FULL GEAR.  It is bad enough with all the no drop floating around from planes. (Discussed in more detail down)  Thats my opinion on coin loot, flame all you want, but thats how it is.<P>Problems:<P>1) Portal ganking:  Guilds who participate in this sort of action are normally of the PK variety, however if an anti-pk guild sees pks port in, they will also take part in this time honored favorite exploit of RZers everywhere.<P>Solution: Give players a 5 second invulnurability period after zoning, or porting into a zone.  Making it impossible for say 5 Draughts of Fire to hit before a person even comes into screen, sup Maule, Teef, Genaside, Kityara, Apak, and Wiqid.<P>2) No drop gear: For players with full no drop, they remain at 90% efficiency with absolutely no risk to themselves.  Most of the 50+ population you will find, stay in complete no drop unless DEEP inside a dungeon.  They will go around trying to kill people with full droppable PvP gear, while themselves wear nothing except no drop, even though the people they are fighting are much better resists, the outnumbered opponent will lose, if it be the person wearing full droppable gear, he losses an item, if it be the person wearing all no drop, he loses nothing but his coin, and comes back to loot his corpse, med, or in the case of melees, fight again.  Absolutely nothing for them to lose when they die, and thus they pull out all the stops.<P>Solution: Make all gear on RZ servers, except for epics, droppable.  Possibly leave Plane of Sky gear no-drop as well.  Hate\Fear\Growth needs to be all switched to droppable.  There is one other solution to this problem, which will be covered in the part about resistances vs the 66% dmg DDs.<P>3)AE spells on all PvP servers are useless because they effect players, regardless of if they are grouped with you or not.  This makes AE spells COMPLETELY useless in all events, and dungeons, although they are effective for Quad kiting, and PvP.  It would be nice to be able to use these spells for what they were meant for.  <P>Solution: Make a PvP switch.  /pvp on, /pvp off.  /pvp on, will make spells work as normal on PvP servers, i.e. everyone NPC or PC gets hit.  /pvp off will work like any blue server, all NPC get hit, no PC get hit.  Whether /pvp switch is on or off, you will still be able to be hit by PC players with their /pvp on.  I suggest this over the solution stated earlier in this thread because in large scale events in velious, kunark or planes, you never have just 1 group, or even just 2 groups.  Thus you would still never use the AE spells in events.  This solution however fixes the entire mess and makes area effects completely usable on the PvP servers.  This also minamizes problems of people hitting their friends accidently at events because of lag and such.<P>okay balance stuff now<P>1) DD spells do 66% dmg of PvE in PvP.  <BR>for example:<P>Ice comet does 1120 PvE dmg, for 400 mana with instant effect with a 6 second casting time.<P>It does 739 dmg PvP, for 400 mana, with instant effect after a 6 second casting time.<P>Remedy heals 438 HP with a 3 second casting time for 175 mana.  <P>Do the math here folks, for every Ice comet a wizard casts, a cleric can completely heal himself + more, when Ice comet is not resisted at all.<BR>Lets check druid PvP ability<BR>Chloroplast, heals for 428 3 second casting time for 175 mana.<BR>Again same situation as with cleric heal, although this spell is 55, druids still have superior healing, which still will out heal Ice comet, or any other wizard spell in PvP.  Not that they shouldn't be able to, but with this kind of healing power why should there be a 66% dmg nerf on DD spells in PvP? (I purposly used the most POWERFULL DD in the game when doing these calculations, because even when completely unresisted it is still very useless against any type of healing class)  Shaman have similar healing spells.  Paladins have LoH.  Ranger have weak healing spells so I won't count them.  This means 4/14 classes has the ability to OUTHEAL a wizards best DD spell in PVP, even when the spell is not resisted at all WHICH happens 1/30 times against any player with decent resists.<P>Solution: take off the 66% dmg reduction on DD spells for PvP.  The reason that these classes have become so powerful for healing purposes is because of the new uber kunark mobs that call for more healing power.  Wizards are completely out gunned, as are enchanters, and mages when it comes to this sort of healing power.<P>2)DoTs vs DD spells in PvP<BR>Once again <BR>Ice comet 729 dmg, in 6 seconds if unresisted <P>(which as stated before rarely is completely unresisted, where most cold resists are always buffed above 100, making Ice comet actually on average do about 100 dmg, my own cold resist is actually 167 with self buffs only, druids sometiems have over 200 in cold\fire as do shamans\clerics and various other classes that may be buffed by classes with the resist line of spells)<P>Now we get to complete unbalance<BR>Druid DoT winged death: 1287 dmg pvp (no nerf on DoTs) 5 second casting time.  Do the math guys, thats 24 damage a second, for 54 seconds.  This goes straight through skin spells. (i.e. mana skin\rune wont stop this badboy) Now can you guess what a druid's favorite tactic is to use with this spell? DoT and run...  They winged death you, cast soc on themselves and run for the hills.  you can chase after them, or die at your bind point, its your choice really.  If they stay and fight, they still have that DoT on you, and their 54 DD 454 dmg in 2.5 seconds. (more dmg and faster then level 51 draught and less resistable in my experience)  This total damage out put in PvP maxed for a druid in a given PvP encounter is HUGE!.  FYI Winged death will kill any pure caster by itself if left alone, and is completely unresistable with a very long range.  <P>Splurt is much the same story doing 1100 full dmg in PvP, this is death for almost any caster, not to mention the necro gets the life back.<P>Suggestion: Either a) make Winged death and splurt resistable or b) reduce dmg in PvP on these spells.  And btw druids with WD and Chloroplast + their superior resistances and a DD spell that easily rivals wizard's for best DD IS CRAZY in PvP.  Druids before this patch were nuts, with chloroplast they are going to be the undesputed GODS of PvP.<P>3) Melee resistances seem WAY too high.  I heard something about extra resistances melee's recieve for PvP, but I'm not sure if this is true, or it just seems that way because they have more HP?  50+ it is crazy to have this kind of resist for melees, wizards can't even take down a melee using full lures.  <BR>suggestion: remove the resist, if any from melee classes.<P>4)Resistances on 50+ spells don't seem to check right for classes under 1500 HP.  I have my fire resist up to 210 (with resist fire) and scoraie still does 2 bubs of damage 9/10 times. (me with 990 HP)which is about full damage.  But when mana skin is up, (591 absorb) it seems to take 5 scoraie's on average to take it down.  I have checked this multiple times with druid friends, in preperation for this post.  Mana skin (591 abosorb) seems to eat 5 scoraie's on average before going down with 164 fire resist.  On average that is 118 dmg per scoraie when Mana skin is up.  However doing 10 scoraie's 9 out of 10 scoraie's hit for more then 118 dmg, 6 our of the 10 scoraie's hit for more then 200dmg, 5 hit for more then 300, and 4 hit for max damage.  I then tried the experiment with Draught of fire. (458 pvp)  This time it took 8 draughts of fire to take down mana skin, we then figured fluke, and tried it again to find that it took 7 draughts to take down mana skin.  Then without mana skin draught seemed to be more susceptible to resists.  hitting for 300 dmg for average without mana skin, with only 1 hitting for full dmg.  Could there be some sort of weird bug?  I am consistantly seeing scoraie, and other DD take FOREVER to eat through my mana skin, but then take me down with 3 times the dmg without it.  Please explain this.  Also then we tried buffing a warrior with 210 fire resist.  We found 6/10 times Draught of fire would hit for 100-200 and 3/10 would hit for 200-300, and 1/10 would hit for 300-454max.  Scoraie was used with similar results.  Where as listed before draught of fire hits a wizard with 990 HP and 210 resistances for an average of 300.  For reference the wizard used was 52, druid was 54, and warrior was 51.<P>solution: give all non-melee excluding rogue a HP buff when calculating saves, or take it out of the equation all together, if this isn't a bug, it should be fixed anyways.  Please tell me how this is calculated so we can find why this happens.<P>4) necro dot drains<BR>Splurt and spells like it, even when dispelled, continue to give the necros health<P>solution: if splurt is dispelled on a player, the necro stops receving health.  This hurts a lot in PvP, when a necro just chain casts these type of spells and still gain health for each one.<P>5)melees cant hit casters running around casting for crap.  Lag, hills, levitate are contributing factors to this problem.<P>Solution: Give melees a bind target where they will follow that target around easier.  Also slightly increase melee range in PvP.<P>6)Enchanters can't mez hardly anyone anymore because of the High MR used at 50+ levels, even with tashani on the player mez will still only hold 5/10 times.  Similar problem with root.<P>solution: make all magic based spells slightly less resistable.  Stuns\mez\root\magic all or nothing DD  just do NOT work ever.<P>Well I think i covered it all.  If i left out anything feel free to e-mail me at Sysop182@hotmail.com<BR>or go post at the begotten public board www.thebegotten.com<P>So far I think this has been the first post to really cover all the unbalances specifically on the pvp servers.  <P>As you may have noticed I used a wizard to compare to most of the other classes in the DD section, not because I feel wizards are the weakest of any class in PvP.  But because they have the most mana efficienty DD spells, and I was showing how much the 66% dmg cap in PvP has thrown the favor to the other direction 50+, on the other hand in pre-50 levels things should be left as they are, but post-50 things are COMPLETELY messed up.<P>Please read, comment, and please do not flame my opinion as I have not flamed yours.<P>Arkons Arenstaad<BR>Recruit of The Begotten<BR>52 wizard of Rallos Zek<P>Thanks to:<BR>Borrso and Kerek for helping me test some of this stuff <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First, I would like to say thank you for opening this topic up once again.  I would highly recommend perusing some of the previous discussion threads initiated by Abashi for some ideas that we may miss here.<P>Note that I play solely on RZ so my perspective comes from that of free-for-all open loot environment, some of my comments may or may not be applicable to TZ/VZ and I do not presume to speak for those servers' issues as they may very well be different (but some things will undoubtedly be the same).<P>Points and suggestions:<P>a) Please either create a ffa pvp split server that is coin only (and let players from all three current PvP servers move to it via /movelog) or allow moves to a blue split server.  The imbalances in PvP, especially at high levels combined with the rarity and costliness of good gear as you progress is an unaddressable issue.  I don't propose ruining the game for those who enjoy a loot environment but I (and many others) would prefer to move.  Please at least consider it.<P>b) AoE spells are relatively useless in PvE.  Many good strategies developed on blue servers are absolutely useless on RZ and AE spells are left largely neglected (unless one is raining a group of PC's =).  This can be a tough one to fix but merits attention.<P>c) Con system changes.  The con system should be changed for PC cons to green if they are lower than your range, white/black for in range and red for higher than range.<P>d) Delevelling is certainly an issue, not one that I have dealt with but I'm hearing more and more complaints in the newbie zones.  The problem is that higher level characters are purposely delevelling so they can use their advanced skills to slay newbies.  The hard cap for skills isn't enforced if the player already has a skill over that level.<P>e) Clearly defined rules.  It has been 2 years almost and there is still confusion/debate about what is or is not legal in the PvP environment.  There are no rules posted to clearly spell out what is allowable.  Some starter points (certainly NOT an exhaustive list): Portal Camping, Zone Camping, Bind Point Camping, Killing in Banks, Making creative use of Guard aggro ranges, repeatedly killing someone, etc.<P>f) In tandem with (e) there needs to be strict enforcement of the rules.  There are guilds on RZ (one in particular) that is well noted for training mobs on people, finding their bind point and rooting them as they pop with mobs trained there as well to purposely cause exp loss.  There is absolutely no reason why these people are still in the game.  I'm sure training is a problem on blue servers as well but at least the trainer cannot root you to prevent you from fleeing.<P>g) PvP death penalties.  On RZ, other than item loss (no risk of that when you pvp nekked) there is no downside to coming back again and again to harass an individual or group of individuals.  Either make the PvP death penalty somewhat severe (say 30 minute res effects) or encode in rules what constitutes harassment versus pvp.  (For instance if you're trying to drive a group out of a zone and they kill you, you don't get to keep coming back and trying until they simply leave out of exasperation).<P>h) high level spells with low resists are unbalanced.  The wizard Lure line, Necro lifetap/bond series, etc are great for pve but horridly mess up pvp balance.  I would suggest making PC's resist all of these "low resist" lines at a significantly higher percentage (but still less than other similar lines of spells to at least make them preferable).<P>i) Barring (a) perhaps change the loot system.  This is a snakepit item however with spirited and worthy arguments on both sides.<P>j) Add more purpose to PvP by integrating it into quests, server events and the like.  I remember an event in SK a while back that did this and was a great deal of fun -- there haven't been many of them like this.<P>Many of these ideas require no technical work, I'm positive I've missed some technical changes that have been on my list (I'm typing from memory) and will post again if I recall.<P>Thank you again,<P>  Rafinne - 59th Defiler<BR>  Gubbwin - 51st Druid<BR>  Stephans - 36 Ranger<BR>  Resplendent - 23 Wizard<BR>  Corellone - 23 Paladin<BR>  Qintano - 23 Monk<BR>  Liffe - 22 Warrior<BR>  Satyr - 17 Cleric<BR>                  Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First I want to say I really enjoy PvP on Rallos Zek.<P>PvP in EQ is in my oppinion quite awesome but only if you play it like you do PvE... In a GROUP!<P>The main issues I have are with melee pvp<P>1) warping still is deadly to melees, any zone with hills and steep inclines is a insta target area to run to for casters because everyone knows warping occurs and they can cast on the melee in safety.<P>2) Range of mellee weapons seems to be very short, so short that with 300 ping I have to be AHEAD of my target (cant see them have to guess where they will be) by about .3 seconds to even get a chance at hitting a running opponent, needless to say this is totaly impractical since this is first person and running ahead of your opponent(right on them on server but lag makes it so your ahead of them on your screen) is not a good thing when they stop to cast. Perhaps increase the range so that if I had 300 ping(seems average ping?) that on my screen if Im right on someone I can hit them?<P>3) LOS would be nice to make it so spells land on players the same as they do mobs(offense ones anyway) Im guessing they arent LOS and you can nuke/dot thru walls because on blue servers people wanted to be able to heal players behind walls or anyone in range.. if it was possible to make offense spells affect players the same as mobs this would be a good thing I think.<P>4) Too much no drop on these servers. No drop is the same as coin only, honestly anyone that spent the time to go to events and get loaded in no drop risks little to nothing in PvP while their opponents most often risk.. isnt having better gear a good enough advantage? remove no drop tags from most things.<P>Those are my issues.. Primarily the weapon range vs other players is just so small that even 300 ping lag makes melee a non-threat to anyones life.<P>Coan DragonClaw 53rd Monk on Rallos<BR>Phreeze 49 Wizzie on Rallos<BR>Canticle 49 Bard on Rallos<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>At last, an official PvP thread.<P>Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm impressed with the quality of the discussion so far - much more civilised than on threads of this sort in the past.<P>Anyway, here are my thoughts from the perpective of a 50 necro on Rallos who has played there since release.<P>Loot rules:<BR>As has been pointed out already, item loot causes all sorts of problems on Rallos. It's really just a symptom, however. If PvP wasn't so imbalanced, if there was actual risk involved for all parties involved in a typical PvP encounter, there wouldn't be so much of a problem. As it stands, however, it is far too easy to be caught in a bad spot and ganked. You lose your best item before you even know what has happened. <P>This is not fun, except for the gankers. The gankee has just had several hours (possibly days) of time stolen from him - the time it took to get the item in the first place, and the time it will take to replace.<P>Something needs to be done about item loot. Either change it in some way (either go coin-only and remove the main element of risk, or some other option which retains risk, but levels the playing field), or properly balance PvP so that with the current item loot rules everyone has a fair chance to survive a gank attempt.<P>On a related topic, the current way that loot rights are awarded is untenable. As it stands now, I can suffer 99% damage to PvE, but if a PK whacks me for the remaining 1% of my life he gets to loot. This is unfair, and should be fixed. <P>Perhaps if you die to PvP damage and they didn't take 51% or more of your life your corpse is unlootable?<P>Other comments on mechanics:<P>AE spells: useless on Rallos, as pets and party members are affected by them. <P>Solution: make party members and their pets immune to AE spells.<P>Pets: pets in PvP will defend themselves if attacked by their masters. They also cease to be pets, so they don't obey /pet commands anymore. This is not so on blue servers, why is it this way on PvP? This makes it suicide for any pet caster to use an AE spell near his or her pet, as it will cause the pet to rebel.<P>Portal camping/zone camping: even though this is expressly forbidden, it's also common practice. This is especially bad outside dungeons, as folks will zone out in full gear and low on health. Boom, one cast, thanks for the SMR. <P>Solution: make players immune to PvP for a set time after they zone or make a no-PvP zone around druid/wiz rings and zone lines so that you're safe there.<P>Perhaps implement a "in pvp mode" flag that will turn on if you attack/are attacked by another player which would not allow you to exploit these safe areas. This flag would reset when either you or the other player died, or after a certain time had elapsed.<P>Faction: there was a poorly conceived faction system implemented on RZ some time ago, and it was removed. The reasoning was good, the implementation wasn't. The problem is that there needs to be consequences for PKing. Faction would work well here, if implemented properly. The problem is that there is no way in the game to judge intent - the game doesn't know if I'm killing someone because I want that shiny new breastplate they're wearing, or because I'm defending my friend, or because I'm revenge killing them. If there was a way to help determine intent, faction hits would be great (or some other punishment). This is especially important for same-race PKs.<P>Duels: in a consentual, formal duel guards will attack the players if they like either of them (or both). Guards should not interfere with duels.<P>Newbie PKs: someone posted a little while back saying that newbies should not be PvP+ until level 5 or so. I think this is a great idea - it would cut down on the tourists from the blue servers who come along to kill people just for the hell of it on the Zeks, and would make the first few levels at least bearable. Levels 1-5 are when you will be PKed most in your life, I imagine.<P>Movelog: if nothing else can be done, at least give the players an option to get off Rallos. Many people have quit because it's just too stressful for them to play there, and they don't have fun. Rallos used to be different, there usen't to be so many griefers, there was more roleplaying. Things have changed drastically since then, and especially at the high level game, PvP is severely imbalanced, and the penalties for death are extreme. <P>Just my .02.<P>Mantik Boneweaver, 50 necro, Rallos Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please leave PvP alone. PvE class whining for two months ended up in clerics getting nerfed and mages getting 1-2 bug fixes. Leave PvP as is. Yes it is broken, but there are no quick half-baked fixes that VI can do improve it and VI will not commit itself to anything serious. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay two more things<BR>I want to throw my support in the way of making all it so when you con someone they either are blue\white\yellow (in range) or green\red out of range.  This will make it easier to find out who you can fight instead of dropping mana on them when you can't.<P>Also a loot and leave policy needs to be established for zone control.  When your group dies, you loot your corpses, and you leave the zone.  You do not, come back and train the group who killed you trying to do an event... sup sabbat?  you do not sit by your corpse and med, and refuse to loot and leave.  you loot, you leave, and the fight is done.  Come back later to fight again, but you loot for now and leave.  None of the BS with, that you need 30 min to med before you loot corpse or any of that.  You have safe passage to your corpse for the time you are looting and back to the zone line or the time it takes to gate, thats it.  IF you refuse to leave you are fair game.<P>Ummm don't bring back pre-nerf pumice, that was way too exploitable.<P><BR>And to sum up what I said about resistances.  <P>Damage on DD spells needs to be increased for 50+ to full 100% dmg in PvP.<P>Resistances against DD spells seem to be lower the less HP you have.  I.E.  A warrior with 2500 HP and 120FR will resist Draught of Fire better  then a wizard with 990 HP and 210 FR.  However with mana skin up the wizard seems to resist at the same rate as the warrior.<P>Question:<BR>How are Saves done... would HP effect so drastically as I am speaking of.  OR could this be an over looked effect of the 66% dmg rule.<P>Also if there is a melee bonus resist? which would explain this situation.  And if there is what is it based on, and would 50+ situation have drastically effected it?<P>Arkons Arenstaad</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>There are two problems that concern the Tallon Zek community (as evidenced by frequent posts on TZ Times).<P>The first is the Invulnerable Healing exploit.  Please note I am not talking about Out of Range Healing, since this is really an issue that can be resolved by bringing in others who are in range of the OOR healer and can then battle him.<P>Tallon Zek has historically been a Good vs Evil server.  The Human, Elf, and the Short team has been battling the Dark team without many problems.  Recently however, an uber-guild has formed on the server which accepts members of all four teams.  This has, how shall I put it, basically screwed over all the other guilds on the server as they are now completely powerless to compete with this uber-guild.  If for example, your guild, which consists of all Darks, tries to fight this uber-guild, they will be met with a force which includes Dark clerics.  Your guild will be defeated because they will be unable to touch the Dark clerics, which will stand back with impunity and heal all their comrades.  I have seen this guild in action, and let me tell you, they are truly unstoppable.  The only, the ONLY answer to this is to cross-team to fight them, in essence forsaking the entire server history and the charters for many a guild.  <P>Some have been proposing to hard code against buffing cross teams.  This would however destroy almost all Light guilds, who have historically been united in their struggle against the Dark team.  I support a hard coding, but only as it applies to the Good vs Evil concept.   Please make it impossible for the Dark team to cast beneficial spells on any of the other teams and vice versa.  This would restore the historical GvE style of play common to this server, and make skill, not the use of an exploit, as a measure of power.<P>The second issue is the dreaded Uber Guards.  Some time ago, all the newbie guards were uber-buffed and given insane resistances in order to prevent high level players from farming these guards and thus leaving newbies defenceless.  The motive behind this 'fix' was good, but the implementation has severely hurt PvP play.  The Guards now make it completely impossible to perform any sort of city raid.   They are also frequently trained at anyone on another team, with very disagreeable results.  Any one of these guards is probably very capable of taking on Naggy or Vox all by his lonesome.  I kid you not.<BR>I propose that in order to alleviate this, the guards be returned to their former pre-uber status, with the following modification:  make the guards like merchants - no loot and no exp.  This will eliminate any reason to farm them, but will allow city raids and PvP play in zones which are populated by such guards.<P>Thank you for reading this if you got this far  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059914&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059914&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
