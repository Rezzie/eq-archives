</FONT><HR>The issue of whether or not others should kill guards isn't up to anyone but Verant.  If they want it stopped, they'll make them like shopkeepers.  As it is, it's as close as you can come to laying siege on someone's city without getting wiped out by their innkeepers and bakers.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Numnayan<BR>44th Necromancer<BR>The War Council -- Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Why do you think guard killing is so wrong? I for one consider some guard killing as a major part of the game and a must because of the way Verant designed the game. I consider myself a Good (as in I fight evil) player and I have no problem killing some guards.<P><BR>Also there are many reason why people kill guards:<P>1) Exp Guard Killers - these are the most common guard killers. They do it for loot and exp. Nothing else, they will kill anything blue and higher to power level.<P>2) The Race Guard Killers - These are people that normally do not kill guards unless they are from a race that hates them alreay. Most players here are normally RPG players. But there are many that do it for the exp and loot too.<P>3) The Quest Guard Killers - These are people that have no other choice but to kill some named guard to complete a quest. Perfect example is the Soulfire Quest. Every Paladin that wishes to get his Holy Sword has to Kill Sir Lucan (The head of the Freeport Military). <P>4) Right to live Gurad Killers - These are the players in the game that have become KOS to the guards thur doing other quest. They may have no other choice but to kill a guard to stay alive in the game. Ex. Doing quest in Qeynos for the paldin guild or the cleric guild will put you KOS faster to the evil guards of Qeynos. <P>I am a guard killer and proud of it. I kill Troll, Orge and Dark Elf guards for reason 2 and I kill evil Freeport and Qeynos guards for reason 3. I am warmly to every other races guards in the lands. <P>I will fight evil wherever I find it. And for any of you Paladins on the Veeshan server that need help Killing Sir Lucan to complete your Soulfire quest. Just get me a tell and I will be more the happy to help you.<P><BR>Teggo Silvermist<BR>Druid of Karana<BR>Fellowship of Light<BR>Veeshan Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>XraX:<P>The Lost Order of Akalabeth has a code of conduct that prohibits guard killing in newbie areas.  The idea is that killing guards in newbie zones (such as the gnomes in Steamfont or the Ogre guards) negatively impacts the weakest players, and if consistenty done, is an offense that can get a player removed from the guild.<P>We recognize that there are certain times killing guards cannot be avoided, either to complete a quest or because you are KOS in a zone and are attacked.  These instances are understandable and don't affect your standing with the guild.  However, killing guards in low level zones simply for experience is considered bad form and hurts others, so is not tolerated.  We know others do it, and that's up to them, but it's not something we practice or allow of our members.<P>For more information on the Lost Order of Akalabeth (LOA), visit our website at www.lostorder.com<P>Levenlear<BR>Ranger of the 22nd Season<BR>Lost Order of Akalabeth<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>GreenChild99<P>While I applaud you for having such a code, at least it shows some RP initiative, I must disagree.  Lets say I am outside of Freeport blasting away at the guards.  Now lets say some little newbie has a train of rats and orc pawn after him and no guards to run to.  Now I can suddenly buff the newbie, heal him, etc. and he will GAIN experience where as a guard would just kill the MOBs and the newbie wouldn't get anything.  I think it is MORE beneficial to have players kill guards.  For one, the players killing the guards get good exp and loot (depending where you kill them at), second the newbie gets good loot (depending on what you leave on the corpse for them to take) and third the newbie gets experiece from MOBs when a person helps them rather then having the guards kill them and getting no experience.<P>Sorry, don't see how this is a "bad" thing, to kill guards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The main problem with that Kiron is that 99% of the ones killing the guards will simply sit there and watch the newbies get decimated by the mobs that the guards would have at least got off his/her back.  Not everyone helps the poor newbie runnin for his or her life.  I know, for I have died with my secondaries many times to that problem.  I personally never kill guards where I am not willing to aid the newbies I hurt in this way. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personally I don't guard kill unless I hear the shout "Affront to my senses, etc..."  Guard killing is the idiots tool to level.  I knew a wizzie that started killing guards at level 30 and made it to level 50.  Brought this wizzie down to LGuk where *perish the thought* there was a chance of dying (which did happen because this person had no inner party skills at all.)  Seriously think about it, why go to LGuk and be in this mess dungeon where you might die when you can fight Freeport guards at a zone line one at a time.  Where is the thrill in that?  The fun?  I guess if your pretty incompetant and lack the skills to be a benefit to a party, this is fine.  I just wish Verant would make the guards tougher.  Saw a level 2 newbie mowed down by Firebeetles at the Gate in freeport because there were no guards to help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>corax7:<P>Well, I don't know how it is on Veeshan (I play on Prexus and USED to play on Veeshan, I like to keep up with that is going on here cause I still have friends that play on Veeshan) but on Prexus, we have a sense of community.  People do not have guild envy.  If someone has a problem with someone else, it is an INDIVIDUAL problem and the whole guild does not get involved.  As a matter of fact, way back when, there WAS a inncident of a small guild of KSers (who were all 40 - 50) but they aren't a problem anymore since the people rallied against them.  Anyway, we have enough decency to stop and help out our fellow players no matter how low they are.  It is a shame some of the people on your server don't do the same.<P>discouraged1:<P>Well, I don't make it a practice of killing guards UNLESS it is for a roleplay event.  Such as, my friends or guild wants to attempt to raid a town.  The only times I really solo guards is when I can't find a group to get into.  Just because someone makes it a habit to solo guards, doesn't mean they have no "Grouping skills".  In your particular example that person obviously didn't have the skills.  I had a partner with me when I decided to kill guards.  Just me and him from level 30 to 35 and when he wasn't around I would go to Cazic or Sol B and find a group.<P>I guess the point is, just because someone kills guards doesn't mean THEY aren't having fun, just because it might not be for you.  It doesn't mean they don't necessarily have any grouping skills because of this ONE person's incident.  It doesn't mean they get no thrill or rush from taking on a guard by themselves, just because you don't get a thrill or rush.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Check out my Norrath's Most Wanted.<P>I thought about maybe an official &lt;Crime Stoppers&gt;, but that's redunant, it isn't going to stop so we just keep taking Cheezy pictures.<P>Levenlear, I would be intrested in joining the Lost Order of Akalabeth.  I agree that quests like Soulfire require Sir Lucan's testimony, but strictly poaching for experience gains alone strongly discouraged.  <P>What extremely bothers me, as I've posted before elsewhere, the guards simply PASS by as a BARD in North Freeport gets BLASTED repeatly.

I only kill evil guards, and for roleplaying and fun.
