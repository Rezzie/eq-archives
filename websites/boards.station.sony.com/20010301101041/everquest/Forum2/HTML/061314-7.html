I'm not sure who is more stupid and repulsive, the whiners who haven't even tried the changes to see their effects ( or lack there of ) or the idiots who are complaining because they have to change up some of their strategies!<P>I personally played around 30 hours this past weekend. Everywhere from Karnors to Cobalt Scar, to Lower Guk! I'm a hairs breathe from L53 now and I started Friday at just over 1 1/2 bubbles into 52! I BARELY noticed a thing. No heaps of dead clerics around me either! <P>This may very well have some of the hyper-ubber encounters but that won't affect 95% of the people who will ever play EQ and I don't think the intent is to make it impossible for the remaining 5%. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>to advisor<P>lol, i love the answere's blue names give sometimes. sure i am all for repairs but man you guys go overboard sometimes, if you have a tire that leaks do you over inflate it in hopes to go that extra block, no because the extra preasure makes it leak out faster and your still back to where you started, not much of a fix is it?<P>as for "broken this broken that" it does not matter what label you put after it "IT STILL IS A BROKEN ISSUE, DESIGN" as in game mechanics, game engine (for the pathing issue that seems to never gets glanced at)<P>as for other broken spells, how about a dot stacking with regen but not the other way around, sure there was a bug, so you try and fix it, imo its not fair to allow spell stacking one way and not another. oh how about if your a wolf and have levitate on remove wolf and cast sow, hmmm levitate drops, oh how about being in wolf form and hiding them wolf form drops and your quit hidding ? i could go on for hours of broken spells, pathing bla bla bla, but what does it do, it has been reported by me and thousands others and no words ever spoken about it. btw does the bug command even do anything ?<P>oh and i like the xp boost you put into some places, yet them places the greenies will not run anymore like they "DID" before the patch to them.(ie a 1-2 lvl green will not run but a blue will? lol thought you could sneak that by since alot of ppl never fought in these places) <BR>but i am starting to see how you work. "well will give you 25 but well be sure to take 50 back some other way" am i correct in this assumption? xp went up 15 % but the risk/downtime went up by 50 %<BR>looks like we are worse off than before<P>as for clerics healing goes, to much agro, you wanted to get rid of the manditory cleric status in groups , well all i have seen now is 2 cleric per group that wants to crawl anyplace instead of camp a room, why ? because if cleric falls your back to square one with a CR due for the group. how did this fix your problem to the spell and grouping issues ?<P>i am either stupid beyond reason or i am missing something, you state one thing to help the game then blast another thing full of holes and claim it was "not working as designed", bla bla bla, you can claim anything you want you designed the game, heck you can say anything you want about things broken in the game, but where does your loyalty get placed in situations like this?*snicker* guess we will wait and see if you prove us right again.<P>pause for a second and think about games, they are there to have fun/challenge right? but when soemone comes by and tells you to "PLAY ANOTHER WAY" is that fun? you think ppl play to have someone change the rules halfway threw the game, it has been tried in proffesional sports(and failed) but who says the changes stay or go? the ppl who pay to go see it or attend have the say not the all might person who made the change.<P>oh well, like alot of other game "flaws"(put your own label here since verant will make a orange an apple) i suspect this will fall short like many other attempt to get things fixed the RIGHT way, dont ask me what the correct way is, i just know if it was my game i would do a little more listening instead of preaching the way things i figure they should be.<P>i am not flaming no one, i am just not getting a clear picture of what verant wants from me, they seem to EXPECT to me enjoy the game no matter what they do, but its getting harder and harder and what i hate most is i have to agree to there terms without being able to read the fine print at the bottom that seems to be smudged pretty badly<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since Absor stated he and others at Verant are looking at these posts to see what is happening, let me be clear about what I have seen in the pre-50 game since the healing aggro changes. Let me also be clear about what the healing aggro conditions were like before as well. I am a 33 dwarven (thank Brell I have lots of hps) cleric and but for a few late heals, my party members live. At least they used to...<P>From levels 27-32 I was at the giant fortress in FM. Multiple pulls are more the rule there and I have learned that mobs attacking my group which were not engaged by a tank would attack me when I healed. Makes sense. If I healed too early in the fight (read: the puller left before being healed), then I would have all the mobs on me. Again, makes sense. After a couple of poundings, I learned to Enstill the extra mobs before I healed anyone. It worked. When it didn't, the tanks (warriors, monks mostly) were able to taunt the giants off me in a short time.<P>When I arrived in Dalnir, I was prepared to deal with multiple pulls and pops in the middle of fights or medding. My first two adventures into Dalnir were at the fountain on the second level and were very successful both in xps and loot. But that was before the patch so good luck getting me down there again...<P>My third time in Dalnir I was working with a monk at the entrance. After a fight, I cast a GHeal on him before he pulled our next contestant (Mr. Coerced Dward, COME ON DOWN!). A group of three next to us had been engaged with a mob which was below half of its health when I cast the healing spell. I was immediately attacked by it and with a 38 monk, paladin, druid, and enchanter pounding on its back, I tried to keep myself alive with heal which caused another mob to aggro on me. After uselessly typing, "/g peel!," I started trying to cast DBarrier but it took 4 tries to get if off between the hits against me. Even then, it took time for the mobs to be pulled off me even though they couldn't hit me and were being slaughterd by the chars behind them. That does not make sense.<P>I've read the following several times but the fundemental logic of this statement is essential to 'balancing' the clerical healing aggro or any taunt related calculation: any sentinent being will not focus on someone who is not causing direct damage to it over someone who is. Period. A RL Master swordsman (EQ skill 100+, right?) would instantly cut down any being foolish enough to leave itself open to an undefended attack like grass on a Saturday morning. No contest.<P>As I said in an earlier post, let the mobs come but give my fighters the appropriate bonuses for attacking a mob which is doing nothing to defend itself against them. Rogues develop the back stab skill to apply against an aware opponent but against one that is ignoring a rogue it would be nearly impossible for one to miss. And a warrior swinging away would be effectively reduced to a lumberjack if the mob ignores him and looks the other way. Even the NFL outlawed crack-back blocks b/c it took advantage of the fact the target was blind to the impending hit. Why are NPCs immune to them? Again, that does not make sense.<P>So, VI, the next time someone tells you the sub-50 game has not been adversley affected by the changes to a cleric's healing aggro, you tell them surf's up and the to hit the beach...<P>I will adapt and find a way for a cleric to survive in the EQ world such as it is today. However, I think the mechanics of EQ have worked out very well for the 300,000 people who have come to play. Maybe EQ would have been so hard from the beginning with this aggro level that it never would have been this successful. Maybe the current, aka 'original', version would have only attracted 50,000. I wonder if Sony would have come courting then...<P>+++<P>Absor says that we should trust them to do what is best for the game. I don't trust Absor, VI, or Sony to know what is best for the game any more than any one of the 300,000 players in EQ. Frankly, the 'we know best' stance reminds me a lot of the debates I used to have with DMs in D&D. A DM has a vision and if the players exceeded or circumvented that vision, the DMs didn't react for the player's benefit but to have them meet his expectations of their success or, more likely, failure. I see that happening here since the first player hit 60th eleven months early as has been reported.<P>There are a lot of ways to make EQ harder without re-writing the way the game is played. I fully support forcing chars to think of solution rather than handing them the Holy Hand Grenade to obliterate their foes. Further, I think VI has an obligation to pursue solutions to the mutual challenges faced by the both side to do better than sneaking in a change of this magnitude. I am suspect of any s/w distributor who says he did not test the repair of a piece of software that's been 'offline' for 2 years and fixes a basic mechanic. It's inappropriate to implement untested software into a live, production environment which adversely affects your customers. The implementor has the obligation to back out any changes which cause unexpected hardship on the client. But if I am understanding what I'm reading, there was no testing. That is disappointing. We are all waiting for VIs response now to a situation which its customers are clearly not happy and definately are not having as much fun as they were before. Hint Hint.<P>I hope this helps Absor and all others concerned that you have affected the game at many levels. And while you hold you team to hold the sanctity of EQ close to its heart, please understand that your customers hold their fun closer and we like EQ the way it was.<P><BR>Armeedoc Curesall<BR>33rd Dwarven Cleric<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to add my small voice (I never post here) that I think this cleric agro from healing change is aweful for gameplay.  Last night during a raid in Karl our clerics where afraid to even heal the tanks becuase that meant certain death (they where the first ones to die for a horrible change).  Yes the mobs were 55+ but we have done this area before and it was challenging as yeck but we where many and strong.  This nerf that takes out the clerics (and druids casting their new sup heal) much earlier is crippling.  Please realize that normal players are very upset about this change.<P>Thank you.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, the main point I see from the new postings is that people are trying to get Verant to admit they were wrong. Well, in actuality, they were right on this. They were, however, wrong BEFORE, when healing didnt agro. Alot of things go wrong when healing doesnt agro. This is where major Power Leveling comes into play. If you think about it, without this, you could have a hella high level character heal your butt a million times in order for you to take something way too high for you. With it set how it is now, as long as the healer is in your group, it shouldnt matter, since you are all in the fight. With clerics, they can wear heavy armor, so if you are in a group, your enemy should be about or a little above your level, so its not like hes gonna die before your group jumps in. Palys, same thing, heals, but good hp and attack. druids heal, but can blast the hell outa somethin if it agros. Its not the end of the world this way. It would upset the lazy clerics though, who healed in a group for 20 levels, that may have to defend themselves now, an never having taken a swing before, your offense must suck. The last line of defense is your mighty weapon, so dont let your mele slip just cuz you dont need it all the time. Bottom line, all things now should be even. Clerics will agro when they heal, so dont get in a group that is over your head! This will force you to play with a group your level, thus, evening things out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Suro, you made a very good point which i hadn't even thought of. Healing causes an AE Agro where as DD's/Taunt/Melle dmg, do not. So if you have more than 1 mob and all the tanks are hitting Mob 1 while Mob 2 is mezed then Mob 2 is getting REALLY PISSED at the cleric who is healing. When mez breaks the cleric is in deep crap. Ofcourse it get exponentialy worse with the more mobs you have.<P> How can you fix this? Either make healing not an AE agro or make ALL damage an AE agro, as well as taunts.<P> The problem gets ALOT worse if you are healing Tanks that are over 51. So i guess verant wants us all to pull single Mobs.<P> Maybe this was to fix the AE Stun/DD  to 15 mobs at once thing?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played a lot since the last patch.  I play a ranger, but have a good idea of what it takes and how the cleric class is played.  I agree that it did not make sence for mobs to ingnore a ch as much as they did.  However, EQ is 2 years old.  A change like this that makes such a huge impact on the players is uncalled for at this point.  This type of issue needs to be noticed and taken into acct in the next game VI develops.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This may have been stated already but i refuse to read through 5 pages of people complaining about changes that they have not tried.<P>Now first off my cleric is not the 50+. I do not have alot of experience playing this game. I've only had it 4 months. In that time i've gotten 3 characters up to 25+, Warrior, Mage and Cleric.<P>The big reason that people are complaining are because they don't like to lose days(my guess) of time trying to get that exp back that they lost from dieing.<P>Instead of looking at these encounters as new encounters after the changes they just run in and try the old tactics which has already been stated need to change. If there are no other tactics then please post them instead of stating getting hit for quad 850's and dieing. If that is truely the only tactic then VI should look at them but post what the encounter is, how can you fix something that you don't know what the problem is?<P>If you don't want to list the problems or don't want to take the time to die and test the new changes then don't complain that they need to be fixed. If your fed up with having to keep changing your tactics and are looking for a game that never changes then i suggest you play another game because this game "Everquest" made by "VI" is going to be ever changing for the better or for the worse. I for one like that idea. I like the idea that it the mobs are changing because i've been playing games ever since i was 4 years old whether it be Atari to Arcade games and i can tell you, after you figure out the "Tricks" of the game it becomes boring and you stop playing it. Why, because it's no longer a challenge.<P>I'm assuming since i'm getting into the last of this discussion that this post will be missed by most of the people out there and i encourge that if this post makes since to anyone thats out there to repost it as much as you want anywhere that you can.<P>Just keep in mind a couple of things before flaming to high heck and back people whether there people that have complaints about the changes or ones that don't have a problem with them:<P>1. Some people have been playing this game for a long time and don't like to try changes or lose exp to trying new things or having to relearn things. Why should they, they've paid there dues in learning it the first time.<P>2. The people that like the changes that flame others for not trying them out is that these people have tried changes before and died because of them, lost days or months of time because of it and they don't want to do it again.<P>3. Some people just don't have the time in real life to go and relearn something all over again or try out new areas. They wait for others to go there and then have someone explain to them what they need to do. As it cuts down the learning curve and makes new areas more enjoyable because they don't like to die, they don't like to waste what little or as much free time dieing.<P>I personally don't mind dieing, i have more free time then most people and like the new challenges that this game presents. Whether it be a new zone, new mobs or having to relearn the game i like it.<P>For those of you that don't like it. You should be flamed for not liking it. For those of you that have done this since the bata of EQ i have nothing but praise for you in helping make the game what it is today.<P>Thank you all for reading,<BR>Gremlinn, Szokur, Atens<BR>Xev<P>P.S. I wrote this at work and if it's kinda of non-linear(sp), i'm sorry. I just hope you get the idea behind the post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well I see Clerics complaining...well here goes my 53 shaman POV (point of view)<P>This sucks....lame response you say? allow me to explain:<P>In OS day of patch, cleric enchanter 3 tanks and me. (war ranger and rogue) We are fighting the trash in the way to Outzone just to get some exp. Tank pulls with half hp, I hit him with slow (51)and it IGNORES ME and bash on the tank (goodjob tank_01). Tank starts getting  beat down cleric Cheals  and saves him (good job cleric_01).  INSTANT agro on cleric, i see this and start casting envenomed bolt (nice dot HIGH agro) the frog has over 85%hp at the time i hit him, ususally this= its kicking my butt now...umm no didnt even phasethe frog...sooooo I cast EB AGAIN and it hit....STILL nothing....not even a glance my way, while im doing this rogue is BSing away tanks taunting snaring, cleric_01 almost DEAD, I had to blow the rest of my mana HEALING him and it STILL didnt  agro on me (sup healing) which gives us even MORE down time.  <P>I feel I have the right to complain, this screws our group from what should be a FUN night of gaining EXP. When ANYONE in the group dies it sucks , when the cleric dies we train other groups to save ourselves in hope to go on a CR for cleric or we all die due to lack ofheals... GREAT idea SOE.  Now half the clerics wont play no cleric_01= no one having fun.  Nothing worse than sitting around for 3 DAMN hours waiting for a cleric to show ...OS has 23 people last night i saw 2 clerics....whats wrong with this picture?<P>Ergomas makes a rude gesture at SOE for screwing up high end part of the game...<P>Ill be playing my enchanter....since my group doesnt have worry about cleric dying at lv 33...<BR>or Ill have to PL my cleric to 50 on my other account so I can play my 53 shaman again...<P><BR>Ergomas<BR>53 shaman nameless and clericless so it seems<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>again, more good points. Some of you said that the game is 2 years old, and making a change like this now is weird and affects alot. True, hence my comment that Verant IS admitting they were wrong. But what they were wrong about is they were wrong before the patch, meaning that if this was to be done, it should have been done sooner. We are the players, we figure out how to get around things like this all the time, and as soon as we get how to get a good pull, when and who to heal, and what kind of members whould be there, we'll be fine. But for now, Im sticking with my druid, until they mess with his tracking, them im going to my mage, while his pet still works how its supposed to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Again I will post a reply. (Not as long winded this time)<P>The cleric rules have me running scared if my group attacks something that cons even.<P>I am a level 24 cleric, I have logged 15 or more hours simply playing my cleric since the patch date.<P>I have played it, and Greater Healing pulls mobs off of tanks like there is no tomorrow.   Everywhere in the world.   Not just Kunark, everywhere I have been.   Oh, you heal the tank, get attacked, wait until the mob is peeled off of you, and then heal self.    Bam there we go again.<P>Here's my tactic.   I will play my monk.<P>There have been nerfs in the past, and some were needed.   (Necro for example)   However if there was ever a nerf that was not needed.   This is it.<P>Monks still have a chance, and when they nerf that, I guess, I will start a druid.    Maybe they can nerf us all, and we can go back to POSSIBLY killing decaying skeletons, bats, and large rats.<P>This disgusted cleric is giving up.   I like my cleric, I like the game, but I refuse to try in a futile effort to gain any experience (I gave up on money a long time ago. &lt;read the message about heal med heal med&gt; )<P>I started playing this game because it was FUN!  Not because of an everchanging world, not because of an adaptable AI.   FUN, interaction, enjoyment.   I can get this much frustration trying to open a frozen can of pickles thank you very much, and sometimes it's more satisfying.  (mmmmm pickles)   /sarcasm off<P>Verant is not to blame completely.   Those players out in the nether realms who complained about too little fun and excitement for the cleric should be thanking themselves.   <P>Well, I have had all this much fun I can stand.    <P>I have a 24 cleric now to do nothing but kill Dark Elf guards, and drop swords for my monk to pick up and sell in hopes that the monk may someday be able to purchase some good weapons from a player.<P>Monks ownz.   They heal themselves without spells, they tank for themselves, and if you are an Iksar, they feed themselves.<P>All you clerics out there, if I see you, I will give you any and all cash I can scrounge up, simply so you can try to buy those SoW potions that are on the market.<P>24 clerics got the nerf, feel the nerf, and hate the nerf as much as the next guy.<P>The replies from Verant representatives who state I should play before I make my accusations?    I have.    As for my previous post, I have my proof, logged, I have witnesses, I have pics.<P>You DON'T have to be healing, sitting, or hitting to get a SARNAK of any kind to agro you. All you have to be is a cleric (Of suitable level) and stand still 40 feet away while watching it die.<P>Thank you Verant, I have some nice wall paper shots.<BR>Thank you Alan, Absor, whateveryournameis, I have opened up and got on my soapbox.<BR>Thank you whiney uberclerics who wanted more fun and excitement, I have no reason to play my favorite character any more.<P>Thank you all for listening to the ramblings of a RIGHT Dwarf Cleric.

</FONT><HR>Now I am -not- a cleric nor do I play a Cleric alt, but I feel that this recent "fix" is a mistake. Now this may be due in part to the combination of the "fix" by reduction Melee Taunts and increasing Healing Aggro.<P>This healing "fix" has not only affected Clerics but just about every healing class. Now all of my negative experiences have been in Velious, so perhaps there is wherein' the problem lies... Just wanted to relate the experiences I have had and hopefully this "fix" can be relooked at in depth.<P>1. Was on a raid into Western Wastes to kill ourselves some dragons. I as one of the few shamans was grouped with mainly casters to drop heals and buff and debuff as needed. We all zoned into SG and the melee's pulled the 3 spawns at the entrance to clear it so we could CotH and Succor people across. Now about 30 seconds in 1 of the monsters had dropped and the other two were well on their way to being dropped. One of the casters in my group received a couple of hits and thusly I dropped 1 Greater Heal to restore their health. Immediately the other 2 monsters who were being engaged by a total of 20+ melee's all who were of 45+ lvl or higher, turned and killed me. Mine was the first heal of the fight, and despite such massive amount of melee aggro the monsters turned and killed me for it.<P>2. We then went to clear the Sea Horses as they see invis and it's easier to clear them to advance. During this fight once again I dropped 1 single Greater Heal on a Tank who was in my guild. The Sea Horses immediately turned on me and I found myself dead yet again.<P>3. Finally we had entered Western Wastes, after having to rez Healers and casters after just about every fight, because the Melee's -could not- taunt off. Our Primary Enchanter was dropping every fight no matter what we did because aggro was so bad on her. Well some unmentioned guild trained one of the Dragons into the Tunnel zone. Various melees in our group engaged it to try and slow it down so that others could escape. Being the fool I am I stayed to help instead of running for my life and leaving others to die. I noticed members of my group receiving dmg from the Dragon's breathe weapon, and so I dropped a Greater Heal on one of htem so he could make it to the zone. Immediately the named Dragon ran down the tunnel to kill me. Now this Dragon had been engaged with a good 15+ tanks at the entranced of the tunnel and I was not even in visual range. It removed itself from engagement with these tanks and it and another Drake who had been trained by the same unmentioned guild both shot down the tunnel to kill me yet again.<P>4. Now, being the glutton for punishment I am...<BR>I proceeded to our next spot to actually get to dragon killing. We killed a couple of wurms, a drake or two and then while resting up another Wurm wandered into our path. Once again a fight ensued and melees began to engage the monster. I once more healed 1 person - a melee this time - and once again the monster left the combat to come over and give me a nice big bite or two. Now fortunately and unfortunately one of my Guild Enchantresses decided to Debuff so she was turned into a snack before I could be finished off. However When I dropped a second heal later on in the fight I managed to aggro one of the other dragons in WW. This Dragon though in visual range had -not- been in aggro range and not even seemed to notice our group fighting off in the distance. I had not changed position, nor moved any closer to it... yet right after my heal was cast it turned and ran straight up to munch me in half.<P>    So as you can see this is not only frustrating to clerics but to many other classes that attempt to "play healer" during big raids or fights. This is something that I think needs some big in depth looking and some immediate fixing... because I have already seen raids in Velious, OS, KC, etc... where Clerics -will not- go unless there is an Enchanter to take the kill or it is a raid of 20+... where at least they have a chance of a surviving the onslaught after a heal.<P>Fennin Ro - Iksar Shaman <BR>Just another Tastey treat after he heals a party member.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>3 types of sheep or "God Backers"  (translated those who will kiss up to the Verant power structure regardless of what they do)  Which category do you fall into?<P>God backers seem to break down into one of these three groups: <P>Self-Preservationists - Probably the largest group on the god-backers team are the self-preservationists. They are also the least loyal to your position as an Imm bent on wimping. These people are participating in a typical human reaction similar to that of the pre-war Germany where the populace allowed those in power to take rights and property from others, and even SUPPORTED it in the vain and stupid hope that the authorities would remember them, and not take similar action against their race or class at a later date. As with the people in Germany, this belief of course vanished as soon as the authorities turned their interest toward their particular minority. It is indeed gratifying to watch self-preservationists become enraged and vocal when they get the nerfed as the self-preservationists tend to be the ones that have the fiercest and most vociferous outcry when THEY are the ones being betrayed by the administrators of the mud. The already wimped players will see this as an ironic form of justice for not having stood by them when the imms were mucking up their stuff.<P>Ass-Kissers - When an established skill or spell is taken from others, a very significant portion of those who back you as an Imm are doing so for the sole reason that they would blindly agree to any damn thing you did! You should already know the kind. These people likely want to ingratiate themselves to you because they have their own aspirations for immhood in the future and know full well that being buddies with a god, (especially when standing up for an unpopular action), will win them approval with you and subsequent favors or other consideration or bent rules. It is also important to remember that many people who want to cause strife to your mud, (See '*****ers' in the next section), will pretend to agree with you because its the best way that they can think of to be able to SAFELY (to themselves) stir the **** with arguments which they know will cause problems and hurt others in order to meet their final agenda. Online these people are known as trolls.<P>Genuine-Believers - There will be a few people who will genuinely and honestly believe that what you are doing is right. A person is most likely to belong to this group if he agrees with what you are doing and it is being done to him. (Although its very important to remember that the Ass-Kissers many times will do this even to their own detriment.) Genuine believers may believe their points after rational and cerebral introspection, or they may simply be blind followers. The fact that you can find people to agree with you even if that belief is genuinely held in no way makes what you are doing right however. <P><BR>Verant, you are breaking the game and causing strife by messing with established skills/tactics.  This is not going to help, it's only going to hurt.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am not a guinea pig, lab rat or beta tester for Absor/Abashi or VI.  I will not subject myself or my group to needless death, exp penalties and timeloss for your little test.<P>Why do clerics have to be sacrificed on the altar of nerf in the name of "VI intelligence improvement"?  You want to improve VI intelligence?  Put enchanter mez ability on 50%+ of all the mobs in norrath.  Have them mez players and pick them off one by one in every encounter just like we do to them.  Have your mobs camp the zonein spots in every zone and pick off the players as they zone in with only one intention...to kill the mobs.  This is in-line with what mobs should have learned by now after 2 years of constant camping and slaughter.<P>The game was working fine as it was for years by design.  Sorry, but your arguments aside, this is a fact because I was there playing the game on the live servers...for years...living and dying like everyone else.<P>I challenge Abashi/Absor or any number of people on the Dev team to a face to face debate on these issues.  I will fight for the clerics of norrath since noone else here will and Absor/Abashi postings are all one sided.<P>&gt;&gt;"Of course. We make mistakes like everyone else. The point here is not that we are absolutely right, but that we don't think it's completely wrong. There might need to be some tuning done to this change. But the change itself isn't wrong. Having monsters nearly ignore the fact that there is a healer restoring the life to its enemies is wrong, both in terms of consistency within the game world and for the mechanics of the AI."<P>Then why did it mysteriously escape your vaunted dev team's notice for 2 years.  Did they also notice that there has always been agro from heals...just not the "uber nerf" agro you thrust into the game w/the latest patch.  Are you reading this point?  Did you ever play a cleric to 50+ to verify this? <P>&gt;&gt;"No, I didn't. This change was made because healing was being almost ignored by the NPCs."<P>I disagree with this assessment.  If you play tested clerics I'd have a little more to believe.<P>&gt;&gt;"The mechanic was broken. I've never said anything about this being done as something to make a cleric's life more interesting."  <P>Did you take into consideration exactly what this nerf would do to a cleric's life?  Well, you already answered this.  "We are happy with this change, and we hope you will be too".<P>&gt;&gt;"So, unfortunately, we have to say no to some customers, especially when their request would adversely affect other customers."  <P>You didn't say anything in this case.  You just thrust it in on the coattails of the donals bp nerf (not that I care about the bp).  How about when what you do adversely affects a group of customers?  You give 2 other large populations of customers 25% of what the smaller group specializes in, then the smaller group you nerf a core ability and give them nothing...then clearly state that "we want to see how they will react" given nothing to deal with a change to something we've used for years.  Then make them wait how many weeks/months before you do something?   And I emphasize the last part here..."MAKE THEM WAIT HOW MANY WEEKS/MONTHS BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING (POSITIVE)".<P>&gt;&gt;"And we appreciate your passion, we share it. I would, obviously, prefer to have you stick with us and trust us to do what is best for the game."<P>I love playing the cleric and would hate to leave over this.  However, I do not trust you to do what is best.  Based on your own past performance with nerfs and "balancing" as well as this one.  You obviously know what is best based on demographics, not player interest (except where the bottom line is concerned which leads back to my point).  You would chop peoples virtual arms off if you thought it would keep them playing.  Does that help gameplay and balance?  I think not.<P>&gt;&gt;"Well, there is a difference between a broken game mechanic and a technological problem. Bad pathing is not a problem with the game mechanic, it's a problem with the execution of that mechanic. That doesn't mean that such things shouldn't be fixed, I just wanted to be as clear as possible on my point."<P>So, why are you ignoring bad pathing problems and focusing on nerfing players.  It took you 2 years to find this one (so you claim and I don't believe everything you tell me sorry), you have other in game techno/mechanical problems that could be considered a bit more important.  The game environment isn't likely to be this vocal on your msg boards either.<P>&gt;&gt;"As for not seeing all of the long range repercussions of this change, that's always possible. In a way, it's not being able to see far enough out that probably caused healing aggro to be way too low for all this time."<P>So, seeing that you made a mistake however many years ago, in one patch you violently rectify the problem, thrusting hundreds/thousands of people into a beta test scenario on live servers.  You have no idea what repercussions this change will make either, yet you did it anyway.  We the players now lose our exp/time we put into our characters/game to test your theory "fix".  So, which is the lesser of two evils?  The fact that you built the game around an ability for years and didn't adjust it gradually over time?  Or that you are forcing the players to eat the pentalty for being forced to beta test for you.  Do two wrongs make a right?  Does the end justify the means?<P>&gt;&gt;"This becomes a problem for us. We need feedback on the game. This sort of thing, however, is not feedback, it is misinformation."<P>&gt;&gt;"All I was saying was that if people want to provide feedback, please do so. We're reading as many of these posts as we can. But posting something that basically says, 'I haven't even played since the change, but the change is bad', isn't very convincing as feedback."<P>You did no testing on this nerf and you just thrust it in and gave nothing to balance.  You are saying, that you will not believe anyone here who does not have firsthand experience with your nerf, yet its perfectly fine for you to nerf at will - who has no knowledge (or experience) of what this nerf will do.  How much knowledge did the dev team have of what a post 50 cleric's life is like before the nerf?  I realize this point isn't very eloquent, I could not think of another way to put it, but I think that it makes sense.  Tossing me and my years of experience playing the class you carelessly nerfed out the window...its part of your nerf.  You are attempting to turn me into a newbie even though I refuse to take part in "it".<P>&gt;&gt;"Keep posting your experiences, we are reading them. And we are certainly aware of your concerns. We are looking at all of this keeping your responses in mind. I'll keep you informed about any decisions we make."  Alan<P>&gt;&gt;"We need feedback on the game".  'I haven't even played since the change, but the change is bad', isn't very convincing as feedback."<P>I have played (and paid Verant Interactive in cash) up to the "nerf".  Just because I refuse to be forced into a beta test situation, basically be a lab rat for VI doesn't mean that my input as a 50+ cleric isn't valid which is what my previous point is "saying".<P>I do not wish to subject the people I care about and group with daily to who knows what with your "well planned/intentioned" nerf.  You have no idea what will happen, you admit it yourself.  Why should I and the people I group with be subjected to additional time/exp loss because of a "nerf"?  "Its part of the game"  "you'll learn, you'll be a better cleric" etc etc.  That rhetoric doesn't justify the fact that you guys are "playing god" - design 2 expansions around this ability, then whoosh, nerf it and give nothing to balance it.  Giving 2 other classes our healing ability is not balance for the clerics.<P>I consider myself an intelligent and conscientious player.  I have played enough to see when a nerf like this with no balancing compensation to deal with it is bad.  The fact that you gave nothing in return is reason enough.  The fact that you will wait weeks/months before you decide on what to do is worse.<P>I am not a beta tester for Verant Interactive nor do I have any wish to be one.  You did not pay me for said testing and you will not compensate the people I group with and get killed by your nerf for their trouble.  I will not be responsible for their loss.<P>Compensate the cleric class for this sudden "nerf" accordingly with spells we can USE.  Keep your "nerf" but do the right thing and give us a means to function in a game designed around something you just nerfed.<P>You want some suggestions?  Here are some good ones:<P>1. Move celestial elixir to level 49.  <BR>2. 5 more upgrades to the celestial line of spells at 51, 53, 55, 57 and 60. Improved healing over time doing 2000, 2500, 3000, etc per upgrade, add a cure poison/disease component (with each pulse) at level 51. Increase the first few pulses of healing accordingly with the upgrades. The "agro" factor does NOT change beyond what the first in the series does because these are "heals over time" and not instant. Too powerful? I think not, its no more powerful or unbalancing than your "ch" nerf is. The celestial line is the only thing "unique" to the cleric class atm with the exception of Paladins.  Everything else is shared.  Think about that.  Can't come up with names for them?  Call them: Celestial Elixir II, III, IV etc.  Or Celestial Tonic, Potion, Concoction whatever.<BR>3. All celestial spells are purchasable at REASONABLE vendor locations. <BR>4. Group celestial healing at some mid 50ish level.<BR>5. Gradually reduce the casting time on all celestial line spells for upgrades.<BR>6. The level 60 version will attempt to completely heal the target over the standard period of pulses/time.<BR>7. Atone - upgrade it 2 or 3 times. 3rd at level 49. It becomes unresistable at the 2nd upgrade. Yes, that means it becomes unresistable like wizard lures and ignores all checks for MR regardless of the mob. Its casting time/recycle time becomes 1.5 seconds/instant recycle at 3rd upgrade and costs no more than 25 mana AND is alteration.  If the spell doesn't work, then we won't use it.<BR>8. Divine series. We get another upgrade at 49. Faster recycle, no more than 3 minutes - duration 30 seconds, heals 2+ bubbles while on.<BR>9. Increase dodge/defense/agi for the cleric class. <BR>10. Increase our armor of protection personal buff to "increase" in effectiveness every level to compensate for your "nerf".<P>Abashi says we have to "learn to manage our agro". Well, give us the tools and upgrades to do it. You "nerf" something the class has had for years and give nothing in return.  The fact that we are dealing with the nerf with nothing to "balance it" right now (for how many weeks/months before you decide to do something) shows how much you care. If you do implement improvements, you should have done the nerf/improvements at the same time.  Think about that while the entire cleric population is left to "writhe in the winds of nerf" before you do something positive...IF anything.<P>These most recent suggestions are most up to date.  Use them instead of the ones I gave in your "cleric talk" thread.<P>Again, it shows how much you care. There is no excuse for poor planning at this stage of the game, after 2 years of nerfs and patches.<P>There, you have your solution to rebalance the cleric class.  Notice I did not ask for melee ability.  I did not ask for nukes, or snare, or sow, or ports, or pets, or dots, or damage shields, or regen, or haste, or slow, or melee, or bash, or solo ad nauseum.  I asked for HEALS.  I asked for upgrades to existing spells/abilities.  Thats what we are about.  You designed the game around an old class with old abilities/spells.  Its time to upgrade them with the times...you obviously agree based on your nerf.  Now DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE CLERICS for a change.  <P>It took me 4+ hours of my personal time to compose this.  Does anyone care?  Does this indicate to you how much I care about the class?  Think about it. <P>Do these things fast before you lose another subscriber.  Hurry the hek up so I can get back to healing people, being useful, helping my friends and guild enjoy the game and have fun.  I won't play my twinks, and I refuse to play the cleric until you do.  I'd imagine that I'm not alone either.  Playing a cleric is hands down the most fun "thing" I've ever done in any game.  The friends you meet/make and play with etc make it an exciting, dynamic experience. This nerf to me feels like a stab in the back to an otherwise selfless class of players who's sole purpose in the game is to help others.  Talk about selfless...what did I ask for? HEALING UPGRADES to keep YOUR PLAYER POPULATION HAPPY AND HEALTHY and to keep the clerics USEFUL IN/TO GROUPS since we have nothing else.  Rez is NOT a combat spell contrary to popular belief.  It is a shared ability - with necro's and paladins.<P>You'll also notice that for nearly a year I said nothing on your boards until this.  Last time I opened my mouth was because you nerfed/neglected wizards.  So, I made a cleric and here we are again. <P>Thx info.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing the game since the patch upgrade, and I have been upset from Verant's Blind eye to the cleric. All of the other races got "enchancements" and new heals and symbols yet clerics really got no benefit out of the patch other than a new faster agro in healing. I agree NPCs have to be mad when someone heals all the damage they do, but I think an atone II would be a fair request considering atone casts  too slow for a cleric to hope to get it off. Just an idea maybe just a lower cast time atone.<P>Also all this stuff has been mentioned about classes...when are they going to finish the graphics for velious. All my eqclient.ini files have true for the armor. The Erudite Guardian Helmet graphic still hasn't appeared although my gaunts of the black now have a graphic.<P>Thanx<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Okay so I am a cleric on Cazic-thule. I am a whole 44th level now, but that is good enough to have all major heals that seem to be causing problems right? Wll here's my opinion on the deal.<P>1: When I started as a cleric 6 months ago, I was told, and read that heals do the same agro as a DD of the same number of HP. Meaning I heal a tank for 5k, I am gonna really piss off that mob. That was what I was told before I started, it's located in several start guides that were written by clerics themselves.<P>2: So far I've done several runs in regular dungeons/zones, Lower Guk, Skyshrine entrance, Cobalt Scars, Eastern Wastes. In all these places, I didn't die from healing once. Now alot of cleric are whining that this is not what it applies to, but as a brand new 44th cleric I don't yet have Cel heal, it something I need to get of. Mostly I use CH or Superior heal, the ones that were just "nerfed" in your words. Now we can go and complain these are not what people are addressing this is just low level dungeouns and you guys are talking about raids. Things where massive people join together to die. Well then go down to Three.<P>3: Saturday night, skyshrine raid. Skyshrine is a city zone, mobs undercon all over the place. Past the pool room mobs are almost 100% MR. So we get outfitted with 5 groups. Mine includes a 46 war, 51 paladin, 53 paladin, and 45 enchanter, also a second cleric. As me being the low cleric I am not going to be handle heals to most of my group and I know this. We setup camp near the statue area. Nice level 55+ mobs all about. We clear the path and that is when the fun starts. We start pulling 63rd level cubes of Jello! These are quad hitting for 300+. 100 MR and tashani just gets our enchanter summoned and killed within seconds. Other cleric is throwing out heals to group left and right. AS being secondary cleric, I am doing the smart thing target cube, /assist, complete heal tank its focused on. During the battle we lost 0 clerics, 0 healers, 2 enchanters, and 4 tanks. Enchanters should be complaining more then clerics after this patch. During the night I don't think a single cleric was lost. <P>This is all from a happily new 44th cleric.<P>Laldiinu Zyhealer<BR>Level 44th Cazic-Thule -- Hand of Chaos<BR>Praise TUNARE!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>VI has total control over this game and its content.  What they do not have total control over is what the players will do.<P>Clerics have extremely limited options in what they can do to affect the game.  99% of their ability is in grouping and affecting other players in a positive way.  Take away this ability, nerf it, give it away to other classes and the player has little left that allows him to add value to groups or gameplay that other classes can bring.<P>Regardless, you can't just nerf something, give nothing back and say its balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I felt I would post my observations of your Cleric nerf.  I was running a Hate raid this evening.  We we made a big pull recieved 5 mobs, the enchanters was able to finaly put them to sleep. Normaly with 4 enchanters in group this is not to bad of a pull, depending some one normal will die out of it but still manageable, Well with 6 clerics there, the cleric healed one warrior with CH, 3 mobs broke mez at the same time and 5 clerics went down in less than 3 seconds before the enchanters even had time to get them remezed, Nothing I mean Nothing would pull them mobs off I am a SK and I can be darn persasive on taunting stuff off and even that didn't work. So we droped down to pulling singles and 2's trying differnt tech's to see if we could lower the agro on the clerics. Using sooth as a example. That didn't even work, soon as Mez was broken they made a beline straight to the cleric Every time, Only way we could get them off is if the cleric used a Divine aura and by that time they were near dead with maybe a bubble or a bubble and ahalf of life left. This is just plain stupid, you have attached so much hate to CH now that its so difficult to keep the clerics alive that it nearly ruins the game. It has turned from being a challenge to a Mass Murder for clerics. And anyone thats grouped with them.<BR>One Ticked off Tank</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Absor, this is just sad. You've stated that the change was made because clerics were bored with the old heal/med routine. <P>No, I didn't. This change was made because healing was being almost ignored by the NPCs. The mechanic was broken. I've never said anything about this being done as something to make a cleric's life more interesting."<P>Actually Absor you didnt say it but Abashi did.  Here is his direct quote:<P>" "That was one of the thoughts we had as well. At the panel discussions in Baltimore one of the gals there played, I believe, a 56 cleric. One of her complaints was that all clerics did was stand back, heal, and med. One of the good things now is that we've increased the skill necessary on the part of the player to properly judge how likely the NPC is to turn on them. <BR>-Gordon"<P>Honestly though take a step back from all the complaining and look at this subject objectionately.  Take a look at the Cleric/Druid/Shaman classes and then take away C Heal from clerics who really cant use it any more apart from in lulls between battles (where rejen is better anyway).<P>Now that a Druid and Shaman can heal as well as a Cleric (and dont fall back on the Clerics get a healing bonus we tested it and its insignificant)what else it there that a Cleric can do?  Um res and thats about it whereas the other two classes can bring so much more to a group.  Is that balanced?<P>Should C Heal have been Nerfed with a bigger Taunt factor?  Yes it I think it probably should have but you Guys have Way over compensated (and I mean Way).  It you dont want to change the taunt factor of C Heal at least give the tanks a better way of taunting them back off us, becuase as things stand its just plain ridiculous.<P>Dolgann<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Constructive FEEDBACK:<P>Its clear that the change eventually will be GOOD for the GAME. But it isnt finished, as you guys have admitted. Here are a few of the many suggestions Ive either seen here or posted myself:<P>a) Keep the change as is, but retune the ubermobs to either lessen their aggro reaction to heals, or lower their damage per attack.<BR>b) Keep the CH aggro, making it a Post fight spell, but lower the heal aggro on all other clerical heals.<BR>c) FIX the fact that CH heal aggro is AREA EFFECT rather than mob specific.<P>or they might <P>1) Increase clerical defense skillcap. Currently clerics have the lowest defense skillcap of all plate classes. In fact, clerics now get lower defensive skillcaps than some chain classes. Yet their need for defense has increased drastically with just this change.<BR>2) Increase Dodge Skillcap to 150.<BR>3) Add Parry with 100 cap.<BR>4) Lower the Recast delay on the Divine line to 3 minutes. Add another DA or Evade type SKILL (not spell, we dont have the slots for 3) to be learned at lvl 54. Divine line was created and tuned without this AGGRO in mind. This change would make the biggest difference and would go a long way to helping clerics adjust. <BR>5) Change Clerical Stuns so that they dont have two resist checks. Currently three of the four clerical stuns are resisted often on easy mobs because they check a Damage check and a Stun check.<BR>6) Give an upgrade to Atone. Give the upgrade a -50 magic resist check much like the necro splurt spell. And make it very fast casting. <P><BR>We know from verant's history that once they make a change, they RARELY backpedal. Very very rarely. If anything, they overnerf, then backpedal to change the nerf a bit, but only with the Box of Abu-Kar do i remember them making a change, and "totally reversing" that change. (they changed existing boxes to 10% wr, then changed it back to 100% later and removed it from the drop table)<P>The point I try to make is that while this Aggro change was done with good intentions, it was by no means a finished and tested change. Its really hard to ask ask a class to "re-learn" its basic playstyle tactics 2 years after a game is out. Healing is pretty much 95% of the cleric game, and they changed it drastically with no warning, nor did they give clerics any adjusted ways to deal with this change. <P>Most good cleric's can adjust to this for a normal grind, but on ubermobs it currently translates into an insta-death sentance. How is that justified? Why would you go if you were a cleric? To be Verant's Test dummy while they watch you die over and over? <P>Thanks, but no thanks. Fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  While I do feel the new healing aggro is definitely a "nerf", I don't think it's totally wrong, after all, quoting Absor quoting a co-worker, "Just think about how angry it makes you when you've nearly got Vox dead and she casts a Complete Heal."  Indeed, it does upset me.<P>However, here's a counter to that:<P>  Think about how angry it makes someone camping the goblin alchemist when a raid group nearly has Vox dead and she casts a Complete Heal.<P>  They'd feel sorry for the raid people at most.  Would they immediately rush out and charge Vox?  I would imagine not.  And that's where I feel the hate system is really broken.  Imagine the following situation.<P>1. Another group pulls mob to their group, running it past mine(causing us to be added to mob's aggro list)<BR>2. Other group starts killing the mob as normal.<BR>3. I(Cleric) heal my group.<BR>4. Other group's pulled mob aggros me.<P>  In this situation, my group has done absolutely no damage to the dog, yet it will aggro me because I healed someone on it's hate list.<P>  Now, I'm not completely sure if this is exactly how the hatelist works, but it seems more or less accurate, and in this case, doesn't really make much sense.<P>  Perhaps the hate could be scaled down, and added to the mob in terms of how pissed off it is at the person being healed, rather than just the amount of hitpoints being healed.  Perhaps the current hate, multiplied by the ratio of the person being healed to the person with the highest hate.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't understand why you would fix a game that isn't broken (well not too badly anyway).  I mean, sure the healing agro was messed from the start perhaps.  But if you let the entire game build on that premise for almost 3 years (more if you count beta) and the game is working fine, then why the hell change it?<P>Nobody who plays a cleric as thier main is happy about it.  Most are switching to other twinks to play instead.  Now I totally agree that instant healing is a way overpowered feature in a game like this.  BUT!!!  That is what the entire monster set was designed around.  Why do mobs hit for more damage than PCs of the same level?  Because the PCs have casters who can do instant healing.  Instant heals unbalance a game totally.  But if you simply remove the ability to do any kind of instant heals fromthe game, AND leave all the mobs the way they are, then you've just thrown the whole game totally out of balance!<P>Why the heck should healers heal if they're guarenteed death as soon as they do during a fight?  So that basically means that unless your group can take down a mob without having to heal during the fight, then no one is going to fight the stupid mob in the first place.  Its not worth the risk to the cleric/druid/shaman and therefore the group.  The high level game is screwed, since even in a one on one fight, a tank sometimes needs a CH (or equivalent) when fighting a green or low blue mob that barely gives exp.<P>I mean, if CH is useless now... why play a cleric at all?  I mean, you've given away all the rest of thier spells.  Pallies can be used for rezzes and cleric buff.  Druids and shaman can heal just as well as clerics now with thier new spells (since clerics CH is useless in fights now).  Plus druids and shaman get all those other neat spells (sow, dots, ports, decent nukes, ect ect) on top of thier heals.  So I ask again.. why play a Cleric?  At high levels they are reduced to minor druids/shaman now.<P>I just dont understand VI's logic here?  You should of incorporated the agro factor at the start of the game before you designed the zones and monsters that populate them.  But to make the monsters (high end especially) unbeatable without using a TON of instant heals during a single battle, and THEN crank up the agro factor on healing to make it impossible to heal during a fight, is, well, ludicrous!<P>The end result is that people dont want to clerics, period.  They're boring enough as it is.  Most people have a cleric of some sort as a twink, maybe even a high level one.  However, the majority of them are just used to twink characters and rez themselves/friends.  Very few are serious "cleric for life" players, and that is a sad fact.  Now that CH is virtually useless post 50, and druids/shamans have totally rapped them of thier unique healing abilities, why play a boring heal/med cleric.  Especially since the heal part of that statement doesn't even hold true half of the time anymore since it is certain death to do so.<P>Can players adjust?  Sure thing.  It simply means larger groups needed for raids (i'd guesstimate about twice the size currently or more).  No more clerics, or just one for rez if there isn't a 59th pally along on the raid (or as I said before, if there isn't a reserve twink cleric owned by one of the players in the raid).  Longer, more boring battles - no more crazy multiple pulls since no sane healer would heal that poor chanter when mez broke.  Less chanter players because of this.  Tanks *****ing and complaining that they can't find any healers to group with.  And I could go on.<P>Just because a feature logically makes sence to put into the game, doesn't mean it SHOULD be implemented.  What you should say to yourself is "Would the new realism factor out-weigh the damage to the fun factor of the game as a whole?".  But if you think about it, the realism factor doesn't make sence anyway.  Why can't uber equiped 60th level warriors go head to head with a 60th level warrior mob?  Because you decided to remove realism from the game and add the "nessesity" of groups aka healing into the game.  High level groups rely completly on the fact that they have someone to heal them.  If they don't have a healer, then they don't have a prayer (except people who kite perhaps, I'm talking all the melle and support classes mostly here war, pal, sk, rogue, monk, chanter, wiz, bard).<P>That is exactly the tactic that you are encouraging by this change.  The only tactics that could work well with the change are ones that make it so the mob never hits ANY PC.. aka Kiting (either snare or fear, whatever), and root/nuking (although this is dangerous if the npc isn't snared).  Tanking is far less effective, and useless agaisnt tough mobs who waste even the best tank in the game in under a minute.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thank goodness someone is keeping track of "Abashi/Absor" posts.<P>To us, they may as well be the same person.  Apparently, they don't realize this and end up making us look ignorant because we quote one and it was the other that said it.<P>It doesn't matter which one said it, you both have Blue names and you both speak on behalf of VI to the player for the same reason.  If this isn't the case then one of you stop it and be consistent.  At least keep track of what you both say - yourselves to be consistent.<P>Wow, someone who refutes the "15% healing bonus" as being significant.<P>I'd have to agree.  Based not on personal experience (because I don't play a shm/druid) but based on what you see going on right now on the live servers.  Shm/druids ARE taking a clerics place.  There is your proof.  Their heals are quite efficient and effective.<P>No, I am not yelling, or pushing for ANY other nerfing of those classes in any way shape or form.  They are just fine to me - or let them speak for themselves on their current state of affairs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also, if a mob agros on the cleric/healer from heals, only the best equiped tank types have a chance of getting the mob off of him.  So where does that leave the bottom 97% of us who aren't fortunate enough to be in a HOSS type guild and are stuck with decent items only?<P>Its just not fair.  You're trying to punish the top 3% of players for beating your AI code for uber mobs, and your solution affects the other 97% more than it does the group that you are targeting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pretty much this is my view of the new changes to the Clerics... It Sucks. The aggro rate now sucks horribly... I have have a Warrior &lt;I know gasp! A Warrior? Aren't they extinct now that Rangers, Monks, and wizards can out melee them! *sarcasim off*&gt; and I and 2 other warriors COULD not for the life of us remove a mob from our group CLERICS after both of them used 1 CH apiece. We lost both of our clerics due to the fact that we could not taunt the bugger off of them. If these "Nerfs" continue to keep shafting classes to unplayability for the sakes of someone's view of "Balance" then I guess I'll have to quit playing. It's been 2 years and still Verant has not listened to it's players... only a handful of "special" players. I think we all know what guild I am talking about here. VI needs to start doing something about the Balance issues... and that doesn't mean patch today, patch tomorrow, patch the next day... that means TEST TEST TEST! Don't put things on Live Servers that VI itself has stated have not received enough input from the Test Server to tweak it any. Whoever their QA people are... must be "special people" in their own right. As for a certain Special Person who I received a warning for commenting on his egotistical viewpoint of a certain issue...

</FONT><HR>you guys overract, and execessively lie, from my observations in grouping, this issue is far from even relevant most of the tiem, sometimes the cleric will get aggroed, but its not  *un tauntable* aggro... lieing doesnt solve anything, you guys just "feel" you have been nerfed because other people who feel that if there class is FIXED that they have some how been lestened in greatness...<P>enchanters and clerics seem to be famous for whining when they get de-enhanced for grouping or something can actually TOUCH their abilities, my opinion its greed, they want to always be able to find a group, so they want to make sure nobody can ever staple crowd control/heal esp. at high levels..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My enchanter is only level 29 so I won't attempt to speak as someone who knows them well enough.<P>"my opinion its greed, they want to always be able to find a group"<P>Um, last time I checked, clerics are a grouping class.  No group for a cleric = a cleric who cannot play.  Soloing cleric?  If there is 2% of them in all of EQ I'd be surprised.<P>EQ is about grouping.  Personally, I enjoy grouping and making a difference in groups.  I realized this (the game is group based), so I started 2 "grouping" classes to "go with the flow" so to speak.  Fighting the "flow" as a wizard solo'ing for example is boring and tedius, for me anyway.  Thus, I retired my 52 wizard and started cleric/chanter.<P>You cannot fault anyone, no matter what class for wanting, needing, whining, overreacting, lying, scratching endlessly at the door of fairness, whatever is required to ensure groups are there for us...to have fun, to get exp, to progress in the game etc.  Selfish?  Greedy?  I think not.  Its by design.  By design, if you remove value a cleric brings to groups in even the slightest way, even perceived by the masses of other players, it will affect all clerics everywhere in ...well, you draw your own conclusion.  Of course, the same can be said of any class that wishes to group.  Most other classes have vastly superior ways to solo/have other options however the cleric does not have.<P>Clerics are a great class by design.  They are designed to keep everyone alive (and happy/having fun).   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
