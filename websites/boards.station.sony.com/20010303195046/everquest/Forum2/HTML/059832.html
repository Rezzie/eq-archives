</FONT><HR>Smoore: and all others that think Clerics are whinning.<P>They Main concern that Clerics are trying to relay is not just the heals that Druids have gained. It is a combination of the heals and the new agro. You are right you can't fight trakanon without CH unless you have a bunch of healers... but after you cast CH with the new agro good luck getting Trak off the cleric before the cleric becomes a snack. <P>Another concern is the breach of one of the clerics class defining abilities by another class. A good example of the cleric concern is displayed fairly early in the game. Look at a level 19 cleric and a level 19 Druid... Which would you choose? Both have Identical healing capabilities. They both have some buff but which are better groupwise?... Also the Cleric has no offense where the druid can offer a lot of offensive strategy. This causes a lot of Clerics grief until they get greater heal at 24. However the pendulum swings back at 29 when the Druid again gains healing capabilities equal to that of a Cleric.  <P>Finally at 34 you see a very definite difference in roles. The cleric becomes a more defined healer and the druid has by now his very class defining travel spells... <P>I think if i was to put the situation into perspective it would be like clerics getting a small ammount of the travel spells of the Druid and possibly some of their offense whether it be DSs or DoTs. I think the druid community would be just as upset with that situation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So after loging in and testing these changes I have to say... CRIPES. Heals do cause more agro and Warriors and Paladins have to work doubler time to save me... After casting 2 heals 2 Palis could not get the mob off me. Don't know if this because of the change but it did not seem so hard before...<P>Any how Jyn, You are right we have Divine Aura and atone. Only one problem with comparing us to Enchanters for those things. I don't cast Devine aura before I cast heal. After you cast your heal good luck getting DA off... If you manage to get it off it might even be worse than not having it at all. Once you get DA you just sit there. Now you can't heal or anything. Now suppose your tank gets the mob off you now you should heal him but can't. So the warrior survives long enough for you to clear DA. great DA saved your bacon you saved your tank. Now 5-10 minutes later the next spawn comes along. What now?... I don't have DA back yet?... This time I heal and try atone... and try atone... and try atone... and try atone... Yee haa it worked I got one Mob out of 4 to stop hitting me and now I have less mana for heals...<P>My point is as follows. Enchanters do have a valid concern but the crowd control abilities of Enchanters are utilized before the mob is on the enchanter... Using a Clerics crown control abilties before casting heal does nothing but waste mana. Doing it after agro more time than not is wasted mana as well. The only hope that a cleric has is possibly parking the mob (Root) and hope the tanks can move to them before the root breaks. It's a tricky balance. Enchanters can mez which if combined with a good cleric it's awesome but asking Cleric to do crowd control is noe very realistic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The new healing hate equation basically takes CH out of combat.  If CH is out of combat, please compare the healing abilities of a 60 druid and a 60 cleric, and a 60 shaman.<P>Druid == cleric.

Cleric casts CH, then meds up 400mana.<BR>Shaman casts Topors on tank, regen on himself, Canni's up mana.<BR>Druid?  Casts his nice little clarity/hp buff on himself, regens/heals tank.<P>So, in battle, Druid == Cleric &gt; shaman as far as healing ability.<BR>After battle, Cleric == Shaman &gt; Druid as far as healing up group and recovering mana (downtime reduction).<P>Is this balance?<P>Outdoors:  Shaman/Druid heal aggro mob, since they are SoW classes they can aggro kite.<BR>Clerics (assuming no SoW classes in grp) have to use DA/DB or Jboots(if they managed to get a ring of ancients away from a druid camper).<P>Indoors:  Shaman/Druid heal aggro mob and die.<BR>Clerics heal aggro mob, DA, DB, hope mob is dead, or they die too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bateq, Shaman cast Torpor DURING battle not after. This gives them the best healing spell in the game - 1200 HP heal for 200 mana. How can you say Shaman are weak healers when they are actually now the highest effective healers in the game. Because Torpor is a DOT the damage is spread over enough time that the mob never aggros on the Shaman as opposed to the Cleric who is instantly aggro. Druids still suck for healing. They got NOTHING new except a weak 880 point heal at level 60. Don't think 880 point Heal is weak at level 60?

</FONT><HR>LOL...<P>I think it's funny of those talk about Whinning, or saying Clerics still have a spot 50+.<P>CH was one of the main reason some groups survived some encounters in the 50+ lvl's.  Well CH has become a death senstense...  So you will need all the SH's you can spear, and proably 2-3 times more healers than before...  Like raids were that easy to put together, and you can get the additional amount put together... hehe<P>My guild sometimes will seak Clerics for some raids, cause of the lack of them... now it's going to get worse.<P>I agree with the Agro status.  I don't agree with the fact that the Agro is so high that it could mean the end of the whole group....<P>As for Enchanters or Wizards saying "Welcome to my world"...  Well...  The clerics were saving your buts, or trying to by healing you when you got agroed on... I know I've done my share of that in the 20's.  Now, if the cleric is dead...   You wizard and enchanters...  how do you think you'll get out of the jam then ?  Flip a coin... cause either you have to do something and agro the mobs, or wait and see the tanks die before you...  hehe...   This will affect many other classes, not only Clerics... but it will make the Cleric class even rarer than before...<P>Bravo Verant...

The primary tank drops to 30% health in the first two rounds and the cleric pretty much has to have already started casting CH by that time (remedy and chloroblast don't heal more than some of these mobs do in a single hit) or the tank dies, pure and simple.  <P>It's an insult to tell a cleric in that circumstance to "manage their aggro."<P>(And no, I'm not a cleric.  I'm a level 60 druid.  I just recognize that this is not a cleric vs. druid issue...it is a significant nerf to anyone in the high level game who has ever had CH cast on them to keep them alive.

CH causes Agro that in most cases... can't be taken off.  If the Enchanter was Able to do something about it, that would be cool.  If the Tanks could do something about it... cool...  But what's happening in cases where there are 2+ mobs...  The Cleric gets attacked from the extra.<P>Even in a group with 2 healers, a Druid and a Cleric...  The cleric would do a CH... and the Druid would end up wasting all his mana to heal the Cleric...  Then The druid would become next on the Hate list...  Huh ?  All classes are going to be affected by this, not just Clerics.<P>Places that didn't need a Cleric before, could still use a Cleric now.  If SH was sufficient then, it will still be sufficient now.  It's the places where CH was required...<P>Seems like many are commenting without experiencing the pain...   But again...

</FONT><HR>Jyn, did you not notice Wednesday that the hate produced from tashing was GREATLY reduced in this patch?  I can attest to it because I've been playing my secondary these past couple of days instead of my cleric.  I USED to use tash to pull my pet into a fight...doesn't work at all anymore.  And when your being beaten, as someone already pointed out, these barriers generally won't last long enough anymore to pull the mob off and that assuming that you manage to get the cast off.<P>Freewynd, maybe you didn't know this, but mages only fight single mobs.  They rely completely on their pet.  Jboots or no, they still have to remain basically in place with their pet to fight.  There is no quad kiting for mages.

</FONT><HR>Ok, my fews on this.. First I don't play a healing class at all, I'm a mage, best I can do is summon band aids(Mages are the vending machines of Norrath) and throw a tiny heal on my pet. (and yes armor line has a nice slef only regen). Been playing a lot with a cleric in my guild.. yes aggro is up. And yes He got HT pretty damn fast by CT the night of the patch. All the clerics did. And In groups yes, he is having a little more aggro.. but not nearly as much as all you guys are screaming about. Hes not happy about it, and neither am I.. I don't LIKE seeing anyone getting aggro'd like that. Yes its not great, but it doesn't break your class..Truly.. it doesn't. I'll still rather group with a cleric than a druid any day/night of the week, for healing. Same for shamans, (though I love having shamans in the group, just gotta keep them from Buffing me.. "Pet damn it, buff the PET! *grin*")<P><BR>Wildet Manaweaver<BR>Mage of the 52<BR>P.S. *heh* 2 other things.. one mages can solo tis true, but it bites at higher lvls, any druid and wizard can out solo me any day of the week. I can't snare guys.. my pets post 50 can't solo anything that gives me xp, I  HAVE to burn. And then I have to sit on my butt and med forever to regen mana. (no real way to speed up our mana regen) Necros out solo us to, hands down. I rarely solo now.. Yes I can beat up IG in everfrost, but xp not all that great, and still have to burn.<P>Oh and even though clerics did get shafted, I have to admit I LIKE this patch as far as being a mage, some nice spells for us. And reduced aggro of the malosi line is VERY nice. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guys,<P>This is not a nerf against clerics (at first it does seem that way.)  It is against groups.  Right now, most groups only require one cleric and a few tanks.  After this change, high level groups require 2 clerics in all groups - one to heal the tank, and one to heal the healer.  (They will have to heal one another back and forth until the tanks can kill the mob.)<P>That means that you must have massive damage dealing tanks (rogues are the only logical choice.)  Also you have to have an enchanter to keep the mana up for the 2 clerics so the down time between each battle is not insane.  Finally, a bard to sing clarity song, or snare a running monster.<P>2 Clerics, 2 rogues, 1 enchanter, 1 bard.  &lt;=== thats the pickup group of choice now.<P>Only 4 problems with that, there are never enough clerics, enchanters, bards, or rogues NOW.  What fun to make us MORE dependant on them.  But at least we don't need warriors now post 50.  They can't tank since they can't get the mobs attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wildet,<P>   Playing my Necro with a Mage in the Teens... I can agree on thing...  My Necro would always be back to FM way before the Mage.<P>   Can't say from experience, only from many complaints.  I keep hearing that the Mage's pet is stronger than the Necro's one.  is that true ?  Not that I'm going to start a mage or anything... hehe<P>    I think I'll stay away from lvl 50... I'll play all classes to 20-30 until some other game comes along that won't play the Verant tactics of changing Class role/Tactics or Class definition half way through you're accent.  I'm tired of changes that affect game play to this extent... even when 80% of them didn't affect me, I sick and tired of reading about it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059832-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059832-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059832&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059832&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
