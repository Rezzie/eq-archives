</FONT><HR>Seems strange that some people think that removing these boards will end some of the criticisms of EQ. This is farthest from the truth. EQ posters will adopt a non Sony/Verant controlled message board as the 'official' message boards. Verant will have no control of the content that is posted on this alternative board. Verant people will read this board because it is human nature. There feelings will continue to be hurt by reading the comments on there game. If the board is costing too much resources to maintain then go ahead kill this board. However, if the reason to kill the board is to reduce negative comments about EQ, then you are in for an awakening. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Elly_of_Innoruuk<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;When I (as a customer) read the negative Verant-bashing that goes on I recognize it for the venting of frustrated players that it is.  It by no means changes my oppinion of the company or of the game.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Smart.  I'd also feel safe in saying that for every one person who quits due to board induced burnout, ten others that would have quit will stay because they had that chance to "vent".<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I do wish that people posting these highly negative posts would realize that they are just wasting their time and stick to presenting their case in a logical and well thought out manner.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Many complains (of all types) do actually begin that way (logical, well thought out) and then degrade to outright bashing due to feedback from other players. Yes, once in a while it's the moderator's comment that sets folks off, but mostly it's due to other posters.<P>Most people have a limit to how many "live with it" type replies they can read for posting a valid complaint before they end up "going postal".<P>I'd go so far as to say that the prime cause of what so many refer to as "whineplay" is that type of reply.<P>As to shutting down the boards?  <P>It's far too late now. The damage has long since been done.  People that should have been ignored have gotten what they complained for, and the rest are petitioning for their turn.<P>People are now used to having a forum.  <P>If Verant closes the official one, then we'll move to EQVault or one of the others that are already in place and just waiting for the server hits so they can sell more ad space.<P>Others actually Will quit if the board is closed.  If not because of the act of closing the board, then for losing the place to offload their complaints before they log in and hit the cancel button.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

All it does is clutter the board with garbage that the moderaters have to weed through to get too the decent well informed posts.<P><BR>I say keep the boards but get some BALLS and actually moderate the boards, you see what a benefit these boards can be then and only then.<P><BR>Bull</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like and depend on these boards to share information in both directions.<P>I don't use them to vent I use them to inform VI that I have experienced a "less than satisfactory" gaming environment.  I have come to expect that my concerns will be answered at some point and to take that away from me now would upset me.<P>I also agree that the best method of improving these boards would be to (as Bull put it) to "rule with an Iron Fist".  Take out the first negative post by a poster as his only warning, then ban him from the board on the second.  If they can't post in a positive manner then their input here is counter productive and not welcomed. I am sure someone will take me to task over use of the word negative, but I say VI can determine if the post is negative by their own definition, and I can live with that.<P>Keep the boards, ban the trolls and let us hve some honest and open discourse without all the garbage.

</FONT><HR> There are good reasons why Verant NEEDS these boards, though.   <P>1.  It's safe to say that many of the people on these boards have WWWAAAAYYYY more /played time with their characters than anyone one the EQLive team does.  It's a well known fact that there are basic limitations on what a designer (of anything) can know.  Theory is one thing.  Practice is another.  A player who has played this game for 100+ days of REAL TIME knows a tremendous amount about how the game works IN PRACTICE.  This player will understand certain things that even the best game designer never could.   We all have seen many ideas in EQ that must have sounded just great on paper in the EQLive team meeting room, but just didn't work in practice.  <P>2.  It is also a simple numbers game.   There is no way that 10 or 20 members (or however many there are) of the EQLive tuning team could POSSIBLY have as much collective Everquest knowledge as 300,000 players.  No way.  <P>  If you shut down these boards, you shut down the ONLY good source of communication between designers and players.  Sure, we players could still send you e-mail or something, but that just won't work because it won't be a DIALOGUE.  The players need to hear direct responses to their concerns as much as possible.<P>  Sometimes, you guys at Verant are right and we players are wrong.  When that happens, we need direct feedback from you, so that we can know WHY we are wrong.   Sometimes, we players are right and you guys at Verant are wrong.  When that happens, we need to know what you are thinking so we can set you straight.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  <P>  Also, these boards provide a means by which players can correct each other.  Although we aren't always very polite in the process, it does get the job done.  I have personally seen an incredible number of posts on these boards that say things that are just not true.  The best way for us to find out when we are wrong is to get responses from other players.  <P>   Everquest is an incredibly complex game.  It's one of the most complex RPG's ever made.  The only way to have any hope at all of getting things right as a designer, is to have access to REAL DIALOGUE, where players can talk to each other and to designers, and get feedback on our comments.  <BR>      <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, where to begin.<P>Ok, they probably have had misinformation from these boards, and reacted on it.. that is one reason why perhaps (read later on) they shouldn't have had so much customer contact.<BR>Next would be the Uber guilds having too much contact and directing the game's changes.<P>But, to blindly state they shouldn't have customer contact, boards etc.. is naive of the way MMORPGs work. The game EQ was built and based on the alpha/beta reports. That's the first lvl, no games testers, no game.<P>Beyond that simple first layer, you have to see that noone at Verant expected Kalaran (FoH etc..) to get to 50 so quick. Some players achieved things in EQ that weren't expected in very little time. Customer feedback from those players enabled Verant to start working on the 'high-end' game. <P>And on it goes... without the comments of players, be they both new, old or uber, the comments are views need to be gotten somehow. Noone seems to read /bug in game reports, or /feedbacks ... so what is left?<P>Petitions and guides in game, and well .. these boards. Problem being though, you cannot control who posts on these boards beyond requiring a Station ID. After that, it's all hell breaks loose. Trolls, morons, idiots, spammers (who is that Grollerdabard anyway) etc.. who, each and everyone one of them, have a right to speak. That's part of that constitution I keep hearing about. <P>Verant just have to fish through the posts and find what they think is appropriate .. that takes time, and from personal experience, doesn't seem to be done too well either. There are no other options open to them, except opening specific topics, locking everything else down..hence directing input to a specific topic. <P>More people use this board as a form of therapy and entertainment than a real source of information. Most use Safehouse/gameznet or server based boards for anything serious. Heh. There's more true, up to date information on Safehouse than anywhere i've seen.. that in itself says something.<P>V - mindlessly rambling in the afternoon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Look, I fully realize the incredible complexity associated with this game. It is amazing. If you are not amazed every time you log in, then you are JADED and complacent. I DO think that this incredible complexity warrants extraordinary efforts to solicit customer feedback. I just do not think that these boards are an efficient method to accomplish that. Somebody mentioned censorship. That makes my point entirely. Someone actually equates Verant providing an avenue for them to discuss issues with their game to CENSORSHIP, a very real life issue with far reaching sociological consequences. I mean, isnt that a little dramatic? Maybe it is the demographics of the player base, I am not sure. I am quite ignorant of the gaming industry, I will admit, but I do know business. And this doesnt seem to achieve the 'bang for the buck'. The fact that the population on these boards is such a small % of the player base makes it nearly useless to begin with.<P>Lets make something clear here, I am not saying that great effort does not need to be put forth in the area of customer service in order for a MMPRPG to be successful. I just think that thses boards are a waste of time in that regard. I get entertainment out of it. I laugh at work when I read these boards. I troll now and again. I add my thoughts on some subjects. It is really an extension of my EQ gaming experience. I really do not think that was their intention when creating this board. I would rather see these resources devoted to more efficient customer service efforts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Manglosh,<P>Very interesting discussion.<P>I too have wondered about these boards (especially Whineplay) and the value they serve. It's true that only a minority of players even know of its existence, and a small minority thereof make up the majority of posts. Also there's a disturbing tendancy toward "fad" posts. Suddenly everybody is whining about hybrids being useless one day, warriors being obsolete the next, clerics and aggro after that. What gives?<P>But on the other hand, these hardcore posters know the game a lot better than anybody else. Say what you want about -Thogg-, and yes his priorities in life may be loopy, but he probably knows more about weapon ratios and hate lists than many people on the EQ Live team. Therefore his opinion may be in some ways more valuable than that of John Q. Customer who just limits his feedback to the online poll.<P>Also, regarding one of your first assertations, this kind of board is not really unknown in the gaming industry. The RTS Warlords Battlecry had an open and active discussion group with little of the acrimony we see here. The lead producer (Brad's equivilent) posted there daily. Also, another Sony game Infantry does the same thing, and its lead guy posts there regularly. (And I think Aradune himself posted regularly back in his Tanarus days, I could be wrong here.)<P>No, this isn't universal. I don't exactly see John Romero having a polite discussion of his project with his customers. And huge corporations are not known for their eagerness to sponsor criticism of their own products. But with an ongoing project like EQ, with its endless updates and patching, some sort of two-way discussion system MUST exist, or the viewpoint of the designers and coders will inevitably stray from that of their loyal fanbase. I don't care how great of a QA team Verant has, there's no way they can accurately represent the player base.<P>This board DOES serve a valid purpose, and there ARE compelling reasons to allow it to exist. Simply silencing the players, limiting their feedback to one-way only, or forcing them into an off-site board like Stratics would only serve to alienate Verant's most loyal customers.<P>We need..<P>1) A MODERATED board, where useless flames / misinformation / repeat posts of the same thing get deleted. It would not be out of the question for new topics (not replies) to be approved before posting. Yes it would be all too easy for Sony to just delete any and all criticism of its product but even I acknowledge some compromises need to be made.<P>2) One or more staff members to both read posts, and respond. This staff member has to be able to get off the high horse occasionally and see it from the player's viewpoint, or he or she will just make things worse (can we say Abashi). And this staff person must respond occasionally, especially to the most glaring concerns, if nothing else than to say "Hey, we hear you." I think Alan's been doing a pretty good job, considering the sheer volume.<P>3) A concerted effort on the part of the players to present valid concerns, and not just spin off into "YOU RUINED MY CLASS, YOU SUCK" flames. Maybe we need to realize that Verant isn't just "out to get" one class and its players. Sure they may be totally wrong when it comes to the Wizard class (for instance) but what motive would they have to just screw over part of their subscriber base?<P>"Hey Brad, some poor schmuck just made a wizard on Tarew Marr!"<BR>"Bwahahaha, wait'll he learns that we hate people who play wizards! Hey, let's nerf that wizard-only dagger just for kicks!"<P>A fun theory admittedly but not the base of a reasoned discussion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway my point is.. and yes I have a point to all this.. sure people whine here a lot, but a lot of times there's a reason why they're whining. A moderated board; a cool, non-arrogant moderator; and cool players who lead by example in posting reasoned topics can only help Verant make a better product.<P>Enumerator</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The boards have been a steady, reliable source of new content and information to Verant.  Without the boards, many of the changes you have seen would never have taken place....  things like tracking and many of the game effecting nerfs (that were good)<P><BR>The forum also allows Verant to ask the players what they would feel if something in the game changed.  There are a few changes that were mentioned on this board that were shot down in a blaze of glory, that would have caused players to flee faster than a wet fart in a dorm room.<P>I do not think that they should change things at their 'whim'.  EverQuest has gone so much further than being 'just a game'.  People have invested so much time and effort into the game that we feel attached to the characters and sometimes their possessions...  i remember a few changes that were made to a favorite door game of mine, Usurper, way back when, that disallowed particular guild wars.  My friend and i had a guild that only the two of us belonged to, and we were on the top of the food chain forever, often slaying 20-30 people while we were offline (BBS)  In any case, when this changed, and our ratings dropped, and we lost some of the things that we had fought long and hard for... it ruined it for us...<P>My point is that you should not just up and make change that would negatively affect the community without first asking.  Sure, you could do it, much like the ruler of the mongols would just wave an arm and have people executed, but it should not be done.<P><BR>Verant needs to realize that they have taken a game to a level that has never really been hit before (ou counts?)  and has impacted the lives of over (whats that count again, Aradune?  =)  They need to take responsibility for the unique community they have created and treat it differently than any other company would treat their games.<P>When Blizzard changed a few key things in Diablo 2, did anyone whine?  A little... but all that required was a little tweaking on the players side, and no biggs... the character took 4 hours to get to level 30.<P>Change something on, say, a level 30 mage, and you are talking about 20 days to make that character.  Not only that, but the time and frusteration of acquiring items, and travel... you have a lot of time on your hands.<P><BR>Verant needs to recognize this difference and treate EverQuest accordingly.  They may not have 'intended' to create the beast that it has become, but they have it... and they need to learn to deal with it accordingly.<P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Forgive me if I'm repeating anything someone might have said in this thread so far, but I don't have much time this morning and wanted to get this out of my systems.<P>I have been following the boards here for a while now, and I've found the whining, flaming and trolling to be very annoying.  Gameplay issues are often griped about BEFORE the person complaining has actually experienced the problem.  Class issues are flamed by people who don't play the class.  The board gets spammed badly when the servers are down at any point for any reason.  And on and on and on.  These kinds of posts shuffle potentially important information and good suggestions off the front page almost immediately.<P>My suggestion is simple.  Don't get rid of the boards.  They are already here and have been used by many, so getting rid of them would simply open Verant up for even more of the (mostly) unjustified flaming that goes on here.  Instead, limit all posters to *one* post in each "primary" board (or category) every day.  If I post a message in general discussion, then I have to wait until the next day to say anything else in general discussion.  If I post a message in wishlist, technical support, class boards, etc. then I have to wait for the next day in each of those as well.  Therefore, each registered user would be permitted one post in each of the "primary" boards after which they are cut off until the next day.  (I'm repeating myself, and I apologize, but I want to be sure I'm clear.)<P>This would allow the more casual viewers to be able to keep up with the threads that REALLY interest them.  It would cut down on the number of SEVERELY off-topic threads (the top 10 ways to improve Star Trek Voyager was amusing at times but clearly took up space that should not have been available to that thread, at least in the monitored board) and would increase use of boards like the server-specific boards.  It would also cut down on the number of threads that are repeated over and over again.  "What?  You don't like the changes in clerics?  Then post ONE response in the "primary" thread about that issue!"<P>The other thing that could be accomplished under this method would be consolidation of the posts that ARE on the same topic under the "proper" thread for the issue.  In other words, because of the reduced volume, &lt;X&gt;_FlameWalker can take all of the single posts regarding an issue like the recent cleric aggro changes and simply put them into ONE thread to accomplish the same thing.  Obviously, this would enable those blue names who are likely to respond to a particular issue to "keep up" with the posts much easier.<P>Now, I don't know enough about UBB to be sure that you can do this, but I think it needs to be done.  As stated above, you can't really get rid of the boards now that they're here, but I think this is a way to improve the efficacy of the boards and perhaps get rid of all the spamming by trolls and flamers so that those who are really TRYING to make good points can be recognized and read.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bah!! Why would anyone assume that the positive changes that have been made would not have been made without this board? It is my contention that MORE positive changes would have been made with a more efficient method to solicit constructive feedback. As far as putting forth more effort to control this board, I again think it looks good on paper but is not the direction they need to take. They would still be attempting to glean valuable information from a tiny percentage of the player base, at high cost.<P>Sure, eliminating this board would cause some dissention intitially. My response to that is...so? Where exactly are they gonna express this dissention? On spoiler message boards? Good, that is where it belongs.<P>Hmm, maybe they will quit their accounts. My position is that if a customer is going to quit the game because Verant has determined to become MORE efficient and effective at customer support, then BYE. They were gonna leave anyways. I know I wont quit and throw away over 40 days played for Verant making a positive step towards efficiency. And lets not fool ourselves here, if Verant does not make a continuous effort to maintain competitive, then they will not stay in business. They have a responsibility to ME as their customer  with tremendous time invested in their product to do whatever it takes to remain in business. The first step is to eliminate waste, everywhere. Guess what? This board is a waste of their money, and does not achieve the desired objective. Rather then waste more money to try and fix a broken concept, I say eliminate it. Try something else, something cheaper and more effective.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Why would anyone assume that the positive changes that have been made would not have been made without this board?"<P>Because of things like Alchemy and Poison.  Both of these systems were in fact stated to be "working as intended" despite MONTHS of /feedback and /bug reports.  Neither of these was even looked at until numerous posts *on these boards* were made.<P>Shortly before the release of Kunark, somebody posted a psuedo-code algorithm to fix a /follow bug--that he had been /bug and /feedback reporting for weeks.  It was even acknolwedged by Abashi and fixed in the very next patch.<P>Shortly after the release of Kunark, VI implemented a new way to handle LinkDeaths to prevent an exploit--namely characters would start walking toward a locked door, /quit out, and come back to find themselves on the other side due to the old way NPCs (i.e., a LinkDead player) handled locked doors (they'd walk through them--and this was a fix to the fact that before THAT, they'd open the locked doors).  However, the implementation created another exploit--characters who /quit out would disappear in less than five seconds.  Thus, in a bad fight, the exploiter would /quit out and avoid the death penalty.  This was reported using /bug and /feedback spanning over a patch.  Abashi himself acknolwedged nobody on the team even knew about it until a poster revealed it here on these boards.<P>Et cetera.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm seeing a few people suggest that the number of posts people can make to a given forum be limited per day.<P>I don't mind the idea of limiting new topics, and making it a little harder to create a new topic (i.e., eliminate the "accidental" new thread by removing the new topic button from the thread page, and forcing users into the search screen before they can post new).  But I think that Verant would lose a LOT of the intelligent dialogue that exists here if they limited total posts.<P>What about all those threads where someone has an idea, and they post it, and some people say "not bad, but did this occur to you, could be a problem?" so the original poster comes back with a refinement of the idea, and so on.<P>How about the people who post something controversial, such as "This GM gave me great service"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> and people "beat them down" knowing that they can't come back and defend their point of view?<P>A system where people could only make one or two posts a day would effectively kill the dialogue.  That would NOT make communication better; rather, it would cause people to start more new threads (a la "Response to Groller, Mangalosh, Absor, and Thogg for Tuesday") and would prevent the people with something useful to say from participating just as surely as it would those who wish to flame and troll.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

VI, created it, we keep it alive withour 9.95 a month, VI is a just another_gaming_company_001 without out our 10bux a month, without VI's grand creation,  well we would not be paying our 10$ a month. This is not like Starcraft of Red alert, in that you buy the software and check for patches everyonce in a while and thats pretty much it. Our game is constantely changing - some for better and some for worst. There were some improvents made in the game, that were orginally suggested by players and this overall helps player morale, which in turn keeps the 10bux a month coming in. I commend VI's attempt to listen to customers.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A board that ONLY Verant can start a thread on, to prevent threads from getting buried if they don't have enough responses.<P>This would include things like patch messages, the class balance posts, changes on tests, etc.<P>I'd also like to see Verant write a brief description of the logic and *discussion* behind each major change, once the change gets placed on *test*. That way, concerned players could log onto test and examine the changes, see the logic behind the changes, and maybe offer suggestions/ improvements/ noticable exploits before the change is made live.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune:<P>Sorry for a mild flame, but this goes directly to advice I posted to you over a year ago that got no response. I'll repeat it.<P>You are the experts at making EQ a good game at Verant. You need to do so. It's funny how often Verant finds a better solution to a problem than any players suggest.<P>Yet the player suggestions ARE crucial too; the issue is how to extract the gems from the massive volume and complaining and such. Withou lpayer suggestions, the changes and improvements would be a fraction of what they are; and the changes do ultimately need to be linked to customer happiness, so the dev team needs to stay in touch with customers. Maybe players don't want than uber new sword nearly as much as they want an improvement to that other spell.<P>Here's the suggestion.<P>Find a way to filter customer input. I don't care if you get an "advisory board" of players (and I *don't mean an iuberguild, I mean a representative group), or if you use the community bulletin boards to get input and give you the distilled version, or if you hire people to cull the information for you.<P>Thousands of posts = too much for key developers to read through. It can both burn the developer out, and perhaps limit their views to get caught up in the mob mentalities, and it's a huge time sink that's inefficient.<P>My own suggestion? Use a combination of asking the community boards to solicit input, and have people at Verant summarize the thread input, and have *occassonal* direct participation of developers.<P>It is important that you do have an effective way for the best ideas to get to developers. It's pretty frustrating to play a game and have a great suggestion and can't get it looked at. Players like to have the sense that a good idea will get attention, and they undrstand that crap input won't.<P>So, use the developers as the main source for ideas and change; and get *filtered* input about both player concerns (so YOU can decide what if anything to do for them) and ideas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey Lanolil, I am not saying that some positive changes werent discovered and corrected with the help of this board. Dont you think that it would have been more efficient to have a working /bug /report system and got these items fixed right away? Why wait months? Dont you think that the feedback system can be improved? Dont cite isolated cases of success and then assume that means the boards have achieved the level of efficiency required to be worth the money. Or that another method would not be more effective. AGAIN, Verant has a responsibility to ME as their customer to continuously improve and eliminate waste to maximize profits and stay in business. These boards are a waste of money. This is a threat to me as a customer. They need to find a better, less expensive way to solicit feedback. And I stress BETTER, I do not want worse customer service.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the overall point that the original poster was trying to make was that these boards *interfere* with communication as much as they help with it. You are right, of course, that communication is the key... but the problem here is that the "communication" on the part of VI is drowned in the clamors of the masses. What we hear is what the players say, not the company. How many posts have I seen saying "Verant, when will we get an official response on..." which appears between 24 hours and 10 days after an official post has been made?<P>Also, they do employ a "customer communications expert": Absor. It is his job to represent Verant on these forums, and he was hired at least partly based on his experience communicating with people on Everquest Express. But if that is invisible to you, it supports the notion that these boards are not "working as intended."&lt;&lt;&lt;<P><BR>I understood the point, Xelene.  My point, and perhaps I did not express it clearly enough, is that there is not enough communication from Verant, and a lot of the communication which does occur is not handled effectively.  Yes, you do hear a lot more from players than from Verant.  As to that: (1) there are a heck of a lot more players than Verant employees and they are paying customers who are entitled to have their voices heard regardless of whether others like what they are saying or not (and sometimes people just need to vent); (2) perhaps Verant should communicate more than it presently does.<P>As an example (and I don't want to go off on the substance of this, merely the way it was handled):  On the recent cleric nerf, there was no communication or discussion in advance ... indeed, there was no testing, which appears to have been intended to avoid discussion.  That looks bad, particularly when it concerns a major game change.  Secondly, despite the existence of the cleric talk threads, which were supposedly to exchange ideas, this was not mentioned at all.  Finally, about the only communication which ever occurred on that was to state that it "needed" to be done.  Why?  Why not tell us *in detail* why it "needed" to be done (as opposed to someone just "wanting" to do it).  In short, that series of mistakes in handling the matter irked a heck of a lot of people ... I know this board may or may not be representative of the total player base, but on that issue people in the game say precisely the same things.  Anyway, that could have been handled a lot better.  Do you really think that situation would have been better if they just dropped the change in with no opportunity to respond at all?<P>As for Absor, I don't want to make any one person an issue here.  I understand his position, but I don't know what background or expertise he has in customer communications.  Overall, I think he does a perfectly fine job, but there are times when he phrases things in a manner which tends to irk people.  I did some time in customer relations myself when I entered the business world, and you always had to remember to restrain yourself, no matter how upset the customers were.  The point was to solve the problems as best possible. You recognize, of course, that some problems cannot be solved and there will always be some customers who are irrevocably upset, but you can still simply be nice to them and treat their views with respect.  Yes, people certainly sometimes push you to the limit, or maybe you've just had a bad day, or whatever, and you pop one off.  But communications do need to be handled in a productive and effective manner as much as humanly possible ... and there is no harm in hiring someone who is specifically an expert in just that.<P>One thing which I think should be done is to put up forum sections for EACH individual class.  As it is, people log in to Gameplay to see if there's anything interesting concerning them, and they tend to just pop into other threads there and drop comments which may or may not be productive.  Let's make it a little more work to intermeddle in things which don't concern you and about which you may know little or nothing.  In fact, practically every third party board in existence has sections for each class, and that does somewhat reduce the incidence of the cowboys patrolling the Indians', er Native American's, threads, and vice versa. It provides a much more controlled environment in which to exchange views pertinent to a limited group.  As for Gameplay, leave it for issues involving the game as a whole.<P>And frankly, there are some people here who obviously just come to start arguments and flame others.  There are people here - and many are well known - who simply disagree nastily with whatever others say.  There are obviously some people here who are completely unhappy and/or frustrated with every aspect of the game, and their neverending crusade is either to kill the game or drive others away. I would not advocate anyone being suspended or banned from the board for popping off once in a while, but the habitual abusers should be warned, and if they don't straighten up, then suspended or banned from the board (NOT the game ... two separate things).<P>But if Verant wants people to be unhappy without them knowing why, then kill the board.  If they want people to quit without them knowing why, then kill the board.  If they want people to be VERY unhappy when major changes are introduced with no exchange of views ... well, you see where I am going.  I can't see that approach.  I just think more effort and expertise needs to be invested in doing this in a productive manner.<P>No company that ignores customer views, or refuses to hear them, is going to continue to succeed.  In order to take customer views into account, you have to get them somehow.  Certainly there should be more polling in the game, but even that has problems.  E.g., most of the controversy in the game lately concerns post-50 play.  But if you put relevant questions on in-game or other polls, you are not going to be able to sort out the responses of people who have actually played post-50 from the people who just think, for some reason, that they can predict what's it's going to be like.  That really almost eliminates the usefulness of the poll.  Certainly some matters could be covered in polls, but I think most of the "burning" issues really are not suitable for polls ... better to see what people are saying and gauge whether their statements are reasonable, well thought out, and fact-based.<P>Anyway, I ramble ...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>VI won't close down the boards, and here is why. They are control freaks to the nth degree. They would loose any ability to control the discusion about EQ on the net. If the only places to post are on fan sites, and the a "hot topic" comes up, that they would like to suppress, how are they going to do it. Send email to the fan site and say,  please close "hot topic" discusion, it's making us look bad? <P>At least here they can delete/lock the viewpoints they don't like. It hinders their ability to control perceptions, and let's face it, the truth means squat. It is the general perceptions that folks hold that matters.<P>On the other hand, removing the boards would make it much easier to get those stealth nerfs, and computer probes in without generating too much outroar. I mean Mr. Smedley himself showed his absolute disrespect for the law of the land during the pc scanning debate, and this is the aspect that would worry me most, if VI shut down the boards. These boards are about the only check on their power to sneak in dubious changes, that may or may not benefit the player. <P>They have provided a forum, one which is similar to the forums of ancient Rome. A place where people can engage in rhetorical debate. In this forum, I will always take the position of Cato to VI's Gaius Julius Ceasar, and the rest of you can continue to play the Marcus Tulius Ciceros.<P>Alaranth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Xelene:  In my case, I suggested this in the "monitored" boards (in other words the boards that are supposedly to address gameplay issues and the like).  By limiting the number of posts per day (I like one, but could probably live with three) in each of these boards, it would force the off-topic stuff (and I consider GM complaints to be off-topic in the monitored board because Verant has already stated they aren't going to discuss these issues in specific) to be shunted off into a non-monitored board, where folks can post to their heart's content.<P>While threads would take a bit longer to really develop in the monitored board, my contention is that these threads would be occupied more by items that really do need to be addressed, rather than by continuous ranting and flaming.  Let's not forget that unless Verant decides that something is a "real" bug, these issues typically take at least weeks to address anyway, so why not have the discussions more able to accomodate the well-consider posts from people who care rather than having every good point flamed and shunted off-topic by those who enjoy doing it?<P>Frankly, I think that a lot of these in-game conflicts, ethics questions and GM complaints need to be shunted somewhere else REGARDLESS of whether or not Verant limits the number of postings per day in the monitored boards, simply because they are "off-topic."  Heck, how many wish-list-type suggestions get put in the general discussion board where they don't properly belong?  Why are the class-talk threads not *starting* in the class boards, which also seem to be monitored?<P>The solution MIGHT be just to make the general discussion board UN-monitored, make it clear that wish-list/bug/class talk can be had elsewhere and create a separate board for discussion of issues being had with GMs and other "non"-gameplay (in the sense it has nothing to do with the mechanics) issues.  Further, any off-topic thread started in the more specific boards should immediately be shut down with an e-mail notification/explanation (form letter) to the poster.  Once the poster exceeds five off-topic new postings in the more specific boards, they should be banned from accessing the boards for at least a month.  THEN, *every* time they post an off-topic posting, they will be banned again for a month from the boards.<P>Draconian?  Perhaps.  Effective?  I found it so when I ran BBSs back in the olden days of modeming.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Manglosh-<P>I think your missing a point about the censorship thing.  This is a game, but it is a social game.  And with that social aspect comes an on-line virtual society.  This is a virtual world, with a virtual population.  Verant, is in a sense acting as the government of this world.  That is why I believe people say deleting threads, removing boards, etc is censorship.  When you say you are dealing with a game community that is right on target, though there are immature, mature, social, anti-social people in this world, the common thread is that we all share the same world, we all inhabit it and we all play in it.  You can't try to create a virtual world where people interact, they set up mini-governments of their own under the guiding government of VI and then expect them to not want to be heard.  <P>People have called this game an addiction and I am sure it has probably already ruined more than one college career and a job or two.  It's because people can play this game so much that although they KNOW it's fiction, it is still theirs.  Something they can control and have power over themselves and others.  You see these boards as a means to discuss only helpful things, etc.  Their use is more than that, they are actually the courts of the world.  On these various boards, people can plea their case, rally for support and actually make changes to the world.  In truth, the boards are a whole nother aspect of the game.<P>*shrug*<BR>My 2bits anyway.<BR>Tinywulf of Veeshan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Babbster:<P>So, let me make certain I understand you.  You would leave this board more or less intact, possibly with less Verant interaction, and create a new "monitored board" where players have a daily post allowance.<P>While I agree that it would be useful to be able to limit mindless bumping, useless flaming, and pointless trolling, I don't think that giving everyone a flat number per day of posts could accomplish that very well.  People will *still* use their one post per day to do these things, and the others will have to choose between "drowning them out" and posting real issues and concerns.  They'll probably choose the latter.<P>I would rather see a "monitored board" of a more traditional format, where all posts are moderated (approved before being posted).  I would like to see a board where only the posts that are being responded to by a blue name get posted, and where the only responses that are posted are ones that add to the discussion in a productive way.  Yes, it would be entirely possible for Verant to gear the conversation the way they wanted to... we'd have to trust that they wouldn't, and then use the General Board to talk amongst ourselves about what's going on.<P>I think that would be far more effective than just giving everyone one chance per day to contribute or be annoying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Matriach,<P>I think that one of the main problems with communication on this board is exactly what you describe.<P>People forget that Norrath is a creation of a company (Verant) and that Everquest is a service we buy.  They behave as though Verant is a government, and we, the players, have rights.  We do not, except insofar as the exchange of money is concerned.  As long as Verant gives us the product in exchange for our money, and that product "works" (runs on most systems, allows connections, etc. most of the time), we get what we have a right to have.  We have no right to have any gameplay changes made, or anything stay the same, either.<P>Not only that, but when we break rules, whether or not we agree with them and think they're just, we lose what little privileges we are allowed.  People complain about name changes because they have a "right" to name their characters.  But they don't.  They have a "right" to a chance at an epic weapon, they think... but they don't.  They don't have a "right" to solo with whatever character they want, and they don't have a "right" to get in a group easily either.<P>Similarly, nothing that Verant does with these boards is censorship, nor does it have anything whatsoever to do with the First Amendment.  Verant can't prevent you from posting on your own site or taking out an ad in the newspaper if you had a bad GM experience.  They can't keep you from saying that a change is bad, an aspect of the game is broken, or a class sucks in any forum they don't control.  They have some sway over third party sites, because those sites get info and benefits from a healthy relationship with Verant... they have no "right" to be allowed to watch the next inter-server event on Test.<P>If we all stop pretending that Norrath is a real world, governed by Verant, we will have a much easier time accepting that which we cannot change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps saying that the board would not be monitored at all would be a bit inaccurate.  What I guess I am saying is similar to what you are.  It would be nice to have a place where we wouldn't have to wade through garbage and could reasonably expect a response from Verant to real concerns.  I don't see the current format as allowing for that, simply because of the volume of garbage being provided.<P>Some have said that maybe Verant just needs more people to handle the boards.  I say, why should they?  If things were better organized, they could easily get by with one person responsible for monitoring each board (perhaps more than one in some cases).  Why should Verant have to hire more employees just because some of their customers are either trolls or flamers on these boards?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Many here have said that they think blue names shouldn't respond, and I have to disagree with that.  In many many ways this is just a graphical MUD.  The thing that always makes or breaks a MUD is the IMP's and IMM's.  Now due to the size of EQ that role goes to a few different groups of people.  One of those is the responses on these boards.  To that effect people need some feedback, one of the highlights for the 'average' person who wanders in here is an official response.  Most people don't give a damn if they got grollerdabard or thogg's attention.  They want yours, even if it's just to say.  Thanks for the imput, but we can't or won't be going that way, or even emails to the poster so it's not public.<BR>   If there is no official response some great idea's will be lost simply because they don't express it fully the first time.  Whereas a couple comments from blue could get the idea brought out into full bloom.<BR>   There is the other side to an IMP's power on the mud.  The ban.  On a mud it's not big deal if someone is banned or suspended.  It can be a lesson, in EQ people are paying for a service, it's a big differnce. BUT, we are NOT paying to post on this board, this is a free service offered by you just as most MUDS are.  Ban people from this board, suspend their board privliges, but leave their in game unnaffected.  The quality of this board would go up dramatically when you could suspend posting right just because some is a jerk that always trolls or flames.<BR>   That's how it should be handled if you want to look at this as a graphical mud, if you view it as something else, well then all I said is nonesense  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, point taken Lanolil. What if they cant do both, improve things elsewhere and maintain the board? What if competitive pressure REQUIRES that something goes? And I assure you IT does. They HAVE to continuously improve. They can never stop eliminating waste and becoming more efficient. This board needs to be one of the first that goes. It must require several full time employees. Each of these are like a mortgage, the outflow of cash never stops as long as they are there. Total cost nightmare here, complete waste in relation to their core business (providing a game). Think about the return on the investment Verant gets from these boards? Hard to measure, but I am saying very little. Unless maybe maintaining player interest while at work or school. Increasing discussion of the product and therefore increasing their player base. But that is a stretch, and not what this board was intended for. Verant needs to get their heads together on this one. I suggest you have a meeting with a dozen of the top game administrators/decision makers. And pretend that you are starting a NEW game, with all your experience from this one behind you. WHAT type of all important customer feedback/input mechanism would you put in place? Would it include THIS board?
