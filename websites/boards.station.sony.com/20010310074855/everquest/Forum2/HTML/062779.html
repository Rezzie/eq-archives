</FONT><HR>I never played AC before. But for what it's worth, I was messing around the Horizons forums the other day & someone posted a thread with a link to the AC site. Where Turbine just announced that they have been working on AC2 for over a year & had a pic. It was not from in game, from maya. So, I'd guess that there's a chance VI has been working on a EQ2 & just has not announced it yet. One thing I noticed about the AC2 thread, was that a lot of AC players were flaming that AC was just a pay beta for AC2 LOL.

</FONT><HR>I'm sure DAoC, Horizons, and UO: Origin will be fine games, and will even be successful.   But they all share a fundamental flaw that will ensure they never do any serious damage to the EQ client base, nor will they ever truly take off the way EQ has.<P>The reason?  Forced PvP.  In order to experience most of those games, you HAVE to subject yourself to PvP. <P>There are many grand ideas about MMORPGs that support the idea of PvP, even calling it intrinsic to the ultimate success of an MMORPG.  However, EQ has completely disproven the idea that people require PvP in their MMORPG experience in order for the game to be a wild success.<P>Also ... look around on these boards, and on the boards about those other games, and just check out the overall mentality.  Not to be disparaging, but face it ... there is a small but persistent minority of players that are intent on doing nothing BUT harassing, intimidating, and ruining the fun of other players.<P>There is also a small, but persistent number of players that seek to "control" the game, or profit from it (as in "uberguild ebay farmers").  While the competition between these players will probably be very fun and intense, the very nature of how they enjoy the game will pretty much ruin it for your "average", casual player.<P>I think that the old-time "MUDs" of the past basically were ENTIRELY populated by a certain kind of person, simply because of their exclusive nature.  You didn't have the average, casual Joe & Mary Smith blundering in on those old skool text MUDs because they were very eclectic and exclusive.  <P>Now, however, EQ is turning the MMORPG market into a mass-market entertainment field, where people go to have a good time after work and on the weekends, instead of watching TV or heading out to the movies.  They have absolutely NO interest in PvP (by and large), and aren't prepared to deal with the antics of Uberguild Farmers hoarding areas & loot for RL profit or just in-game notoriety .. or to deal with PKers bent on developing an in-game infamy for their character.<P>For these players, which in my opinion represent the vast bulk of EQ players, UO: Origin, Dark Age of Camelot, and Horizon will be seen as interesting games, pretty games, even cool games ... but they will never move from the safety and security of "blue" servers and subject themselves to the anarchy and mischief that is displayed by a small yet persistent percentage of the gaming community.<P>I mean, it's apparent on BLUE servers and even on the message boards .. . can you imagine what these guys would be like in a PvP/Ebay profiteering free-for-all?<P>Few will leave the safety of the EQ Blue-Server playstyle to dive into the gaming chaos of a PvP realm, regardless of whatever assurances are made about in-game "systems" to deal with rampant PKing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I keep starting new Chars every time I reach or am near 20...   playing 10 hours a week makes it hard to play at high lvl when you can't find a group.<P>Dark Age of Camelot looks AWESOME.  Shadowbane looks ok.  Neverwinter nights also looks awesome, even thought not in competition with EQ.  I'll probably get NeverWinter night and create my own world, and have a few friend come once or twice a week and live in it.  Working hard on AI where people walk around and have Specific schedule... and take control of NPC's to make life even more interesting...  Have the PC's earn money, and maybe have them build their own Home, or better yet...  start a town of their own.  Like a D&D Pen 'n paper with graphics... hehe<P>Sad thing...  They all are going to come out around the same time...  Dark age of Camelot is about to start Beta 2.  Shadowbane is in Beta 1 phase.  All 3 games coming out by 3rd quarter I believe....  Dunno about Horizon or Anarchy online... <P>Verant need to make EQ fun, and keep it fun.  They are messing with too much...  Messing with things they should leave alone... and now...  They are making it even more certain to lose us to the competition.<P>I still like EQ.... always will...  Don't like what they are doing in the High lvl game, but I don't feel it and don't want to.  I'll probably have tried all classes up to 20 by the time the competition comes...

</FONT><HR>NOT have a sequel to a wildly successful game?  Only if they're truly insane.<P>Meleager has a point.  EQ has demonstrated that most people will avoid PvP if they can.  While games such as Horizons look good, it's probably safe to say that many people (perhaps most) will avoid such games just because of the PvP.<P>It's strange that EQ (and to a lessor extent AC) demonstrated that the vast majority of paying customers will avoid PvP when they can yet all the new games have PvP.  Do you think perhaps that some game designers just can't get a point?<P>Anyway, there will be a LOT of potential customers (probably the majority of people looking for an MMORPG) who will be looking for a second generation MMORPG without PvP.  The first company to fill that niche well will make a killing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They call it a sequal to AC, most of the players call it AC2.<P>Now what frustrates me about this, is I have been playing AC for a while.  Boom all my characters go down the toilet.  Now when EQ2 comes out, I bet you will not be able to transfer characters either.<P>Now I guess this is good and bad.  What I find is the player community is split between two types of players.<P>1. One player cares more about the game itself<BR>2. The other cares more about his characters he has after playing a game for so long.<P>You see I'm the second type.  I probably like my characters and all the work I have put into the game.

</FONT><HR>Cordaru, did you read on Dark age of Camelot...<P>It's Realm PVP.<P>3 Very Large zones wich are the Realms, with smaller ones for Dungeons and who knows what.<P>You can't send a "Tell" to someone from another Realm.  You cannot create characters on 1 server from different Realms.  The only way you could ever say something to a Player from another realm... is to be in line of sight/hearing and talk to them as if they were an NPC.  You can't group with someone from another realm.<P>Now...  If you go in another realm, you're an Enemy.  If you go on PVP Raids, you can get Realm points.  Another type of Experience which improves your character.  If you get those, you'll be more powerfull than someone that doesn't.  Why ?  Cause it will give you a title within your Realm.  Lord, Knight...<P>I reall think that Realm/Team PVP can be awesome if done right.  DAoC is going in the right direction, we'll have to see when it comes out.  As for EQ and Team PVP... it's a joke.  Cross teaming is none-sense... mostly because of the fact that you can't Hit someone from you're race, even though  he's helping someone to beat you down.<P>Can't comment on Shadowbane...   But some of you have to read on Dark Age of Camelot... It really looks awesome.<P>www.darkageofcamelot.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The idea of "PvP done **right**" is only relevant to those that consider PvP even a REMOTE possibility for their gaming choice.  <P>I've read extensively on both Horizons, Origin, and DAoC.  I find their insistence on PvP as an intrinsic part of the game phenomenally short-sighted when it comes to the success of their products.<P>I've read interviews with the CEO of Horizons.  He said that, while it is obvious that by FAR most players do not want to have anything to do with PvP, in his mind it is only because no one has "done it right".  I think that is pretty much the mindset of the game designers behind most of this new crop of MMORPGs .. they don't understand that the scope of the MMORPG has far exceeded its original clientelle base (from MUDs and online FPS's).<P>The bulk of your MMORPG players don't see EQ as a game, or as an avenue of virtual combat/conflict with other players ... they're not seeking an adrenal rush or additional stress to add to their day.  They plug into EQ for the same reason they turn on the TV ... to relax and be entertained.<P>PvP isn't relaxing OR entertaining to those kind of players.  It can never be "done right" simply because they have NO use for it whatsoever.  They want to socialize, work together, have fun, make jokes.  <P>I think that EQ2, when it comes out, will devastate the competition for one simple reason:  Sony looks at MMORPGs as an entertainment medium.  Those other companies look at the MMORPG as a competitive game medium like a a MUD meeting online Quake.  EQ appeals to a much broader demographic than those other games POSSIBLY can.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Origin unfortunatly will never get it right, I don't see how any kind of reputation system will work.<P>But with DaoC I don't see what the difference between a mob and an enemy.  You can't talk to them, trade with them and you are Kos.  You have to go looking for them, hunting them to fight them.  Mythic has said repeatedy that they will make it impossible to invade a land farther than the most nested PvP fort.<P>I understand that people don't want to be picked on, but what is the difference to taking 5 people and attacking an orc camp, versus taking 5 people and attacking a opposing team camp?  With the exception that the enemy is a bit (sometimes) smarter,  And you can't lose experience or loot when killed by another PC.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Two things about PvP in some of the upcoming games.<P>First, if the death penalty is low, or at least reasonable, and your goods can't be stolen and or weren't absurdly hard to get in the first place, getting PKed will be less painful then dying in PvE in EQ... especially at 30+ (the first hell level).<P>Second, all these games are planning on restricting PvP to particular areas that you never need to visit other then for the PvP element, and you will know where these areas are.<P>Think about that.<P>It's like being able to spend most of your time on a so called "blue" server, then bring your character for a brief visit to the so called "red" server.<P>Don't like what you see or hear regarding PvP or pking?  Just don't go into the places where it's allowed.  <P>Do you go into the arena on EQ blue servers?  If yes, you might want to look at the PvP areas in other games.  If no, then you stay out of them the same way you stay out of the EQ arena.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Either way...  This will promote RP to the point where you want to protect your own...<P>This seems to be the best design on PVP.  I've been wanting to try the Team PVP in EQ... but more I read Abashi's past post on "As designed"... more I think Verant has no clue as to what Team PVP is supposed to be.<P>If a Dark elf groups with a High Elf.... they should be killable by their own kind, cause they are crossing a line... not Invincible to their kind while helping to kill them.<P>Verant has a lot to learn...

They bear grudges, become psychotic, obsessed, and can behave in very mean-spirited ways, including harassing and attempting to intimidate others.<P>Yes, this can happen on BLUE servers, but PvP greatly exacerbates the problem, because, unlike computer code, players have things to prove  ... they have insecurities and selfish desires .. they have all sorts of emotional problems that manifest more vividly in an MMORPG where there is no "real" consequence. <P>Human players will ALWAYS figure out ways of "getting around" PvP system checks and balances.<P>As far as "what's the difference between raiding AI orcs, and PC orcs" .. the difference is that I KNOW I'm not pissing someone off, or ruining their day, or making them cry, or creating a game-life-long enemy, or embarrassing someone in front of their friends if I'm just attacking computer code.  There is no risk of upsetting some delicately balanced mentality to the point of them making it their personal crusade in life to "get me".<P>As far as the idea that there will always be places in the game where I can play safe from PvP, I'm sorry, but that pretty much sets up a caste system where all the PvPers get to point and laugh at all the PvEers because they won't go out into the PvP zones.<P>If I can't be non-pvp, sit down and relax, relatively assured that I'm not going to dramatically piss off or upset or embarrass someone, and play the game in an enjoyable, relaxed manner with my friends, and have the WHOLE game accessable to me, I'm not going to even try the game out.<P>I think a lot of people don't care HOW you package PvP ... the mere fact the game INCLUDES it as a necessary component to experience ANY aspect of the game-world ... will keep them from even trying it.  <P>It is far more intelligent to create a world based upon COOPERATION between all PC races than this inane "race wars" thing that designers can't seem to get their heads out of.  Do they not SEE that people are FAR more interested in making friends, cooperating, and PvE-ing than in trying to fight other PCs in some kind of bizarre, enforced virtual-realm parody of World War II?<P>When do the ADULTS bring out their MMORPG's?<P>Sorry, got me to ranting, hehehee.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This way you can't have characters from different realm and warn the other side.<P>2) Will not be able to talk to people of other factions easily<P>Again... You're not supposed to talk to your enemy.  Otherwise, you can slip information easilly.  You can talk to someone from another Realm the same way as you speak to an NPC... face to face.  This promotes you staying with your kind, and fighting with your kind.<P>3) /tell may not be easy (may need spell/item etc)<P>Not sure about this...  But realistic here...  Should you be able to Shout and be heard from one side of a zone to the other Extremity.  Who the hell has lungs so strong they can shout so loud... LOL  As for Tell...  This is like using an IM in game.  From what I read on DaoC, you can chat TO someone in your Realm... they just didn't specify how... so we are assuming they might not have a "Tell" system.<P><BR>Again... REAL Role players will see this as going in the right direction... a chance for Plots, and planning and Pride for your kind.  Not that this will cause problems for Powerlvlers... they will always exist..  but people like to playing a "Role" in a game will be able to do so, much better in Daof then you could ever do it in EverQuest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>U all have to be kidding me.  Have U seen the movies on www.uo2.com?  There is no game in development that will be better than UO2 or correctly stated Ultima: Origin.  UO may have sucked after a while, but UO2 is an entirely different animal and the graphics and spells look great.  U can keep your Camelot crap =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Havok26....  We couldn't do this thread without someone being totally imature about this.<P>There is a way of giving your opinion without being Nasty about it... As if I start saying UO2 Sucks big time, and you're full of it... all we're going to do is fume and destroy this thread...

</FONT><HR>Have to admit that UO2 looks cool, didn't know there were going on the 1st person perspective... <P>I have always been a Ultima fan...  palyed them all up to VII.  Guess I have something else to put in my favorites..<P>Still no need to bash others, considering no one played any of these new ones yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062779-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062779-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062779&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062779&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
