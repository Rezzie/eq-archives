</FONT><HR>      Im just trying to understand the hostility tward FD as a means of pulling, when you have introduced spells into the game that do essentially the exact same thing, such as harmony, numb the dead(i think this does same thing to undead...could be wrong), mezmerize, etc, all these spells do is make it so that you can pull one thing to kill at a time...alright thats fine, great idea...FD on the other hand is a skill, with chances of failure just like any spell, and has just as much a chance of training a large group of mobs into your group, not only that, it is a greater risk to the person pulling because he generally is risking his life, not his groups on his ability to successfuly FD. a caster that harmonizes unsuccessfully pulls the same group of mobs, but you will rarely see the caster willing to go a good distance from his or her group so that if he fails only he will die, they will remain with there group and the whole group will take a beating if not get wiped out.  FD pulling has enough risks inherant with it that it should be smiled upon as something of a 'sacrifice' skill such as your necro rez or cannabilize spells.  <P>     Could you please explain just what makes this so different and evil? the only reason that i see is that the players discovered the use for this skill instead of verant pre-planning on it...is that such a terrible thing? <P>Azith</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Also I think that feign death can fool monsters in situations where normally it would be ludicrous.  I mean, say you are a chasing a monk for 2 minutes and he suddenly drops dead in front of you for no apparent reason.  The sensible thing to do at that point would be to jab him a couple of times with your sword to make sure he's really dead.  I could be wrong but I dont think this happens much in EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Also, when the spell was created, it was _intended_ to be used to break up a group of out door critters. That wasn't the intention for FD. However, the question is moot anyway since VI stated that they don't have any plan on nerfing FD.<P>While we are at it, take a look at bard lull song, you should group with one in a dungeon for bard's ability to pull singles.

</FONT><HR>     I only used harmony as an example, there are mez spells, and other type of pulling spells, either way your still not answering the question Gordon, if harmony stops working at level 30 or so, then that means that monks are the only class in the game that can perform this function at higher levels.  <P>     We have a place in this game with this and its rather obvious that if you take it away, the number of people trying planes, high level dungeons and heavily populated zones will decrease sharply and the monk will not have a class defining ability.  Can you see why we go crazy when you talk about how much we hate FD nerfs? why do we complain or have fits when its even suggested to be happening?  Yes we hit for lots of damage, and at the current level im at (40) i can say yes we do rock as you have claimed.  But even if 90% of the monks in existance dont claim that we are balanced there are obviously enough of them out here complaining that we need something.  Its not class envy, personally i dont care if the warrior will outdamage me by a slim margin at 60 because up until now and into the future *I AM* the tank in any group i join.  The damage output we have is such that no warrior has yet to taunt a mob off me successfully and consistantly.  The Rangers are complaining that they are taunt machines and dont have the defence to protect themselves...well Rangers look at the monks? we do have a bit more defence then you (i think..dont have the chart in front of me) but we also have alot less hit points then you do.  The level 50+ monks are upset Gordon because Kunark expansion only gave them a slim increase in skill caps and let the people they use to out preform catch way the hell up to them.  I really dont think this is a case of 'people wanting something for no reason' its a case of not only are we losing major relative power to the point where we arent the jaw dropping damage dealers we were, but us not getting any really useful enchancements to come along with the increase in levels.  I dont need triple attack at 60 for my monk, but i would like something to show for it rather then a simple 2hps extra heal when feigned.<P>Azith Evertoon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In response to zerogravity's post about shadowmen, from what I can tell, the shadowmen don't necessarily resist harmony, but there are a few spawn points that are so close together that even with the reduced aggro radius provided by harmony, you'll still get two if they're right next to each other. Harmony only reduces the radius where the mobs will notice an attack on an ally and come running..for instance if you harmony a group of critters and pull one from the far side, they'll likely bring others with them as they travel through the group of them and set them off.<BR>FD pulling and harmony pulling each take a degree of skill to be successful, and tricks that need to be known to be good at it. FD is more of a "damage control" angle on pulling, while harmony is more of a "preparation" pull.<BR>Another think I've found difficult with harmony is that some mobs seem to have such a large aggro radius, that you have a very narrow "safe" distance you can cast harmony from and not draw them in the process.<BR>I myself have deep respect for monks that are skilled with this form of mob control. It takes nerves and talent to be able to split some of the nasty groups and come back alive.  Once a monk friend of mine got completely squished by several harm touches in Kithicor..just nasty.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The resists are quite bad on this spell and you have to cast it on all mobs. This spell is never used indoors anyways (mobs are too close for it to work). Always have a druid or ranger to harmony a camp (and I have seen it fail often too in the higher levels) as to break it up, and an enchanter to clean the mes up with mez if it goes wrong. Indeed there is mes for indoors. Enchanters can not take much hits, and mes is extremely dangerous too, it can be resisted or broken by damage which a lot of times means a dead enchanter.<P>By the way I like monks that feign pull too if we have no druid or ranger.

Most sk's that I talk with feel that its bound to happen either upping the rolls for success or something along them lines forcing the skill in to near once in a life time successfull saves. Once again placing one more Hybrid class into the hobbie catigory, in the VI vision.

</FONT><HR>BloodyGrey thats where you are wrong about the class dependency issue.  Ranger/druid is needed for snare in dungeons. Monk can be used for pulling,  shaman for buffs, etc. Each class has its good points and warrior,cleric, enchanter are not the only classes needed. When I play my ranger i am usually preferred over warriors because of my versatility.

In fact, from most of what I've heard of feign death, the roleplaying aspect of the skill in general is pretty absurd.

I feel bad I even bought this spell (all that page swapping in your spellbook to put it in page 50).<P>Instead of wake of tranquility, that works both outdoors and indoors everyone would prefer to have a druid or ranger that casts harmony. Lower resist rates are worth having it work only for  outdoors (and as I mentioned noone will use these kind of spells indoors anyways).<P>If the lull spells would not cause aggro, or have much lower resist I would move it a little to the front of my book again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> would rather see wake of tranquility swapped for harmony (just a wish and joking a little, not class envy).<P>This way the enchanter could take over the job of pulling if no druid or ranger is available, and monks can't do it anymore.<P>It's just an idea, don't want to offend anyone with it.<P>By the way I like people who feign pull for the party.<P>Neferti<BR>TZ<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The reason FD is "against the vision" is because it was not intended to be used to pull mobs.  Harmony on the other hand was planned to do just that...pull single mobs.  That is why FD is frowned on and harmony isn't.<P>Now...to address some of the points that have been made.  I have tried both "Numb the Dead" with my SK and the soothe line of spells (that are aggro reducing spells like harmony) for my enchanter.  These spells prolly have a 30% resist rate for chanters (I quit using it on my SK after like the third time I cast it due to high resists).  A resist with these spells is considered an attack spell and will bring the entire camp on a fail.  On a success, no monsters attack (but I want to say there is about a 30 second duration on the enchanter line...so you have to cast and pull quick).  An enchanter casting this spell will quickly be annihilated under the barrage of pissed off mobs...probably faster than your tanks can pull them off.  A ranger can take the hits for a while.  Harmony also has about a 1 min or so duration (when I was a newb, I thought someone cast clarity on me...it can be cast on PC's on non-pvp servers but it doesn't do anything).  It is also highly non-resistable by mobs under 30 (I think the save may be poison based...most non-undead monsters have fairly low poison resist)...and I believe a fail doesn't bring the camp on you (tho, I may just not have seen a fail =).<P>Verant does want Rangers, Shadowknights, Necromancers, and Enchanters to be able to pull singles from a group of mobs via an aggro reducing spell.  They just made the resist rates so high on all but Rangers that it is not a safe way to pull.  This was the vision.  Verant has RP problems FD...where a mob thinks you are alive...then dead...then alive...then dead...then alive...then dead...ad nauseum.  Even the dumbest creatures prolly wouldn't fall for this more than once.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Now just because the spells you have that are perform a similar function yet you do not use them because they have high resist rates, does not lessen my argument that the skill and the spell perform the same function.  The FD pull is not a 100% gauranteed to work effect, and can kill the monk just as fast as a bad lull / harmony spell can kill an entire group. <P>"Second, you defeat your own argument - if the alternative spells are as good as monks, then why is everyone using monks, and why would it matter so much if it were nerfed?"<P>To your first comment, you may as well ask "why play a Shadowknight when you can play a necro" 'everyone' is not using monks...monks probably make up the 2nd least chosen class on the game after Shadowknights..and i may have that backwards.  As for why it would matter? How would you like it if the mages pet were nerfed or removed from the game and replaced with, oh say..some nice DD spells.  why would you play a mage when its just become a less powerful wizard? Why would people play monks if they are religated to a good attacker but a non-tank.  We would stand right next to the ranger because we DO outdamage warriors for the most part and thus we tank.  Without FD, our defining characteristic is gone.  Make FD pulling obsolete and yes people would have to devise new tatics and such for places like the planes, and higher level dungeons, but the problem would still remain that verant is hoping us all to just push through a dungeon, getting killed by trains of 5+ mobs making us spend that much more time and thus money to do something.<P>Azith <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002718-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002718-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=002718&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=002718&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
