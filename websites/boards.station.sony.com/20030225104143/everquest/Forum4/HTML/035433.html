Other guilds have the application, you need 3 sponsors from the guild to recommend you and then the guild votes on whether to accept you in a week or so.

If you can't be bothered to introduce yourself, I don't know why a guild should welcome you...<P>Likewise, we have a "probationnary" period.

I've pretty much kept to myself with this character, so besides a few friends, she's not well known.

There should be easy guild creation using the raid window.

I've pretty much kept to myself with this character, so besides a few friends, she's not well known. But alas, I've level'd faster than my friends, so now even they are powerless to help me, and feel my frustration. I really don't know what to do besides give up.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>A few questions...<P>Is there one guild that you are truly interested in? Not because they kill X mob that could get you Y loot but because you've had good experiences with them, like their overall outlook on the game and feel that you would be as good of an addition to them as they would be a fit for you? <P>If yes, then post your interest on their board. Let them know that you are trying to work up to meet their standards and would like to get to know some of them on the way. Basically, tell them you exist. <P>If no, then find one. Joining a guild simply because they kill a certain mob is silly. Do you want to enjoy EQ or loathe logging in each day because the people you are around are perfect strangers?<P>You want to join a guild, it is up to you to do the persuing, not the other way around.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

One still popular zone for guilds who average in that area of levels you are in is Temple of Veeshan.  Guilds who do halls of testing for skyshrine armor are there often.  Of course, you need to be non kos to COV to survive there.<P>Also, keep looking at the guild tags of people you are fighting with.  If you see one over and over, it is probably a good, popular guild.<P>Just cause a character is level 65 dosen't mean his guild is too high for you, especially at 59.  Granted, there are one or two guilds per server that require 65, because they do all the high end zones.  However, there are plenty of guilds out there with 60+ characters who would be more than willing to take a 59 enchanter.<P>If all else fails, ask around.  If you are good at your class, and people see you are interested in joining a guild, you will start to get invites.  Be active, be friendly, and know what you are doing, those keys will get you in in no time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That includes mine, and for some really good reasons.<P>We're an offshoot of an old guild on an old server. During my time in that guild, I went from newbie player invited as a RL friend of a friend to a dedicated player to an officer who helped out when the GL was busy.<P>We invited people who seemed like great players: friendly, generous, quality players who had a lot of devotion to the game and guild. Some of these people turned out to be real menaces -- to the game, themselves and the guild, let alone a raid. And after booting those people out (sometimes with a lot of trouble, since you have to catch all their toons in-game), some of us realized that we had an even bigger problem with our GL. So there was an exodus due to the powertrips and lack of ability to communicate effectively.<P>Having been through all of that, we're even pickier than what was a pretty selective guild. That means you don't join us unless you play with us first, and people who ask to join before we've played with them enough to know if we want them get probationary status. It also means that we consider our little (and likely to remain little, since we're choosey) group a family, a group of friends we trust as players and as people.<P>We still have to boot people out sometimes, still have some bad fits, but we're all the better for it. The people who have been with us are people I know will stay, and they bring new friends to us who are assets to the guild.<P>The opposing example comes from some (SOME) of the guilds that have begun to dwarf the servers by virtue of size alone or the ones that started last week because someone decided they wanted to start a guild -- just because they could or because they couldn't get anyone else to take them; the ones that shout to the zone for recruits and accept them all, with few rules of conduct. If someone asks, or even looks at them for a second longer than normal, officers invite them in, no questions asked. In my experience, these are the people who end up being the bad apples, because good examples were never set, rules were never established and their loyalty to a name is more than it is to the people involved.<P>It's a long way to justify having an application process. No, it's not a job interview, but people spend a lot of time in this game, building friendships and guilds, maintaining guilds. It's important to like the people you associate with and to trust they won't ruin your reputation or your experience. And having all the information from the start makes roster management a lot easier.<P>You really have to look at why you want to be in a guild. Is it just to facilitate grouping? Is it to have friends to share information with and chat with in-game and out? If it's the former, you may wish to put off getting into a guild for a bit longer (you've waited this long), and just focus on playing with people you like and trust. If it's the latter, then finding those people is the core of finding a guild that you'll be pleased with.<P>As for why you're having a hard time finding a guild -- IMO, anyone who, as an uberguild, rejects a lvl 59 chanter as too low is either way too focused on the letter of some rule they made (relatively recently, since lvl 60 hasn't been obtainable for all that long) or very short-sighted. If they'll want you at 60 or 62, they should be building a friendship with you now, if nothing else. If they don't want you, they don't want you and should say so.<P>Either way, I'd reconsider any guild that's that picky about levels and try to find one that really wants you as a player. Know also that some people are wary of high-level toons that aren't guilded, as they could have been booted out of every guild on the server or purchased yesterday on eBay. Play or talk with people you like, even if they're a little lower in level, and see if they don't have guild connections in a guild that might be a good fit for you.<P>IMO -- a good overall fit, a friendly atmosphere, in a guild is vastly more important than the exact levels of the players or even being in a guild at all. People will come and go from EQ; some players will level faster than others; and eventually you'll find a group where you're happy. In the meantime, focus on finding good groups, or even consider the dreaded server change to find a guild that will make you happy with the kind of people, the kind of players you'll be playing and socializing with.<P> -- Aeronwyn Faeriefire<BR>    Enchantress of Erollisi Marr<BR>    Grandmistress Jeweler<BR>    Co-GL of Phoenix Ascendent of Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
