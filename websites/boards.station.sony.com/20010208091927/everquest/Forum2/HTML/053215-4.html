</FONT><HR>-Dr,<BR>I disagree. I'm only 48th level. And grant I'm not 50+ BUT I have lived in the 50+ world for well over a month now. I've been on raid after raid against dragons, in the planes, in top Kunark dungeons etc etc etc. I mean, it is the raid game we're referring to yes? I have seen with my own eyes my higher level brethren deal with the troubles at hand. I have myself been pushed aside and/or ignored for being what I am while warriors a few levels under me were regarded fondly and protected at all costs, given full attention by everyone around.<P>I've seen and experienced the lack of equality and the desparity over these issues. Just becouse I myself am not 50+ does not mean I am ignorant to what is going on. So please do not just assume that my being under 50 or anyone else for that matter makes my opinion any less valuable to the "high level" concerns in these threads.<P>Check my posts and you'll see that for the most part my complaints about the class are nearly identical to those others here who ARE 50+ before you pass a generalised judgement.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love playing a SK.  It suits me to play with a casting tank.  However, there are some glaring problems that have been stated that I agree with.<P>The spells need to be improved, and probably geared more towards siphoning off of the opponents.  I would love it if my SK could drain a mob of speed, health, attack ability, armor class, and yes, even small amounts of mana in place of disease, the heat blood series, and the heart flutter.  If these drains replaced our dots, please keep in mind that the drains should be significantly more powerful than our current ones. <P>There isn't much difference between the lizardman hitting me and his brother that i stole 20 attack power from (shoud of hate)<P>The lifetap series is, frankly, pathetic.  <P>My highest is for 45, and I've got over 1200hps.  This tap, coupled with the other weak spells and all my mana, does not make me the offensive or defensive equal of a warrior.  Or even a monk/rogue/pali/ranger.<P>Only fear, in open areas, can do that.  This being, what, a lvl 8 necro spell?  I'm still using a lvl 8 spell at 40??  And it costs me more mana??<P>I don't mean to rant, but this is a class i love to play, and i don't want to be useless to groups after those few levels it takes me to get into planes.  <P>Many people here were right, that SKs as a defensive class was not fitting with our skills, our caps, or our spells.  <P>If this is going to be the SK ideal, we need more defense.  Inherently.  It's bad enough grouping and explaining that you have attack skills, but a warrior's better.  and you can pull, but monk's FD is better.  and you have spells, but they are expensive, weak, and overwritten by necro spells.<P>If any change is made, let the first be our spells.<P>A SK with a shield is not my ideal, I prefer a 2hs, but we should, as before, have the option. Not balance by greater shields.<P>P.S. any values i've used may be a little off; i don't play the game by solid numbers, just trial and error and some fun.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well so far I've read just about every Shadow Knight forum/discussion/description/post. I only have a level 15 dark elf shadow knight and play the Saryrn server and well as a basic summary i think that what most high level people post 50 want either better offensive/defensive caps with better discs and such to help with the uber mobz... <P>And i just want to say that not all shadow knights are ogre/troll... actually majority of the shadow knights are small/med races who can't bash and i think this is kind of like forcing us to play bigger races just because of the extra attack... i think this is really wrong because many people like me play dark elves because we like them and rp them not because we want better stats and such... i think a nice solution would be either to let all sk races have slam or an equivalent like headbutt =) dark elves with their horned helms should have a great graphic for this... LOL j/p. Anyways they should replace our bash with kick or something. <BR> <BR>Summary: give sks better lifetaps, post 50s give us better caps or something with the addition of better disc. I'd be extremeley happy with an extra attack like kick while using 2hs... otherwise i'd have to play an ugly ar$e troll/ogre</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fact of life that anyone who's ever whined about being a ranger will tell you:<BR> <BR>Offense means nothing if you can't take hits. Ask most rangers,who can draw mob attention fast but then get chopped to bits faster than any other hybrid would.<BR> <BR>The only thing upping our offensive skills(with the exception of bash,which is as much defense as offence) would do is up our taunting without giving us a method of living through it. And we don't live through it at 50+ as it is.<BR> <BR>And they aren't going to give us both. What do you want-the ability to hit like a warrior,or the ability to survive hits like one?<BR> <BR>Warriors hit things and use the taunt to get their attention. We should be able to:<BR> <BR>1) Taunt<BR>2) Effect-over-time spell them with multiple types to keep atop the hatelist<BR>3) Bash/Slam accurately enough to stun lesser mobs and add in another dose of pain to the hatelist<BR>4) Use our spells to further our survival in close and heavy combat AND have those spells increase our taunt capacity still further<BR>5) Live owing to our defense skills despite being able to keep the monster on us literally the entire fight,assuming timely healing and support.<BR> <BR>Giving rangers the "offensive" role fits them as hybrids-because they can compensate for it if archery is done right.<BR> <BR>Giving paladins a "defensive" role fits them as well. <BR> <BR>Giving us a "defensive" role fits here,too. We are the shield against the light as the paladin is against the dark gods. And that is what the class should be focused towards-holding a target on us and using that target as the method to survive being beaten on by that very same thing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Input on Shadowknights from my perspective.<BR>We've got some pretty interesting stealth abilities that start kicking in at 30th that make us kind of useful for dungeon reconnaisance, and at 35 the addition of the hide skill at least gives us a chance to recover from a bad situation  where another class would simply be killed.  I rather like this aspect of the class.  We're one of very few classes in the game that can simply stroll to the bottom of a dungeon without being hassled (provided you still exercise caution, stupid invis tricks are sometimes needed, and some places are still just plain off limits). <BR>Other things tho.  The pet's gotta go.  Nice idea, lousy execution.  It's like a cruel prank played upon us.  The pet's so weak, and carries a trunkload of additional risks, that it's simply not worth it.  Also, once the aforementioned stealthing abilities start to kick in, the pet's gonna die whenever the need for discretion arises.  Waste of mana and bone chips IMO.  <BR>Harmtouch.  I like what's been done with it recently, but still think it should be a lifetap.<BR>Master taunter idea.  I kind of like this role in a group.  If everything is swinging at me in my groups I'm a happy camper, just wish that my drains and dots cost less and went off faster.  A goodly portion of my offensive punch is supposed to be derived from my spellpower, which is dandy by me, but... I use a large chunk of mana in order to exercise my full potential in combat, and after an extended killing spree in a group I'm often left OOM for the most part of the night, particularly if I'm pulling.<BR>Anyways... about all that comes to mind at the moment.  <BR>-Abraxis Townrazor<BR>36 Iksar Shadowknight, Brell Serilis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Skimming through here, I like more and more of what I see.<P>I would like to throw my hat in with that hatelist/taunting idea, and I can relate to being OOM the whole night when I'm pulling. At this point in my character's career (level 30 and traveling about) I can out-taunt almost any warrior of comparative level. Debuffs and DoTs tend to annoy a mob quite a bit more then a well-armed strong-man or woman hefting large weapons and spewing imprecations.<P>I am actually finding, for instance, disease cloud to be a very effective taunter. With that and a handful of other 'pain' spells (taunting) I can easily distract a mob off of the warrior (and anyone else, for that matter) for atleast a few seconds. After a few moments, the mob will turn its attention elsewhere (if I am not the only tank). I am then open to drop another DoT on it to regain its attention.<P>Personally, I would like to see the SK class more geared towards that Pain angle, with increased /something/, whether it be caps, hp, disc, or what not, to be able to take it. However, if spells truely are resisted as much as they are in later encounters then that pain element is not existant. We become a warrior quite a few levels lower then what we are if our spells can be used for not.<P>The invis, hide, fd, etc., are /very/ fun to play with. I am touring the world now with those (sans hide, 5 more levels for that).<P>Pets are useful for vengeance runs through Black Burrow and Soloing. ; )<P>Rikis Lana<P>30 Iksar Shadowknight of E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's a couple of ideas:<P>How about a mid level weapon that SK's can quest for?  Paladins are the supposed opposite of Sk's and they get Soulfire.  I remember before the expansions that the Dark Reaver was the only unique SK weapon.  Maybe a mid level weapon with a Dark Reaver as a part of the quest.  Something with all around the same difficulty.  And a similar cool graphic.<P>Also I like the idea of giving the small SK races kick.  It just seems right and also seems like a good counter to the large races getting slam.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Hell we need them more than they do. If not give use a new set of Ac+ damages sheilds that increse with levels so where getting a ac bonus at higher levels so we can stand with the warriors not best them but be a good alturnative.

</FONT><HR>Well, I have been playing since november 99 and have played several different classes (almost all of them).  But, here are some problems I see with the class and a few change suggestions that I do not think would unbalance the world of Norrath based on all the other classes I have played(yes I know most of these problems have been stated, but we are trying to get things changed so they need to be repeated).  The lifetaps are a joke.  This whole line of spells should be increased.  I would recommend our lifetap spells should all be increased 1 spell level and we should get a new 1 at every new spell lvl(I mean tapping for 11 damage at lvl 28 doesn't really change anything).  Fear and darkness are very nice but get resisted way too much.  Make an SK variant of these spells that are less resistable because these are basically the only useful spells I have gotten yet.  My pet?  He makes every little green thing in a dungeon want to kill me.  He's decent for fear kiting in wide open areas or as a small dot in groups though most of the groups I get into don't even want me to summon him because of the added attention he'll draw.  It would be nice if they were about the same lvl as me without necessarily increasing hp and damage output just so I won't have to spend all my time killing greens to protect him or have it so ours pets are not KOS to anything, they'll actually have to hit something to make the mob attack.  <BR>Taunting is another weakness I see for SK's and all melee classes.  I've never been able to taunt anything of a dual wielding double attacking warrior for more than about 1 second, and then maybe once a battle.  I know that warriors should taunt better but if the warrior is not actively trying to taunt (i.e. hitting the taunt button) than I feel that I should be able to do something about it and not be limited by my extremely low damage output.  I think making taunt more effective in general would help out us SK's as well as all melee classes.  Furthermore, bashing needs to be improved.  I like carrying my shield but the extra 9 damage and they extremely slow refresh rate doesn't make up for the added damage of a 2hander.  I think making new shields that actaully had a bash damage and delay would be a nice game enhancement for all melee classes (even dual wielders may feel the need to don a shield).  I mean, they make all sorts of weapons with AC, why not shields with damage and delay?  Of course, they should not be as effective as weeapons (they are mostly for defense).  Lastly, I would like to talk about harm touch.  It's a nice last ditch effort, but really is pretty useless.  I don't know how everyone else feels about their HT, but I like to save mine unless I really think that I will die and can not make it to safety first because of the loooong refresh rate.  When I do use it, it's usually towards the end of a battle when I'm really hurt and, most of the time, I end up dying anyways.  So, I like the idea of the HT lifedraw.  It still wouldn't heal us anywhere near the amount a lay hands heals a paladin and would give us a much better chance of surving a lot of bad encouters.<P>Just a few little things I've been thinking about and everyone keep posting, things may change because I like playing my SK even though he's never been able to keep up with my necro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well.. There are 2 major problems with SKs. The first is their spells. We get them FAR TOO LATE. I read back that somebody suggested the spell levels get bumped back one and i agree. I should not be getting a near useless necro lvl 16 pet at level 30, i should be getting it at level 22. Has anyone actually looked at the damage that pet hits for? If it weren't for my characters life at stake, i would break down in a fit of laugher when i saw the pet hit for 1 dmg, if it could even hit at all.<P>Somebody (a necro in fact) was even watching me the other day and asked why my pet missed so much. The simple answer to that, which i gave to them, is that SK pets are weak and near useless for the level they are obtained at.<P>Heck you could just kill all the pet spells and give us a cheap DOT. Does the same job but a bit easier to manage. But then again, pets are fun..<P>As for the other spells. 45hp lifedraw. Uses about 2/3 of a bub of mana, bit more. I've got ~1100hp. A full bar of mana (rarely do i have a full bar of mana, and it takes an eternity to regen) would get me around 300hp. Now, there's no point in using this in a fight because the mobs that i'm trying to solo at my level are hitting me sometimes for double 80dmg, and i'll just get interrupted anyway because i NEED to tank for my pet or it dies in about 5 seconds. So, obviously it must be to reduce downtime while solo'ing or something, but i can tell you this, i still have a LOT of downtime while solo'ing. If it was a tough fight (often is because my spells get resisted 50% of the time even when fighting middle blues), then it will take 1-3 full regens of mana to go and lifedraw a green (which still negates the use of lifedraw if i get too close and it hits me) and get back to fighting again.<P>The lifetap range of spells NEED to be as powerful as they are to necros. SKs are triply penalised there. First it costs us more (double?)mana to cast, no? Second, we get it twice (more sometimes) as late as necros. Third, it is nowhere near useful for the actual hp we have. That's a bit unfair, to be penalised 3 times over. Makes the idea of a 4th xp penalty a joke doesn't it? In fact, especially after the 5th melee penalty. No wonder the xp penalty was dumped. Still 4 penalties there to get rid of though. I didn't know penalties were stackable.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>And now back to my other point. Hybrids are obviously meant (but not designed) for solo'ing. If a group has a warrior and a necromancer, sk's are not needed. I can barely tank, i can't cast many spells because the necro is casting the same ones or better ones. You might as well just give another DOT or spell "Summon Shadow Knight" to a necro and delete all SKs because that's all i feel like. My pet is a weak DOT to me. And i'm a weak DOT/pet to necros/groups.<P>Now that's not too bad, i don't mind being useless to groups, but i'm also useless for solo'ing.. Beginning to wonder why i even chose SK. I guess i didn't know what i was getting into.<P>I heard it mentioned that because SKs recently got the DE-NERF (yes, that's what it is) of the experience penalty, that you'll be keeping that in mind while tweaking us (presumably this means you won't tweak us as much). How completely unfair. The experience penalty was inappropriate all along so it's no bonus to us. It's a de-nerf.<P>And i'm going to back up the point that we're not defensive. SKs should actually be capable of dealing out the most damage of all classes. Let me put the question to you.. If there had to be some sort of humanoid guarding the gates of hell, what would it be? A shadow knight. And what/where/who is the most awesome and feared and destructive force in existance? Hell and all of it's occupants. Shadow knights are pure killing machines upholding the 'virtues' of hate, pain, and death. They are the only ones capable of giving you a pure taste of hell through sword, and magic. They'll bite you, they'll stick knives in your eyes, they'll lob your limbs off with massive blood ridden swords, they'll boil your blood and burn you alive (if you're still alive) and then feed you to their hungry brain-eating zombies pets.<P>In no way should our defense be reduced though for better offense. We take hits hard enough as it is.<P>The point is really, that SKs are just pretty average at whatever they do, even below average. Our fighting skills are pretty poor, and our spells are weak (if they don't get damn well resisted). We're penalised ridiculously in our spell department, and we're penalised in our fightning. The only thing we're good at, and this only goes for dark elf sk's, is to stand around and look damn cool. But apart from that, we're not particularly useful to groups or solo'ing. We have no strong points at all. Shadow knights are a brilliant idea and bring thoughts of immense power and fear when pondered, but in "reality", in the game, we're pretty boring, weak, and misrepresented..<P><BR>Actually i thought of something while writing this post. Why the heck are undeads aggressive towards necro and sk? We should be "warmly" to all of them. They are our brothers, our servants, our masters. And is there a "Charm Undead" spell? And if not, why not? Get rid of those inappropriate CLERIC DD vs undead spells and give us control over (some) undead mobs (perhaps only of our own level and below).<P><BR>And one more thing.. I don't want to see any pre-50 twinkies posting on this forum because what you say about things such as offense and defense is completely out of whack with normality. We don't all have armour and weapons worth 100+kpp. I'm level 35 and still got a few bits of bronze for example. I hope that pre-50 sks get tweaked, and i hope when the evaluation is being done that proper equipment for that level is used. <P><BR>Aaand one more BIG suggestion.. Why not bring back the xp penalty but make us stronger across the board? Perhaps 90% warrior, 60% necro, therefore 50% xp penalty (we're 150% of a character). Even 80% war, 70% nec is good, probably better. Would suit me just fine. The reality is that some classes/races are just inherently, by their own definition, more powerful than others. Don't try to balance them too much. XP penalties are good if class or race definitions call for it. Like trolls for example. I believe shadow knights, and even other hybrids, do call for more power and an xp penalty. But, *sigh*, i suppose that can't be done now that there are a whole bunch of SKs there who would effectively bypass all xp penalties up until their current level, and heaven help you if you 'nerf' them by de-levelling according to the 50% penalty.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heyaz,<BR>I am currently playing a lvl 33 sk, and i am happy with her; the problems of sk seems to raise after lvl 50 and the last changes on exp penalty made me really grow faster.<P>So i don't want to talk about technical questions  nor about high lvl and their disciplines...<P>At lvl 33 i play my sk as a puller and tank in charge of taunt mobs off the casters. My role is genrally appreciated, but i notice this :<BR>     #1 : when in a group i use 3 spells only (steal strength, heat blood and lifespike), darkness don't take hold, disease cloud can be used to taunt but i rarely use it.<BR>     #2 : if i don't have an enc to clarity me i run out of mana (pulling prevents me from medding), to avoid this i just use steal strenght and heat blood, cast them at the begining of the fight and that's all.<P>Then, while in a group i am 90% meleer and 10% caster and that's a pity.<P>The problem is not our power, we are powerful indeed, but is the variety and originality of our spells. Instead of thinking about sk as a necro/warrior combo, you should, in your next games, think about them as an original class with particular skills and its own spells.<P>BTW, IMO harm touch is pointless, if you make it powerful, you break the balance with other classes (especially on pvp servers), if you don't, it is useless. You shouldn't have created this, that's my 2cp.<P>I think the shadow knight concept is extremly rich, you could create 1000 differents spells line or skills for a shadow knight and still be "realistic" without making them a mix of two other classes -wich is easier to understand but much less enjoyable.<P>You have to bane the idea of "hybrid" classes, that's definitely not a good concept, and find out what is the real own nature of those classes. when you're half a class and half another thing you're never as good as those to classes, and when you re grouped you become quite useless. If we had our own skills and spells we 'd have much more fun.<P>EQ is my favorite game, but with a bit of imagination, EQ2 could be the definitive RPG worldwide...<P>Once again i love my DEF sk  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>You actually did a good job, but you can still be far better.<P>Thx for reading, sorry for the spelling, thx for having creatd EQ, please make EQ2 the best game ever - i know you're able to do it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Tandainu Tumaifuh<BR>Lvl 33 def shadow knight<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the Lifetap HT suggestion that has been thrown about.  Given that the Paladins LOH is about two to three times more potent, usable on anyone and unresistable, making the Harm Touch into a LifeTap would not be remotely unbalancing by comparison.<P>The idea of allowing both HT and LOH to be used more frequently at the higher levels could also be useful.  Subtract three minutes off of the refresh time at 51, 52, etc until a level 60 Paladin or Shadow Knight might be able to use his special power every 15 minutes or something.<P>The current SK Disciplines bite, and not only in comparison to other classes / hybrids.  <P>Leechcurse is really addressing an inbalance in <BR>the utility of Harm Touch at the higher levels and reflects a change that should perhaps exist already as a baseline, not as one of the classes 'special disciplines.'  The same line of thought would have led to saying that the 55th level Paladin Discipline would cause LOH to come with a side of Abolish Disease and Abolish Poison, which would be rightfully seen as a <BR>'ripoff' by the Paladin community, just as a long-needed Harm Touch upgrade at 55th, slotted in place of one of our promised Disciplines is seen by some Shadow Knights.<P>A special SK Discipline would be something more appropriate, like an AoE Lifetap (like the Maestros) or a massive Lifetap strike ability for 18 seconds (like Venril Sathirs) once a day.<P>If *nothing* else, you'd think a Discipline named 'Leechcurse' would have something to do with lifetapping, since the Leach line of Necro spells is a Lifetap line of DOTs.  While I disagree with the idea of a HT upgrade as a Discipline, just as I would with a LOH upgrade wasting a Discipline slot, it sure *sounds* like a Lifetap from the name...<P>Necromancer spells oriented to melee, such as Grim Aura, Vampiric Embrace and Banshee Aura should be available, unnerfed from the Necromancer versions and available at lower levels to the 'melee necromancer' Shadow Knights.<P>Grim Aura seems suitable for level 9, Vampiric Embrace should be every bit as effective as the Necromancer version and Banshee Aura (the normal Necromancer version) should be available by 30th level.<P>Finally, Crusader pieces are both too rare and too random.  I dislike waiting five hours for the third Crusader to finally spawn, killing him to find while this one does have a Decaying Piece, it is the same left gauntlet that I have watched rot before and don't need, not the visor I have been waiting for.<P>Have different Crusader spawns throughout Cazec-Thule and have them drop specific Decayed pieces so that if I need the Decaying Mail to make a Darkforge Breastplate for my Epic, I can just go search for the one Crusader spawn that drops Decaying Breastplates and Decaying Mail and not watch a dozen pieces that I don't want rot over the course of a long and frustrating week of camping greens.<P>Although this would seem to be out-of-line for an Epic quest since almost all of them seem to involve hogging spawns that would be worth good  experience to a lower level party...  (The Cleric one being a fine example otherwise, with it's own unique triggered spawns.  I expect like most comparisons to the excellently-written Cleric Epic quest, the only thing to come of this will be the usual refrain, "Well, the Cleric Epic was clearly too good, since everyone else is class-envious that their quests don't have their own mobs, triggered spawns, etc." similarly to what Shamen were told when they complained that their Epic was vastly inferior to the Cleric one (and every other Epic discovered by that time coincidentally...).<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all, I have a lv41 Iksar Shadowknight (25 days played) (all pre-exp change). He is my first character, I picked Iksar because I thought they looked cool, back before i knew anything about the game. BIG MISTAKE. AC bonus BAH! (my ac is lower than any other SK I know 700 somthing), Regeneration BAH! (after 25 its not even noticeable), Master Swimmer BAH! (anyone swimming into a wall while eating lunch can do that), and Master Forager BAH! (it doesnt go up in skill and at 100 forage its a waste of time, I buy my food). At 41 I cant solo a blue in OT and Granchist in WW kills me and he's green. Why solo? because finding a group is hard for a sk,  when you cant tank.<BR>So I got smart, since i cant wear any class-defining armor anyway BE,UMBRAL or DF, my SK now farms low greens for loot and pp to sell. And I started a halfling druild. Result? My Druid is 35 and a half with 5 Days playing, ohh and i solo'd two Granchist's yesterday. Im gona take my druid to 50 asap and then start a Ogre Warrior and twink the ell out of him.<BR>Dont get me wrong I love my Shadowknight, in my heart of heart's I would rather play my SK than anything else, he just suks. I cant get groups, I cant solo anything but greens, and I know its not "just me". My Druid has no problem getting groups (or soloing for that matter, as earlier noted) I have people sending me tells to log on my druid when im farming with my sk.<BR>I did group yesterday with my SK for the first time since the EXP patch, and low and behold I saw movement in my yellow bar! (wow), but I still suk as a tank, I was the main tank and the cleric was chain casting heals on me, we had a bard manna song, enchanter, and a cleric (awsome combo) and the bard was out damaging me and the cleric was running out of manna. I felt bad. This is not the way a SK should feel (Ohh BTW I have a MOSS farming rocks!).<BR>OK enuff of my story, here is my opinion on improvements. Every 5 skill points represents a full level so I imagine at 60 SK REALLY SUK (their skills are that of a 55 warrior or less maybe)<P>1 Bash - Skill must be upped to warrior level<BR>2 offence - upped a little (just narrow the gap)(due to increased difficulty of MOB's in incounters skill gap's actually get wider as levels increase even though numeric value of the skill may stay the same)<BR>3 defence and all defencive skills should be upped to warrior level (thats right exactly the same)(It is the ONLY way)<BR>4 HT - should give HP to you (take our pet's if you'd like, thay are nothing but a green aggro machine. fun to "play" with and make fun of with other pet classes)(Our spells suk and we get a pet, pallys get superior healing thats fair? What's the best heal my druid get's? superior healing "p")(make our HT worth thier LOH)<BR>5 Give us a better disc at 60 like that Xilth dude (sp?) said.<BR>6 Give us Uber Taunt Skill higher than any other class. (I used to be awsome at this)<BR>and fianally<BR>7 I want to wear blood ember! (I know Noctivigant is out and is very nice but imagine a Iksar in that reddish black BE)(I would look sooooo coooo)<P>Classes should not be defined by an item/armor that only some races can wear. Shaman/JBB SK/BE and im sure there are others. Iksar ac bonus is nothing! take it away and let me wear plate! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Nope, I'm a Shadow Knight, and my fate is sealed.<P>You wanna make the classes balanced.  Get rid of them and give me a practice-your-skills, quest-for-ultimate-power, serve-the-greater-good(-evil) game where my only limit is the choices available, instead of limiting me to a choice made when my avatar in everquest was created.<P>Bloodletter, Dark Elf Shadow Knight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To the previous poster...<BR> <BR>They aren't going to rewrite the core rules of the game here. We've got to work in the system that exists.<BR> <BR>To the Iksar-what are you wearing? Have you got something at least Dreadscale-level for AC? Or even Ornate Chain? Have faith,there's plate-level armor for Iksar in Velious if you can get to it.<BR> <BR>To the level 35 who's still using bronze-whaaaaaat? Come on,I'm completely untwinked,made every copper working for it,and I had nothing worse than fine plate by ten levels below you. Big mistake I see a LOT of SK's at lower levels making-they go full bore for levels and don't take the time to earn decent gear. Then they hit the AC wall HARD-and we seem to hit it before warriors do. Make the money,get the gear,then level up a bit. Repeat as needed.<BR> <BR>I can as it stands sit there with Siphon,Disease Cloud,and Engulfing and out-taunt any warrior my own level and even within my grouping range,though I might actually have to use the "taunt" key to do it. SK's have crowd control of a form that is unique to the game. We don't mez. We ubertaunt. Given the capacity to take the hits(forget about dishing them out like our opponents) we will have a unique role in the game ALL THE WAY UP TO 60. We have soloing tactics that fit our roles as the ones who dish out pain. <BR> <BR>We call that "fear kiting". Scaring the big bad beast around and around while lil Goner and I give it the death of a thousand cuts. I know we ain't getting that at later levels. I'll enjoy it now.<BR> <BR>Don't give me warrior-AC armor. Give me warrior-cap defensive skills and drain-debuffs(over time and instant) that let me weaken the opponent and add to my own defense at the same time.<BR> <BR>I think a spell that lifedrained the opponent to create a damage-absorption buff would be a good replacement for the lifetaps. Then give us the appropriate lifetaps for our levels in those ranges as well. I should already have a 45pt lifetap by now-that's ONE round of hits worth of healing at my range. So I'd have an 11-point shield and a 45 point recovery spell,both of which drain HP from monsters to fuel. <BR> <BR>Just lobbing more ideas into the ring for Absor and company to absorb when they're back from Baltimore.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Its amazing to me how many people use this forum to ask for better gear.  Gear does not make the character for the most part.  It is what you can do with your gear that counts.  For the most part(except for a few uber weops) most weopons are not that different in stats, some are on the upper or lower end yes, but it is what you can do with it that counts.  You will note that we actually have many 1hs, 1hb and one or two 2hs weopons that actually exceed most warrior weopons in stats.  Our damage delay ratio's for the noctivigant blade, MOSS and other weopons are great, amongst the best in the game.  The key is a Warrior has higher skill limits, and has duel wield, so he can use two at once, effectively doubling damage output/chances to hit in a fight.  GEAR does not make a character.  It helps out some, but I would guess unless you pick up some uber weopon, nobody has ever picked up a piece of gear and instantly transformed into "The Instant Super Duper Shadowknight."  Most improvements are made incrementally, small, a little here, a little there.  To improve our class we need to discuss what our class can do on its own, not ask that they drop more fat loot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;&lt;actually majority of the shadow knights are small/med races who can't bash and i think this is kind of like forcing us to play bigger races just because of the extra attack... i think this is really wrong because many people like me play dark elves because we like them and rp them not because we want better stats and such... i think a nice solution would be either to let all sk races have slam or an equivalent like headbutt =) &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>As a Troll Shadow Knight, I have to take exception to this idea.  I take a BIG experience penalty for regeneration AND the ability to slam (as well as infravision).  Because the burden of my racial penalty is paid by me alone and no longer shared with the group, it was shown by a player, and agreed to by Absor, that I now get LESS experience per kill for the same mobs than I did before the experience change, even WITH a full group and the new group bonus.  But that's the price "I" pay for my race.<P>With this in mind I see only 2 things happening to 'balance' all SKs getting slam.  Either my penalty is reduced or smaller races penalalties would be increased to make up for this new abilty.  Otherwise, there would be even LESS large race SKs than there are now (and you DID say the majority were NOT large races).  <P>If we get a "head-butt" ability, or even kick, then you could use an extra, possibly 'stunning', attack while using a 2 handed weapon while I would be able to use the new attack AND slam with a 2 hander.  You can then choose to use a 1 hander and a shield if you want bash and use the additional attack.  <P>Hey, if you want slam and my penalty is reduced, great, it'll make me level faster.  If we all get a new "additional" attack, I keep my penalty, but slam is left "large race only" fine as well. It would leave us BOTH with hard choices to make. (Remember, I give up a HUGE amount of AC, 25+, if I opt not to use a shield). <P>Barring that option then we should just lose all racial distinction and make everyone "ONE" race, giving the benefits of all: a smaller frame (and that in and of itself IS a penalty.  Follow me into Sol B or Thurgadin, just to name a few, for examples) high intelligence, ultravision, regeneration, natural armor bonuses while still being able to wear plate, and the ability to slam. <P>It's the differences in races that make those within a class more interesting.  Yeah, I can slam, but there will be more places I cannot get into due to my size (I'm a slave to the shrink), I don't see quite as well, I'm not as smart (30-40 pts less, our strength is only 15-20 points higher (GOD I wish I could wear a hero bracer . . .)) and I now gain experience at a much slower rate.  But that's the price I pay for choosing the race I did, and not being able to slam is the price you pay for your race.  We made those choices when we picked our race and that hasn't changed (as opposed to the BIG change in the gap in abilities, and usefulness post Kunark and SOV that we DIDN"T choose when we first started). <P>- Vorrek, 52 Shadow Knight, Quellious </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>InnoruukSK continues to give arguements for defensive skills, raised and I am now leaning towards this idea. Even if we deal out major dmg, we won't be able to live long enough to be worth having. BUT I have a solution to if offensive route is gone.<P>Ability/Spell called Fear of Retaliation<BR>It completely wipes SK off of hate list for a several seconds (10-20) or instantly<BR>RP: Like name suggests, who in their right mind would try to retaliate against an SK 8p<P>DONT'T make it some sort of takes forever spell to cast, OR once in a blue moon disc, cuz we will still probably be doing less dmg to MoB than a Warrior, but want to be the Uber-taunters when necessary. Make the casting time/refresh time (if disc) SHORT AND CHEAP, cuz it would make up for lack of D, but allow us to be better in O.<P>IF you go D here are some suggestions (previous ones should also be included IF we go D route)<P>A)Fling<BR>Instantly makes caster top of hate list for 10-20 secs, BUT repels MoB away from group/caster<BR>RP: The power of the SK should be too much for mere creatures to even touch him.<P>B)Inferno<BR>Makes the caster gain a dmg shield (around 10-100?) that lasts around him for 1 min(?, or +/-), grants the caster improved, AC, HP, Defensive skills<BR>RP: The flames of "evil" burst forth from you to scorch your enemy, which makes them "less" anxious to hit you. You play w/ fire your bonna get burnt 8p<P>C)Immolation<BR>Some of caster's mana and/or staminia is removed and MoB casted on loses some defensive skill points (10-30) and gives them to caster for limited time<BR>RP: The fires of "hell" help an SK, while the fires burn and weaken the MoB<P>D)Challenge<BR>Makes caster on top of hate list for limited time. MoB loses defense, but gains in offense, while caster gains defense, hp, and ac AND loses offense<BR>RP: SKs may be arrogant at xs and make challenges to those they consider weaker. The SK gets ready for the charge, while the MoB gets ready for the attack<P>Well, I'll probably come up with more ideas soon.

</FONT><HR>Those spell changes all look pretty good.<P>Some other reccomendations  for spells that would work well in the SK arsenal are:<P>-Possibly an upgrade to the pet buff later on (intensify death at 52 maybe?)<P>-pet heal maybe<P>-upgrade to dark empathy<P>-fast acting dots such as venom of the snake to replace or act in conjunction with slow acting (and not too usefull) dots like boil blood<P>-shielding line of spells<P><BR>-screaming terror (would be immensly useful in group situations)<P>-root (Paladins and Rangers both get root, and it is a line that necromancers have too)<P>-Harm Shield (Paladins do, after all, get divine aura)<P>-move vampiric curse to a lower level (49 is where I would put it) The point of these spells is that thay act slow, but heal more than the DD lifetaps of the same/similar levels (at least with necros). As it is it's kind of pointless to have this spell at level 57, even without the changes that are being tried out on test. I currently do not use this spell, but I feel that it would be very useful but not overpowering at a lower level.<P><BR>I know a lot of this is repeated from my previous post, but I felt that it wouldn't hurt to bring these ideas up again in light of the recent changes on test.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And that's without buying anything else until then.<P>And heck i'm even a bit twinked by friends and come across some ridiculously cheap and lucky deals.<P>If you had 100% FP at level 25 then you've got some good friends, got some damn good unusual deals, you're lying and you're a twink, or you're a complete loot monger and ninja looter.<P>I just hope when SKs are considered for tweaks that examples are made from REAL sets of equipment appropriate for the level of the tweak, not twinked sets.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

OR ALL THE OTHER STUFF SAID SUCH AS:<BR>lifetaps that are as good as Pallies heals (ie 45 lifetap and their 100 heal, is not balanced), STUFF TO MAKE US WANTED ON RAIDS!, Pet problems, Bash problems, specialization problems, lack of discs, lack of uniqueness, lack of defensive skills, etc. As you can see there are a lot of stuff that VI (you guys) just didn't bother to add/include/create/test.<P>Oh ya by the way, WHY did you have these threads if you didn't even post a summary/responded OR even waited for the talks to end? Was it just so that you made people think that most of the things they want might actually have a chance of being included?<P>"Art is one of the greastest things we have.

</FONT><HR>My standard answer to anyone who asks me who twinked me-<BR> <BR>My sewing kit did.<BR> <BR>I was trading smiths packs full of paddings for armor,and I still sell stacks at 60pp each. Amazing how many of those you add up when you actively hunt for em in say....Nektulos.<BR> <BR>I simply kill everything that's within reach of my spells. I mastered tailoring. Every HQ bear is 75pp. Every 20 lesser skins is worth 60. Raw silk bits for a few platinum. Cured silk for a few more.<BR> <BR>Fine plate by 25th was no problem at all,as I worked for it and got it. I was still getting touches of xp smacking kodiaks in the Commonlands when I got enough silk thread up to run outside Nektulos for a while. <BR> <BR>Just most folk think of xp first,and money last. I thought of money first,and xp last...I'd probably be in my mid 30's by now if not higher if I'd gone straight for levels,but my gear would be utter crud.<BR> <BR>We don't "depend on our gear",but there's a certain standard that makes life decent at any given level.<BR> <BR>We'll see if the Test changes go through,and if so how the beefier lifetap strategy and the rest make meleeing easier(how much,I know not) along with the new spells.<BR> <BR>I still wonder if Defense going up alone will make enough of a difference for high-end SK tanks,though.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok well... i tried reading the majority of the posts but as you said it hurts my eyes too<P>anyways... kudos on the changes made on test, they're heading in the right direction, but to me... they're still not good enough...<P>allow me to argue my point<P>monk: offense 252   defense 252<BR>(i still think that making the punch and kick stills un-hinged would be a great idea, it would put monks back up there with the rogues 1k dmg backstabs, guess it didn't go over too well...)<P>rogue: offense 252 defense 252<P>warrior: offense 252 defense 252<P>shadowknight/paladin: offense 225 defense (finally) 252<P>ranger: offense (finally) 252 defense 200<P>(these came from castersrealm)<P>now as far as i have seen... I being a SK compete with warriors and other paladins for a spot in a group.<BR>and from the way it looks there rangers would be offensively leaning, so i would think they should compete with rogues and monks in groups, but why so much more defense for rogues and monks? if your going to talk about balance reasons i see no reason rogues and monks should have more AC than SKs and paladins which they had for well over a year (like i said kudos for actually fixing it) now, i could bring in the dodge/parry/riposte things, showing how in many ways they still out-tank us, but we always have the higher HP so ill leave that alone, but spells NOWHERE nearly make up for the lack in melee ability, warriors can invis and shrink (via armor), thats more than i as a SK could ever do. I would suggest further increasing hybrid skill caps to bring offense/weaponskills up to 252 and ranger defense up to 252, in the end, classes are stilled defined by armors, weapons, and certain skills they have (backstab for example), warriors were never ment to be much of a damage dealer, i doubt that bringing offensive skills for pally/SKs will make them damage dealers either, and rangers ARE fighting in melee combat along with rogues and monks, should they not be able to take a hit just as good?<P>i've thought about this for a long while... we are still 75% melee, this is and always will be defined by our armor and weapons, i have no trouble out-tanking a monk/rogue/ranger at my level when this are still balanced, with my taunt skill i feel secure being the main tank<P>my suggestions for your "balanced" melee classes are:<BR>raise warrior taunt skill and taunt of a 2 handed weapon so its once again a viable choice for warriors in extremely high levels<P>make the monk "strike" and "kick" lines un-hinged, i always thought monks were supposed to be the supreme damage dealers PEROID<P>raise hybrid caps on offense/defense to 252 PERIOD, it will make the game more balanced and once again hybrids can melee in there with the big-boys<P>oh yeah and another one... paladins need their heal spells altered as well, they were equal to druid/shamans in the healing area before, and now druids/shamans just got a big increase in healing power, now clerics don't need compinsation, but paladins do IMO...<P>guess thats it</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053215-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053215.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053215-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053215-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053215-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053215&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053215&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
