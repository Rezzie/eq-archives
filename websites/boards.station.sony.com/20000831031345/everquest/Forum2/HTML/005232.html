</FONT><HR>Hi,<P>I must say I am quite dissapointed of the EQ quest designing team. I'm just got level 24 and started doing some real quest. One of the first ones i wanted to do was the Testament of Vanear, nice druid item. I go to Qeynos, get the book and the first page then go to high pass. I then learn that I have to wait for the NPC with the second page to spawn. Problem is, the guy spawn once every 7 hours!!!<P>So, I have to *SIT* and wait 7 hours for the spawn. How fun. I wouldn't mind playing 7 hours, running around all of Norrath and get 2 bags full of items to get the second page. But sit down and do nothing for 7 hours is not what i call fun playing. I think you guys could stir up more imagination and redo some of those quest to make them "fun". <P>From what I understand, most quests include a *long* camp to get an item. If you want to control how often the quest is done, just give it more requirements (20+ no drop item list).<P>Was just hoping questing was going to be more fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For just about any of the non-NODROP quest items it seems to be more efficient to spend your time hunting for Plat and just buy the item.  Take the Buring Rapier quest.  Not only does a rogue (non-TP class) have to get booze from just about every continent, they have get a cask from the Gnoll Brewer in BB.  I have hear of people camping for weeks to get it.  And that's only half the quest.  Now, do you know how much plat I could make in a week's time?<BR>The problem with so many quests is that not only does the MOB have a huge spawn time, they then have a place holder, and to top it off they may not have the item you need.  I think big V wanted to make these items rare and for some, they succeded, but in most cases they also made the quest boring.  Sometime the quest just doesn't make sense.  I really wish someone would check the quest team for drugs...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To Kalin-Khan:<P>I also am doing more than one quest. However, can you imagine the incredible stroke of luck needed to actualy find the NPC that spawns only once every 7 hours when you dont camp him. Sooner or later, even if you do many quest simultaniously, you'll have to camp the guy. Which brings me back to my point: sitting down and do nothing is not fun. I would rather kill the guy 70 times (1 spawn per 6 min during 7 hours), get some xp, some loots and have something to do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;So, I have to *SIT* and wait 7 hours for the spawn<P>You aren't required to "sit and wait" for the NPC.  You are only required to be there when the NPC spawns.  That can happen at any time, and you could choose to leave and come back later to try and complete the quest.  Now, if the item is such that you *choose* to sit and wait, you've made the decision that the item is "worth it", which is your decision to make.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;From what I understand, most quests include a *long* camp to get an item. If you want to control how often the quest is done, just give it more requirements (20+ no drop item list).<P>More requirements do not limit the amount of items that come into the world.  The proliferation of items in the world is tied only to the amount of time it takes to get the rarest item.  Even if the quest had 20 one-hour steps, taking you at least 20 hours to complete it, the rate at which items from the quest can come into game is one/hour.  The more items that come into the game, the less valuable the items, and the less prestige garnered from acquiring it.<P>-Gordon<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Are you really interested in rewarding the players that earned the prestigious items?<BR>Relly? Then why is Ghoulbane tradeable? Why is the Holy armour of Ro tradeable? Making these items No Drop would prevent high level item farmers from taking over the spawns and selling the prestigious items to those who are undeserving.<P>Sure, some mobs are on 7-8 hour spawn times, like the AC or Oracle. Someone with a fulltime JOB could not possibly do this except on a weekend, when the servers are full to capacity. Others are on a short spawn time (relatively) but the item is a rare drop. So you have to spend hours and days killing the mob over and over until it drops.<P>SO you're saying I should check out the Shin lord room, wait an hour,nope just a rusty sword this time, I'll come back tomorrow maybe.

Therefore people sit and wait for hours and hours and hours at a very boring place, with nothing to do, because that's how Verant designed their 'quests'.  Sorry Sir Abashi, but I don't agree with the way you guys have implemented quests at all.  Having played a monk for most of my EQ 'life', I've gotten completely jaded on 'quests'.  I've spent upwards of 200 very boring, very UN-fun hours in the Beholder gorge (anywhere from 2 to 16 hours at a time)  and I've NEVER EVER seen that stupid alchemist. Sorry, but that's NOT right.   I also spent over 100 total hours waiting for the misty alchemist.. fortunately I happened to be in the zone with a secondary when it popped once... was able to log in my monk and get a port there before anyone else killed him.  I was LUCKY.  (if you can call gaining an item from a creature 30 levels below you lucky after 100+ hours of waiting.)<P> Questing should be involved, and tenacity should be rewarded. In this case, the only reward is more waiting.  I've given up completely on quests in "everquest" because they're just not fun to do, nor are the rewards usually commeasurate with the time/effort/risk involved.  <P> It really wouldn't be hard to make quests more fun guys. You have the engine, you have the means. All you need is the dedication and someone who cares enough to make them fun.<P>I'd sure enjoy it if that happened.. but from your answers to questions about questing, I'm not holding my breath :/<P> Zandramas</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thing is, if nobody camped, you could walk by and check if the spawn were up. If nobody camped, we wouldn't have lists for the next 30 people to get an SMR, most of whom will play for 20 hours straight and fall asleep. If nobody camped, we could DO dungeons.<P>Problem is, people do - maybe because it's safe, maybe because it's efficient, maybe the game encourages it - and that makes it tough if you don't want to. If you're not camping Dyllin, there's no way in hell the guys who've been waiting 7 or 14 hours are going to let you take it and walk away. If you want to do Dalnir, you'll have to avoid the groups already camping the "nice rooms."  In my mind, it's a shame, since it really takes away from the game...<P>If Verant could find another way to limit the rate of items entering the game, that would be a very good thing.  As things are, there's no way I'm sitting on my arse for 7 hours, or 2 days, or 4 freaking weeks to get some "prestige" - I'd rather have fun.<P>-Redi</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey, you just gotta love Gordon. He tests monks vs. warriors with the BEST (non-VP) stuff that you HAVE to camp for, and claims the results are valid, and for monks to be effective that they need the "new" weapons (WEAPONS???!! for MONKS?). Then he chimes in here saying "it is your choice to wait for the NPC to spawn". Of course you can go do something else, and check back to see how many dr00ds are there at the time to compete with, but then as far as Verant is concerned, they are still getting your monthly charges, so who cares, right Gordy?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Contrary to Abashi's comments you really don't have a choice but to sit there, unless you are willing to wait weeks and even months of your real life time to get the item.<P>With all seriousness the part you need comes as a requirement to do the quest and that you KILL a specific NPC.  That NPC spawns every 7 hours.  If it is in High Pass then I suspect it is a gnoll that you need to kill (but am not positive).  It really doesn't matter.  If the mob is "happened upon" by those many OTHER players in the zone who trying to get experience (which usually is the case), then you will not know the next time it spawns unless someone tells you.<P>We both know that the only effective way to ensure that you get the item is it sit there for 7 hours.  That's 7 hours of real life time.  It is boring and an unintelligible way of playing the game.  Not your fault.<P>The design of the game, the overcrowding in some of these zones, the overpowered mobs, the chance happening of the spawn all contribute to you being required to sit and wait those 7 hours (and many times not by yourself).  As I've said before.  Most zones are overcrowded, all spawns are camped, the spawn times are known and the spawns are killed as soon as they pop.  This is descriptive of most zones where experience is good and you are a certain level.<P>Someone described the zones in this way:  at lower levels there are usually an abundance of places to fight for experience; at levels 15-20 your choices are fewer but still plentiful; at levels 20-30 your choices are becoming limited; at levels 30-40 you have very little choice; and at 40-50 you have serious limitations.  This was the case pre-kunark and is still the case to some degree for certain level players.  Kunark mobs hit far too hard for players in the 25-35 range.<P>As a result the players stick to the known zones with mobs of specific types where they know they won't be pummelled, die and have to spend the next two hours trying for a resurrection or running back, waiting on slow and broken boats/pathing.<P>As a result the zone you are camping this item in is probably heavily camped.  Because it is the mob, if you were to leave, could be killed as soon as it spawns (which is most likely the case).  If it is then you are going to have to wait 7 hours more (or keep trying back over the next several months of your real life to get the item).  For this reason alone you can see that Abashi is wrong in his descrption of how to go about getting the item you need.  It was manipulative and was intended to cover up the very deficient aspect of this part of game play.<P>You didn't write your post pointing this out to have Abashi tell you that you don't know how to play.  You wrote your post because you were frustrated at having to sit for 7 hours to get an item.  Others pointed out to you that there are other camps that are worse.  (E.G., the camp for the summon corpse spell in Paw, which is 32 hours).  What we have seen in the case of the summon corpse spell case are a bunch of uber-guilds that bind (or camp) high level players near it, determine the spawn time, and when the time is up they log in their high level character (or gate there), kill the Ishva, and take the spell and robe (when it drops).  This keeps others from getting the item that have a legitimate need.<P>See Abashi doens't play the game enough or isn't good enough to understand the true dynamics of it and he's shown us time and again that he doesn't.<P>So, I understand your perspective and encourage you to either find something else to do with your real life time or you keep trying to get Verant to understand the defects in their ways.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sad thing is if you did decide to camp this thing and spend the time you would eventually find out that the item doesn't help you much really.  There are extremely few items in the game that affect your game play, jboots being one example.  Take for instance acquiring Golden Efreeti Boots if you INT is already 200.  Problem is the stats are horribly broken in the game in terms of affecting your character in any way.  Brad has said he would have done this differently if given the chance again.  Go buff your character stats silly with a Shaman and see if it really affects your character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all - don't bother with the Testament unless you really want that "book in 2nd hand" look.<P>Get a Charred Guardian Shield.  On my server they go for 500 or so.  You give up 1 wis and 10 mana to get 10 AC.  A far better bargain, especially for clerics who desperately need AC.  If you don't have the money, get a few 30-35ish friends, tanks preferrably, and hit Sol A.  Gnome faction may take a hit.<P>Abashi - bull about not having to sit and wait 7 hours.  If you don't, 4 other people will be in line waiting for him (hoping that the ones in front of them will leave)...3 of which were waiting on the last spawn and timed exactly when he would appear again.  And of course someone will TP in at the exact moment he spawns to KS him.  EVERY single quest with a rare spawn is usually camped 24x7.  <P>I have yet to see the Glacier Bear NOT camped, Regis is almost always camped, the Goblin Alchemists, etc. etc. <P>So basically what you are telling us is the way to win these "prestige" items is to be willing to do something you have said repeatedly is not in your "Vision (TM)" of EQ - CAMPING, and that for hours and hours on end.  <P>This is preferred to completing difficult quests, working on faction, learning trade skills, destroying an evil nemesis of our city, race, or god, traveling to new and exotic places, sneaking into an enemy's stronghold and securing some item hidden within, etc., etc., etc.  There are TONS of ways to make quests interesting, dangerous, exciting, and still limit the frequency of these items entering the world.<P>The 10 or 20 step quest idea WOULD prevent the items from entering the world as quickly, because most people would still be trying to do the quest DURING PEAK HOURS, so they'd still clash.  <P>Also, they would still be investing around the same amount of time in the quest, which many are not willing to do.  <P>And by the way, except for super-elite 50+ items, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in this game should take more than about 10 or 20 hours to obtain, that's just ludicrous.<P>And it would be far more interesting than sitting on your a$$ for 68 hours hunting low greens hoping you hit the right spawn trigger.  <P>As many, many people have said, we do NOT mind if the quests are LONG and DIFFICULT.  <P>What we mind is that they are BORING, FRUSTRATING, and almost impossible to complete by anyone who has responsibilities other than playing Everquest 24x7!<P>Vivid Dreamings, 32nd Enchantress, Hand of Mana officer, Craftsmistress, and Linguist on Nameless<P>Proud owner of a Tome of Vanear...which I got back when it was thought that wisdom helps trade skills...now I use it for my Barbarian Shaman impression.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Lira,<BR>I do agree with you, BUT the original point is still valid.  I play much like you do, I kill alittle here and there.  I rarely stay in one spot.  BUT I have never recieved one piece of equipment I am wearing from playing this way.  I have had to buy or be given them all.  And while this works fine, it is very un-RPG-ish.  D&D would be REALLY boring if the only real loot you ever got was money and you had to buy the cool stuff.<BR>The main point of this post is that no item should take hours if not days to get.  Sure, Abashi is right that you don't have to camp that 7 hour spawn.  BUT if you don't it will take even LONGER to get the item.  If it takes a minimum of 7 hours to get the item if you sit right there, think how long it would take otherwise.<BR>Sadly this game caters to the lowest denominator.  The campers who have 20 hours a day to play.  Verant is afraid of them getting things to easy so they mold the game around them, and those of us who don't play that way get hosed.

</FONT><HR>I think the camping issue shows just how far out of touch with reality Verant is.  Gordon has stated before that they have actually INCREASED the spawn times for a lot of quests to discourage camping.  Now, while that might make 'X' item enter the game less often, it doesn't seem to decrease camping at all.  <P>Actually, making the spawn time longer seems to reward camping.  X item used to drop every 4 hours, now it drops every 12.  Guess what, if it's a popular item, the price just went up substantially to compensate for the increase in spawn time.  Also, since a 12 hour camp is out of reach of most casual players, many will now buy the item instead of trying to get it themselves, raising demand, and thus the selling price, even more.<P>No, you don't HAVE to have that item, but how many level 45 warriors have you ever seen with full bronze and a couple of Langseaxes?  They don't HAVE to camp/buy that Exe axe or SSOY's, but they're going to be pretty worthless in a group with out them.<P>If Verant REALLY wants to get rid of camping, they need to make nice items either NO DROP, or come off random mobs.  Encourage players to DO a dungeon, walking through killing everything in hopes that the item they want drops.  Not everything should be NO DROP of course, just those items that remain stationary.  <P>I know NO DROP goes against The Vision(tm), but I can't really believe The Vision(tm) involves a group of Paladins seeking Holy Swords finding that they can't get a Ghoulbane right now because there is a necro/mage/wizzie sitting there camping it already who doesn't want to give up the camp, but will gladly sell the pallies a GB for a mere 3500pp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi said the time it takes to get the rarest item is what effects the rate the quest reward item goes into the game.  This isn't true.<P>There are quests already in the game that don't even require items but take a long time to do them.  An example that comes quickly to my mind is the Squad Ring quest in Rivervale (to do the quest you just have to raise your faction with the Rivervale guards a lot).  I did this quest while playing about 3-4 hours per day, and it took me 2 weeks to get it.  Others I have talked to have had similar results.  Of course, it's possible for someone to do this quest quickly if they play 20 hours a day, but, Abashi has said in the past that people who play a lot should have an advantage in game.<P>I found that the nice thing about this quest was that I was always doing something and feeling a sense of accomplishment as I did it.  I could log in for an hour, kill a few goblins, and log out, knowing that I had made progress.  When you are camping for an item, when you log in for an hour and the NPC doesn't spawn or doesn't spawn with the item you're looking for, you've just wasted all your time.  You might as well have not logged in at all.<P>Perhaps making it so that only one of these quest items can come in every week or so is part of the Vision.  That doesn't mean that it should be.  Abashi has stated that people who play 10 hours a day should have an advantage over those who don't.  That doesn't mean that there should be whole areas of the game inaccessible to the "casual" gamer who "only" plays 3 or 4 hours per day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
