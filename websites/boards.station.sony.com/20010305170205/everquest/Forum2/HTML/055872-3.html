</FONT><HR>I've been trying to parse through the talk threads as I could, and what I've found is that there are a lot of requests for defensive skill cap raises.<P>To this point I must agree.<P>We wear very light armor, and should have a higher cap on our defensive skills.<P>Disarm= Please! we don't need this.(equal to Warrior at least)<BR>Defense= please increase the cap on this.(equal to Warrior at least)<BR>Dodge= we are light and Agile.  Why our abilities (equal to Warrior at least)<BR>Perry= increase this please (equal to Warrior at least)<P>Offense= I personally don't care if this stays where it is.  Rangers are a very damaging class as it is, a defensive cap raise would benifit us far more than an offensive increase (we are offensive enough without it =P).<P>Spells= Possibly make Jolt available at lower lvls.  Add Bind/Gate at 39, we are after all 1/4 Druid/Cleric/Shaman.  Do NOT add ports, I am a ranger, I travel the land, I do not port around it.<P>Archery= just make trueshot work.  Make it do equal to the damage we are capable of in mele, and reduce the time to use.<P>That's it for now. I will repost if I think of anything else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It procs a push-back, not a stun.  The push-back is a spell interrupt (well chance for interrupt).

</FONT><HR>One thing about ********TRACKING*******<P><BR>I understand tracking is to be improved for rangers at some point in time.  As it stands right now, it IS a class balance issue.  Druids and Bards are better at tracking mobs that are already in a zone.  Ranger tracking is superior ONLY when a mob just pops!<P>Bards and druids have a shorter tracking range and get a greater chance of detecting rare mobs that have been in a zone for several hours or more.  The ranger will never see the mob since his range is so big and many mobs have since popped to clog up tracking.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thurgadin quest armor for Rangers aka Runed Scout armor is chainmail look. I'm very disappointed in this. Rangers have had banded look all there life until Thorny Vine came along..WOOT, celebration. Then comes Tolan Darkwood, more plate, more celebration. Then Runed Scout comes a long...an upgrade from Thorny Vine with better AC yet it is BANDED? Please, I was incredibly happy to throw my Ivy Etch in the fire for the plate look of Thorny and Tolan only to find that I have to revert back to banded? And I think the look of this banded is worse than regular banded...it makes me look like some dude ready to hit the clubs in NY.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I noticed in a couple of the class-talks the disarm skill has had a few complaints. Absor mentioned to one person that removing the skill would not affect any other skill nor be considered a nerf if people don't find it useful to begin with. The problem as I see it is that the skill with it's low cap and high failure rate basicly makes it an unuseable skill. If skills are given to a class, that skill should be something that the class can DEPEND upon in their career. If a skill has such a low rate of success it therefore becomes a token skill. The same can be said for certain spells. Let me reiterate, a combat related skill is something a class should be able to depend upon else it serves no purpose. Now a non combat skill like forage makes sense to have a low cap for some classes as a means of survival in the slim chance they cannot find food and water. It's not a skill they need to depend upon but only in extreme cases. Not so with a skill like disarm. If I have that skill I need that skill to work else what good is it if in 30 to 40 fights or more it might just work once. That is my take on it and I feel it is something that needs to be looked into.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rats, I for got one other thing. Club of Ice ocean. It cannot be wielded even though my class and race fit it's criteria. Now I am not sure but perhaps it is either a bug or verant made a weapon that is level limited on it's wielding and not on its proc. If that is the case, I think the level limit on the proc is sufficient and does not warrant a level limit on the wielding especially since there are other weapons with better dam/del that can still be wielded by lower level characters but not this one. By the way, My ranger is lvl 39 and my warrior is lvl 31. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok. I'm going to try to limit this to what i consider to be constructive changes and NOT a wish list. <P> We need to be more durable. Bar none this is the biggest problem facing the ranger class. Over aggro a MOB and suddenly you become either a huge drain on your healers mana or someone he/she has to res.(Neither of which, needless to say, helps your group)A ranger must not only battle the MOB he is facing but fight a constant battle with his own aggro as well. Big aggro doesnt mix well with low HP low AC and an inability to "un-aggro". There are 2 basic ways this can be fixed and it really depends on which version of the "vision" of a ranger you subscribe to.<P>If we are tanks then we need a whole lot more HP and a whole lot higher AC items. End of story.<P>Personaly I dont believe that rangers are tanks. We were reffered to somewhere in the SK class discussion as "damage dealing hybrids", and if memory serves we have been described as by VI employees as "light agile chain wearing fighters". This requires a different set of possible solutions. <P>Someone in an eariler post adocated giving Rangers a Monk like AC bonus so long as we are below 130 stone weight or so. This is an excellent idiea please look into it.<P> If we are ment to be "light and AGILE" why do we only get one AGI buff and why such a weak one at such a low level? Perhaps we should get another at a higher level. <P>We need more in the way of defencive skills. Adding new ones would be a good option, but personally I'd rather see the skill caps go up on the ones we allready have.<P>We are provided (eventully) with a method to reduce a MOBs hatred of us in the form of Jolt at level 55. The level on this spell needs adjustment. Level 55 is MUCH to high to place such a vital spell. A more appropriate level would be 39 (or failing that 49, but It is absolutly a spell we NEED past level 50).<P>I think that once rangers are more durable the big problem has been solved, leaving only a few minor issues.<P>Many of us are patiently waiting (some of us not so patiently) on the improvements to track. Of course I'd like to see them in the game ASAP but a simple ETA would be nice.  Same thing on the fletching upgrades. <P>Personally at level 51 I havent a clue as to the details of the trueshot disc, but others say it needs a look. May as well mention it while I'm here.<P>Devotie Phoenix<BR>51 Pathfinder<BR>Bristlebane Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor.. <P>1) Please up our hps. We are equal in hps to a pure caster. That shouldn't be. We are melee, and our weakness should be our armor, not our hitpoints. Can you up our hp's?<P>2) Please address our fizzling post 50. I cant tell you how many times i fizzled Chloro and went from Full of Mana to completely Out of mana, and never got the spell off. I fizzled ensnare about 3-6 times per try. Can you address this please?<P>********<BR>3) Also can you please look at this next topic very carefully....<P>I did a test with attacking a SLOWED mob. and what i found was that my attack speed was so fast that the RIPOSTE of the mob I was attacking was completely smoking me. I Couldnt beleive the amount of damage I took. SO.. When verant made all those modifiers to help 2HS, this includes the mark of karn and also the damage output.. they never accounted for the RETURN-FIRE from the mobs. Please fix mark of karn back. It is balanced if a 1hs heals more than a 2HS, becuase they are getting hurt more. This also includes any damage shields on the mobs.. Faster might be better on paper.. but it has it's up and it's down. Balance Mark of Karn better please.<P><BR>4) Archery needs a minumum damage. I have 228 in archery and i once missed a rooted mob 12 times in a row.. TWELVE times.. that was such a waste of combat time.. I eventually had to run and zone.. and voila... more downtime. Can you fix this miss miss miss i keep getting?<P><BR>5) Need to seriously look at the spells on the Tolan's armor.. We get a lvl 14 spell on our arms. Do you know how funny it is that i do 99 damage over 1 minute with my arms at lvl 57. This needs to be looked at please. Also, our Tolan's BP need to have a better spell on it. Every class's BP has a spell that they can use at least 1-20 times during a Battle.. Ranger's only need this effect maybe once every 4-8 months. Please change to something we can actually USE. Warriors and rogues get heal and str.. we could use something that would help helping in reducing downtime too, like Skin like diamonds, or group cholorplast for the BP effect.<P>6) Disc's: can we have a choice of two archery based /disc's<P>a)/disc Trueshot: would do 2 minutes of max to 2 times the normal damage.<P>b)/disc Sureshot: would do 1 shot that would inflict 800-1200 damage. Guarenteed Hit. One shot only. This isnt overpowering as we have spells that van do 450 DD single cast. SO a /disc isnt so bad, but it allows us to use our bows more.<P>Both reset after 72 mins<P>7) Fix foraging please. Can you please ask if they can give us a message that says you can't forage right now, but... make it not grey it out. Just annoying. very very annoying.<P>thanks..<P><BR>mec<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My major concearn with Rangers is our complete lack of class defining skills and roles.<P>My perception is (and of course this is just what I see, others may see things differently), that as a high level ranger (50+) you only get groups for one reason.<P>That reason being the fact that you can snare, and druids seem to be even less desirable than rangers in the 50's, and darkness is unreliable.<P>The only times I've EVER seen a group looking for a ranger, is when they've had problems with mobs running. Period.<P>That seems like a frail defining role, on top of which it only applies to 1 group situations, not raids. We still utterly lack a defining role on raids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ill try to be as succint and objective as possible in this thread.<P>First off the comment of our epics being built that way for a reason makes no sense. Many of us are doing our best to control our aggro factor and to be honest many see being able to switch the blades as a way of controlling that aggro factor.  The proc on Earthcaller is enormous aggro.   Plain and simple, many know that the way to control aggro is to not taunt.  Secondary slots proc a lot less than normal (or so it seems from our veiwpoint).  So it leads one to believe that moving the high aggro blade to a low aggro slot would improve our situation.  My other concern is that ALL caster classes recieved some form of boost to their primary mana pool with these weapons yet rangers did not.  <P>Fiery Defender 15ac and 15wis for Palis<BR>Spear of Fate 20wis<BR>Water Sprinkler 25wis<BR>Innoruuks Curse 15int<BR>Nature Walkers Scim 20wis<BR>Staff of the Four 25int<BR>Orb of Mastery 20int<P>I could go on but i think that point is made.<P><BR>2nd is the lack of Velious dropped ranger armor (this also applies to Paladins and Druids).  Being forced to do these quests isnt appropriate especially when the only quests available for those classes apply to the Tunare deity item.  11 of 14 classes having dropped armor is not balanced for the other 3 that dont have armor drops there.<P>I had more to say but think thats enough for now<P>Walksinshadow<BR>Warder of Rallos Zek<BR>150+ Days played<BR>Master Tailor, Smith, Potter, Fletcher, Baker and Brewer and all around most excellent Linguist.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, Absor, I commend you...  Reading all of this took a *very* long time...  And I have an interest in the subject =P Sadly, I think this ran a little long, too...  Paladins/Shadow Knights are just referred to as Knights.  Hopefully you were kidding about getting Rangers done by Friday.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  After reading your first post, Absor, I cut out as much as I could that looked like it was repeating old stuff, even though it appears you missed a lot, too...  I felt there were some valid points made.  Hope cutting it down helps...<P>Plainsight: One thing that I've had an issue with since before the release of Kunark was the removal of Plainsight.  Granted, it was removed before the release, but it was the spell I was most looking forward to.  Kunark is naturally darker than the original lands, and the Ultravision would have been nice... But what I really wanted was that see invisible.  Plainsight lasts twice as long as Chill Sight, costs twice as much, adds see invisible, and I feel it makes more sense from a role-playing perspective.  Also, Rangers get vision spells such as Eyes like Cat, Bind Sight, Glimpse, Dance of the Fireflies, and Chill Sight, showing that Rangers do and should have vision spells, yet we're still lacking see invisible.  As the only class that can cast invisible and not see invisible, it almost makes invisible self-only, since lacking see invisible all but prevents you from using it to travel with friends.<P>Riposte/Dodge: I feel that an increase of 25 points in Riposte, like the Knights/Warriors got in RoK, and  several more points into Dodge would make sense.  Rangers already have 220 Parry, and half of Riposte is a parry, while the other half is a return thrust (which could be performed with a second weapon, ala off hand).  It makes little sense that Riposte wasn't raised along with the other defense skills.  While Riposte may raise our damage, it raises the damage of the Knights even more, since they use 2 handed weapons rather often, and their skill rating is higher.  With the bonus damage from Riposte, Knights are doing damage even closer to Rangers, while Rangers are still far behind Knights in their ability to take/avoid damage.  As far as Dodge is concerned...  Rangers are a chain-based class, like Rogues, but they have much lower skill levels in defense abilities.  Rangers should be dodging with the best of them.  They should at least be able to do it as well or better than plate-wearing Warriors.  <P>Kick: Originally, Rangers were supposed to get kick, so they could use an extra skill while dual wielding, and Knights were supposed to get bash, which promoted a shield/sword combination for them.  However, at higher levels, Paladins (and SKs?) are allowed to bash even while using certain two handed weapons, making the advantage of kick negligible.  So, in light of that, I feel it would be fair to add damage to kick, since it was supposed to be more damaging, but lacking of a stun, or to add a stun to it, perhaps at level 60, since by then many Paladins would have their Epic, allowing them to bash while not using a shield.<P>Track Screen: This is something I really want...  A see-through track screen!  Something a lot like the new see-through inventory screen.  My current text color set-ups blind me whenever I have to hit the track button, and it makes it hard to talk to my group if I can't see what they're saying.<P>Natural Resists: Rangers should gain a little natural fire/cold resistance as they level.  I was excited when we first got the little fire/cold boost, since I was hoping it would be continued as we leveled.  It wasn't.  Even a point every 5 levels or something would make us that much better in raids where fire/cold resistance is important.<P>Calefaction: In it's current form, it's about twice the recast for twice the damage of Call of Flame.  That means that it's essentially casting Call of Flame twice, which means that Calefaction is hardly an improvement over Call of Flame, and Calefaction is a level 59 spell.  Improved damage or reduced recast would go a long way towards improving this spell.<P>Concern: Don't get me wrong, I love new spells, but while you may think that adding spells like SNL (Or low level spells, since it's the high levels that need help) helps our defense/AC problem (and it does in solo/in some groups), on raids we lose that bonus, while the other melee classes don't lose it, since their bonuses are innate.  Even with the spells increasing AC/HPs, in a raid, or in a decent exp group, we lose the enhanced AC/HPs to improved buffs from other classes, where the other melee-classes natural AC/HPs aren't lost.<P>Offense: It's great that Rangers have Dual Wield equal to Warriors, but it would be nice if their double attack rose the 10 points needed to equal Warriors, since Double Attack applies to both hands, and it goes off more frequently than Dual Wield.  Or, you could always raise Dual Wield over Warriors, since Rangers have always been good at that as well.  Other ways to possibly raise Ranger offense, if that's the course you choose to take...  You could give us Triple Attack, which I find highly unlikely, and probably too damaging, even if with a substantially reduced timetable.  Warriors also get Critical attacks and Crippling blows, and while I don't feel that Rangers should get these (they aren't strong fighters), Warriors are often the third best damage dealers in the game.  It's an advantage they have, but it's not their specialty.  Having Triple Attack or enhanced Dual Wield/Double Attack would raise us to a better level, and would fit the class well, as we're fast, and skilled with the use of weapons.  If we're having no changes to defense, shouldn't our offense be raised just that much more?<P>Anyways, thanks for taking the time reading this, assuming you did so.  Wouldn't blame you if you didn't.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Did I overlook it, or is whoever is supposed to be reading this just being a jerk and not responding. This whole Fix the Ranger thing has been going on sooooo long. You'd think they'd pull their heads out of their (you know the rest) long enough to at least make a summary response in ONE of the 4 (and continuing) Ranger Talk strings. Sheesh.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Something that you said in an earlier post really has me wondering why you even want to know what Rangers feel that need to be done to balance there characters.  You said that you skiped whole sections because they are saying the same thing.  Well Take the hint! If ALL of the rangers are saying the same thing.  Don't you think that there is something seriouly wrong then?  Look at the servers, There are so FEW high lvl Rangers out there.  Maybe that is because they are so underbalanced that when it comes time to group with others.  Other groups don't want a Ranger because they aren't good at any one thing.  They do not have one thing that they are the masters of, or the best of. It seems to me since Verant isn't listening to what we have to say by skipping whole sections, that Verant doesn't care about the Ranger class.  If you did care about the class you would listen to what people have to say about making the class better.  I have heard from several Rangers that they are going to stop playing Rangers because you just don't care about them. You don't care about balancing them or you would take there suggestions to heart. <P>I am truly sorry if I am off base here.  But from some of the comments posted that is how a lot of people are taking this. <P>I feel with a lot of work Rangers could be a Very good Class to play.  The Tracking needs to be fixed, it needs to have the sorting feature put into it.  Ranger tracking right now is useless. If you have a "True Shot Bow" Then don't you think it needs to be a True Shot, and actually hit a target more often then 50% of the time if a 170 archery? I am not going to go through and relist everthing that everyone else has said because we are saying the same thing.  If a majority of the people feel this way... don't you think that the majority of the people could be right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ooookay. As most people do when they are peeved, I've stuck my foot in my mouth. I wrote an acrid statement concerning the lack of response to our Ranger Talks. I was wrong. Absor did respond in Part 3. Flame me. I deserve it. My apologies. Really. :-)<P>P.S. Absor, you stated that bind, gate and earlier Sow won't make it onto the list. How about you not playing God and at least put them on your list for review? Personally I, along with MANY others) don't think they are bad ideas, as we are the only casters without a bind or gate of some sort. Honestly, have you tried to play a Ranger? Many of the spells offered us are really crappy for our level. <P>(I would have emailed this to Absor personally, but I couldn't find his email address, so please, if you read it, just grin and bear it, people.) <BR>     Concerning the statement that the aforementioned suggestions concerning Bind and Gate would not make it on your list; This leaves me with a very bad impression of you and your attitude towards others. The problem may lie in the fact that one man is playing middle man between those who have knowledge of the problems and those who can fix them. Don't let it get to your head Absor. People that get God Syndrome can and often are replaced. I see it all the time, and we, the customers, DO have the power to affect Verant employees with a simple phone call or letter. :-) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>With respect to the stacking issues encountered with our Velious buffs, there IS a stacking issue.  The presumption was that you wanted to give certain classes a means to be more group friendly.  You gave paladins Divine Strength.  You gave rangers Call of Earth and Strength of Nature.  They have stacking problems, as I mentioned in part 1 of these threads.<P>I am usually in 100% agreement with my friend Tanthalar on things, but in this case I think he's 100% mistaken.  The haste buff afforded by the enchanter epic weapon frees up a spell slot for enchanters.  They don't even mem any of their other haste buffs.  When I ask for haste from an enchanter with an epic weapon, I don't expect them to have to unmem a spell, mem VoG, and then cast it on me.  It's just not right.  It's a spell that stays unmemmed whenever I'm in a group with an enchanter with an epic weapon.<P>The stacking issues are real.  Don't get the idea that there are mixed signals on this.  I don't mind the decision one has to make with regard to Strength of Nature.  You have 3 choices with it:<P>- Strength of Nature for 75 hitpoints and 34 attack<BR>- Divine Strength for 200 hitpoints<BR>- Call of the Predator for (reportedly) 40 attack<P>With Call of Earth there really isn't a choice for me.  If I cast Call of Earth on myself, I will never get a haste buff from an enchanter while on a high level raid.  They simply don't have the time (or the mana for that matter) to unmem a spell, mem VoG, cast VoG, unmem VoG, mem their other spell, continue with their enchantering.<P>One other note of interest.  With regard to your comment about the epic weapons being designed for specific hands, there ARE cases in which I'd give my left front tooth to switch hands.  I have to lug around a 3rd reasonably good weapon with me at all times.  If I'm fighting a dragon and I proc with my Earthcaller, I get agroed on.  It's happened to me many times.  So at high level dragon raids, I would LOVE to be able to switch hands with my weapons.  Putting the Earthcaller in the off hand would greatly reduce the chance of proccing, thus enable me to actually survive being agroed on.  If I get agroed on, since I can't Jolt these creatures, I die.  I find a nice place, throw around some straw, get a good book, and get ready to get rezzed.<P>I must say though, my corpse looks great.  I've taken screenshots of it.  The fetal position is a bit much.  I'd love to have the troll death position as a wood elf ranger.  It would be a lot more "GQ".<P>Lewick Goodheart<BR>Outrider<BR>Knights of Eternal Good<BR>The Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  I am not going to try to flame the decision to add Panic Animal into our spell lists, but rather to ask the question, why? I also would like to touch on some topics (please forgive any reposted ideas).<P>  My vision of a ranger is one that IS at one with nature. Note the word nature. Nature is descriptive of life that has not been twisted or belched out from the bowels of some great unknown. For that simple reason alone I see adding panic animal as a method for "fear kiting" the very beasts that rangers are to defend as against the spirit of the ranger. To further support this, if one would look into our Ivy Etched Armor quests, they would find that we are supposed to hunt down someone who, as the story line describes, killed animals for purposes of pleasure. Also leading toward this point is our epic quest. We are to find out what is "twisting" the animals of Norrath. I see panic animal as the opposite of what we are suppost to stand for, and also as a beginning to the end of the role-playing part of EverQuest (at least for rangers). Perhaps a better spell would affect the minions brought about by one of the less nature oriented gods/goddesses. We see this with clerics and paladins with their undead line of spells, and I believe, in the interest of roleplaying, the same "mirror entity" affecting spells should be thought about. Not one that is in-line with our story.<P> On another topic, again as to what a ranger is supposed to be. Our abilities to be the light, fast, and MOBILE pseudo-tank class are severely hampered by our ability to travel from place to place quickly until higher levels. One example is the level requirement for sow (I know there have been debates about this, but it still remains an issue with many rangers). Another example is the lack of teleportation (please read on before flaming). I have thought about these issues for a while and in a manner to help us attain the mobility we should have and not to totally unbalance the class and make others less useful. A couple possible solutions are: A) A version of sow at a lower level that would be 1) SELF-ONLY, 2) Shorter duration, and 3)Slightly slower, but still enable us to move about quicker without having to spam every zone we run through. (I have worked my ranger through to level 40 so this is not for my benefit. B) Teleportation ability. While I do not believe rangers should be able to teleport to every zone that a druid can, I do feel that there should be a couple of zones that we could teleport to. Maybe one per continent (two for Antonica due to sheer size) should be open for rangers to port to. C) The binding issue (I also know this was discussed). I find it illogical that a ranger can be bound in a city, but not in the wilderness. In fact, I believe that a ranger SHOULD NOT be allowed to bind in a city, with the exception of Kelethin due to its own nature. Again this could be a self-only bind spell only useable in a forest or plane based zone (or a centralized zone in a wilderness area)ie. no dungeons, mountain based regions or deserts. This does little damage to balance issues because is would not open up every zone to binding. Also this should be a mid to high level spell.<P>  As far as the issues of defence it has been covered by many, but it still is important for every one of us rangers who get the lovely "snare beatings" and are nearly dead before a healer can get off a spell. In most other fantasy role-playing games that I have played, there has been a class of armor between the chain class and plate class. For instance a scale class or something of that nature. I do not feel we should be given the equipment to raise our AC as high as a warrior, but the limits of the chain class armor does protect a ranger sufficiently in the higher levels during melee combat.<P>  On the topic of pets. Again, being one with nature would lend itself toward a ranger having a animal companion of some sort. I am not going to go too in depth on this topic because I have not put too much thought into it other than the occaisional mental picture of the typical woodsman caring for the animals he is supposed to be protecting.<P>  I would like to thank the developers for taking the time to listen to us, and show enough patients to sort through all of our ideas, wished and concerns.<P>Rakassan<BR>40th Level Ranger of Tunare<BR>Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From Official EverQuest chat with Sony Online Entertainment February 7, 2001 4pm PST RPGPlanet lobby in GameSpy Arcade<BR>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt; *mOoK_* Recently it was stated that Ranger's Offensive skills were raised to the level of Warrior's, when all of the other hybrid's defensive skills were raised, why is that? As if our AC wasn't low enough! <P>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt; Rangers are offensive in nature, palys, sks, and bards are defensive in nature. Those classes were design around that. We decided to give the classes a bigger piece of their parent for one side of melee. As for your AC, yes, it's lower. Try not to get hit  Next <P>TRY NOT TO GET HIT! - That is just STUPID - Rangers due to there ungodly taunt get HIT! We deal damage! We taunt we have NO real way to control that taunt except not fighting!

</FONT><HR>Sevin,<BR>I assure you, you could remove every high level Druid from the game and, except for friendships, no one would notice.  If I woke up tomorrow and my Druid friends had suddenly become Warriors of the same level, it wouldn't affect my gameplay except for their ports.  Their heals (presently) are substandard, as are their nukes, charms, damage shields, and just about everything else that they do.  If you're trying to make the arguement that Druids are desired in high level groups and, most importantly, raids for their teleports, I can pretty much assure you that you're wrong.<P>You get X spots to fill in a group.  Every one of them needs to count for something.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a Cleric, the primary problem with Rangers isn't even how fast they take damage.  Even with the far lesser hit points of any other tank class, I can accept the limit on their hit points. (I do not include Bards as tanks, though they are melee.  Rangers are tanks in most groups)  The biggest problem is that when they get below 35 to 40 percent health, they die faster than they were dying before they hit that point.  In order to have a tank be Complete Healable, I must get at least 3 to 1 hit points to mana efficiency.  Anything less on a tank makes the tank a mana drain.  If I try to cast a Complete Heal on a Ranger, I can be very surprised at how fast their health drops and lose the Ranger if I try to Complete Heal them.  A Warrior takes damage at a lower rate after 35-40%.  Warriors are made for Complete Healing.  But Rangers Snare and have a high inate taunt factor.  That leaves them tanking often enough with even Monks and Shadowknights unable to taunt off of them.  Those are my views of Rangers as a Cleric.<P>What do I want for Rangers as a Cleric?  Since better Defense, Defensive Skills and higher hit points don't seem on the table (in my judgement), I just want Rangers to die at a steady rate.  Make them die no faster at 5% health than they die at 100% health.<P>Rangers, please forgive me for intruding on your thread.  I want Rangers to be a better, more desirable class.  This is what I feel will address my greatest concern as a Cleric when grouping with a Ranger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm tired so I'll try to make this short:<P>I don't appreciate the fact that Ry'Gorr armor is so much superior to Ivy Etched armor (each piece has AC equal to that of plate armor, and in most cases (this is just my opinion but I think it's also a popular one) the stats are better as well). I'm not saying that Ry'Gorr is too good, but I think, given that it requires roughly the same level to attain these armor pieces, that Ivy Etched armor should be made less difficult to obtain. Here are some things I believe need reviewing:<P>Greaves - by FAR the most problematic of pieces to obtain. Many rangers tend to get Silver Plated Greaves instead, since Ivy Greaves are so hard to get and popular opinion rules they are not worth the trouble. This quest involves hunting down a wood elf thief who is a rare spawn on a strange cycle: his placeholder will, after 60 minutes, suicide and be replaced either with the next placeholder, or the thief (Wiltin Windwalker) himself. However, if the placeholder (a buccanneer) is killed, there will not be another spawn until 80-120 minutes later, which can be either Wiltin or another placeholder. The biggest annoyance is that if Wiltin doesn't engage in combat (i.e. is attacked) within 15-30 seconds of his spawning, he will despawn and the cycle will start again. People have reported taking up to 3 days to get the quiver he drops, and the problems don't end there; since the quiver is a container, it will disappear if a main inventory slot is not open when it is looted, since it has nowhere to go (normally containers fall to the floor in this situation, but since this one is No Drop, it just disappears). I would fix this by applying some global code which makes it that containers remain on the corpse if they have nowhere to go, and also by making Wiltin stay for the duration of his spawn cycle (not just half a minute). Making him spawn more often would be nice as well.<P>Gloves - now this is just a plain shame. Not only are Dark Mail Gauntlets better than these, but again it is a nice quest hindered by ridiculous spawn times. This quest involves returning the Bow of Kithicor to Leaf in Kithicor. He mentions somebody called Maldyn Greenburn in Rathe Mountains having the bow and hunting the Unkempt Druids. The spawn rate on Maldyn is somewhere in the vicinity of 60-80 hours. He's pretty tough to kill as well, and for a piece like gloves, I don't think he's worth it at all. To add to all this, he is KOS to hill giants, so if you don't get to him before they do, then you have another cycle to wait before you can try again. These gloves' stats should be increased to be better than Dark Mail Gauntlets, and Maldyn should be looked into.<P>Boots - now here something puzzles me. This piece requires a piece of Ronium. That means that you need Soil of Underfoot. Which means you have to kill fairies. Fairies, considered to be the children of Tunare, and rangers need to kill them to get a pair of boots? Of all classes, it makes the least sense for Rangers to have to do this. Pixies I can understand (in the ranger guild in Kelethin a quest is given to go kill pixies so they stop burning down tress in the Faydark), but Fairies make NO sense. I think this quest needs to be reviewed.<P>Well it's too bad I didn't keep it short like I wanted. Oh well... thanks for reading and considering what's going on, and I look forward to a response!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ranger position in the tank realm is identical to that of the wizard position in the Caster realm. <BR>Think about it, Wizards have total offensive with little to no defense. What do rangers have in defense? Our Defensive skill is capped at 200 while ALL the other tank classes in EQ are at 250 or higher INCLUDING Bards and Rogues. Good grief even the blasted BARDS have better defense than a RANGER? <P>What is on tap for rangers on the test server right now? More increase of Offensive capability equal to that of Warriors. Zero changes in Defense of any known defensive skill like risposte, parry, dodge, and disarm. That's Sending a clear signal from verant that they are trying to increase the wizard role that rangers have in the group situation in the Tanking Realm.<P>We hit hard as hell and pay for it with little to no defense. We have to get other classes to bail us out like healers or the other tanks built for DEFENSE to taunt off of the rangers to survive. All the other hybrids are built around little offense with alot of defense capability. This is the exact opposite of rangers, WHY? Becuase they are designed to be the counter agent to keep a ranger alive after the fight is over. They are suppose to taunt the monsters off of us.<P>But here is a news Flash, Why are the rangers complaining? Because this ISN'T WORKING! The other tanks can't peal off the monsters from slaming into us. Their taunts are just not powerful enough to counter the heavy hitting power a ranger can deliever. Add to this, the mis placement of Jolt spell which in my opinion comes too little and too late to help any ranger. The newest HELL levels for any ranger in EQ is lvl 50 thru lvl 54. We have no Jolt spell, no way to peal the monster off of us. Also, the monsters in the post 50+ arena are what, Magic resistant to almost 90 to 100%. Gee, That means the chances of jolt actually working is little to none.<P>You ask any ranger in EQ, what you concentrate on when your in a fight. He will tell you this. We try to hit the monster as best we can, if the monster starts to hit us we back off or turn off attack hoping the monster is going to turn to someone else to hit. Hopefully its an another hybrid that's built for defense or the Warrior. If we are high enough to use jolt, we use jolt. When the monster is not on us, we hit auto attack again. It's a constant back and forth struggle of when do we fight and when do we back off. Constantly watching the cleric heals and watching the monsters health. We DO NOT snare immediately, we snare when the monster is half way dead or more dead then halfway. Reason for this is simple, the single greatest taunt a ranger can use to pull anything off of an another group member is taunt.<P>Wizards, we all know what it's like to be a wizard. We defend them all day long, Here is a news flast for Warriors, Hybrids and all other tanking times who have little offense and alot of defense. Your assignement if you choose to accept it, becuase you have to accept it is to lessen the burden on the cleric and ranger by keeping the monster on YOU, not the ranger. Keep taunting the monster off the ranger at all times. <P>All the other classes in EQ, fail to see this or are blind to it. Rangers equal Wizards, they are in need of defense and not considered in the leasst a tank to be on the front line to taunt monsters onto them. They are designed to deliever the greatest amount of damage they can with as little agro as possible. We just need HELP to keep the monsters off of us, Rangers are either not playing their class right to know not to take the brunt of the damage. We aren't designed to, or if the other classes are not doing their job, Rangers are asking for changes to give them more defense to compensate the failure of the other classes to defend us.<P>Think about it. Verant is sending a message with these test server changes. When are people going to listen.<P>Ixcor Blackthorne<BR>Lvl 53 Pathfinder<P>Ixcorian D'eltaire<BR>Lvl 52 Vicar<P>Ixcutus<BR>Lvl 19 Wizard<P>Forgotten Alliance Guild<BR>Bertox Server <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055872&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055872&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
