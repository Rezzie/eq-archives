</FONT><HR>Dont let any trolls fool you. Clerics were hit HARD by this patch. Harder then they have EVER been hit before. Forget about the high level game. Instead think about the lvl 46-50 Cleric who now has the EXACT same basic heal spell as a Druid/Shaman does at 51. Its simply unbalancing.<P>Receiving Remedy at 55 is also damaging. In one quick patch Verant has defined our class as nothing more then Ressurection machines. Remedy and Complete Heal are the Clerics bread and butter. Unlike Druids and Shaman, those two spells are ALL that a cleric does. By giving one of them to another class you destroy any semblance of balance that currently exists. Quad Kiting has never been easier then now i imagine.<P>Mangar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

For once you can have somebody handle the "little" healing in a group while you concentrate on your biggest mana sinks, the tanks.  As for the 55 druid spell being like remedy, that's the whole point of putting it on test, to see if it is overpowered or not.  Also, don't dog on shamans over this, they haven't recieved any (test) healing changes yet, so they're whining as much as you clerics are.<P><BR>For once, druids have a reason to group post 50 (if the changes stick) and the Cleric Monopoly freaks!  Don't worry, I'd choose a cleric over a druid any day, and any group leader that says "we're good on healing" post 50 because he has 2 druids is smoking crack!  2 druids should be able to keep 1 tank healed now, and that's how it should be.  1 cleric can handle the whole group easilly, 2 druids can handle 1 tank.<P><BR>/rude clerics, give the test server a chance, let's see what VI decides on.<P>&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm....this is a tough one.<P>I play a 44th warrior, and I have always had a need (and desire) to have a cleric close by. In some cases, no cleric=no party. Clerics have historically been as needed as enchanters. Just couldn't 'do' high level zones without them.<P>This change, if deployed, will clearly change that. Although I like the idea of being able to be healed by more classes in a more efficient manner, and having more pickup groups, I also see this as a fuzzing of the core role of the Cleric in a party role. Enchanters will continue to have a clear and distinct role, by comparison.<P>Unless, of course, the people at VI decide to give Rangers and Druids AOE Mez spells.

</FONT><HR>Hehe, Symbol and Cheal is the key to efficient healing 50+.  Sheesh, that was true at 44+ pre-KUNARK even.  Fat buffed tank + cheal = 10-1 mana efficiency, nothing comes even CLOSE to that.  Remedy is a "save the overagroed caster" spell so I really don't know where you get off calling it "our best spell!".<P>Now, in a clericless group not only does the druid/shamen have less efficient heals, but the tanks have WAY less HP and less AC too.<P>Groups without clerics will NEVER be as efficient as groups with clerics.  However, redressing the balance a bit so that they can do SOMETHING is necessary.  I dare you at L52 to not cast symbol/AC and heal JUST with gheal, or 53+ just with sup, in an appropriate dungeon environment for your level (like seb) and just watch your efficiency drop through the floor.  (ps: you might need rez if you do this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">)<P><BR>Worgar  L52 Shaman<P>ps: balance is not about making 5 people sit about near a zone line until the magic 6th of a single class turns up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gartan: "1 cleric can handle the whole group easilly, 2 druids can handle 1 tank."<P>You are wrong im afraid. Using Remedy only, in a well balanced group (i.e. mana regen, slow) you can keep a high AC tank healed perfectly fine in places like Seb. I do it all the time (54th cleric). The fact is you can med back all the mana used to cast a Remedy before the tank needs another.

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Gartan: "1 cleric can handle the whole group easilly, 2 druids can handle 1 tank."<BR>You are wrong im afraid. Using Remedy only, in a well balanced group (i.e. mana regen, slow) you can keep a high AC tank healed perfectly fine in places like Seb. I do it all the time (54th cleric). The fact is you can med back all the mana used to cast a Remedy before the tank needs another. So toss this 2-for-1 thing out the window.&gt;&gt;<P><BR>lemme throw you another quote of what I said...<P><BR>&lt;&lt;As for the 55 druid spell being like remedy, that's the whole point of putting it on test, to see if it is overpowered or not. &gt;&gt;<P><BR>I doubt that the new druid remedy type spell would be nearly as efficient as the cleric one...  think 1/2 healing ability, double mana cost/casting time.  (V/I likes to work in halves and doubles for some odd reason).

</FONT><HR>And despite all the venom from Druids and Shaman, who both are HIGHLY viable classes in there own right - The fact remains that Clerics post 50 obtain groups based on Complete Heal and Remedy. No other reason. By handing off one of these spells to another class you inhibit a Clerics ability to group. The question for me is "Should a class that can quad-kite to lvl 58 without so much as GAZING at a Dungeon be given a spell that will hurt another class that DEPENDS on groups?" Absolutely not. Im all for enhancements, but when they come at expense of another class its simply not right.<P>Druids as of this post can effectively backup heal, evac, port, buff, and can deal out damage more effectively then a Wizard. With the proposed changes you can add primary healing to this already substantial list. The ONLY thing Clerics will be able to do group-wise differently from a Druid is complete heal. Nothing else. Its sad how little respect Cleric's as a class get from Verant.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just gotta ask (regarding the high level game only):<P>How many full groups of 6 (no cleric) are gonna tell their druid or shaman healer "Hey, a cleric is LFG. We need him more than you, so you gotta disband." ???<P>Hopefully you all said no groups would do that, that would be cruel.<P>Ok, back up a bit.<P>15 minutes earlier, you formed a group. No clerics were in the zone lfg, so do you takea druid or shaman and rely on his Chloroblast? (remember, you have no idea when or if a cleric will show up).<P>If the answer is no, then these changes won't impact the game that much. WTG Druids, now you can heal yourself faster if you take damage when you are quad-kiting; better healing for the druid soloer means less downtime and faster leveling.<P>If the answer is yes, then that means that 15 minutes when the cleric shouts LFG, your group won't still be looking for a healer.<P>Currently, you all claim that no cleric means 5 pople sitting around doing nothing. That means that 15 minutes later you will still be doing nothing and you will give that cleric a group.<P>After these fixes, no group for that cleric.<P>Now ask, if it were a druid lfg, how long will he sit at the zone waiting for a group before he decides to go soloing.<P>Same question if it were a shaman lfg.<P>Now, same question if it were a cleric lfg.<P>You all see where this is going.<P>Of all the three healing classes, clerics clearly suffer the most when lfg. No other way to play the game when they are lfg.<P>Yes, I play a cleric.<P>No, I am not afraid that these new spells will ruin my game. I'm not retiring. I will continue playing my cleric just the same.<P>But hopefully some of you can see why some clerics are worried.<P>So please don't flame the worried clerics, they have a good reason to be worried.<P>Show some compassion instead.<P>Tell these worried clerics that you still love them, that you still want them in your groups.

</FONT><HR>first off<P>a very big /rude kethlarexa<P>Please keep your uneducated dribble off the boards. <P>Not all clerics are whining about this. These are good changes for Druids and shamans. Lessens the fizzle rate on SH and adds a Remedy type spell at level 55. Thats all you should get in fact the remedy spell should cost you more mana than a clerics. You aren't masters of healing its all part of game design, doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. You want to be any better at healing THAN you must give up sow or porting ability its that simple. There is no logical debate that can counter that arguement.<P>The one thing that will kill YES kill the cleric class is ANY KIND of Cheal nerf. I don't know if this has been implemented on test but you can bet your fat epic weapon that they are considering it. If they should do that Clerics will quit en masse and you all will be screaming when you can't get a res for your big butt quad kiting self.<P>Verants track record has been to nerf rather than add and fix problems. So think about that before spouting off that clerics are whining. Sheesh I wonder about the brain power of some people. Think before you speak.<P>oh yeah whoever said clerics can solo well past level 40 was smoking some really bad crack. You like sitting on your butt for 15 mins at a time medding while you get a sliver of exp ? then you are seriously lacking something upstairs. Druids and Shamans can easily solo past level 40 Clerics cannot end of debate. A clerics only option is to group period. Once again there is no logical debate that can counter this point.<P>So yeah good thing on the SH move and the remedy type spell addition. You all better hope their isn't a cheal nerf on the horizon because if so your orange exp bars will no longer have the security it once had.<P>Signed<BR>A Level 59 Cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;The fact remains though that -every- single time I join a group where a druid/shaman were the primary healers they are greatful. Druid/shamans want better heals so they can use if they have too.  They -do not- want to be primary healers. They have too many spells that are more fun.&gt;&gt;<P>This so perfectly sums up the druid/shaman case that it bears repetition and emphasis.  <P>&lt;&lt;And despite all the venom from Druids and Shaman, who both are HIGHLY viable classes in there own right&gt;&gt;<P>Actually, most of the venom has come from paranoid clerics too insecure with their skills to recognize that the kinds of changes proposed by the majority of druids and shaman will not affect desirability for clerics in high level groups.<P>&lt;&lt; - The fact remains that Clerics post 50 obtain groups based on Complete Heal and Remedy. No other reason.&gt;&gt;<P>Someone tell this guy about Resurrection!<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem is availablity for normal pick up groups. With the primary cleric competition.. *DRUIDS porting around, getting on lists in half a dozen high level zones and soloing or farming while waiting, the cleric will be sitting at a zone line doing res's.<P>If its res's that are suppose to get us into groups, perhaps clerics will quit doing res's if not grouped. There has to be something a cleric can offer his group.<P>As far as all the posts about clerics getting rich off res's. Yeah, I have had a 1k res donation before. But that is far from the norm, I res'd 26 people the other night in lower guk and recieved one donation of 100plat. I'd hardly say I was getting rich from res's.<P>Now I'm just talking about pick up groups here and not raids. I know clerics are needed on raids. Raids, however, are a small percentage of EQ play time.<BR> <BR>I guess some people just dont see how a change like this will hit the cleric class. But when your competition for a spot in a group can be half way across the world in 5 minutes, where it would take you an hour, that LFG tag wont do you much good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054981&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054981&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
