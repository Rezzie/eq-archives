</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056034.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056604.html<P><BR>Author Topic: Necromancer Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-07-2001 10:08 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>So let's talk about necromancers.<BR>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread.<P>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion.<P>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters. But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.<P>Anyhow, here's what I have already.<P>Ignite Bones: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that. Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns. If we can’t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed.<P>Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<P>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet.<P>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<P>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its not like there are a ton of Pvp servers either... Come on guys if something needs to be fixed in general but will mess up the balance of Pvp just dont make it live on Pvp servers. I play a 55 Necro on Povar and am useless as hell on raids and find that getting kicked from a group for a player 5 levels below me sick. I cant feed mana if I cant tap. How about NOT nerfing anything and just give us some group only benifit spells, *** is the problem with this, what could it hurt?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fearless Pets<P>PLEASE don't forget this. We need the spell you are giving the mages even more than they need it. We need a way to make our pets not be running all the time when fighting fearing mobs (many of them).<P>Comment on the Lich series....<P>Perhaps it is just as well you have this 'bug' because the way it works now is already finely balanced in my view. If you made it about 60% worse, then in many groups/cases we would not be in a position to use the spells. C2 then looks like a more attractive spell and Lich series except in very specific circumstances disappears from use.<P>Furthermore, we have been complaining - rightly - about the poor efficiency of our mana transfer. If you make it worse it is even more of a joke.<P>bear in mind that clerics mana to hit point efficiency is VASTLY superior to our hit point to mana efficiency. Because clerics have Complete Heal, because clerics have heals whose efficiency exceeds 3 to 1 hits for mana or better.<P>If you wanted us to be 'useful' for mana transfer you'd have to give us 'complete mana' or spells of similar efficiency to clerics. However, because you can then setup mana loops, you dont want to do that. So, either were never going to be very useful in this role, or you have to increase our efficiency in some way that doesnt create loops. <P>Nocturne Shadowfyre<BR>Warlock - Emarr<BR>Monk 53 - Emarr<BR>Ranger 50 - Emarr<BR>Rogue 45 - Emarr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pet commands: Please give them a larger range. Many of the time a pet is out of range, it's due to bad dungeon pathing and pet warping off to an unknown area.<BR>DoT's: Most DoT's are too slow to be of any real benefit, except on large raids, where we cant use them anyway. Speeding up our DoT time would be extremely nice, and make using them beneficial in smaller groups.<BR>As it stands now, at level 60 I memorize 0 DoT's except my lifetap DoT, to keep a proper mana/life balance while doing damage etc, and pet is the main source of DoT damage. Speeding up the damage time on things like Pyrocruor, would make them somewhat viable for places like Sebilis etc again.<P>Pets: The special ability of the level 59 Pet, was supposed to be that it didnt require weapons to dual wield, and is a Spectre.. Since ALL pets now dont need weapons to dual wield after a certain level now, what is the special benefit? <BR>I know it's a couple levels higher, sure...<BR>But, head to head, it sometimes loses to a level 49 pet?<BR>Couple that with the fact that it's the only pte we have that cant use Proc'ing weapons, and it's really not much of an upgrade at all, considering it's a rare drop from a level 60 NPC+. At least if we could arm it with Proc'able weapons, that would be a nice benefit. Add to that, it costs about 60p average, by the time I get a good pet up... since each try for a blue pet costs 1 Peridot, while the mage pet still uses a 7 copper item for a much stronger pet.<BR>While Verant never stated that Necromancer pets would be kept equal to mages, it was certainly common knowledge that people felt that was the case.<P>Keep in mind when making changes to Necromancers, that Necromancers have probably seen the biggest decrease in power already, compared to any other class.<P>Some changes that have already been made to NEC's..<P>At level 50, pre nerfing, i had a pet that could hit for 66's, at about 13 delay.<BR>Now, at level 60, I have a pet that can hit for 57's max, almost 2 years later.<P>Ignite bones used to stun the opponent for the full duration of the spell, until Skel form wore off..<P>Charm and Beguile were deemed useless to Necromancers, and removed. I still have both in my spellbook..<P>Umbral Messenger? Hmm, that would have been nice <P>Lifetaps made resistable.. and in fact, now more resistable than the Lure line for Wizards I believe...<P>And I could go on...<BR>Now, I know some of these were fairly necessary changes in the opinion of Verant... But honestly, it would be nice if there was a sense of security that I wont sign in tomorrow and find that the pretense and reasons behind playing a class for 200 days RL time have changed, and now I have a totally new balance to my characters role.<P>If you are making changed to classes, I would suggest.... especially with the Pet classes, to look at the level 60 players first. That is where the game is heading. Soon enough, the majority of the players in Everquest will either be alts, or level 60 mains.<P>I would say the typical Necromancer in Everquest, is one who played another class for a while... heard all the talk about how strong Necromancers were... started one, and at some point became disillusioned with their roles, or strengths.<BR>Why people like Abashi continue to make comments like "And we all know how strong necromancers are...." is completely baffling to me. <BR>Yes, we're excellent fear kiters.. But, then again, so is a Druid/Cleric combination.<BR>Compared to say.. Mages... what is our Strength?<BR>Mages are very much more desirable in groups in dungeons, and nearly as efficient as Necromancers even when outdoors... Especially with their Epic pet which hits for 70's apx. compared to the NEC's 57's.<BR>Near balanced now? Thats fine, acceptable.. Some small upgrades and changes could be made to make our lives a bit easier. <BR>But overpowered?.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<P>Look I only play a lvl 18 necro and so do some guild members so I can t really reply with regards to the high lvl posts but a few things I have noticed that might help us get grouping earlier...<P>I group a lot with a lvl 17 enchanter her fear and root seem to work against undead better than my undead line do so are we tha master of undead?<P>- Maybe a line of spells like an enchanters that worked better on undead than an enchanters would help?<P>Everyone wants breeze, clarity, sow, invisibility, damage shields and night vision can we give any of these? no...<P>- Why cant our invisibility and night vision be cast on others? everyone else seems to be able to... Dark Pact cast on others still would not be as good as breeze or clarity but it would still be sought after<P>A class specific spell that we can bring to a group would help...<P>- Vampiric embrace castable on others, do damage and heal themselves tanks would love it and want us.. BTW in the 10 lvls I have had this it has never gone of once for me, seems to be a useless self only spell...<P>Heat of Blood appears useful in a group maybe some more like that.<P>Everyone says necros are masters of the undead and the best solo class around, I would disagree, I also dont agree we are useless in groups but everything we can do someone else can do better plus more. Why do YOU continue to emphasise the grouping in this game when YOU created a character that no one wants to group with, you shouldnt be talking about lessening our spells you should be making them castable on group members. <P>Do we have a handful of spells by 20 that can be cast on group members? Yes we have 9, some are useless and the rest others get earlier, why would anyone want to group with us. You made Necros that way so don't camplain and weaken us and move the game away from us. Do minor enhancements and let us grow with the game please.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm curious if Verant have considered making pets count as group members, assuming it might now be possible given the recent nerf that made them more pc-like?<P>This would of course be a big change to pet classes but I doubt it would be overpowering - it would simply make pets more effective group members. They'd be able to benefit from group buffs, bard hastes and group heals.<P>Related to this is would it be possible to display pet health in a blue bar within the necros health bar? This would not only help generally but again would make us more group friendly. Currently clerics have a hard time targetting pets mid-fight to heal them, result is a possible dead pet just because of poor game mechanics (it is NOT the case that clicking on a target mob always selects it, many things have bounding boxes in excess of their physical size yet it's the bounding box that determines what is targetted).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a recap of what high level necros want/don't want.<P>-We DON'T want to be mana batteries AT ALL, so don't try to placate us with a better ratio mana dump.  Its demeaning and insulting for an offensive caster to say "I suck, so here, take my mana."  Its the equivelent of being a squire boy and handing your swords to a warrior before the battle.  Its nice in situations, but it shouldn't be even considered for our main role.<P>-We WANT to do damage.  Deflux and Vexing mordinia, with their bad ratios, and the uber mobs having 32k-3200k hp, to be irresistable.  It'll allow us to have FUN!<P>-we DON'T want lich to be nerfed, as we will simply get clarity 2.  If you are going to nerf it, throw effect regrowth (while held, not clicked) on the epic duck, and it'll give people a reason to shoot for it.<P>-we WANT a new effect, and the stats bumped a little (-mana, +hp, +5 int) on the epic.  Currently, Zlandicar's heart is more saught after as it is similar in stats and has a better effect... a lowbie druid spell!  HA!<P>-we DONT want to exclude our necro friends on raids, so make sure the solution you come up with means that more than one necro on a raid is viable!<P>-we WANT to be able to use our nighttime spells, at the VERY least Quivering veil of Xarn, 24h a day, currently it is unused because its unreliable to save our lives.<P>-we DONT want to be forced to consume essence emeralds to infuse ourselves or to trucidate others.  Re-examine the cost.<P>-we WANT to be able to cast ignite/chill bones and not annoy the tanks.  Change the illusion.<P>-we DONT want to use full mana for a spell which only does 30% of its potential.  Re-examine the duration of dots and how long the average mob dots.  Lowering duration won't mean we kill faster as it means we have to med longer.  Currently we are medding while the dot(s) work.  Making them last shorter means the mob dies faster, but that we med while not engaged in battle.<P>-we WANT to play the class we selected at level 1, not some deformed abhoration of a class which "the vision" has mutated and mutilated.  Everyone chooses a class because it suits their playstyle, their personality, and their idea of fun.  Sorry verant, at level 60, your idea of fun, isn't mine apparantly.

</FONT><HR>Yeah i agree with what lovestrong has said and i have said earlier.  If you cant make it feasable for necros to group effectively with other classes on uber raids then make us effective as pure necro groups maybe with sk's too.  Make our dots stackable or something.  I dont understand why the dynamics of this game and the and the history and personalities of characters make absolutely no sense.  Why is it more feasable to group with druids, clerics and pallys over my own evil bretheren? I want to have grouping ability at high levels if you cant give us a spot in the lineup then make us more of a class to build a group around than a class to join on other groups.  We are not a hybrid that you just tack on to a group.  How can one of the more powerful individual classes in the game be worthless group wise on uber raids?  We should be a class that you build groups around by adding hybrids and other classes to help our characteristics.  But as it seems now we have minor value at high levels and sks got some of our most valuable spells.  And we cant tank so i guess were left in the cold looking at our fellow necros sitting next to us and thinking we cant even group together because our dots are not stackable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cough.  Ahem.  Absor.  I don't know if you keep your patch history messages...but go dig up the patch message put out on Sept 22, 1999.<P>And I quote.<P>"The Lich (Necromancer) spell will now provide more mana. "<P>That's right.  MORE.  It was deemed insufficient.  Too much damage for not enough mana.<P>Of course, it took that long to fix because lich was broken and unscribable.<P>The problems with the necro prior to 50 are NONE.  Even with all the nerfs inflicted upon the necro, it was and is still a balanced class up to 50.  In fact, all the nerfs done to the class were done in that name (balancing).<P>However, it's the post 50 game where the necro gets romped.<P>Pet's start sucking.  No, I'm not talking about their damage output.  I'm talking about their skills and hps.  At no level prior to 50 would we be fighting a low level blue and have our pet tank for a MAXIMUM of 12 seconds before dying.<P>Now, 50+ we must summon, and re-summon until we have the max pet because it has a whopping 1400 HPS.  Not to mention it is such a low level compared to what we are fighting that we begin to feel that we have SK pets.<P>Solution - 50+ pet spells should summon max level pet every time.  They are special right?<P>Also, please do something about their hps.  You keep talking about how the pre 50's are too powerful and the 50+ are correct.   <P>Really?  My pet's have always needed support killing mobs for xp.  I can't let them solo things for my xp.  They will die.<P>However.  50+.  I have to do all I can to prevent them from being hit as they will die within second<P>I do believe that our entire 50+ spell lineup has been talked to death.<P>Please add coffins to all sk/necro vendors.<P>Please, restore our class 50+ to the title we all signed up for - Masters of Destruction.<P>We, unlike all other int casters, are hated because of the vile disgusting magics we practice.  We choose this path because of the raw power of EVIL.<P>It's very frustrating to pay this price and enjoy the rewards, only to hit 50 and discover that we are now Mana station attendants.<P>Take 6 level 60 necros with epic and 6 level 60 magicians and see who is the Master of Whoopin.<P>Just look and discover what we aren't anymore.<P>Please make us destructive again.<P>Give us a 30 sec 1K dot no taunt, like you did the magicians.<P>Give us pets who don't die faster than a CH can touch them.<P>Give us Damage capabilities in a dungeon environment and raid environment.<P>Give us an epic that doesn't have people on the floor laughing.<P>Make us evil again.<P>As it stands, I'm evil-lite.

</FONT><HR>I don't really care if Lich/CoB/ do more damage than they do now, as long as they still give the same amount of mana. I don't think most Necros even use CoB unless they are fighting, which means they will have something to Tap. I do, however think that we need a role in a group. DoTs take too long to do their damage, people complain that with spells like Ignite Blood we can do as much damage as Ice Comet for only 250 mana...great. If you want to sit around for 2 minutes and wait for it. Rogues could do equal damage, if not more in 2 minutes, for absolutley no mana but that is perfectly reasonable. I think if the time it took DoTs to do their damage was halved, it would help a lot. We would be able to use DoTs in normal, day to day fights that usually end too quickly for them to be effective. It wouldnt matter for soloing, since the mob is feared all the time anyway, it would only speed up the process. If it normally takes 1 Boil Blood, and 1 Venom of the Snake to kill Ulrich McManus, then it would still take 1 Boil Blood, and 1 Venom of the Snake, and the same amount of mana. Please consider it, I would love to use my DoTs in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DoT stacking would be far too powerful IMO. DoTs are inherently efficient spells but are countered by the duration of the spell. Allow all DoTs to stack and necromancers suddenly get exponentially powerful when grouping.<P>On the Ignite Bones front - if the intention is to stop chain casting by different necros then why not turn the spell into a DoT? 500dmg over 2 or 3 ticks? The important thing is to remove the illusion - it's simply far too confusing, even if the skeleton were made the correct size AND mob type (which will never happen due to the limits of the global file). If we are stuck with the skeleton illusion then it needs a crippling debuff attacked to it like -500AC or something. That way there may be certain situations where tanks would be prepared to accept the confusion given that their melee damage would significantly increase as a result.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A recap on my ideas.<P>Life Taps:  make the unresisted when the Caster is within the Spell Level Cap [this will also benefit the SK class].  This will not make Taps any more useful in Normal fights [where they are unresistable] and will keep low level Necros from Taping mobs well above their level.  A reduction in Touch of Night would be in order to keep from stepping upon the Wizards 'Lure' toes.<P>Pets:  <BR>A) Enchance their resists [I have had 30ish level Shamans able to slow my 59th lvl pet...].  This could be done by the level of the Pet or by adding a resistance buff to our 3 Pet buff spells.<P>B) Necro pets need to have an immunity to Fear to make them even somewhat effective against AoE Fearing mobs.  This could be done similar to the Mage Pet buff upon Test.<P>C) Remove the peridot regeant from the 59th lvl Pet.  This was placed their because the Pet auto duel wielded, well now all pets above 39th lvl do so.<P>D) How about making Necro pets immune to Posion and Disease attacks in the same Fashion as Mages pets are immune to Fire/Cold/Poison [depending upon which is summoned].  Why would something raised from the Dead be affected by these attacks?<P>E) Allow Pets to be affected by Group Buffs [this would apply to all Pets].  With all the Group Buffs in the game the Pets rarely even get DS without me reminding the DSer about him...<P>Root Line:  Remove Enstill and Immoblize.  Whoever did the Necro spell line up had no knowledge of the class, otherwise they would have REALIZED those 2 Root spells are actually a down grade to Para Earth [49th lvl Necro spell].<P>Night Time only spells:  Good concept but poorly implemented.  Remove the night time only requirement from our 58th lvl Harm Shield and rethink this line of spells.<P>Essence Stones:  Using one for Covergence [Necro res] is fine, a soul for a soul.  Yet I will never use one for a 1k or a 1.1k Tap.  I can med back to full mana in less time then it takes for Infusion to recycle.  Change the regenat cost to some other gem or just remove them.<P>Ignite/Chill Bones:  Remove the Illusion effect.  It is for show purpose only and has become a hinderance upon raids.  This spell may have once been useful [when it stuned] but it's time has passed.  <P>Archi Lich and Demi Lich: Why in the world did you give us 2 Lich line spells at 60th lvl and one of the [archi lich] has the same conversion rates as our 49th lvl Lich spell...  Move Archi Lich to 55th lvl and give it a conversion rate between Lich and Demi Lich.<P>All of these changes would not in anyway make Necros more powerful in Grouping nor Soloing but would go a long ways towards Raids.  For you to expect a class that has been a 'Damage Dealing' class for 50+ lvls to suddenely become a replacement for an item VI removed from the game [Manastone] is WRONG!  We never asked to be given this ability and now we resent it!  Please listen to what we are saying and make fair changes to the class.<P>I understand those that do not want the Lich bug fixed but that is what it is, a BUG.  This line was affected by the PvP damage reduction code by mistake and should be fixed.  Several other classes had their spells or abilities fixed when they where discovered to be bugged and we should be no different.<P>Also our Epic item is far from Epic.  Have someone really look into ALL the epic items and the quests.  They are all out of balance...<P>Briljin D'Aerthe<BR>59th lvl DE Defiler<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The whole mana battery thing is a joke.  I will play till I hit 60 cause I said I would.  Am currently 59.  But will probably stop playing after I do.  I loved my necro until recently.  The word has gotten out.  Every group I get in and every raid I go on is just feed mana, feed mana, feed mana. <P>Last night for example.  Level 60 enchie pulling in HS.  Exp was awesome so I stayed even though I was hating every second I was there.  A game that makes you want to vomit.  LOL great game.  All i did was feed the enchie so the pulling was non stop.  I could not complain because that was the best thing I had to offer.  My DOTs take too long, the fizz rate on the Undead DDs is horible, so just feed to help the group.  What a joke.  I hate playing the class I once loved.  Sick thing is is that most people here are saying the same things.  Its sad that Verant has decided to change a class that all of us high levels have played for 2 years and totally changed it on us.  No spells land on the uber fights, pets get feared.  I basically go to the big raids to have irc chat with some neat graphics cause I damn sure am not doing anything else.  Feed the enchie, feed the cleric.  Joy.  That is so fun.  I wonder if I could train my dog to do this meaningless, tedious task of sitting and push the mana feed button.  Gee do you think I am negative?  So much time invested in a class that now is so boring to play.  I can still get off in group setting but at 59-60 95% of my time is spent raiding.  Not in a single group setting.  THat is why the necro class sucks to me now.  <P>I dont even know why we have this thread.  They will do what they want with us regardless and there is nothing we can do about it.  Not until the next game comes out that is.<P>B</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>RED ALERT FELLOW NECROS<P>You have 2 weeks to reach level 60 before the Necromancer becomes an extinct race.  Lich is the core of our power.  Druids and Wizards can already out solo us and nerfing Lich will be the end of us.  We will no longer be able to solo efficiently.  Add that to not being wanted in groups and we'll never be played again.  We won't even be efficient mana batteries without Lich, (a role that really sucks to begin with, give our mana to someone that can use it better, what a wonderful role)<P>I have a couple of suggestions for you fellow Necromancers and to follow my lead.<P>1.  Make a Living Will, mine goes something like this:  Upon my death after the nerfing of Lich, I wish all my worldy possesions to be auctioned and used to twink my Druid, the true uber class of EQ.<P>2.  Or we can be forced to take our anger out on other players, we are evil afterall.  Nobody survives like a necro, our FD (nerfed), still isn't bad, and we have harmshield.  No reason monster trains can't be run at groups that won't let us in.  Just tell the group "Sorry, nothing better for us to do", can't solo without Lich, all our group stuff is worthless.<P>(actually #2 is pretty mean and I don't think I could do it, but I swear, I'm gonna raise hell in some fashion if they nerf Lich)<P>What I used to LOVE about EQ is that you can do what you want.  You weren't limited like other games.  Other RPG's you are always stuck into some BS storyline that you CAN NOT deviate from.  But now Verant is looking to do that, make all classes forced to group.  If you became a Necro to be a group force, you're fool.  I have a cleric I play when I want some group action.  Don't take our ability to solo.  I'm a powergamer, but many people aren't and all they can do is solo, they don't have time to "get on a list" wait 2 hours, then group for another 5.  Keep the classes different.  SK's can now summon corpse, well there's the other reason to have us on raids.  That's gone now.  <P>Giving our pets more Hps and giving the nighttime spells full effects would help soloing, we're still not going to be as strong as Druids or Wizzies, but atleast we could solo when we can't get a group.  And our pets still wouldn't be able to go toe to toe with a mage pet, and it shouldn't be able to, its just needs to be able to take 4 or 5 hits intsead of 2.<P>A spell that would greatly enhance our group role without changing our soloing skills would be an unresistable and stackable Debuff.  Then you could have more than one necro.  And if you're soloing, you're not gonna waste time Debuffing, you're already casting, Dark, Fear, splurt, Plague, Fear, Bond of Death, Envenomed Bolt, Fear, and let pet finish.  No time in there to waste on a Debuff.  A Debuff that would be similar to Asystole would be wonderful, necros are supposed to be life draining in some fashion, life or strength.  Having a stackable Asystole would be more than enough reason to have a necro in uber encounters, or more than one necro for that matter.  Just think that with every cast from every necro lowered the AC of a mob by 45 and the str by 10 or something.  You're still not doing real damage, but you're making it a little easier for tanks to kill it while somewhat reducing the damage they take, and the magnitude would be affected by how many necros you brought along.  Make it 50% resistable or better, the potential for debuffing it along with our other makeshift chanter/healer/mana dump skills would be enough of a reason to include us.<P>LEAVE LICH ALONE!!!!!<P>One more nerf is gonna give us necros alot of time to do other things, because you're not going to be playing for XP anymore.  No soloing, no grouping, no playing.  <P>If we get nerfed again and you're angry, I'll start coordinating some sort of protest we can do.  I'm not sure yet about what we could do, maybe organize people to Spam GM's or make newbie chars and organize enough people to spam zones to make communication impossible or what.  Or wether we would have to go farther than that.  I refuse to go down without a fight though.  My E-mail is steveolso@hotmail.com  <BR>If we get nerfed hard (i.e. Lich gets nerfed), send me an e-mail, we'll work something out.<P>I'm planning on finding some quiet sandy beach in Timorous Deep to spend my final days in retirement.<P>Vaelik Radanavich of House Radanavich<P>54th necro (retiring)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A good idea might be to let us be able to cast more of our buffs on our pets (shielding line, shieldskin line, vampiric embrace, banshee aura, etc.) which would make our much more viable in several situations. I know this probably won't be implemented because they would greatly increase our pets abilities and since the necro pet had to be nerfed before because it was too powerful, this could probably be seen as a step backwards if were ever implemented. But, I'm just laying the idea on the table because, after all, it's better to have to veto a lot of bad ideas than not have enough good ideas.

</FONT><HR>I hear that Bralan1.  I can't wait for the next game to come out.  The idea of being an evil caster bent on sucking the life out things to make  yourself stronger is great.  Its something none of us can do in real life.  I love playing evil chars, even my cleric is a DE priest of Innoruuk. The idea of the alternative of being a nature loving, butt kissing druid makes me want to Vomit.  When the next game comes out where you can be an evil wizard, I'm gone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I have heard a rumour, and this is why I'm asking not ranting, that hybrids will be getting more spells from their parent class, but with modified casting times.<P>The rumour, that concerns me, is that SKs will be getting our 49 tap with 1/2 the cast time (or there abouts).  Which means, that they will be tapping for 360, in 3 seconds, while our level 54 deflux is 320 damage in 3 seconds.<P>Can you confirm/deny this?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Maybe a few changes from my post on the second forum:<P><BR>Ignite Bones & Chill Bones: make skeleton large enough to match melee range as normal form<P>Lich series: whether it's fixed or not doesn't really matter at this stage, it's been 1:1 since release, perhaps it should be left alone.  I don't see why mana should be lost in this transfer anyway.<P>Mana Dump series: 2:1 at least<P>Lifetap boss mobs: have a good chance, though not entire chance to succeed<P>Defoliation: needs to work on any mobs that is a plant, fungus, or is in any way a PLANT. that shouldn't be too hard to figure out. This includes plane of growth mobs.<P>Pet resistant to fear: on test it's given to mages, which makes no sense since the mage class has no specialty with fearing, but if you are going to give it to mages anyway, necros should have it at a sooner level, it should be more effective, and we should be able to cast it on other players.<P>Epic Weapon: Vexing Mordinia effect OR Pet Focus effect similar to mage's epic(but not as strong), higher +hp and +mana stats to match other epics, make it look cool (big bloodied scythe blade with skulls etched into it, white fear skull particle effect, blighted wrappings flowing about it, curved stave)<P>Group Spells: Group Dead Man Floating, Resist Disease, Resist Cold, Resist Fear, Mana Dump, Lifetap(if you've played Might & Magic 7, this would act like the Lifedrinker spell, in which let's say I cast Group Lifetap for 300 mana, it drains 1000 hp and splits that between the group members.)<P>that is all<P>Pathogen<BR>- 55th Defiler<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As far as i can tell a solo'ing necro is perfectly balanced for 'solo'ing' this is from a druids point of view, they have there pet for soloing which they can use to pull faster = less downtime, also the pet takes a share of exp making it no more efficient than the druid root/dot'ing a few feet away.<BR>In groups they are nice, lifedrain/pact-healing is a nice combination, and the pet is a nice 'dot' but they are by no means needed. and subversion etc managiving spells, which are nice in a emergency.<P>now raids is where the real problem for a necro is.<BR>on a dragon for example there is no spell they can cast to affect it(immune to lifetaps, cant use ignite/chill bones for reasons already discussed), there role is simply to give mana to clerics/shamans to speed buffing time, and summon corpses on failures if nessacary. And there pet? nothing a necro can currently do except watch every dragon roar send the pet running in fear unable to resist it.<BR>Might get boring after a while?.<BR>Add venril sathir to the dragon catagory and any velious ubermob, and most raid type encounters.<P>Idea's for improvements:<BR>the fearless pet spell like a magicians get, that gives them something to use on a dragon raid (magicians can nuke a dragon necros cant)<P>a lot of there spells are night time castable only, this makes them virtually unusable, veil of xarn (upgrade supposedly to harmshield) only working at night destroys the usefullness of the spell, also with levant(intra zone teleport)imo they should work day or night there not really all powerfull spells.<P>they have low level poison based DD spells, as far as i know this line of spells stoped? maybe continue and enable them to work on some of the higher end ubermobs, on par with enchanters dd or ignite bones/chill bones in power<P>and lich being overbalancing is not a factor imo, as a druid i can stack various mana regen spells and get near as good as lich regen without the hp loss (much better with c2, which a necro cant get due to stacking issues with lich), it may be bugged but it seems to work in balance from my experiance<P>Ainianu Sylvanfyre<BR>Heirophant of Emarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
