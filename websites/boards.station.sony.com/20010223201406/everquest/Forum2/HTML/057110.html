</FONT><HR>I was considering the problems that face Everquest, why so many people find that the sheen *quickly* vanishes once they get into the High Level game post-50.<P>In terms of balance, there are massive problems, only one class can heal, another single class has an absolute monopoly on all dungeon groups and at the very high end, only one class is really effective at tanking.<P>But those aren't game killers.<P>The game killer is travel - or the lack therefore.  IT IS BY FAR the number one problem in EQ.<P>I've played deep in Sebilis without Enchanter, Cleric or Warriors, the same for Chardok and most of Velious.  If you are smart and with it, its *playable*.  It's not easy but it can be done.<P>But the actually killer is time.<P>I don't *HAVE* two hours to wait for everyone to get in position for a Raid.  I don't *WANT* to waste over an hour of my time simply travelling.<P>Hours are lost for thousands upon thousands of players.  Most classes have no viability to travel and those that can travel are burdened by constant demands and expectations from others to be ported around.<P>The world seems no larger when I have to run through Burning Wood, Skyfire, Overthere to get to the empty (due to its remote location and poor loot) dungeon of Charasis.<P>IT JUST IRRITATES.<P>The world seems no larger when I need to wait in Wakening Lands for the best part of an hour while my friends who kill Dragons have to port 4 zones away then run to join up with us.<P>IT JUST IRRITATES.<P>The world seems no larger when I make my twelth crossing of Combine Ruins to Karnor's Castle of the day.  Seriously - *ONE* port location in all of Velious?  The mind BOGGLES.  We already have massive complaints about the difficulty of travel - SO YOU UP IT MANY FOLD!<P>MORONS!<P>Then they *ADMIT* it was a stupid, busted, idiotic game design by using a *completey* different system in Velious.  BUT THEY DON'T CHANGE THE KUNARK PORTS!<P>Seriously, what the hell is going on here.  WE KNOW THE WORLD IS LARGE.  Now we just want to play and spending an entire play session to get somewhere just so you might enjoy a dungeon the next play session is ENTIRELY BROKEN.<P>This is just so broken and so funamental to the EQ game design that I'm not sure it would be fixed.<P>But perhaps, with recent changes, Verant will consider it.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whole heartedly agree with you Eduin. And I think you meant only one port location in all of Kunark.<P>I don't wish to even run from Sol B to Guk when playing my twink, because he's a monk I need to beg a port/so or carry a multi sow potion in my tinkers. And I don't have the room for one sow potion.<P>Funny thing is is it's almost like they just HATED to have to put more port locations in and because they knew they had to they added highly aggro mobs from Wuoshi to annoying snow dervishes all around the port locations. It doesn't make it challenging or "fun" it just annoys the hell out of me.<P>Even from a ROI point of view you'd use less bandwith per game session, get to where you want to fight, fight, then log off.<P>I also hope they finally go all the way and just realize that traveling and seeing the country will be done voluntarily, after that we simply don't care to run past the same c.r.a.p. each and every day. Do I want UO type of travel? No but it needs to be waaayy easier then it is atm.<P>Zedd<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea they had about making it so you had to travel to the port by foot before you could TP there. That way people truly had to experience the 'game' but only had to do it once per character  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The whole TP thing should be available via NPCs. This would step on the toes of druids? The game should never have been designed this way to start with.

</FONT><HR>Dunno if I'd be as...forceful....in my wording of it as Eduin, but he has a point. Travel Time, moreso in Kunark and Velious, but even in the old world, sucks major. <P>The run from Qeynos to Freeport was fun and exciting. The first 2 or 3 times. The Boat trip from Butcherblock to Firiona Vie was fun and exciting. the first 2 or 3 times. The Run from FV to Dalnirs and Overthere was fun and exciting. The first 2 or 3 times. <P>Tonight was a good example. A Friend of mine was over in CoM and wanted a hunting Partner. I was in Lake of Ill Omen Playing with the Bloodgills. <BR>Well, Lets see, I could run through Cabilis (2 zones of it) with invis hoping it didn't break/nothing sees through Invis, run through FoB, Hope the Targin wasn't out, run through EJ, and get to CoM. <BR>I could run to FV (Dodging Spiders all the while), then to DL, walk into Karnors, and spend a long time begging for an evac to EJ then run from there to CoM.<BR>I could run through the Gobbo Tunnels, get to WW, Get to FoB, get to EJ, get to CoM.<P>Any of those ways I bet you it would take a good 45 minutes to an hour. And this is me with Selos and Invisibility song. I'd hate to be a Warrior trying to make that run.<P>Travel time in the high level game is one of the major things killing EQ.<P>It's pulling apart us younger "non-uber" guilds to. <P>An Example: An Old Dearly Beloved member of our guild recently moved her highest character, and will probably move her 2nd highest character, on to a larger guild. Why? Not cuz we weren't 00ber or weren't getting the ph4t l3wtz, but because she couldn't stand the downtime. With the larger guild, at least they would have many groups in many places so she could get on and actually hunt somewhere without having to travel across 10 zones, wait for everyone else, etc.<P>And heck, She has a point. Our guild has, like, around 40 or 50 members, sure, but maybe 30 of us play on anything resembling a regular basis anymore (we're starting to spread our focus to beyond EQ), and you'll probably see maybe 15 in guildchat on any given night. Not only that, we're in no way like an 00ber guild. We have like, 3 active enchanters, 3 active clerics, whatever, we have no class/race/etc quotas, Some of our members are the type who will probably never make it much beyond level 25 or so because that's just thier playing style, etc. So if we have a guild group going it's in one specific location about the near 100 zones in the current EQ...<P>I dunno, maybe she was an anamoly, and she's still around on her lower level alts and on the MB and in our IRC room, but I can't help but worry that I'll log onto EQ one day, ask, "Hey, Where's &lt;blank&gt;? and here "They left for a larger guild."<P>I'm rambling.<P>Suffice it to say, Travel time needs to be reduced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>At the very least, make the firepots two-way, so people can travel from city to city quicker.  This will speed up travel a little without making it too easy (you still have to run to the dungeon from the nearest city).<P>It's a shame that there's this great teleportation system in the game and the only people who use it are the ones who are still bound there (from back when you could bind in TD).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I liked Gizzi's comment about the NPC ports.  That would be cool.  I don't have a 50+ character and have thus far not had to pay for a port or SoW (thanks to all the Wizzies, Druids and Shammy's that have been so kind to me).<P>The going price I see for most ports on the servers I've played is about 20 plat (I've seen as high as 100).  Although porting can be a good way for Druids and Wizards to make some cash, they are not always available to do ports.  If NPCs were standing at the various Spires/Portals that could be paid to take you to say just 2 locations for a modest fee (say 5 gold per level, don't know if this is possible or not).  This could make a port network that would take some time to learn, but still be more efficient than running the whole way.  Also, the cost per level would allow younger character to afford the ports, but still make finding a Wiz or Druid useful at higher levels when it costs 10+ plat per jump and they could charge about the same or do it from any zone instead of having to run to the nearest NPC port site.<P>Feesible in a coding aspect?  I don't know, but I suspect that it is.<P>Good Hunting to all!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I completly agree with the author here, even as a 25th level ogre warrior I have the same issues. My Husband and I play dual computers with dual accounts so we can enjoy EQ together, and as a shaman he has been repeatedly aggravated by the annoying lack of ability to either port, or travel through zones because of our alignment as ogres. <P>Not long ago there was an intelligent post about giving shamans the ability to port as well, and letting their placements among the lands be totem poles instead of ruins or platforms. I thought it was an insightful and well thought out idea, and do support that as well. However, simply giving shamans the ability to port, would not solve these travel issues. For that there would need to be more teleport areas, and also more binding areas. At the very least in my opinion.<P>Hopefully our words will be heeded long before the next expansion or EQ2 debuts, and as a long time gamer, from UO and all the way back to AD&D, I know that EQ can do better. Alot better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There most be a full moon out or someting because this is only the second time I have agreed with Eduin [better not become a habit].<P>Travel time is the biggest downtime in the game and the most boring of all.

</FONT><HR>Solution to the problem (and J boots problems):<P>Questable, NON CAMPABLE, no drop, upgrade to J Boots.  Effect will only work on those players level 45+, and will grant them speeds of a high level bard.<P>This would make travel thru the zones still necessary, but at a much faster rate (about 2x as fast)<P>Will this upset people?<P>Bards- they don't want to wait for other party members anymore than anyone else.  This change would infringe on bards the most, but I think most high level bards I know would love having their guildmates get to raids on time!<P>Shaman/Druids/Rangers-  let's face it... casting SoW is an annoyance more than a privelige.  How many 45+ shm/dru/rng charge for a SoW?  These classes would benefit as well with the new boots.<P>Current J Boot owners- some of these people have spent weeks camping that AC... they will most likely be upset if a new quest is implemented (that does not take take as long to attain).  I suggest that by turning in J Boots, you can by pass the quest and immediately get the upgrade... this should make some J boot owners happy.<P>Under 45 players- regular SoW or Scale of Wolf works ok for most of the journeys these people make.  They are not sent from one end of the world to another on a daily basis on big raids.  By making the new boots 45+ only there will not be farming for twinks like J boots today.<P>Yea/Nay?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think traveling is sort of class related meaning that a Rogue can't rez, a Druid can't duel wield and double attack so its Verants idea of balance and has been since  day one of release, I'm not saying that we all like it but if you travel a lot maybe you need to make yourself know a bit more with the classes that can travel so if ones not one ask another that you have a good relationship with(meaning simply make more friends).<P>Traveling does stink to a point but that's the way the classes are set up. I'm sure we all wish we could have clarity,rez,SOW,gates and so on but that's the way Verant set it up so we all can have unique points to add to the game.<P>If you plan to come to a place that is out of the way like City of Mist do it a day in advance and work out the traveling with a gater so before your day ends get to the city and when you log back in tomorrow you wouldn't have to hope that there is someone that can gate you there because you took care of that the day before, if its a spur of the moment thing then deal with the fact that travel is expected.<P>Kunark was set up as an out-of-the-way continent to make it more interesting from a role playing point of view I believe, the Iksar are people that don't want to be bothered with outsiders so it would make sense that there aren't many portals in Kunark. From a player end like its been said,make more friends so getting around is easier or as easy as can be.<P>   <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Travel is a joke in this game.  There are many good points in this post so I won't go into it.  But let me tell you that there needs to be more Teleportation rings throughout the world.  Its ridicules that most major duengons are empty?  Why?  Because no one wants to walk 2 hours to get there when they only have 3 hours to play.  I personally just stay at Kanors because there are always people there to find groups.  Velious?  out of the question.  Velious is like the guild event playground and not for pick-up groups.  What there needs to be is more TP rings near major dungeons and evac spells.

</FONT><HR>I totally agree with this (that the time and effort for traveling is too big a problem for EQ).<P>My main is an ogre warrior. I enjoy playing him. He is currently parked near Lake of Ill Omen, and I am starting twinks. Why? Because the traveling requirements are a killer. I can't run from zone to zone, or dungeon or dungeon looking for something to do. First, I can't run. Second, I'm dead if any blue or better aggros me, period. Third, I just don't have the time. I'd go to Cazic-Thule -- if I could be sure to get a group there. But when I'm in Frontier Mountains, how can I know? And even if there were a party willing to take me there, I need 45 minutes to get there. Nurga? Dalnir? Sure, I could run from zone to zone looking for possibilities, and each time I usually strike out, die while traveling, lose hours of time (and more when I die), etc.<P>It's just not that fun.<P>The game appears to be designed for people with HUGE amounts of discretionary time -- kids and students. I usually only have a few hours, w hich for most normal people is a LOT of time to spend on a game. In EQ that barely gets you started. <P>This is bad design. Do I really have to play another game? It's too bad if that's the case. I'd be sorry if they reserve this cool world for people who either only play traveling classes (ie casters) or have enormous blocks of free time.<P>Don't even get me started about the binding issue. To say this is a "roleplay" thing is a joke. How the hell is a caster binding his return point for WHEN HE DIES a roleplay issue not for a melee type?<P>If you want to preserve some difference, let melee people bind themselves in city zones, and casters bind themselves anywhere. I've been in cities many times, and not found anyone even capable of binding me (since I sometimes play odd hours). In that case, I'm just stuck.

</FONT><HR>There are a few places they could improve the transport options for people, but I don't think it's as big a problem as you say.  Of course, I'm a complete idiot for disagreeing with you, but there it is.<P>They aren't totally oblivious to the problems, but look at it from their perspective.  The only way they will make it *easier* to travel is when they see areas of the game that are underutilized.  Kunark probably looks pretty well occupied to them.  This is why they put the Velious ports up for sale after initially making them rare drops.  It is in their best interests to help people spread out over as many of the available zones as possible.<P>I will agree about the boats.  I don't see much harm in rigging up some teleporters between the continents at the port cities.  Leave the boats for getting to the ocean zones, but the wait is just too ridiculously long when all you want to do is get from Freeport to Butcherblock.<P>As for getting people together for a raid.  I find that the biggest problem there is not the travel, but the coordination.  If everyone was ready to move at the same time then we'd get there pretty fast.  In a raid situation, you are likely to have several teleport classes available to ferry people to the destination.  Problem is, some people are not finished with their last group, or they want to go get their resist gear from the bank, or whatever.  It's like herding cats.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't see anything idiotic in your post.  It's just wrong.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>They aren't totally oblivious to the problems, but look at it from their perspective.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>I completely disagree with this statement.<P>In many regards Verant demonstrate a lot of ignorance over their product.  They claim that they have lots of active players on their staff, that is either misleading (free accounts) or their internal channels for feedback are non-existant or broken.<P>There are too many "Alchemies" for Verant to be considered knowledgeable about their game.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR> The only way they will make it *easier* to travel is when they see areas of the game that are underutilized.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>But in Everquest today, the *majority* of the world is underutilized.<P>Let's just look at the 30+ game.<P>Old Norrath :-<P>Solusek B (next to a port) - packed<BR>Lower Guk (best loot) - packed<BR>Paw II - empty<BR>Kedge Keep - empty<BR>Castle Mistmoore - empty<BR>The Hole - empty<P>And think about Old Norrath itself.  THE ENTIRE WESTERN HALF IS EMPTY.  Why?  There are No ports closer to Qeynos than North Karana (ok, there is a Wizard one in West but its at the damn NK zone line!)<P>Kunark :-<P>Karnor's Castle (next to the port) - packed<BR>Old Sebilis (best loot) - packed<BR>Chardok - empty<BR>Dalnir's - empty<BR>Nurga - empty<BR>Droga - empty<BR>Kaesora - empty<P>For every zone you move away from a Teleport location, the population halves.  This is the same in every part of Norrath.<P>Velious<P>Oh boy.  They really screwed the pooch on this one.  The whole continent is practically deserted other than some persistance in Great Divide, Iceclad and Crystal Caverns.  Even Skyshrine is empty these days.<P>It's a playground for guild outings (that's the only time we visit) and that, sadly, is that.<P>Now you might argue that its easier to level in Old Norrath and I'd agree.  The mobs are several fold easier (massively lower HPs for level, hit much weaker) but that's just part of Verant's problems.  Ports play a part in this complete disdain amongst players for the newer lands and the empty dungeons all over the place.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR> Kunark probably looks pretty well occupied to them. This is why they put the Velious ports up for sale after initially making them rare drops.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>I'm not aware of Great Divide or Cobalt scar *dropping* on any server.  That leads me to believe that they were actually missing.  Wakening ports drop in Icewell (at a 4:1 Wizard <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">ruid ratio which seems remarkable blindsighted).<P>&lt;chuckle&gt; Maybe they're found in Siren's Grotto!<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR> It is in their best interests to help people spread out over as many of the available zones as possible.<BR>&lt;/q.<P>Is it?  I'm not convinced.  Crowded zones lead to slower levelling and that means longer play times.  That makes good business sense to me.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>As for getting people together for a raid. I find that the biggest problem there is not the travel, but the coordination.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>No it is travel exacerbated by Real Life.  We aren't all 15 year old high school drop outs for whom time is no issue.  In my guild we all work and have other commitments.  We are also, by design, all in the same time zone.  But when people log on up to an hour either side of 6pm GMT and all want to get to their beds by 11pm GMT for work the next morning YOU TELL ME how we can co-ordinate a raid a night.<P>It's not possible, you either have to lower your expectations (NOT, note, because of lack of competence, but through this pitiful game design) one nigth a raid, the next night travelling.<P>Is that what EQ is about?  Use an entire play-session just to prepare and travel to your next play session's location?<P>If Verant put that on the box, I sure wouldn't be buying.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR> If everyone was ready to move at the same time then we'd get there pretty fast.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>A physical impossibility unless your playing peers are on 24/7 and have no external commitments.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR> In a raid situation, you are likely to have several teleport classes available to ferry people to the destination. Problem is, some people are not finished with their last group, or they want to go get their resist gear from the bank, or whatever. It's like herding cats.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>Umm, teleporters are either Wizards or Druids.  In the vast majority of raid situations they have zero functionality.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No, I disagree, I fail to see why Verant should get an excuse to introduce more mind-numbing quests just so people can actually attend raids without the current level of fuss and bother.<P>Tonight was a great example.<P>It took around 2 and a half hours to get everyone to the Dragon Necropolis (only partially due to it being our first trip there) after we did get there we only had time for a couple of hours fighting before it was time to log.<P>That is ridiculous.<P>Now its not as bad as Kunark.  That's a real joke but its still bad design and the person it hits *should* be the sort of customer Verant wants - long term commitment but unable to play 24/7.  That's the profit maximising customer for Verant but instead they tailor everything to 24/7s.<P>The funny thing is that Dragon Necropolis is an amazing zone.  I have *never* been so impressed by a layout and the design of a zone - it has an incredible variety of mobs, traps and encounter types.<P>Yet how many players will never see this?  I'd bet its the vast majority.
