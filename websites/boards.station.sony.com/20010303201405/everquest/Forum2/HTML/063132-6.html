</FONT><HR>There's nothing wrong with customer contact, every big company learns as much as they can afford to about their customers and what they want.  That's marketing, find out what they want and provide it, that's how you make money.  Doing otherwise makes you a poor company.<P>The problem isn't contact, it is being swayed by opinion.  Popular opinion should have nothing to do with decisions, only facts and information.  Provable things, not whims and moods.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, you know what this board has done for me???<P>ONE, and foremost, I have had a good laugh at work and has provided me with entertainment, in effect an extension of the game I love. I enjoy much of the humor on these boards, quite advanced at times.<P>TWO, I have had a few questions I have had in game answered for me (spoiler).<P>THREE, I have had a few minor system questions answered for me (I am 'puter 'dumb').<P>FOUR, as a 45 necro, I have learned that I will be nothing but a mana battery after I reach higher levels. To be honest, I have SLOWED leveling because of this. Maybe this is a good thing, but whatever, I am not judging, I am just stating a fact here. Kinda took the wind outta my sails. And whats up with the duck o' death?<P>Look at the class posts. Wizards had what 11 parts? ELEVEN? That is complete garbage (same with all the class posts). I bet there were maybe 20 posts on all class topics that covered everything. Same with the pvp post (they just need to talk to Lord OBeron, Isladar, Grairage and Jericho probably - they cover all the bases).<P>Sure some good ideas make their way here. I like the jboot solution (AC shouts out the name of the one that first engaged it). But in general it is entertainment. The moderators enjoy to laugh as well, and lets face it, some funny stuff is here sometimes. Heavy sarcasm mixed with above average intellects = humor to me. So in a way I hate to ruin it, but as far as it being a viable customer service tool, NOPE.<P>When I mentioned that people posting here keep proving my point, I really directed that to the few who belive that it is their 'right' to have these boards, that Verant is the Gov't of the world of Norrath, and this is a democracy. How twisted is that? The scary part is that I almost believed the same at one time...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Manglosh, you're more then entitled to your opinion about these boards and you're more then entitles to post about it.  If Verant doesn't think the boards are useful then I would suggest they put up a poll and ask the players if the boards should come down.  <P>And for a change let US see the results.  <P>Why do I feel the need to see the results?  Because I don't trust Verant to be honest period and that's from months and months of seeing them hide info, misslead players, and ignore issues.<P>So if this is such a hot issue and deserves so much weight then put up a poll and let the player base have their say. <P>I've seen more different names here in the past month or so then I've ever seen so that tells me that more and more players are learning of the worth and availability of these boards.  And yes it could be that some players are simply changing their chat handle but I don't think that's the case overall.  <P>The cleric issue brought out a bunch of very intelligent posters which was a much welcomed change to the many nonsense posts I'd been seeing much more frequently of late.  And in a lot of the posts to the cleric thread the first thing that was said is "I usually don't post here but...".  So these users felt again that THIS was the place to come to express their opinions and relay their experiences with heal/agro.<P>And you really think this place is useless?<P>I simply disagree for the reasons I've already stated.  <P>If Verant is seriously considering removing these boards and they don't give their players an honest chance to voice their opinions then my advise is they just better be prepared for the fallout behind it. <P>Just my opinion<P>Morgian<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Suggestion:<P>More division in the forums.<P>Everyone hops on 'general discussion' and spams away. Literally anything and everything gets posted to one place, bumping all other things below it.<P>Class issues should each have their own folder so those that are concerned can post them in the appropriate place, and Verant can go directly to the forum they want feedback on.<P>I'd also like to see a 'gameplay' forum where folks can discuss gameplay issues and 'how to do things'.<P>Just ideas.<BR>But yes, this board is of course very negative.<P>The reins need tightened if it is going to continue to exist and prove to be useful to Verant or the customers.<P>Whether you see them as just 'passionate about the game' or not, bring down the hammer on those folks who resort to name-calling and personal attacks.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem with a poll for an issue like this is:<BR>I will probably vote that I want the boards to stay because I get entertainment from them, not because I can effectively conclude it is a wise business expenditure. It is up to Verant to decide whether this is worth the stockholders money. It just doesnt SEEM it is worth it to me. But I do not have access to the numbers. I DO know that a MMPRPG is a high risk, high cost, low profit business venture. I ask you to do this, look closely at the first two pages of this one board. How many posts contain productive ideas that are not biased and take into account the overall balance and longevity of the game, incuding maximizing stockholder profit (this part incudes maintaining customers of course)?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant's contact with its customers is one of the mahy things that makes this game so great. Any other company (with the exception of Blizzard) just releases a few bug fizes and says, "Hell with it, we're done." Verant, on the other hand, listens to their customers and tries to please everyone and continues to improve the game even now, after it's been out for two years. If anything, Verant deserves kudos for its commitment to its game.<P>Asfaloth<BR>Cleric of Brell<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>What "right" does the general public/customer base have to make any decision (or even give input) for any company? We are not talking democracy here folks, we are talking about a private company deciding what is best for them. If you want to get right down to it, Verant is a subsidiary of Sony, which is a Japanese company, a country where democracy is not the norm.<P>All companies make decisions on how to best service their customers, customers DO NOT DICTATE how a company will service them. To even feel in the slighest that you have that power, let alone that "right" is ludicrist. Companies offer support based on internal reasons alone, the bottom line is an internal reason by the way.<P>If Verant decides to only offer support and obtain feedback through the game interface/email/telephone, that is their "right" to do so. The only people who have any "right" what-so-ever to dictate how support is handled are the majority stockholders, of which I am guessing few if any players are.<P>The only way you as a customer have any sort of input to what Sony/Verant does it to vote with your pocketbook, that is what makes or  breakls companies. If you are happy or gripe but keep paying them, they made the right decision. If you and many others cancel your account, they made a bad decision and may rethink it.<P>Feel free to gripe all you want, but until exercise the only power you have over what Sony/Verant does, they will feel they made the right decision. A customer is a customer happy or not, happy customers do bring extra benefits, but an unhappy one is still paying you.<P>That and how silly is it if someone asks you "Is EQ a good game?" and you answer "No, its all nerfed, messed up, etc..". Then the person asks "Are you are still playing?", and you answer "yes"... hehehe, kind of a mixed message wouldn't you say?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Would a genuine customer care about ROI? I don't think so. Customers don't care about ROI.  Why else do they dump countless hours into characters their not sure they like?  Peer-pressure or online friends. The VR sandbox Verant's made is immersive enough to engage the company of thousands of online extraverts. The socialization allows people to forget their virtual and RL woes.<P>What happens when the people you socialize with quit or switch servers?  Well you discover your class is still wanted, make new friends, and move on or you discover your class is unwanted and point out why it sucks on these boards.

</FONT><HR>Hmm.. i really like reading and posting to the boards. There is some great humour and great ideas that come out of it. It would be a shame to see them disappear, in fact i think it is just the general board that is out of control at the moment.<P>The rest of the forums (server, class, bug, etc..) are not overun with posts or spamming. People seem to be pretty good about posting the real stuff to those forums. <P>My personal method is to not bump any threads that i feel are undeserving such as 'i don't like this class' theads.<P>Perhaps you need to really moderate topic creation .. just check every topic that people try to put up. That would really cut down on the 'same old topic' threads.<P>But i don't think you should get rid of the forums.. at least if there on your site you have some small amount of control :)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
