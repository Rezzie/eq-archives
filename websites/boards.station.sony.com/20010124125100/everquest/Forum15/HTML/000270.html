&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I wanted to re-visit this topic, since it's been awhile since the original post.<P>Hybrids used to be great, back when EverQuest first came out (that's when I started my Paladin). We had almost the same fighting skills as Warriors, wielded the same weapons (everyone wanted a ykesha, mithril 2-hander, or skarlon sword, it seemed), and wore the same armor (everyone dreamed of Rubicite).<P>Since then, Verant had given Warriors: <BR>- berserker rage<BR>- critical hits<BR>- critical blows<BR>- kicks that stun<BR>- the best armor in the game<BR>- the best weapons in the game<BR>- massive resistance increases vs hybrids<BR>- massive hit points increases vs hybrids<BR>- greatly increased skill caps vs hybrids<BR>- spells (in the form of disciplines)<BR>- more spells (in the form of armor that casts spells they didn't already have)<BR>- huge increases in skill caps vs hybrids at 51+<P>The justification for these major changes that resulted in a slow but dramatic shift in the viability of warriors was that the class was originally not good enough, and not enough people were playing them.<P>The problem is, the main price that hybrids paid for their advantage over warriors was their xp penalty.  Well, the advantages over warriors have diminished into a distinct disadvantage against warriors (to most), yet the xp penalty remains.<P>The Verant FAQ implies that the real reason for the xp penalty is that hybrids are allowed to cast spells in addition to maintaining reasonably good fighting skills, and the xp penalty is the price for this.  The problem is, at the very highest levels of play, the fighting skills of hybrids are dramatically inferior to the pure melee classes, and their spellcasting abilities are extremely limited.  Warriors have been enhanced so much (and the dependency on pure casters at the highest levels is so great), that there is little room for hybrids left in a high level (level 50+) group.<P>So, even if you can find a group that doesn't mind you sponging up more xp than your fair share (based on your contribution to the group), chances are you won't be the best fit, because at the highest levels the specialization inherent in pure classes is much more desirable.<P>What is the solution?  There is no easy one, unfortunately.<P>The easiest to implement would be an increase in skill caps.  Perhaps add some better armor for hybrids that doesn't double-tax them (lower defense plus significantly lower AC from your armor is a very tough price to pay at high levels).  And better swords too (same argument...lower offense + lower weapon efficiency makes it very tough for you to effectively contribute).<P>How about making the spells on the hybrid armor at least as useful as the spells on the warrior armor (i.e. don't give us spells we already have and no longer use, give us spells that add a new ability, as the warrior armor gives them)?<P>How about giving us a bigger mix of spells?  It's a real disappointment to high-level (49+) Paladins that in group situations with a cleric present (and they are always in groups at this level, I assure you) the majority of their spells are obsolete.  Yes, Valor at level 49 looks great on paper...but in-game, it's not terribly useful, because there are plenty of clerics around to give you Resolution or Heroism.<P>I'm open to constructive comments, intelligent feedback (especially from Verant), and differing opinions.  I do not appreciate flames ("well, if you knew how to play your class, you wouldn't think it sucks..."  Trust me, I know how to play a Paladin...been doing it since day 1 of EQ).  I do not appreciate posts like "yeah, but my class is even more screwed, so shut up!"  either.  Give me a little credit, I have 140 days played, have taken my Paladin from patchwork armor to leather to banded to rubicite to valorium to deepwater, from rusty sword to combine to ghoulbane to mithril to Fiery Avenger, and have used all of the spells available to me extensively and it many, many different situations.<P>Thanks for your time.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Totally agree with Scrith. I also see my played day is 100days+. I found it it totally different when I created my Paladin. We are totally useless class(all hybird) in the game. Sometime, we ask that why we are very difficult to play EQ and Gordon said you are not best combination of group, so u get difficultly. OK - We need best combination then the group kick out hybirds. All of ppl only want warrior, cleric, bard, enc, shm, Lv55+ mage(if camp items), Wiz if need KS(lol) or dmg to RED mobs, rogue if need open locked doors, monk in big raid for pulling. Ok, where is Paladin??? Please answer to me when will a group need a PALADIN???<P>Spells is another problems. The game designers never play the game before. They thought a part of low level cleric spells are very good to high level Paladin. Haha, u know what is my usefull spells? SYMBOL & GH - Pls paladin cast on symbol because it need componets. Pls cast GH to full the warrior hp bar. Haha, Stun and divine might also good for self too. Another spells can forget it. We already got penalty to learn spell late and we got penalty to learn less. I think we need less but same level cleric spells or totally new spells(But if u see the divine favour, u will not ask for new spells) lol<P>Melee abilities is another big problem. We only can wield 1H with bash for the advantage of stun. But if u give kick stun to warrior, we are totally less a hand for damage. We are suck of damage compare to War, Monk and RNG. Never can taunt when I click taunt. Ok, we are not good deal in damage if u see the cap of skill if u say. How is our defense skill? I feel suck too when I compare with Warrior. I am not asking same abilities, but I feel we have 80% less compare to warrior. Why? If u want to rush out to Seb zone out area, u can feel it, ok! Even if u have divine aura, u will feel suck when rush out alone. Why I focus on defense? It is because the designers set we have more abilities in defense, right?<P>IMO, hybird should not exceed all the abilities to their parent class, but we should have some or specical abilities. For example, paladin should have some same level spell to cleric to take their duty. Also, we should have exceed defense abilities to warrior because we are only shield class - Logical and make sense, right? Why a man with shield is less denfense to a man without shield at same level? Paladin and Shadow Knight should be the best dmg absorber, and warrior is the balance and ranger can be out dmg compare to warrior, so we all have own specical abilities but not all.<P>Spell on armors are totally unfair to many class which can cast. I think only some of that are new to us, all are waste. But if u see warrior, monk, bard and rogue, all are new to them. those of the armor are high end to us but most of them are waste. Do u think I will use the cancel magic with a crazy long casting time? Do u think I will use the helm to buff my members with Daring? Do u think a shm will use them but they already have a high level buffs? Please change it if all the game designers are said they are working on balance or ... Action is better than talk only.<P>Actually, I can tell you that EQ is my ICQ right now. I am boring to play any more. EQ only for me to keep my friends just like ICQ. If u think I am stupid and going to pay money, yes I am. But in the view of programmer (or game designers), there are totally suck to cheat money. Because ICQ is free but EQ is monthly fee!<P>Shiorikw - Lv55 knight in Eci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I disagree that hybrids are obsolete. Hybrids provide a distinct challenge to player. Hybrids require skill, timing, and a bit of cleverness.<P>This post is not a flame, just an opinion.<P>I restrict my following comments to Shadow Knights/Paladins.<P>-Berserker rage: This is not a terribly inportant<P>-crits/crips hits:  Nice when they happen. Do not happen terribly often.<P>-kick that stun: Paladins/Shadow Knights can bash. Bash has a chance to stun. <P>-best armor in the game: Warriors with out gear don't have much to offer a group. However with high AC they can take hits.. that's what they are good at. <P>-best weapons in the game: Shadow Knights get extremely good weapons in the game. For example Ebon Mace(19/24), Mace of Shadowed Souls(19/29). Shadow Knights get these weapons to compensate for the fact that they don't offer groups much. Conversely, greater heal/stun/root are invaluable tools in the hands of skilled paladin. <P>-massive resistance: I could be mistaken, but I think warriors only gained resistance to magic... Class specfic armor + Runed Bone Fork+ Good shield can raise resitances sigfigantly.<P>-massive HP increases: Rangers exluded... the difference in HPs is not terribly extreme. Most warriors at 50 have in the neighborhood of 2k give or take a few hundred hp... Shadow Knights have between 1600-1900 hps. Paladins Usually have similar amouts of HPs to shadows. Hybrid hps are very dependent on gear. Reguardless, a paladin can self heal up to 1500 hp with minmal wisdom gear at an appreciable lvl. <P>-disciplines: Frankly other than large raids disciplines are over rated.<P>-huge skill cap increases: Well... hybrids do get some ablities. At some point we do have to pay for them. Hybrids are not warriors. We are not the best tanks. We are not lots of things. We are emensely powerful when played correctly.  <P>GLAUX 49.8 shadow<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Glaux, nice reply, I agree with some of your points.  However, in my opinion the SK is in slightly better shape, balance-wise, than the Paladin (their weapons are better, and their spells are more useful in group situations because many of them deal damage or are self-buffs, so don't necessarily lose effectiveness when the parent-class is present in the group).<P>That being said, I disagree on berserker rage and critical hits/blows being "not terribly important."  These add up fairly quickly, and also change the strategy of warriors a bit, which would be a very nice addition to the hybrid classes.  I'm not saying Verant should make hybrids be as good in berserker rage mode or achieve critical hits and blows as massive as their warrior counterparts, but at least let us in on the action a little bit...it would make our classes a lot more interesting to play and wouldn't unbalance things at all, in my opinion.<P>As mentioned by someone else, warriors getting the ability to have kicks than stun is not comparable to our bash ability (they have bash too, of course).  The problem is that they previously had to make the tradeoff (small race warriors, anyway) to either be able to stun (using bash) or dual wield.  Now they no longer have that tradeoff, so it's quite an improvement to their class.  Hybrids should also receive some kind of skill upgrade at level 55 or 60 (as warriors do)...why don't they?  Wouldn't unbalance things I'm sure, and, again, would make our classes more interesting.<P>"Warriors with out gear don't have much to offer a group. However with high AC they can take hits.. that's what they are good at."  This I really don't understand.  One of the primary things that Paladins and SKs have to offer groups is their defense (they sacrifice offense for improved defense in RoK), so shouldn't this argument, that they are not as useful to their group without great armor, be even more true for us?<P>Massive HP increases "are not that extreme."  I disagree...regardless of what equipment you put on a hybrid, they really don't even come close to a warrior, in terms of HP, at the higher levels.  I'd say warriors have anywhere from 800 to 1500 more hit points than a hybrid, wearing similar class-specific armor, at level 60.<P>"discipliens...are over rated."  Absolutely not!  These provide key strategies for the warriors I know and enable them to do things (such as fight effectively against Venril Sathir) that hybrids cannot.  I am encouraged that Verant has said they are looking into adding disciplines for hybrids (but highly discouraged that they believe they'll not be very useful).<P>As far as the skill cap increases go, why not maintain the ratios set forth by the original skill caps?  You would think all the other changes made since the initial release of EQ would have been enough to balance warriors out...but along comes RoK and Verant dramatically changes balance again by giving them massive skill caps increases.  To me, this was the nail in the coffin to the hybrid classes at lvl 50+.<P>---------<P>Again, just to make it clear, i don't think Hybrids should be as good as Warriors in every respect (or, even, any respect, melee-wise at least).  But they should be closer than they are now (as they originally were, when EQ was first released, and many of us die-hard hybrid players created our characters).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually, the big game hunts has a lot of importance from many players. We are talking about post-50 issue when we talk about disciplines and big game hunts. Sure, big game hunts does not matter to the majority of players of EQ. Why? Because the majority of players of EQ are not post-50. And since disciplines are only a post-50 issue they become important in that context. <P>The majority of post-50 players desire to go on those big game hunts (ie. Trakanon, VS, Overking, ect.) Why else did they raise to that level? How else are they going to achieve their ultimate goal of being the highest possible level with the gear? Face it, if a player makes it past 40, it is their desire to be able to go on those big game hunts. The disciplines are keeping many people from being able to achieve this desire. It is an extremely big issue for hybrids in the post-50 game play.<P>Does this mean that hybrids should receive disciplines as well? Maybe or maybe not. What it does mean is that hybrids are lacking something to be desirable in those big game hunts. If they had anything that was even compairable, they could be desirable. HT and LOH is close to the idea but do not even come close to the damage output that a riposte discipline skill can achieve, let alone a all critical hit skill. The worse discipline of them all in regards to balance issues is the riposte skill, IMO. This is the sole skill that keeps ever hybrid out of the VS raids, with the exception of the 1 or 2 token hybrids in the Trashman group. 36-42 member raid against VS, and you only allow 1 or 2 hybrids in the raid? Come on, if you cannot see that there is something wrong with that, then I have absolutely no idea what could convence you that everything is not "green garden rosy".<P><BR>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dranthor,<P>That was the point that I was attempting to make. If the could affect the mobs in question and do substantial damage to them, then they have the potential to be an exceptable alternative to the disciplines. If they were an exceptable alternative to the disciplines, then a specific hybrid would not necessarily need a discipline. Currently as it stands, these special skills are not an exceptable alternative to the damage produced with disciplines and subsequently are not sought or desired in the organization of these big game hunts. <P>Simple fact of the matter is that the big game hunts work better (and in some cases cannot be completed without) the use of disciplines. Hybrids to not have any disciplines. Therefore, hybrids are not being considered from these big game hunts. This is the case eventhough many hybrid items are only obtained from these big game hunts.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Few things fairly important got passed up.<P>Warrior power increased at an infinite rate with their "kunark armor" than the hybrids.  Hybrids got spells they already had.  Warrior got all new powers.  Not to mention that for the most part, those spells were far more usefull in making the warrior a better warrior, where the paladin armor sure didn't make them better fighters (or even better paladins for that matter).  Since I don't know the SK armor..I wont comment.  Bards got summon food and drink.  heh, thats about as usefull as giving the spells to a druid.  Those that forage - don't need food summoning ability.<P>Shield Bash - I have news that you all seem to have missed.  Bash *only* stuns fleeing mobs.  Otherwise, it caps out at about 20 damage.  Same damage as a kick, but a kick will stun from what angle?  It also cannot be dowplayed that for a hybrid to bash, they *must* use a shield, and therefore cannot use a two-hander for improved damage.  Shields should add a huge benefit in AC.  They do not.  Unless you get really lucky and out roll those clerics and druids, you're stuck with a 15 or lower AC "boost" using a shield.  Even planar shields with 25 AC still don't even come close to closing the gap between warriors and hybrids.  In the real world, that's insane.  In the game, it is still insane -- because the added value of killing a mob faster with a 2nd weapon should *equal* the ammount of damage saved by using a shield.  It doesnt.  Not even close.<P>Why do I play my hybrid?  Because I don't have another year of my life to level up another character to 50+ to play with my friends.  I feel bad every single day I group with them.  I *know* that "played properly" I bring a lot to a group.  Basicly roots, stuns, and a tiny ammount of extra heals.  But I know that I cost a full group 7% of thier xp gain.  That's a *huge* ammount.<P>It's funny, the FAQ states that Hybrids pay the penalty so not all people play them.  Heh.  Shouldn't druids and necro's have an XP penalty?  Since it's not a dynamic variable, and not known to the new player, that argument is illogical.  One cannot make an informed decision about an xp penalty when it's not known, except to some very thourough investigations.<P>Sorison - disillusioned Paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hybrids DO need some work and personally I'd like the 'tweaks to the class' to take the form of a handful of distinctive spells that we receive - say one every ten levels, so we only have 6 unique class spells.<P>Additionally the hybrids can be improved by higher skill caps and the inclusion of a couple of useful disciplines. Also for the shadowknights, unnerfing of certain spell-lines would certainly improve our soloing life - and the improving of harm touch would both benefit soloing shadowknights and give us a greater usefulness in groups.<P>As a hybrid and a tank, all I really desire is to be a useful and effective fighter and to be a group member whose contribution is of equal merit with others. However at the moment my spells are really too low and too nerfed to be effective as damage dealers so I use them only as hopeful taunts; my melee ability is very much second class; and I cannot even offer useful buffs or abilities to a group...and I still get slammed with a nasty experience penalty for all the above.<P>In short a hybrid is a little like a lavalamp - interesting to look at, everyone has one (alternate character), but generally after a while they are passe so they get put in a cupboard and gather dust because they don't really DO anything useful or needful.<P>Cheers,<BR>Tryst, lv40 darkelven shadowknight</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

However the power of a shadow is severly limited on the planes, and in big raids in specific. When Shadows can't DOT, the power of the class drops signifigantly. Shadows can compensate via lifetaps(life leach... post 50 lifetaps)/shadow vortex/syphon str). Honestly I don't know if shadows should get disciplines.

</FONT><HR>I've been playing EQ for about a month now, the whole time with a Paladin. I love the character.  As I am still low level and adventuring in EC I haven't had any problems yet. At the moment, I still feel pretty darn cool when I yaulp in between every battle strike, or LOH to a stranger in need.<P>I've been reading a lot of posts across the web about the shortcomings of hybrids, and of Paladins in particular. It seems there has to be real validity to the problems mentioned both here and elsewhere. Too many people have the same complaints and concerns, and most of them are not the whiney I-want-to-shoot-deat-rays-from-my-nostrils-at-lvl-60 variety.<P>More often than not I hear responses to the effect that the rewards for having a Paladin are in the roleplaying possibilities. While I am an avid roleplayer, if I wanted to play a character strictly for it's roleplaying, I'd stick to pencil and paper and my local gang of rpgers. I play EQ because there are various levels of gameplay for me to enjoy, from hack and slash to rp and inbetween.<P>While there is some logic to giving hybrids disadvantages to balance special abilities (i.e. spell casting etc.), ultimately I think all the classes should be equal in strengh, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. At the higher levels, all classes should be able to contribute equally when it counts. From what I have read, this is not the case.<P>I'm new to the game, so I still have faith that Verant will get around to balancing things out.<P>Remember, the squeaky plate gets the grease.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mingis, you bring up a good point.  We love playing our characters (Rangers, Shadow Knights, Paladins).  The people who got too frustrated with these classes moved on to others long ago(generally they started warriors, necros, and enchanters, based on my experience).<P>But some of us still remain with our old hybrids because we love playing them, and it's a real challenge to squeeze some utility (especially in a post 50 environment) out of them.  These are the people you see posting in this area again and again, passionate about the classes they love, and hoping, someday, Verant might understand that perhaps some of their concerns are valid.<P>Verant did address some of the concerns of Rangers about their defense recently (by the addition of the Jolt spell, subsequent tweaking of it, then re-tweaking, and then finally, and very surprisingly, increasing a couple of their defensive skill caps).  But Paladins and Shadow Knights have very real, very similar concerns about their offense, and are awaiting some kind of reply from Verant.  And I believe all hybrids are a bit disappointed to see some really cool new abilities (like critical hits, berserker rage, disciplines, armor with spells that give them NEW abilities) given to warriors and to see their beloved hybrid ignored.<P>Again...I don't think any hybrid thinks they should be as good as melee at a warrior, or anywhere as good at casting as their parent spellcasting class.  But we used to be alot closer to warriors, and the gap has widened considerably, and seems to be growing.  And, worse, we're not seeing any innovation in hybrids (as warriors have received with many of the new enhancements listed in the original post).<P>We all think it's high time Verant spent a little time re-thinking hybrids, tweaking the balance knobs a LITTLE bit, and spicing up our repetoire to make them a bit more interesting to play beyond level 50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About two months ago I had an argument with a person that abandoned his level 54 paladin. He said that the paladin just wasn't any good. I questioned his rationale of how he could advance to level 54 if that character was no good. Since then I have noticed level 60 paladins so they are viable with a lot of effort and good groups.<P>In theory I agree with some of the things are being said here but I think we have to remember some of the basic rules of RPGs that have been around for almost 20 years. In essence hybrids are two characters in one, however there is only one being so each one of these characters can't be a whole. If some of you remember, there were RPGs quite a few years ago that allowed a triple hybrid. They were utterly useless because of the huge exp hit.<P>A paladin is 75% melee and 25% cleric so setting aside skill and spell differences, a level 50 paladin should be able to fight as well as a level 38 warrior(I doubt it)and cast as well as a 13 cleric. So the bottom line is the hybrid is just not going to be near as good as either class he/she represents. Also it's up to Verant's interpretation of the rules. In keeping things balanced they upped the warrior's ability and gear which almost makes a hybrid feel that he/she has been nerfed. Remember that a warrior is useless without a cleric at his/her side.<P>You play a paladin for what that class represents, not how good that class is. This holds true for the other hybrids. If you are not into this mode then a hybrid is probably a waste of time. For pure independent class leveling, a necromancer can't be beat. I have a friend that is level 50 and never grouped. Why that class hasn't been nerfed, I'll never know!<P>If the present trend holds which it will to a greater or lesser degree, there are going to be fewer and fewer hybrid players around. Patience is a big factor. Most people don't want to beat themselves to death and don't plan on playing EQ forever. You have to balance the fun factor with a very serious gaming world.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I understand the 75/25 logic, I really do. On paper it makes plenty of sense. But in real play, what if the paladin were two people instead of one? Would it be good sense to have a 38 warrior and a 13 cleric with a group who's avg lvl is 50? Although it is often said that the sum of the parts are greater than the whole, I'm not sure that is the case here.<P>Again, I love my pally. I don't forsee retiring the character. What will most likely happen, if I ever make it to high levels and find that I am unable to either be a true asset to a group of peers or solo efficiently, I will simply stop playing. It surely isn't the only way to respond to the situation, but it is probably what I would do if these paladin concerns aren't met.<P>On the rpg note, I have been playing rpgs for 20 years, and my three all-time favorite characters were two fighter/clerics and a fighter/thief. Of course there were restrictions I had to follow for being a dual class, but although the xp was split between the classes, I never felt that I suffered for it. I always felt confident that if I were to fail in assisting my comrades, it would not be because I was burden to them. Hopefully it will be the same when (and if, Erolissi willing) my Paladin reaches elevated status.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am very happy to see such well thought out posts with no name calling or bashing.I play a lvl 54 sk and i agree with the fact that we need(as well as the pally)something to make us "group friendly"<BR>I don't think anyone wants to make hybrids "god like"it would just be nice to be welcome in groups .I have all but given up playing my sk.I can very rarley find a group that will take me.I know alot of ppl on my server..some rl friends..some in game friends..im an officer in a guild and yet i can VERY rarely find a group.I don't blame anyone for not wanting a sk in the group...all we bring is an exp penalty and a hole for the cleric to dump mana down.I have played my sk for over a year and a half and i KNOW what im doing.(you don't get to 54 unless you know how to play your character)<BR>There is an ever widening gap,with each lvl i am more and more useless.From what i have read on the boards i would have to say that 95% of hybrids feel this way.We don't want or expect to be as good a tank as a warrior,and we don't want or expect to be as good a caster as our parent class.All we want is to serve some purpose and feel that we have earned our keep,(i for one feel guilty getting exp when im doing very little to benefit the group)<BR>Now to all the ppl that say"well if your so unhappy,go play another class"I could never do that. I would quit before doing that..i play a sk because of the difficulty and i expected,like many of you did that there would be a payoff later in lvls.<BR>There is alot of pride involved with playing a hybrid,i can't speak for all but when the day comes for me to cancel my sk..it will be a sad,sad day .I had alot of fun playing my sk before lvl 50..but since then the fun has been sucked out of it.Its no fun spending 3 hours sitting at the zone in to sebilis looking for a group...watching warrior after warrior come in and get a group right away.<BR>I truely hope someone from verant reads this and considers for a moment that the ppl that play sk's have the inside track on what is lacking and that we are not asking alot..and only wish to make the class enjoyable again.<BR>I know im rambleing but one point i wanted to make....When rok came out,and there were bugs galore,ppl asked why these were not found during testing,verants answer was that 200k+ ppl could find alot more bugs then a handful of testers.I agree with that.When this issue came up the response was,(and im trying to remember it as best as  possible so forgive me if i quote it wrong)"we have someone here in the office that plays a sk and he says that they are just fine"<BR>They say it, so i believe it to be true.However just like with the bugs wouldn't X+ amount of players find problems that ONE player may not?<BR>Just my 2 cents...sorry if this went on too long..<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pride! Yes! That is the keyword or we wouldn't be playing these hybrids. There are probably a few things that Verant could do to ease our troubles slightly but the bottom line is that we have to accept the basic premise of a lesser standard melee character, a substandard caster, and the experience hit.<P>How we created the character from the start and what race we picked is a factor. Humans are well rounded but not high in anything. Other races are high in some things and very low in others. Of course good items later on makes this a null factor.<P>You have to figure that strength and AC are the most important things to a hybrid. I have experimented with agi and dex items and have found that dex does possibly help a paladin some but agi seems to do very little. The random nature of hits and getting hit makes any solid conclusions very difficult and I may have not gotten either one high enough to make any appreciable difference.<P>A paladin's greatest asset is his LoH to be used on another in a group. At higher levels this can make a difference in the survival of a group when things go wrong. He has to be very careful not to waste it or to be stingy and save it for himself. When used properly the LoH makes the paladin much more acceptable to a group.<P>eq.castersrealm.com is one of the better guides for all character creation. While not everyone will agree with the guides, I have had good luck with my more recently created characters based on their recommendations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AugustMoon...some good points, but, amazingly, at higher levels even LoH is handicapped.  Verant, in their infinite wisdom, chose to cap the amount of heal it provides at a rather low value.  At the highest levels of Paladins when fully buffed, it barely heals half our hit points.  Yet another in a long, long line of Hybrid issues that Verant chooses to ignore or seems satisfied with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agree! LoH not very useful now. I can say LoH is great but the down time too long now. I just like a CH but need wait 1.5hr in real time. Enc will be like it if he/she fal to mes mobs several times and let other tanks have time to taunt them off. IMO, I think LoH should decrease the recovery time by Level. 1.5hr for Lv1 char is ok, but for Lv60 char LoH like a junk to us. Lv60 Pal should get 30 or 20 min recovery time is the best idea.<P>Also, if you see another forum here, there are a new topic to add an good idea to all hybird. This is give us boost effect when hybird group with their parent class to let their parent class obtain 50% mana boost. Hybirds are useless when group with parent class together. At least, our buff are totally useless at that time.<P>Please vote to that idea and let Verent think about it!!!<P>Shiory</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey, that's an interesting idea, Shiori...make the regen time on Lay Hands decrease as you level up.  Right now Verant is practically giving away healing (it's on warrior, rogue, and bard armor...and on the Cleric BP a complete heal is just a click away), so why not make our primary unique ability scale up in usefulness as we level?<P>Hardly unbalancing in my opinion...I'd like to see it range down to 15 or 30 minutes at level 60.  And, of course, adjust it's effetiveness so it can completely heal a fully self-buffed Paladin at level 60.<P>Comments from Verant?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Frankly I think hybrids are pretty much fine the way they are. I have read countless posts of rangers being broken, paladins being ineffective, shadow knights being too weak. I have read these post often wondering why these things are true. Hybrids are designed to be unique creations to an extent. The player of a hybrid must make up for the deficencies of the class they play. Hybrids are not warrior, rogues, or monks. Hybrids are not masters of damage or casting. <P>-Paladins: The difference between a good paladin and a badly played paladin is emense. A good paladin does many things effectively. For example a paladin can park a mob, a great technique when no chanter or shamman is around.  Paladins make good secondary healers. For example, not to long ago I was in a long involved battle in Karnors, the cleric in my group was oom as was the shamman in the group. A paladin in my group kept me alive long enough to finish the battle. <P>-Shadow Knights: Shadow Knights have little room to complaign. Shadows are insanely powerful post 49. Shadows need to know how to play, to tweak out every last ounce of power.<P>-Rangers: After the thousands of ranger's are broken posts (slight exageration), I still see rangers as both viable and potent. Their offensive output is a bit low. However rangers do have alot to offer a group.(here come the flames)<P>GLAUX 50.3 Shadow </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Glaux, I'm sorry but I have to disagree with your argument:<P>"For example a paladin can park a mob, a great technique when no chanter or shamman is around."<BR> <BR>Do not forget that Clerics, Druids, and Rangers can do this as well, if not better, than Paladins.  So that leaves us 6th on the list of usefulness in this category.<P>"Paladins make good secondary healers. For example, not to long ago I was in a long involved battle in Karnors, the cleric in my group was oom as was the shamman in the group. A paladin in my group kept me alive long enough to finish the battle."<P>Yes, Paladins can serve as a good 3rd or 4th  healer in a group (and that's not exactly a key position in a group, is it?), though due to lack of mana and advanced healing spells this ability diminishes rapidly as your approach level 60 (i.e. with all the hit points players have from the advanced high level buffs, not to mention the greater number of hit points they have from being 55+, Paladins can't exactly heal as much of a player's hit points, percentage-wise, as they can at lower levels).<P>The bottom line is, due to the extremely wide gap between hybrids and warriors at the highest level (55+), and the extremely wide gap in the effectiveness in our spells vs our parent classes at these levels, it is extremely difficult to argue that a hybrid is a worthwhile addition to a high-level group.<P>This is a situation that is started with the release of RoK, mainly because the increases in skill caps (not to mention disciplines and enhancements to the relative effectiveness of their armor) that warriors were given greatly diminished the relative melee strength of hybrids.<P>In other words, at the highest levels (55+) it is very difficult to make a good argument that a hybrid can be as beneficial to a well-balanced group as a pure caster or meleer, especially when you consider the additional xp tax they place on the rest of the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Scrith,<P>   So we disagree. No big deal. Alot of people subscribe to your school of thought. Alot don't. Doesn't mean your right or that I am. Nothing wrong with differing opinions.<P> As one person once said, "a good paladin you will swear by, a bad paladin you want to kill quickly". Paladins are an easy class to play badly. Most people aren't aware of that fact. <P>  Paladins and parking. If a paladin is in the group I hope that they are stunning, parking and healing. I don't want a cleric wasting mana on stuns and roots. That eats into the amount of time that they have to spend medding after a fight. Shaman are better at parking than paladins.  However if the shamman/druid is low mana, I'd rather them med/heal/slow/speed buff. I don't play a paladin but I can see the differnece between a good paladin and a poor one. <P> I leave rangers out of this discussion... Rangers damage output is not nearly as high as it should be. Rangers work fine in a group as long as they play second/third/fourth tank.<P> Shadow Knights are by far the most powerful class out of the hybrids 49+, in terms of offense,defense and role versitlity. The problem with Shadows is that they are hard to play. A badly played shadow is seen as patheticly weak. A well played Shadow is something to be reckond with.<P>  Just my opinions.<P>GLAUX 50th Ogre Shadow.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Glaux, more good feedback.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Please keep in mind that at level 50 (your current level), I think hybrids are much better balanced with Warriors than in the high 50s (where the difference in skill caps is very noticable, and the flexibility of warriors greatly increases with their new disciplines, and many of them have the *ultimate* armor and weapons for their class, since they are most likely taking part in Trakanon, Venril Sathir, and full PoS runs on a regular basis at that level).<P>When you start feeling the pain of levelling a hybrid starting around 54 (vs. pure melee who seems to cruise straight to 60, amazingly), and how powerful your warrior and rogue and monk counterparts are when you are all in the high 50s, we may agree on a few more points.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
