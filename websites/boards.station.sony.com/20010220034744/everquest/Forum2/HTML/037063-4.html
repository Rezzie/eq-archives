</FONT><HR>A few items of interest:<P>During the time of Prohibition, did people stop drinking?  Hell no.  They drank MORE.  Tell someone NOT to do something, and they do it.  That's a lesson in child psychology most parents learn the hard way  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Another thing:  Spiderhack, it's *******s like you that make americans look bad.  Take your bigotry ELSEWHERE.<P>And I have to agree with a previous post:  Most of what's illegal is only considered as such because of the fact that the government can't get any of it's revenue out of it.  Want to clean up smut and drug use in america?  Legalize prostitution and drugs.  Good bye to a LOT of crime, and a lot of sexually transmitted diseases.<P>And on another post:  We as americans do still live by the Theocracy that was implemented by our forefathers (ie: The Church).  Our laws, and our "moral code" are dictated by what the churches interpret to be appropriate, and whatever they consider offensive, disappears.  Some examples?  The V-Chip.  Movie Ratings.  A lot of porn bookstores.  etc.<P>Freedom of speech and expression?  Sure....as long as you are a god-fearing, tax paying, "upright" citizen.<P>Peace  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>what is you people's malfunction?  Byph had it right, dont expect a game to do your parenting.  You people flaming on here are probably the same ones who think that its perfectly acceptable for our schools to teach "heather has 2 mommies"  or the deviant version of what goes for sex ed in US schools now.  I imagine that you also dont see a need for the armed forces, and think that this nice, happy world where we all coexist in peace is just spiffy.  It constantly amazes me that some people can get up in arms and inflamed about the stupidest petty things, while totally glossing over important issues.  PENIS is a word just like any other....and to say it has anything to do with child molestation..as it was posted here, is ludicrous.  As for the banning...i am quite certain we arent hearing the full story, and it was probably legitimate.  In closing...if you are going to delude yourself and pretend you speak out for freedom, do that...speak out for freedom...NOT just the freedom that you happen to agree with...ALL freedom.  I hear words 10X worse than "penis" every single day...as i am sure all of you do, but do nothing about.  you just power trip about it here, because here in this little world (unlike the REAL world)  you think you have power to affect something.  You people are the ones who need to grow up...heh, a bunch of adults whining about something like this is pathetic, and i feel just as stupid for having wasted my time posting something that someone will dissect and flame anyway.

</FONT><HR>Gee, i thought this thread was dead.  I only just got to read Spiderhack's whitty comeback.<P>Pity for Spiderhack that his post was in breach of the EQ rules of conduct.  I wonder if he has received a warning in the mail.<P>"And Australia is a Country that was also founded by criminals, petty thieves, rapists and the dregs of society."<P>Well, if you wish to call the Queen of England and her representatives that then its your call, not mine.  I daresay many English people would take offense to that.<P>"Your great granddaddy got brought over in chains for some crime he comitted in the old country, he taught his son how to pickpocket who in turn taught his son to steal hubcaps and now it has filtered down the bloodline to you."<P>That is an insult directed at me and I find that offensive.  I'm a first generation Australian citizen.  Not sure if you understand what that means so let me explain it to you.  My father migrated here from Europe after World War II.  My grandfather, whom you insult, has passed away never commiting any crime.  He was an honest farmer who honourably served his nation.<P>"It's not surprising prostitution is LEGAL but never make the mistake that your quirks and skewed moral values make you any more civilized than the rest of the planet. Quite the contrary."<P>Its not a matter if I agree with it or not.  I personally dislike it and would never use one.  But, there are those that do, and they will use them irrespective if its legal or not.<P>You critise my nation unjustly, we may not be perfect but we are down to earth people.  What possible gain do we have from making it illegal?  We lose the ability to control it, we lose the ability to make sure there is no associated problems caused by it.  From our current affairs reports these places are clean, there is no spread of disease, there are no associated crimes typically found in countries where its illegal.<P>You know how uncivilised we are?  Our governments provide safe places for drug addicts to inject themselves and there is alot of pressure to legalise many of the current drugs.  Why?  It is problematic due to lack of education and lack of control.  With legalisation you can begin to control the problem.<P>Then again, we no longer murder our citizens that have been accused of capital crimes, you know why? Its barbaric.  People make mistakes, people are convicted unjustly.  Thats right, my country is full of barbarians and criminals, right?<P>At least kids that go to school here do not have to pass through metal detectors.  Kids are educated, not taught how to dodge bullets.<P>I'm not bashing the USA, I like the country, I like alot of people that live there.  But its far from perfect and your personal attacks on me and your pre-school level history of our country only highlights the problems in your own country.<P>Your comments make you sound like a bible bashing redneck who is so totally offended by prostitution that you resort to personal attacks rather than conjure up some statistical evidence to suggest that legalising prostitution it is wrong.<P>If you do have a logical and educated arguement to put forth then be my guest, let us hear it.  Let us see just how much the education system has invested in you.  Back up your comments with something intelligent.<P>BTW I dont expect to hear a response from you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

BAN HIM!!!  <P><BR>Listen to yourselves,  when did the gaming community become so militant and unaccepting in its thinking??? I thought that more people were like me that played EQ to get away from the narrow minded people that think like those that backing this banning.  <P><BR>Off topic : prostitution<P>It is only illegal because of the morality of others forced onto everyone.  Prostitution hurts nobody.  If it were to be made legal it would be better regulated and taxed.  This would reduce the risk of disease being spread and also providing extra money to the govt.  Can you say "whoring saves social security"  It would but I fear  I will never see the day when someone else's morality isn't forced upon me</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
