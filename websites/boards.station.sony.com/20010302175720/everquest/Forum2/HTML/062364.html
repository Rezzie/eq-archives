</FONT><HR>Try this instead.<BR>Temple of Cazic Thule has this ugly little mob called the Avatar of Fear. Innoruk has that chick in the maidens fancy.. (joke).<P>Back on topic.<P>PoF has a Temple devoted to their God, whom happens to be a bit bigger than it. Inside that Temple is a portal back to the 'rott. How about a second portal.. this one going down to the next level of Fear. (Think Dante's Inferno, or Super Marior Brothers: Going down, level 2)<P>Fear level 2 would feature not just CT, but a different VERSION of PoF. New map, new mobs, new armor for the new risk and the greater reward. And yes, it would count as a seperate zone. And exit in a different area, maybe some spot inside Grobb / Ogguk. Not to mention a bigger, meaner version of Cazic.<P>Now, there would be a problem with this. In order to get to the one, you must first clear the weaker type. Or, try this. Getting to F2 would be *optional* via a port into it, ala PoH. And of course, to make things fun, POH v2 would be accessiable by a gate *inplane* (I remember hearing somthing about a "gatehouse" in PoH, tho my knowledge of the zone is not great)<P>As for the zones.. ehh.<P>Fear 2 would be underground. Hate, on the ground.. more in the open. I want to get this posted before anyone else thinks of it, so I'll skip on the zone design phase.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>~Akaran D.<BR>50th Paladin, Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree with this. I just made level 49 yesterday. I am very much looking forward to my first ever planes raid this coming weekend on the Plane of Hate.<P>If you need new zones for the 55+ crowd, MAKE NEW ZONES! Do NOT steal 45+ zones from those of us that have worked hard for months to be able to get to where we can go to them. It will be many months before I reach 55. <P>It has taken me over 3 months of playing virtually all my non-working, non-sleeping hours just to reach level 49. I have now earned the right to go to the planes. Leave me that right.<P>Yes, I know it costs alot of money to make new zones. However, you are getting tons of money from 50+ players that have multiple accounts to twink and power-level their newest characters. Take that money and put it towards the costs of making new zones for them. Who knows, after the caster-proof Velious you came up with, maybe you can come up with something that is melee proof but caster friendly this time. That should help balance out things a bit.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"I don't know why I even complain, we all know our opinion doesn't matter once the Live teams thinks they have a good idea..."<P>Amen.<P>The truth is, while the creation of other zones for the gods is a good one, Verant won't do it because then they'd have to CREATE new zones.<P>I think it would be terribly cool if they worked this in somehow.  Add another zone to Neriak with the royalty.  Make up a story about how Innoruuk has left the plane of hate and his essence now dwells directly in Norrath.  Make it ALWAYS night in nektulos, with lightning constantly flashing (but no rain) or something...  Make the halfling camps retreat to closer to the zone and have the guards attack them every once in a while (I think something like this is done in Velious where PC's can trigger an NPC vs NPC battle?)<P>But, that would require a LOT of resources to build.  Ideally they would move the epic drops out of the planes, but they are still left with the fact that the gods SHOULD be stronger than they are.  And realistically I think someone like Innoruuk would be much harder to take down than Tunare (though there's something to be said for the power of nature.  But ultimately, Nature grants life, while Innoruuk grants only hatred and death)...  In any event, the gods DID need to be buffed, and I kind of agree that their planes needed to be buffed too, but I think Verant needs to create new *prestigious* zones for level 46-50's to hunt in, similar to the old planes in their difficulty and loot.  Perhaps planes of lesser gods...  Or more quest based planes.  The Plane of the Tribunal could have loads of quests and decent enemies put in place to test Norrathians, while the god(s) themselves are practically invincible.  It would be nice to have some MOB's that aren't just there to kill and loot.<P>I almost had high hopes for the Plane of Mischief.  (spelling?)  It sounded like a VERY fun zone to look at, with LOTS of characters gabbing at you but very little 'phat lewt' to draw in the power gamers.  Unfortunately I guess it just hasn't been properly itemized yet, but a couple of zones like this might be fun.<P>The game mechanics probably wouldn't allow for this, but it might be fun to have some enemies that you aren't supposed to fight in a group.  I know this is primarily a grouping game, but wouldn't it be really cool for a Paladin to go to the Plane of Marr, and spar with Mithaniel?  A one on one battle that you can't be assisted in.  Even better would be if he didn't kill you in the end.  If you went below 0 hp he would complete heal you and send you back to earth, with the message that you aren't yet ready to pass his challenge.  You wouldn't be able to try again for a full month.<P>Also, have him strip you of enchantments before the battle begins.  It still wouldn't exactly be a test of skill, (more of equipment) but it would be neater the same ol' thing we face every day in Norrath.  <P>Each new zone brings more of the same, only with more hp, more MR, stronger attacks, etc...  Its just getting more frustrating, its not being improved.  Some diversity in the game in the sort of ways I described would probably be greatly welcomed.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At the higher levels Inny and CT are TOTAL chumps which is stupid. They should just remove inny and CT and replace them with quicker spawning bosses of similar difficulty and save inny and CT for a nasty yet to be released plane where they should be buffed up. <P>Improve the gods but not at the expense of the playerbase.

Should Verant should stop trying so hard to keep the level 60's and focus on more content for the mid levels, hoping that the ratio of new players starting and level 60's quitting is even? Or should they continue to try and keep the level 60's thereby raising the bar so high that casual players just give up?<P>This will be the problem for every MMORPG that is due to be released. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dazzler_Twodirks,<P>How can you can you judge a book by it's cover? Have you ever been in a uber guild? Do you think we really want to go to fear for 18th billion time?<P>Lets sit back here and think why an uber guild might want to raid hate/fear.  First lets think about equipment. Why would we want gear from drops of mobs in Hate/fear? Must don't, You can get better gear from Kunark or SoV, all but a few classes.  Well what about the loot of the Gods? do we really want CRoA when we can get bonecasters much easier? Do we want the rogue spear of Innoruuk when most have epics? Do we want The Cazic skin, or The Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth? YES, Most uberguild's don't want to have anything to do with the yard trash of Hate/Fear. Just look at the evidence, Guilds Killing Cazic Thule and leaving the yard trash up, Guilds killing Innoruuk and leaving everything not in their way up.<P>You should have no problems at joining a Hate/fear raid, not to many guilds hunt here for gear, just for FA. If you want to see A God then your only option is to join a Guild capable enough to fight for the spawn. It doesn't matter if the Gods are level 1 or 200, as long as FA are on them the uber guilds are going to fight for them, Epic items are the best equipment in the game.<P>As a side note, you do not have to be a uberplayer to join an uber guild, nor do you need to play 24/7.<P>This game is for fun if the fun is gone, than what is the point?<BR>Ernie</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the concept here.  If you aren't even allowed to get past level 50 without the expansions yet can achieve these planes, how can you be expected to even survive?  I understand Verant wanting to have tougher challenges in the planes (especially after people rightly showed them that zones like Veeshan's Peak are insanely more difficult and deadly than the planes).  But why don't you do something like this:<P>A portal is in the plane of Hate, when you kill Innoruuk.  It forms and takes you to... the bowels of Hate, an even MORE dangerous place with the REAL Innoruuk in it, not the demon he put there to slow down people.  THAT is the place you can make nastier.<P>I mean think about it a while, level 50 is as powerful as you can get without the expansions, does Verant mean to imply you MUST get them now?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The point seems to be missed here, Guilds 55+ are not going annihilate these zones without cause. If we are not after the loot, off the randoms spawns, just the quest items, it doesn't matter what is done, 55+ guilds are going ravage these zones. What Verant is trying to do, is stop these guilds from camping one spawn and pulling out.<P>Grimstaff I like your idea about a portal to the real realm of the Gods, but after what I have seen in Crapplane (Plane of Air) I would like to stay away from quest entered zones.<P>Verant could have used better ideas to fix Hate and Fear, It's simple why people don't want to kill the random spawns here, you can spend the same amount of time, and fight mobs with about the same ability and get better equipment that you can off a 65 dragon that hits for base of 620, lifetaps for 1200, ports, and has a massive AoE poison breath.

Without the expansions, you cannot go over lvl 50.  <BR>So with a change like this, they are requiring people to buy their expansion.

</FONT><HR>I guess it all depends what "is" is right, Cardulus?  The planes were released before Kunark and before you could go beyond level 50, why are you arguing petty semantics?<P>The solution to Verant's wish to have planes be more challenging and such is to have a secondary set that has more difficult things, not to simply powerup what is there already.<P>This is what makes me semi-nervous when they talk about 'retooling' old dungeons.  Look at what they did with Paw, it took them 6 times redoing the dungeon and people STILL avoid it.  The monsters are too tough for the old world, and the treasure just isn't worth the effort.<P>Verant appears to be working under a sliding scale of perception.  About a year ago, they had the impression that the game started at around level 35, all new additions, spells, changes, etc were past that level.  It was like a magic break point for Verant, as if nothing previous mattered in any way.<P>Now they seem to think the game starts at level 50, one gets the impression they are tuning the game based on their personal characters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Uber Guilds don't train to get what they want, they use politics, Do you ever here Afterlife or Fires Heaven training someone to get a spawn? I don't think so... If that is what happened you didn't encounter an uber guild, you encounter a ban of greedy loot hungry thieves. You obvious hate what you do not understand. Try looking at it from a different perspective, later,<BR>Ernie</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I may be wrong but before or real soon after RoK came out I could swear there was some post by Brad or Gordon saying that they would not force you to buy SoV to play in the "old world". It may have had something like "in the foreseeable future" or something, but if anyone else remembers this, or has the post cached it would be interesting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guess what guys.  (If this is all true) When something makes it to test the decision has already been made.  I'll repeat that:<P>THE DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE!<P>It goes to test to make sure that the changes they made don't crash the server or something.   If it doesn't, the changes go live.  Complaining about this ahead of time will have zero impact.  The decision has been made, it will go live, people will be livid, Absor will come on here and tell us how wonderful this change is, after a week people will be merely upset, nothing more will be said from Verant, people will either deal with it or quit the game.<P>This will make any class that is nearing level 46 right now pretty undesireable over ones that have their lower planes gear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062364-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062364-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062364&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062364&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
