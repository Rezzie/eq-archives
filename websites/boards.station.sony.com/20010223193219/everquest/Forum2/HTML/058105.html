</FONT><HR>Test conditions do not always reflect actual game conditions.  DD vs Line of Sight may not be equated under many conditions, landscape, number of players or mobs fighting a single target at a given time, etc.  Pet damage is neutral damage, though the mage receives the hate.  100% of the damage done by a wizard is attributed to the wizard, but mages receive no credit for the pet dealing 100% of the damage unless no other player deals damage.<BR>Additionally, the two bigger factors here are type of damage and and damage over time.  Cold damage in the majority of zones is superior to fire because of innate resistances that players and npcs have.  Less resistance = greater chance to do full damage.  Additionally, the mage is limited to magic and fire based magic.  Wizards have more choices and the lure line is designed specifically to have less chances to be resisted.  The other important issue here is that wizards, who claim full credit for damage dealt, are able to deal this damage at a faster rate.  Timing is everything in the game, and wizards are the most efficient mana and time-wise for killing something faster (and receiving credit for the kill).<P>Another factor you don't account for is that specialization makes up for this difference.  A mage may also choose evocation specialty, but this choice limits many other important, mana-costly aspects of game play -- especially chain pet casting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Amazing the number of lameheaded responses here.<P>First off, in a dungeon environment standing right next to the mob, a bolt is as good as a shock.  Also, broadening the comparison to other classes, levels, etc., is fine, but it is NOT what I was talking about.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for doing it faster, not by much...3 secs in total mana delivery?  Out of almost a whole minute?  You really think that matters?<P>The basic issue is this, and if you want to play it out for other levels and classes, feel free.  My issue is that at 49th level, a mage is IMMENSELY more powerful in Velious and Kunark (okay, not Sol B, whoopdedoo) than a wizard at delivering mana produced damage.  Take the pet out of the equation, it is a near dead heat.<P>And to the reply that said it was a PvP comparison, nope, never said that.  I am simply talking about the ability to burn mana fast and deliver damage.  And if you want to turn the numbers into raw unresisted numbers, feel free to divide BOTH damage amounts by .7  The analysis still holds.<P>And aren't Lava Bolt and Ice Comet both line of sight?<P>Wizards give up quite a bit for the ability to deal significant damage quickly.  If they are no different in delivery than a mage, why restrict the wizard class from having a pet?  Not that a pet is desired, but its absurdity proves the point that there IS a balance issue here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No, Ice comet isn't line of sight.  I have yet to talk to a Magician that specialized in conjuration, honestly, but Im sure there are some out there.<P>This is an old line but here's what we have to keep in mind:<P>Wizards are meant for fast damage with no long term pay off.<P>Magicians are meant for long term lasting damage even without mana.<P>The problem isn't that Magicians outdamage Wizards eventually, that's not a bad thing.<P>The problem is Magicians and Wizards are VERY close in damage in a short period of time, if not Wizards coming up short.

</FONT><HR>Unlike other classes who tried to hide they are powerful and don't want to be nerfed I will answer this age old debate with wizards and mages.<P>Yes a mage will out damage a wizard if he has his pet, damage sheild, and nukes going off all at once.  But yes a mage should out damage a wizard.<P>Wizards constantly always forget about PORTs.  I would trade every summon spell I have (excluding pets) for all the ports a wizard has in a nano second!  There is no comparason that Ports are 10 times, hell 100 times more important in the game than Oh Wow I can summon my food and band aids.  <P>I mean I play with wizards all the time who are 10 times richer than I am, wonder why.  We go start to hunt in a zone.  So my shaman, wizard friends and I go on a kitting party.  We come into the the zone, man it's pack.  We are not going to get anything, and it will take us 30 minutes easy to get to another good zone.  Wizard says no problem POP!<P>Wizards don't have your cake and eat it to.  Your ports are maybe 2nd only to the Res line of the cleric that are the most valuable non-combat spells in the game!<P>A mage only has damage.  That's it.  We are the rogues of the casters class.  A one trick pony, and I'm really trying to fair here.  I mean once a wizard get's his J-boots, or pairs up with a shaman/druid.  He becomes a SOLO KILLING MACHINE.  So don't bring up that either.  We mages don't have a lot, and threads like this don't help.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Around the 50 mark, tears of druzil and the mage's rain of swords can drop foes extremely quickly.  Bear in mind that AOE's are where the wizard excells far beyond any other classes.

Doing damage fast and over time means Wizards are useless to a group.<P>How often do you port in a given day?  How often do you want to?  Now, how often do you kill a creature in a given day?  Ports are nice, but don't hand me that they balance everything and make the damage mean nothing.<P>Fast damage is what a Wizard is about.  Taking that away makes the class pointless in a group.<P>And guys, get serious, you are acting like you only have (five) things... and adding them up as if every one of them is equal.

Blasts, Ae... one gets summons summoned armor and damage shields, one gets skin spells, a couple stuns, and more DD spells ooh.<P>But the damage is done, the best they can do now is to make the distinctives more useful and important and focus on what each class should do.

</FONT><HR>Personally, I think the damage output on Wizard spells ought to be significantly increased at 49+, especially considering all the high hitpoint mobs out there. And decrease their resists too.<P>Given how close the two are now in damage output the pets put it decidedly in favor of the mage.<P>Couple things though...LoS spells are a pain and not useable in all situations. I find myself using Char mostly(Shock of Swords before that) as my main spell to deal damage. Lavabolt takes forever to cast and it only takes one little z axis error or one melee getting in the way to ruin it. Mages just love getting this message after casting the spell "You cannot see your target". Dunno about you but I don't stand next to a mob to cast a spell if I can help it. With the long casting time that's an eternity for a mob to lay the smackdown on a mage and interrupt the spell. <P>I think wizard spells should cast 1-2 seconds faster than they do now, do double their damage at 49+, and be resisted 50% less. <P>Mages should be given a line of pet only weapons, not more nukes. Mages are their pets. Their spells should focus on enhancing pets at 49+.<P>Quirinal, 52nd Mage </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I mean at 33 I had a BLAST in the ghost room of unrest, inside mistmoore. My group didnt think I sucked.. neither did I.<P>I doubt those fishes in kedge thought i sucked as we killed them.. Me a ranger and a cleric. OR me and a pally.<P>Lets ask Meldrath and the mino hero how badly i sucked when a pally and myself cleaned both thier clocks.<P>If you think the mage class sucks from 16-45, you need to rethink what doesnt suck.  The worst levels so far for my mage were 12-15. Those were so worse then any of the hell levels i have gotten to.<P>As for a group kicking out a wizzie.. never said they would....<P>But in a pickup group where noone really knows eachother... who would you take? a nuker? or a almost as good nuker with a strong pet and damage shields?<P>And sure, Bolts arent the best indoors. Ive used them in mistmoore to good effect and only once in a while gotten a dud. But I think its easier for a gnome to use them. The bolt can go down on the zxis very easily.. but going up is near impossible. In mistmoore I was climbing on furniture, beds, railings whatever to get higher. I could fit places anyone bigger couldnt have.. Im sure that helped.<P>Amethyr<P>   Outta curiosty, dont you get insane resist rates on the rains? I was in najena screwing around doing parts of my epic and i started using them. I hate getting spammed with resist messages. That was on malised mobs that were uber green to me too.

</FONT><HR>Wizard spells should be a little faster, I can agree with that.<P>It is very easy to overestimate the end-game power of a mage by the figures though.  Lava bolt is very much a situational spell, if you don't have a high rate of incoming mana, or a guaranteed clear line of sight, one mistake will throw your mana/damage ratio WAY out the window.  Any wizard should know this from situations where a runner may or may not reach a corner in time.  Do you use that big mean nasty nuke?  Or the less mana one just in case he gets out of sight and you lose the mana for no effect.<P>Just for the record, for those who don't understand what mages are saying about lava bolt being LOS (line of sight), any obstacle which gets in the way will be hit rather than the target.  This can be a melee player, a wall, a tree, a pet,  another creature.. anything.<P>Lastly, Grimstaff I wasn't saying 5 spells = 1+1+1+1+1 as any kind of measure of power, but rather as a narrowness of focus in the utility of a mage.  A mage is entirely combat offense orientated, a wizard has a fair mix of defensive and offensive abilities.  This is important to realise when stating that a mage will usually outdamage a wizard in a standard fight - i.e. they are the more offensively orientated caster.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Are you absolutely sure lava bolt does not have a recast time? Last time I used it I recalled there being the standard 2.5 seconds. Furthermore, the spdat file says it has a 2.5 second recovery time. Therefore, wizards ice comet beats lava bolt hands down on the damage per unit time scale. Just try to kill steal from a group with a chain nuking wizard during a raid. It won't work; I know I've tried.<P>Root, snare, evac, STUN, etc. have already been covered... Don't forget harvest, shieldskin, etc too.<P>By the way, I'm level 51 and I specialize in conjuration. Before 52 both evoc and conjuration nukes are comparable (and 9 times out of 10 anti-summoned, rain, and PBAE (except scint) are useless); I spend a fair amount of my mana feeding clerics with mod rods (feeding someone with superior heal with spec. conjuration ensures about a 1 to 2 mana transfer efficiency... better than a necro) or if soloing, chain casting pets. In the end evoc versus conj comes out as a wash in my view, the edge going to conjuration if you like to feed clerics, druids, and enchanters; otherwise edge going to evoc.<P>-Cydmab, Level 51 Elementalist, MT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>With rains you need to be in a group who understands where they work well.  Note that the fire based rains are usually more resistable than the magic based rains, unless you're in a specifically high magic resist area.<P>When I do use them, no I don't get insane resists.  At the moment I'm using rain of swords, which is magic based, in conjunction with malise.  If we're using this technique, we need a clever enchanter.  If the enchanter isn't clever, forget it.  They will need to tashani as you malise.  They also need to mesmerise extras before they reach the group, and if that's not possible the extras need to be taken off a short distance and mesmerised.<P>Target the rain on a single target.<P>The other important thing is constant maneuvering of the pet.  The pet needs to be kept right out of the area of effect (well for the time being, this is being fixed apparently).  This can be frustrating, but very rewarding :)<P>By the way, this tactic isn't good with just a mage.  Even the 49th rain only does around 960 damage, which the pet + shock of swords would do for less mana.  But if you have a wizard with you who is willing to experiment, they get far better AOE's (I believe tears of druzil is 1800ish?).  This is when it becomes well worth using rains.  In fact, in this situation the only spells I will use are malise, rain of swords, and the occasional damage shield.<P>Versatility is important in this game, for me it is for 2 reasons.  Firstly different tactics suit specific encounters/areas.  Secondly doing the same old thing over and over is excruciatingly boring.  Vary things a bit and it's a whole load of fun :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No, bolts have no extra hold time.  And don't overestimate the Wizard's 'defensive' strength.  Trust me, I die plenty, and having a buddy to hold em off a few seconds while you bail is 100% more reliable than standing and praying root will take effect just this once, just more than a few seconds.<P>He said it best: You got a group with one slot and don't know the candidates, which would you rather have, the guy with a blast and one stun (don't get any more til level 49, stop saying STUNS like we get a ton) or a guy with slightly smaller blasts, a pet, and damage shields?  Don't tell me snare, there are 5 other classes in the game get snare, you'll have that covered.  If you have a high enough level group Evac is a thought, briefly, until you remember you almost never, EVER need evac.<P>That's the bottom line, what will help the group.  Wizards have to be fast damage.  That is the key, if they don't have an edge in fast damage, and something to help work with resistances more than now, they are trash to a group.<P>Magicians MUST do damage over time, but should NEVER do better damage in the short term, not even close.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually I think we end up being roughly equal defensively.  If the personal ports worked right, maybe you could give the Wizard an edge outdoors.  But if you have several guys hitting you root will not be on your mind, trust me.  Anything I want to root and run from instead of just head to the zone on my tail (aggro greens) I can't get root to stick on and keep.<P>Magicians seem to think Root is some sort of holy grail and let me clue you: your pet's root is the same as mine.  Exactly the same.  You wanna bet your life on that?  Now add in how being beat on makes casting troublesome.  Make that worse with several creatures pounding you.  I just cross my fingers and try to gate, root won't save crap.<P>Cast interrupt<BR>cast resist<BR>cast resist<BR>cast interrupt<BR>cast woo it stuck now for that guy...<BR>cast interrupt<BR>cast resist<BR>cast resist<BR>first one breaks root<BR>die<P>seriously, Im not exaggerating things, that has happened to me several times.  Is the skin spell nice?  Heck yeah but 180 damage melts away in one attack flurry.  How much punishment can your rocky friend take?<P>I think we come up roughly equal, defensively. <P>I really like the idea of better weapons for your pets, and if AE Rain spell was fixed, you'd be a lot better off.  That's the focus you guys should be working on.  Don't try to out gun Wizards in the short term, that's not reasonable to expect and it screws Wizards.  Don't expect to empty your mana bar and out do a Magician, that's not fair to the Mage and it screws them.<P>Each one has to have more clearly defined and useful roles EVERY LEVEL not just past level 50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually until i got jboots, having a druid partner just outright owned outdoors.<P>I think the proper quote on it was, if its snareable its dead.<P><BR>Bob, Have you only played your mage? Do you have alternates in the 30s? I agree Mages aren't gods pre50. I also will tell you right out that they are no where near broken in the 45 levels ive been playing my new main.. nor the first 30 of my old mage.<P>Bob, have you even played a wizard? not just seen one in action, but played one? How bout a necro? enchanter?<P>other then a solid multimob escape spell mages do have it rather good pre 50.. only int caster who has it better are necros. In a pickup group with one slot, if both a mage and wizard are looking for a group I will take the mage EVERY time. As long as we have some kind of healer and some kind of tank(not pet). Bob, why is this? explain to me why i would want a wizard in my group?<P><BR>Ohh for the record, I dont think I would take either over another tank or melee type.. Melee is all powerful if your backed by good healer or two.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I tell you mages something:<P>I am not wanted in a group because i nuke 0.03 sec faster than a mage... The mage got the Pet, Ds, usefull summonings AND the power of my nuke. NOONE at my level, i repeat it, NOONE is interested if i can nuke 0.03 sec faster than a mage. AU contraire, if i do that, the MOBS in Sebilis and HS, Heck, even KC are only scratched and laugh at me... if i don't die because of the immense aggro, i am OOM. My resists and fizzles aren't very helpfull either.<P>I would give something, if i would do 35% more damage than you mages and therefore pay with an increased casting time...<P><BR>(Druids, Clerics and Mages nuking almost as well as we do. 20 points more damage is not interesting at my level. 5 Seconds longer casting time isn't interesting either in an exp group)<P>No class should come that close to the damage output of a Wizard like Mages Druids and at certain levels even Clerics do. And please, stop that BS with the LOS line. You won't have anz trouble to land your spells on a MOB in an exp group... no trouble at all.<P><BR>Natan Magus<P>60 Sorcerer<P>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree, Wizzies need to be doing more damage.<P>And no, you can't use bolt spells in most places. If someone walks in front of you, that's a few hundred mana down the drain. Also, alot of mobs have higher fire resist than magic resist.<P>The smart mage specializes in conjuration, and uses the Shock Line.<P>The only time I would use a spell like Lava Bolt is a wide open area, with a perch to stand on, against a large creature. If you're a gnome and you can fit into some crack and cast this, more power to you. Most of us can't.<P>I used bolt spells with great success in FV killing giants. The extra damage is nice, especially when you can stand on the side of a slope and watch a big red fireball go streaking across the sky.<P>But any other time, in a dungeon or any area where I do not have the luxuries of space and height, I use the shock spells. In critical moments, it is much better to get a guaranteed 600 point hit than a probably 700 point hit.<P>Yes, Wizards should be doing much more damage than they currently are. Yes, mages should have self-only teleports, it's only logical. The 50+ game is all melee, casters of every type need more to compete.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is such an idiotic post.  Mages have been nerfed and made useless past 50...so lets pick on them again. How dare they IN THEORY be able to do more damage.  Obviously the person who made the original post is a wizard and never played a mage past 50 (suffering from make-belief class envy)...thus making on paper comparison of damage...never considering LOS, higher fire resists, specialization, etc...this is not a perfect world.<P>Go back to you laboratory...this is the "real" world.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff, sorry the earthpet root is the weakest in the game (I play a few classes!!) it's max duration is the shortest, the pet level is much lower (very resistable) and you can't target more than one thing with it.<P>I understand completely what you are saying, but don't exaggerate it by saying it's identical to the mage pet root - it really isn't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058105-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058105-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058105-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058105&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058105&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
