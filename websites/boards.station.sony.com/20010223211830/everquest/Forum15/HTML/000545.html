</FONT><HR>   First off I'm getting tired of this "bards suck" crap, bards are tough no doubt, and we do get swindled at times(ie. the drums not working on selo's), but that does not make us "suck". It's self pity nothing wrong with the class, just the player of the class. If you can't play a bard without whineing, go play so 10 days /p lvl 60 necro. I am glad I took the tuff road of bardichood, groups always wanting a chanter or a bard, giving me a wide veriety of options not haveing to compete for groups like finger wiglers or tanks.  <P>"In a clearing in the woods, two roads converged from one, and I, I took the one less travled by."<P>    I have over 100 days /p on my lvl 47 bard (and I'm sure i've had 1 of the toughest times gettin to where i am), but I am glad to be a bard, The Few, The Proud, The Bards.<P>Fiyn Renloral of T`kagi Ro<BR>47th Bard Fennin Ro<P>(Ps: where are the shadowknights on that list, they need more work than all 3 of the others combined)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well now, Grabted I am only a level 14 Bard, but I chose my occupation based on my real life situations.  I WAS in the beta, but didn't have a good enough connection till last year to pick up the retail version.  I have to say that I hadn't even noticed the exp penalties or the fact that the drum wasn't helping until people pointed it out to me.<P>Granted sometimes Bards get the short end of the stick, but I've made a killing training things for the higher level Chars.  (Shoot I made 157 PP last night in BB!!)<P>I haven't done much grouping lately as I've had some BAAAAD experiences in various zones, but I hope to get back into it.<P>Well that said, I am glad that they are fixing the exp thing, and will continue to support EverQuest.<P>One more thing, I wish I would see more people actively Role-Playing their Bards.

</FONT><HR>Just wondering at what level bards begin to suck.  I have my bard to 20 now and it's been nothing but a joy ride so far.  I think bards a great.  On the other hand, Paladins do need a lot of work.  My pally is at 33 and I'm starting to see need for improvement.  As far as Rangers and SK's haven't played either so I can't say to much, although I think SK's are better off than pallies and rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bards are probably the oddest, most unique, and reflective of the creativity and skill of the player classes in EverQuest. So... to answer the question, bards can either suck, or be awesome, it all depends on the person behind it.<P>As a level 30 bard, I can usually enable my group to fight creatures 2 or 3 levels above what they were fighting before I joined. Between magic resistance reduction, armor class reduction, slowing attacks, crowd control, and even charms I find ways to turn most situations to our advantage.<P>On the other hand, I watch other bards, from time to time... and most of them are useless. I see them double-wielding weapons and playing the regeneration song during combat, wearing full lambent at level 20... Sometimes I see them twisting songs... usually a combat enhancement, heal, and discord, while swinging weapons. Funny thing is, with the proper instruments, they could be doing as much or more damage... by playing binding or chains, they could be reducing party damage by 30% (which is a hell of a lot more than the non-instrument regeneration song will repair).<P>I have to assume that these are secondary or tertiary characters, who at best have gone to bard web sites and learned the "best" way to do things. Frankly, anyone who spends ALL their time barding, will never do the same thing all the time, because they realize that different situations require different approaches.<P>At this point, I play my bard 99% of the time... all my other characters have withered and petered out, because the sheer madcap nature of being a bard is too much fun for me to give up.<P>My only peeve is that some of these by-the-numbers bards with no clue build expectations with other players, who complain that I should be playing certain things while they fight because "so-and-so" does. Every once in a while, I even take the time to sit them down and run the actual numbers by them to let them know that what I'm doing is 3 or 4 times more effective than what they think I should be doing. Then I usually find a new group... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bards are great at one thing.  Resistances.  No one can boost your mr to such insane levels.  Sure, dragon raids are rare, but so much easier for a bard to twist some resists than to try to keep the entire party buffed when facing casters.  They can do a lot of other things pretty darn well too.  They can't mez as well as a chanter, but their charms are actually more useful (read no 30 second recast) than a chanters.  No one complains when you play the mana song either.  No group is so complete that your songs won't add something good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Each person has their opinion at what is "great" in the game based upon their playstyle.  I enjoy playing bards mainly due to their versatility.  Bards are unique in that they can do a lot of different things, and can best round out a group by filling in where needed.  No, they are not the best at any one thing, there is a class that can do individual things a bard does better, but only the bard can "do it all" so to speak.<BR>  My reason for bards being great is because I'm having fun playing mine, and the other bards I have spoken too have told me the same.  I play EQ to have fun, a good form of entertainment in my opinion, which is my "backing" as to why bards are great.  As to why they are not in groups, the main reaason I believe is due to bards being a very small group in Norrath.  I played a pally for almost four months before grouping with a bard, and it wasn't because my groupmates didn't want to, it was because we never saw one looking for a group.  Also, not very many people know what we aree capable of.  We are mostly known for Selo's (still called sow song by a few people until about the third time I correct them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and after 32, mana song.  I soloed through my low levels, then partnered through my low teens with a friend of mine (necro).  I went to LIO at 17, and have been in many groups since then.  My biggest shock came when I was invited into two groups shortly after logging on, and I hadn't shouted for a group or even turned my lfg flag on, something that never happened with my pally except within the guild or from friends, which tells me that bards are very welcome in groups.  In most of my groups I get tells saying things like "never knew bards could do that" and have even had people say they plan on making a bard, which is why I think there is a slight increase in bards lately.<BR>  To reply to something JackFetch said, I'm a level 20 bard in full lambent (used my pally to help twink me) and have done a lot of things that supposedly makes me a bad bard, but yet you need to look at the situation.  One group I was in consisted of a necro, a druid, and myself.  Guess who was the tank in that group.  I used my selo's to pull, and then I would use a variety of other songs in combat.  Sometimes swapping in instruments since I have them set up as hotkeys and the necro's pet could help tank.  Later we swapped the druid for a rogue, again I melee'd so that the rogue could get full benefit of backstab.  My main point is that bards are so versatile that just because you play one way doesn't mean another's is wrong.  There will be people out there that of course get into a certain mindset and play "according to the rules", but the real beauty of a bard is that we have the tools and means to be unconventional, to fill in the gaps in a group, and in general, be fun.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My friend, it is painfully obvious that you have never grouped with a competent bard. Bards will benefit every aspect of every group out there...nuff said. Let me say I am not a bard, nor have ever played one, but this is a list of what they can do......<P>1. During downtime can heal and clarity your entire group....this saves the clerics from having to waste precious mana on topping people off.<P>2. During battles, bards are upgrading your stats (AC, STR, ATK, regen, haste) plus maybe throwing a DoT in there. If you are in a group and do not want these add ons......then I dont think I would ever want to group with you.<P>3. In the event of an overpull, a bard can handle two creatures at once, damaging both pretty badly, while taking minimum damage to himself (incredibly useful)<P>This is just a small list of what they can do, dont forget about Selo's for traveling (though you'll probably die at later levels travelling with them). Most bards that suck, there are some, are because the player wanted to be a tank but chose a bard instead seeing that bards get quite a bit in the way of dual wield, songs, and can use a lot of different weapons. I have pretty much grouped with a bard through half my lvls (33 now), and I can honestly say I have died less with him then any other time, and when it comes time to raids (the big ones) i want the bard in my group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Of course people who play bards as their main character think that bards are great. I'm no exception. However, Vandalfox specifically mentioned class balancing, so I assume he's referring to game mechanics rather than subjective factors such as the unique nature of the class. Personally, I agree with him that for most situations the bard (especially after level 50) is seriously disadvantaged in terms of game mechanics.<P>Anyway, my previous post appears to have been misunderstood, so here's an example of what I mean. Unfortunately, it's the only example that I can think of  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bards are great because...they have a very effective AE slow/snare song (level 54), weavable clarity equivalent to C2 that stacks with enchanter clarity (level 55) and healing songs that provide enough aggro to have a taunt effect (55 Cantana and Niv's, level 47). They can wear plate armour, have a reasonable dodge skill and reasonble hit points, so they are able to take damage far better than casters and even clerics. SO.....in a high level AE group bards are GREAT, even irreplacable.<P>I'm not going to tell Vandalfox that bards are great because they are a challenge to play well, are an unusual class, run very fast, etc, etc, because that's just my personal view and has nothing to do with game mechanics and class balance.<P>PS Part of my reason for posting this crap is that I like to play devil's advocate  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> However, I also suspect that the issue of class balance, especially post-level 50, is going to be re-assessed in the near future. Take a look at some of the posts from VI staff on the general discussion board. It would be a shame if bards are ignored yet again because so many bard-players continually shout that bards are fantastic. Heck, they might even nerf us if they think we are too happy with our clss  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, but the reason those of us happy with the class are happy is because we know it is a difficult class to play really well, yet we have managed. We're happy that our ability with the class tends to reflect our skill and dedication... not that we have it "easy".<P>And sure, as someone pointed out above, someone can do almost everything we can do, and better. However, we are in the unique position of being able to switch roles on the fly and cover for a group's deficiencies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Vandalfox,<P>Please explain you facts behind your stupidity because you just showed your butt here.<P>It isn't the hybrids that suck. Maybe it is you that such as a player.<P>I have played a warrior, a rogue and now a bard.<P>I can honestly tell you I have found the bard to be a complete joy to play and that I don't have to ever look hardly for a group. I am at lv 27 now.<BR>From what I have seen with my class it gets only better. I have no complaints that I know of.<P>As far as the rangers and pallys, I don't know the issue if they comeplain but as hybrids our job is to assist our group and make them better.<P>I know a fellow pally that is lv27 and he tells me he loves his class, only complaint he had was that he wish he had a direct damage or dot spell for non dead npcs.  He does around 90 damage with his 2h sword or axe, cannot remember which weapon he uses.  He has double attacks that he has &lt;wish we bards had that&gt;<P>I have 3 rangers that I know and all of them love their classes as well. Don't know all the complaints the rangers have but they are suppose to be the best pullers in the game.  I know they can root and do massive amounts of damage with the bow.<P>I know one thing only that is my bard.  The way I play it makes all the sense in the world if I die in battle or cause my group to die in battle.<P>If I don't use the songs that will help them but only think of myself, I will not only indanger myself but my group as well. I will be seen as an Idiot who don't know what he is doing and will probably have to kick my char off the server for the rep I have.<P>Vandelfox before you complain or try to give classes bad reputation, you better back up any info you have. Wise choice not putting your server up because if you were from mine no way I would group with you.<P>Say it once say it again. Classes aren't what are bad is the players who think they know how to play the class without doing research and getting help in the developement of the character they play.&lt; I am in now way refering to pling or twinking when I say this&gt;<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree, I think the players with the most patience and skill play bards. That's probably the reason why I am immediate friends with any bard above 35, since that prooves that the person behind their keyboard is one of the most skilled and understanding in the game. If a problem presents itself, a bard has a fix. Still to this day, I find myself thinking about random solutions to problems that most people would give up on. I do not need to list examples of these problems since it encompasses ALL problems.<P>I love being a bard, and everytime I play one of my twinks, I sigh when I realize that a warrior can't do this, a necro can't do that, a cleric can't do another thing, all that bards can do (although not perfect, but to an extent).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just my 2 CP my main char was a lvl 30 necro at the time I started my bard.  I twinked my bard with full bronze(dont laugh that was expensive for me back then)and a BTC.  I played my bard to lvl 15 and thought man my bard is so much more fun to play than my necro.  So i sold everything on my necro and twinked my bard with a yak full lambent and still had my BTC.  Now to whoever said that i see bards who dont know how to play there class becuase they didnt start out as a bard.  I dont necesarily think thats true.  At this time my bard is lvl 30(workin toward the "mana song" as people call it) and no matter where or what im doin i always find a use. ill give u a couple of instanses cuase im bored.  It was me a cleric and a rogue killin stuff i was the main tank to keep the mob off the cleric and the rogue so the rogue could backstab.  So i played anthem,constant chain, and bellows. that almost always kept the mob on me(they really hate constant chain ive figured out).  now in another instance i was in a group of 6 me a chanter a monk,warrior,cleric,wizzie.  Now tell me that a bard is not usefull in this situation if u can find a valid reason tell me im on the karana server Name is Davardar.  anyways i stayed on intstruments usually charmed 1 and have it kicked the others ass when we pulled 2 or 3.  Usually played Anthem,chain,guardian rythms im preety sure.  We were goin against mostly casters so im preety sure thats it.  During down time i would sing "heal" song so the cleric could med and the group would still be fully healed.  NOW tell me bards suck there is not one instance i can think of that a bard is not one of the most usfull classes there is. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  later <P>Davardar Drumalot bard of the 30th song<BR>Karana server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They are a lot like enchanters, the can crowd controll, haste, mana/hp regen.  The thing is you have to learn how to play them properly, how to twist songs, how to turn a bad pull into a heap of easy xp.  With a good bard in your group you should be getting zero downtime, they don't have to med and neither do the casters after lv 32.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well i've been a bard and am if not are one of the best bards around on Innorruuk.  I would have to say that bards are fairly well balanced but there are a few key issues that do need to be addressed<P>a) Hp needs to be increased at higher levels (my  hp=most casters) which in my books isnt right because we are both a singer and a caster.<P>b) we need to have some sort of decent heal or a decent way to dmg ( bards being the 2nd lowest class of dmg dealers) Maybe increase our ticks per sec heal whatever works.<P>c)For god sake give us dual attack.  It's not like we do alot of dmg period anyways.<P>d)Lastly we need to have some songs modified for higher levels because lets face it most are basically useless below 50. I rarely if ever use anything below a 50 song now.  Some things need to be tweaked a little to give a bit more use out of them.<P>Now i've played many years (since the beginning of everquest) and i'm damn good at being a bard. Nor would i say i hate my bard due to the said topics above. In fact i love my bard and find any other class totally boring to play.  There are some issue's that need to be addressed but once they are balanced out bards will be more effective at higher levels. Otherwise i'm a happy camper.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In many instances, a Bard is far more useful than a chanter, because the chanter does one thing and one thing only well - crowd control. In a small group, that's not enough to justify a position.<BR>Recent example - group of 3 - Rogue 45, Cleric 45, Bard 40 (me), in cav Room, Lower Guk; getting late, people logging, we didn't realise how few groups were pulling from the area any more, and we ended up with a pull of 5 mobs. Replace the Bard with any other class and the groups dead. Between charming, mezzing and meleeing I managed to keep enough mobs busy that we could kill first one, then a 2nd, when room spawn popped; again I managed to keep things under some sort of control; when a 2nd room mob popped and I went LD thry  had to shout for help, but we all came through the fight alive, something I really can't see happening in such a small group without a Bard.<BR>Many people think Bards are at their best in big groups because their group buff songs have more effect then, but a good Bard can handle crowd control much better than a bad ench, and makes a huge difference to a small group; just watch out for bad Bards, they're easy to spot - bellow, bellow, bellow is the most obvious sign. I haven't used that song in nearly 20 levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Bards Suck?!"<BR>Well I have played quite a few types of characters and I'll admidt...they are all a lot easier to play (not level mind you, but play) than a bard. Casters you just have to click the spell button and the pet attack social and you then sit back down and med. A tank just has to cycle through kick, bash, punch, whatever. All pretty easy. Now with my bard (Level 26 self twinked) I have to target the puller, assist, attack WHILE clicking 3 on and off, 4 on and off, and then 5 on and off over and over again (those are my songs I twist). When a mob dies I have to re-target, re-assist, re-attack (finally I made a social to do all that), and also watch the health and what is attacking who of my entire group. It is quite a tough job to be a tank, a caster, and the groups "mother hen" or "babysitter" during every fight. HOWEVER, there is a LOT that bards can do that no other class can:<P>1) We can cast a wide variety of spells from just about every class such as Regen, Str/Dex buff, Damage Shields, Haste, Mez, Harmony, Invis, Fear, and SoW (Though a bard can outrun just about any creature except dragons so calling it SoW and not Selos doesn't really do it justice)<BR>2) We don't cast on one person but an entire area or group...when a caster casts one buff, we cast up to 6.<BR>3) We can melee, kinda. I was actually in a group tonight where I was the primary puller/tank, as well as primary healer and buffer...Not the best cituation but I did it all relatively easily.<BR>4) We aren't that expensive...My caster friends often spend hours hunting for cash before they hit that level of new spells. Bards need to buy weapons and armor (unless they quest the lambent themselves, very easy to do at level 20 with begging level 50+ people for help) and songs, but I always have extra money in the bank. Besides, having 150 Charisma makes costs pretty good in town.<BR>5) We don't take a hybrid exp disadvantage anymore! I make more exp in a group that soloing with the new EXP and level VERY fast.<BR>6) We are unique and fun! Besides the various role play advantages, no other class can "twist" or do all of the amazingly different things Bards can. <P>I challenge all of you new players to start with a Bard and old players to take on a Bard as an alt. Well, not too many of you because I still cherish my individuality...but enough of you to spread the word on how great bards are. "Bards suck, nuff said"???

We can solo (charm/fear kiting rules!), and people just love our buffs (haste/buff songs, and esp mana song). People who say "bards suck" or put us down has obviously never played a bard or if they have, had no clue what they were doing. My only complaint is the endless twisting and twisting of songs which get tiresome after awhile.

</FONT><HR>I strongly disagree. In any group ive been in, no matter if Im playing my necro , Druid or melee characters. Having any bard (even a lousy one) makes things so much easier. Heck I remember times when a bard dying meant goodluck hehe<BR> Partly because of this I was intimidated by the class however, I have recently started playing a bard (currently lvl 32) Yeah bards could use a few tweaks here and there, Im not happy with alot of the resist rates on songs, My reasoning is if songs do a little damage or a little debuff then they really shouldnt resist nearly as often. Other than that ive not many complaints so far (im sure ill have several post 50 gripes) Would love having double attack then again with some of our haste songs dual wield + double attack + songs that aggro - evade = alot of dead bards and alot of unhappy melee chars heh.<BR>Anyhow just my opinion, ive played all classes but paly and rogue past 20 (most past 30) and I am having the most fun playing my bard.<P>Khay lvl 59 necro<BR>Kaygel lvl 56 druid<BR>Trentt Rezme lvl 32 bard<BR> test server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe the only way to understand a class, especially if they are very different than yours, is to play it past level 20. When I first started EQ, I thought enchanters and wizzies were worthless. Haha, now I know better! I now have a 38 enchanter and an 18 enchanter. I have a 45 druid, a 33 pally and a few younger accounts.<P>You know what? I feel MOST confident as my bard! I get bored playing any other class besides my bard.<P>Bards demand an attentive and adaptive player behind the keyboard. If you're the type that just wants to press Attack and maybe bash or cast a spell now and then, DO NOT be a bard. If you're the type that gives the game all your focus, and is constantly ready to do something beneficial, be a bard.<P>As for grouping with a bard, if you've ever grouped with a good bard, you would not even hesitate to welcome any bard in your group. Why? Number one reason: NO DOWNTIME! Do you hate having to sit and med between pulls? Do you hate having to heal up? Do you hate getting pulls that seem to slap your group all around? Then get a bard.<P>Bards are the fastest mana regenerators, if I twist my mana song with itself during downtime, the casters ALWAYS proclaim they can't believe how fast their mana comes back. <P>Every night I log in, and shout Bard LFG, I get tons of tells begging me to join their group. If I group with a bunch of new people I've never played with before, they all say over and over "This group rocks! We can take anything! I haven't been in a group this good before, there's no downtime, keep em coming!" I just smile, because I hear this every night....  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>So we can do a little of everything, but not do it the best, huh? Well, we do some things the best. We regen mana the quickest, boost MR the highest, charm the best, run the fastest, all without mana. <P>So please, next time you want to say a class sucks, try and group with a good character from that class, try and play one even past level 20. <P>Thank you.

</FONT><HR>Hmm... T'May be one fo the most useless things I've ever said on a board, but then again, its gotta be one of the most relevant...<P>~ponders~<P>Anyway, what is up with all of you folks complaining about your class.  And its not just the bards...  The pallys, the SK's, the Rangers, the Monks, the Warriors...  They all have the same problem...   <P>If you don't like the way a particular class plays out for you, then stop playing it...  There are too many out there that appreciate and enjoy what these classes DO offer to them.<P>On another note and this one is more directed at the hybrids...  You SHOULDN'T expect to be better than ANYONE of a hardcore class in any SINGLE skill.  The purpose behind a hybrid class is to have a smattering of many different skills and yet not to be the best there is in any particualr one of them.  The warriors and monks will always be better tanks overall.  The magicians and clerics will always be better spellcasters overall... (understand that this argument is macro-cosmic in scale)<P>Your only single dominering strength is in your diversity.  So please, if you want to specialize, pick the correct class for doing so...<P>And always remember the following as was stated by Elbert Hubbard:<P>"An ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleaverness.  If you must vilify, condemn, and eternally disparage - resign your position, and when you are outside d@mn to your heart's content; but as long as you are part of the institution, do not condemn it.  If you do that you are loosening the etendrils that are holding you to the institution, and at the first high wind that comes along, you will be uprooted and blown away, and you probably never know the reason why."<P>SharFrog<BR>Master of Ropes, Pulleys, and Big Pieces of Wood</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000545&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000545&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
