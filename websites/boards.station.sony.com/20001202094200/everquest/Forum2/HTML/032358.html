</FONT><HR>The differences are far, far too huge to have been just purely accidental.  Some of the epic weapons are insanely powerful, while others aren't even worth questing over.  So the question here is why?  Abashi, Absor, Brad, or Smed (where have those two been btw? I miss em, at least smed came to our sit in and talked to us),  why did you choose to make such a huge difference between what was supposed to be the biggest reward in the game for all the endless leveling.  Did you feel that certain classes were more powerful than others and so wanted to "balance" by using the epic weapons?  If so, then please tell us why you chose the highest goal in the game to short a couple of classes, overpowered or not?<P>Tell me if I'm wrong here, but if the goal of the game is to attain power and equipment,  why did you deliberately disappoint a huge amount of players?  It's the end game item, why did you use one of the most important aspects of the game to intentionally hurt a large amount of your players?  (Read: waste their time, well over 50 to 500 HOURS of their time)<P>I think you screwed up in several areas, and with each new epic weapon thats found, the differences between certain epic weapons is becoming more and more obscene.<P>Please at least tell us why.  I know for one that if believe you had a good reason I'd be MUCH less angry.. MUCH less.  As it stands right now, it looks like you guys basically pulled things out of your ummm.. hat for certain classes, which lead to things being really really nice for some, and really really awful for others.<P>you know this is true as well, I even have a quotation from you directly in regards to one epic weapon in particular, the necro scythe.  "I'll buy that this item doesn't add anything to your class, but it doesn't take anything away either"  Wasn't the epic weapons *supposed* to add something to the class?  What was the reason for making some of the epic weapons add nothing, while others add tremendous amounts of power and desirability?<P>I'll say it again, a rusty dagger doesn't add anything or take anything away from a class, but it would be inappropriate as an epic weapon wouldn't it?  ALL of the epic weapons are obviously much better than a rusty dagger, but certain of the epic items make certain OTHER epic items LOOK like a rust dagger in comparison, why?<P>Please Abashi, I'm begging you, please answer this somehow, with some form of reasoning.  I'm not saying you have to agree with me at all, I just want to know why you don't.  As it stand, I don't want to even play my class anymore, because the absolute greatest thing that I can accomplish in the game is, well.... really really lame.<P>Absor, this might be a good issue to get your feet wet with as well.  I havn't seen you around much.<P>I've tried to make this post as non aggressive as possible, please do me the favor of keeping it that way so we at least have a wisp of a chance of getting a response.   <BR>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have seen every single class complain about there weapon here on this board.  End result?  No complaint gets any credibilty.  There are so many whines that a valid concern is buried immeadiatly in the static.   So many people want the epic quest weapon to turn them into a god and complain when it does not.  Verant would NEVER give out any weapons that would unbalance the game that badly (thank god), but anything short of that will be responded to as "this sucks".   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Orm:<P>My point is that many weapons **DO** add a considerable amount of power to the class (rogue, ranger, enchanter, bard, cleric)  while others add absolutely nothing (necro, warrior)  It wouldn't be a big problem if certain epic weapons were *slightly* better or even *better* than the other epic weapons, but the fact is that certain epic weapons are *incredibly, massively* better than other epic weapons.  It's like if you got a breastplate from the plane of sky that was +30AC plus stats while the best another melee class could get from the plane of sky (supposedly the hardest plane) was +10A plus stats.  I know that all classes have complained to a certain degree about every epic item, even the rangers (with their amazing weapons) have chimed in because they want the weapons switched around from offhand to primary hand.  That's a definite and viable complaint, but that particular issue is fairly minor in comparison to certain other classes (600+ posts for necros 300+ posts for warriors)  that say , almost uniformly, that either the weapon is useless, not nearly worth the quest, or is much less useful than items they already have and were much easier to obtain. <P>**ALL** of the epic weapons should be very desirable, like (i think) they were designed to be, and most **ARE**.  There are a couple exceptions however where some epic items are only desirable because of the particle effect, and in the case of the necro item (where the particle effect is laughable and the graphic is uhhh , uhhh , uhhh POOR)  the item isn't desirable at ALL.  Remember that most classes have to turn in some very valuable items to get the epic weapon.  <P>I'm not saying that anybody couldn't just say, "My epic weapon could be BETTER"  cause that can always happen, I'm positive that the epic weapons weren't meant to be the greatest thing possible according to current game dynamics i.e. instant death touch ect.  I'm saying that all the epic weapons should be at *least* desirable, **AT LEAST** to the point where if you had all of the components to turn in to get the item, you would do it.  I know of one epic item where that isn't the case (+20 int gloves, cloak ect) and I wonder about another one, tho I don't know the specifics of the quest so I can't say for sure.<P>I would really just like to ask why?  Hopefully they will tell us.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>it's 9/9, actually, but yeah, that's still amazing.<P>Wish they would make it so that the components of the spell that aren't overwritten still work, like in the robe we had to turn in for the quest (robe of the whistling fists). The monk weapon has haste+AC+ATK. If you get a haste buff, you lose all three.

All items within the game do not have to be exactly the same. That is what gives each class uniqueness. If every item and every class was exactly the same the game would be rather boring. I say this, if you had a level 55 necro with the epic... Would you trade places with a 55 druid with their epic? <P><BR> <BR>Phyrieht <BR>Decaying Skeleton <P><BR>Canada <BR>70 Posts Posted - 11/17/2000 :  08:55:10       <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Hell no i ll never trade a necro for a druid...<P><BR>The only thing i have to said is stop complaint about the epic quest cause VI ll never change the effect.

You wouldnt be playing the game you are today and certainly not with the playerbase it has.<P>The constant input from the players and the fact that we are the actual 'testers' for Verant is something that should be taken seriously. I resent every post that has the statement 'if you dont like it, quit' as it show blatant disregard for the players that have invested so much time and effort into their characters. Offcourse there are the 'uber-whiners' which are annoying as well.<P>If you are level 44, then you are playing the necro when it is strongest, our class peaks at around level 50 and then it goes very fast downhill, in regards to our power versus the mobs we face. This is a fact, we are not that much stronger at level 60 than level 50, and certainly not when judging our opponents at those high levels.<P>Our usefulness as you get higher dwindles more and more, summon corpse will often be the main reason to have a necro along, and when facing big things (which will be all that is left in the game that is still exciting when you reach 60) we can do next to nothing, it is frustrating as hell.<P>This weapon was something to at least look forward to, something to set your goals for and hopefully enjoy a shred of enhanced contribution to those groups we are in.<P>Sadly, it is nowhere near an Epic weapon. There is nothing epic about it in its current state and that shows clearly in the high level necro community. This is why people are complaining and rightfully so.<P>And about the druid/necro comment, let me just say that a lvl 60 druid is ALOT more desireable than a lvl 60 necro in those raids you will conduct at those levels.<P>I still love my necro and will continue to play him until I leave this game, but I do feel that the massive amount of time I use to reach 60 (50 to 60 takes as long, if not longer than 1 to 50) is not paying of, in my opinion that is.<P>Be well<BR>Malsheen, Rodcet Nife<P><BR>Edited by - Malsheen on 11/17/2000 17:33:35<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>verant made the mistake of makeing all fa quests about stats.  they should have done varried stats m intersting procs/right clicks.  i'd personaly like my necro right click to be a ht of 1k damage but for special mobs 52 plus to be able to bounce spells back 10% of the time.  This would make our own spells riskier to use.<P>paladins fa should be 1hs with a delay 15 damage 25  with a shield that has a 10% chance of reflecting spells back onto the caster.  now that would be epic and fun. &lt;1hs & shield would allow us damage almost equal to rangers/warriors.&gt;<P>warriors might want dual blades of taunting that not only proc taunts but have the swords say funny insults.<P><BR>stop telling classes you admit are weak that they shouldn't get things they asked for.  they want fun so let verant decide what's too much n not u.<P>in general my necro is great fun n is one of the handful of truely fun classes that needs no 1 item to make me fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No class "needs" an item to be playable, but when 75% of the classes get a HUGE increase in power, while 25% get something laughable (remember: for 50 to 500+ hours of effort) you've gotta ask why.  The problem here is that we havn't gotten any sort of answer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
