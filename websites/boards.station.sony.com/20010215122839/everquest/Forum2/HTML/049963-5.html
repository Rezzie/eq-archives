</FONT><HR>I'm happy with the monk damage, it's our AC and HPs that causes the problem. Although Rogues do a lot of damage backstabbing, they can't do that unless they are grouped with another tank that can taunt. Our FD has to be fixed for sure, it's certainly becomming less useful as levels go up. Usually when I try to pull in a dungeon, if I go to FD off a group of mobs, I have to stay down. No matter how far away they get, they re-agro the minute I stand up. If FD doesn't wipe a mobs agro list, what's the point?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The interesting and notable thing about EQ today, is that the best weapons are no longer monk usable.  Was that an 11/18 sword I saw on Eqlizer?<P>The primary issue I have with monks is that beyond needing weapons to maintain their role in a group now, there aren't really any outside of fighting batons readily available.  You have fighting batons... then what?  Trance sticks are very rare and sell for 7 or 8 thousand platinum.  After that there's nothing much around outside of a Tranquil Staff, Peacebringer, or similar extremely rare 2H blunt weapon.<P>Put a few more mid/high level monk-only 1H blunts in the game and life will be better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

WHY??? Cuz nobody wants or needs a monk in their group.. I got in a group finally. thanks to an enchanter in my guild, and they said whos the tank.. i said me cuz we had nothing but casters.. and they almost kicked me from the group.. again.. 22 days played.. 3 days with a group..

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>As a long time human monk (June '99ish), I've seen many a thing change of my monk. Now that he's level 45, I'm starting to experience more of what everyone has. <P>1. Flying kick. <P>I sincerely want to know why flying kick has a minimum of 3. Seriously. I have been a 'master' of this skill for ages, yet I miss often and do these pathetic minimums. How can being a master translate to misses and damage of 3? Please look at changing flying kick. Is it not reasonable to have a minimum damage equal to our level? Post 45 in regular play and in planes and dragon raids, would that seriously alter the game? I do not believe so. If it is, I would like to know what you think.<P>2. Fists.<P>Yes, there are wonderous new weapons. But I chose the monk because I wouldn't necessarily need them. Please make it more reasonable for me to use my fists post-45. A touch better damage wouldn't hurt. Perhaps a bit slower delay as well? (Beyond what is currently happening post-50) Given the uber mobs now present in Kunark and Velious, you cannot say that more damage and lower delay fists would unbalance gameplay. The weapons already can bring us to that level. Why not allow us to return to the honor and dignity brought to us once with our fists alone?<P>3. Weight restriction.<P>Up until 50, we are stuck with the 14lb. weight limit. Pre-Velious, pre-Kunark, this made sense. Any monk who has played since the beginning knew that this was a tradeoff for our incredible damage dealing ability compared to other classes. Now, with Kunark and Velious, the other classes have been brought into line and in certain cases exceeded the monk class. Yet our penalty still remains. PLEASE consider raising the weight limit to something more reasonable. This is a penatly that no longer makes sense. Your design teams have gone to the effort to make nice armors that are monk wearable but that no monk will ever wear because of the weight! Where is the sense in that?  Giving us a larger weight limit will also help to alleviate some of the AC gripes that we have because or the armor we have to wear. Please consider it again.<P>4. Other.<P>If you can't or are unwilling to raise flying kick, why not implement a new attack skill for level 45? Call it Whirling Dervish or something;. Use the same animation as Instill Doubt. Have it use Eagle Strike, Dragon Punch, and Flying Kick, with very little pause between attacks (a 1-2-3 hit combo). Give it a longer recycle time than flying kick. This would give us a bit more damage, potentially, yet be offset by the recycle time.<P>5. Feign death.<P>Return FD to its former function. Pre-Kunark and Velious, it was nerfed post-35 to stop (or rather, slow down) feign pulling. Guess what? It still happens to a degree. Guess what? Bards and enchanters do it better anyway, before and especially now. Guess what? Giving us back this utility, even though it was not what you envisioned in its use, would make monks appealing again and allow us to contribute more to a group. You have talked about risk versus reward. In a group setting, where the monk is the only viable puller, you set that risk as too high just to curb  what to you was an undesirable tactic. A tactic which has always been better served by other classes anyway. Giving us back our FD pull ability would just make it that much easier to get a group together and go adventuring - just like you WANT us to! If you need to, nerf it for uber-mobs. But don't do this for everyday monsters. Just giving us the ability back won't unbalance things. FD pulling still requires skill to do properly and will therefore still entail risk. At one time, it may have been the prudent course. But now, even you have realised that things changed. Why not consider changing this back? <BR>---<BR>I hope this has given you a few ideas that you can consider and implement to help make the monk class better than it has been, for a long time. Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We shouldnt be able to compare the damage % either. not a 5%, not a 10%. Not even a 20%. I want to be the toe to toe, best damage dealer in the game. AND NOT BY AN INSIGNIFICANT margin.<P>Not because of a skill I can use 9 seconds every 30 mins. Not cause of a weapon that drops once every 2 weeks and I have to fight with twinkers for. And not because Verant makes uber weapons for warriors easy to get.<P>1. Give flying kick damage a min damage factor. Level / 2<P>2. Give thunderkick a min damage = level X 1.5<P>3. Give damage bonus on both monks fist. <P>4. Increase monk bonus damage with blunt weapons.<P>5. Increase the effectiveness of dodge and block for a monk.<P>Monks are NOT tanks at higher level, so no I dont want more hp or ac. <P>We are "SUPPOSE" to be damage melee masters.

</FONT><HR>bumpity bumpity bump<P>I would like to see us get our FD restored to usefulness.<P>Move our damage output between Rogue and Warrior damage.  Not just 5% to 10% more than warriors.  It should be at least 20% more damage than warriors on average.  Love rogue damage, but I don't think they should be doing 2X our damage as is either.  The easiest way to fix both is to move monk damage up.<P>/agree with making specials have a decent minimum damage.<P>Make disciplines useful as well.  Thunderkick is a sick joke.  Believe it or not but Whirlwind's long recycle time makes it almost useless except for god/dragon/epic raids.  Our lvl 60 discipline is basicly the same as whirlwind from the recycle time perspective.  Please have these lowered.  They should only be 30 min at the most when you first get them.  Not 72 min<P>We should leave the idea of more HP and AC alone.  In Kunark/Velious zones there is no reason why a monk should be main tank anyway. (although I know we end up tanking the mobs even with warriors there)  This brings me to another point.<P>Make TAUNT a better skill.  I know this is not a monk skill but we benefit from it.  The upgrade you made to this skill a few months ago was nice, but I think you should increase its affectiveness again.<P>If you can't/won't make taunt better then we should have some sort of evade skill.<P>Yoshimura Mohashimu<BR>The Light Brigade<BR>57 MASTER, Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I agree with much of the things that have been posted here.  I have a couple of concerns that have not been voiced yet.<BR>H2H is basically pointless.  At every level there are better 1hb abd 2hb that can be had.  This has only gotten worse as expansions have been released.  The weight limit doesn't help.  As someone stated, no other class has to make a choice between using their best weapons or having a good AC.  Solutions to this are either increasing the hand to hand damage (the aggro issue is discussed below), or increasing the weight limit, or slightly more interesting creating an additional wieght limit, one for worn equip one for carried items.  For example, a monk wearing more than 10 pounds, and carrying more than 10 additional pounds would incur a AC penalty.  Nay sayers will reply that I'm just increasing the weight limit, but the difference is that you're increasing the amount of allowed equipment without touching the backpack weight limit.  The other idea I liked a lot was gaining the ability to use some of the various special attacks simultaniously, ie the punch skills, and the kick skills at the same time.<P>Bad Tanks: Monks aren't the best tanks, nor should monks be a "tank" in the sense many people mean it, ie damage soak.  Rogues aren't "tanks" either, but serve well enough in that role, by obsorbing some damage then evading the mob onto someone else.  Monks should "tank" by being hard to hit.  Obviously many people feel that the current numbers aren't good enough, I would make one suggestion.  Increase Monks Skill Caps.<BR>Currently, Dodge, Block, and Riposte all cap around 230, increase this number to 250.  H2H (for unknown reasons) caps at 245, while 1 & 2hb cap at 252.  Monks depend on their skills and increasing them is the best way to increase their power.  A change like this is 'in-line' with the monk arch-type (highly skilled masters of fighting), while not being outragous to do.<P>A change I would like would be for monks to get another skill in the 40's.  Casters and hybrids get new spells every X level's.  Rogues and Warrior have all kinds of neat stuff to go find.  Monks, well, need to go kill stuff and gain xp.<BR>I'm sure no monk would turn down Hide, but in line with monk's avoiding damage rather than taking it, Parry at 44.  One more dice to roll to avoid that damage that the warrior would absorb and smile, and the rogue would evade.<P>Monk Disciplines:  No one has commented on the monk disciplines, and I would like to be the first to complain about the general uselessness of many.<BR>Stone Stance: Great, all Monks love it.<BR>Thunder Kick: Doesn't do enough damage to be worth using your discipline usage, seems like about 50% more damage than a dragon kick.<BR>Whirlwind: Great and wonderful.<BR>Voiddance:Worthless.  Why would I use a discipline that lasts 1 sec less than whirlwind, recharges 1 minutes slower, and does less.  Voiddance Dodges all physical attacks, Whirlwind ripostes all physical attacks.  A pointless and vaguely insulting discipline.<BR>Innerfire: ehh, in real usage, it's about double damage.  Not worth the recharge time.<BR>100 Fist: ehh, not worth it.  At this level you should have max haste in every situation that matters.<BR>Ashenhand: If you want to use a damage enhancing disc, Thunderkick is better (~170 every 8 min vs. ~450 every 70).  The inst-kill will only occur on things much lower level than you.<BR>Silentfist: I don't have it so I can't say.  I don't expect much however.  Haven't heard the 60 monks raving about it.<P>Summary: A sad collection of Disciplines.  The best ones are all received by level 53.  Sadly I don't have any real great suggestions.  I would gladly dump any of the last four for a auto-hit discipline (duration 30 sec, 30 minutes recharge). maybe with a guarenteed double hit, dual wield as well.<P>Mend: No other class has an ability that directly punishes you for failure.  If the rogue fails to Hide, the mob sees you.  If I fail to mend, I should not lose HP, I should just not gain any.  When Mend is being used the consequences of failure are usually the mob will kill you.  Verant should not help the mob along by "worsening my wounds".<P>Feign Death:  It should effect the aggro list.  If not immediatly, then over time.  There is nothing worse than some random mob you feigned off come running back to you 15 minutes later.<P>I hope these ideas and comments are useful. I welcome comments on these issues, especially on disciplines.<P>love<BR>Phipps</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Basically, what the poster's point was that there isn't anything *UNIQUE* to monks. I completely agree with his post. What can monk do to contribute to the group? Ask yourself that. Damage? Nope, got rogues. Tank? Nope got warriors. FD pull? Got nerfed. Name a feature that monks have and I'll name another class that can do it effectively or hell, even BETTER than monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
