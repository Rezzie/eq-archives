</FONT><HR>Err....<P>You are playing a Ranger.... You have some good stuff from your Warrior part and some good stuff from your Druid part.<P>However, you are NOT a caster!!!<P>If you like to be a Tank, play a Warrior.<P>If you like the idea to bind yourself everywhere or port you around the world, play a Druid.<P>If you want to be a little tank, a little caster, play a Ranger.  But don't expect to get all the top-notch fighting ability and gears of Warriors, and the best spells of Druids.  You are a hybrid: therefore you sacrifice some melee skills to your casting ability.  But your casting should never match the one of a Druid, and teleport is way a too powerful spell to be cast by Rangers.<P>Just my 2 coppers.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Minerios, proud Half-Elf Ranger on the 12th track<BR>-Vazaelle-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a Ranger myself, I can say without a doubt I do not want self-ports or any of that. Self-ports will not give you power, they will not earn you a spot in a group or raid, they will not balance the Ranger class or their desirability in a group. It would be nice, yes.. but it would cost us something else we could have gotten that would help us. On the other hand, the only way i'd see and accept giving us some form or Druid port ability would be if it's an Evac spell, because then it might actually earn us some favor in a group and MAYBE a raid. Even then I'd rather not have an Evac spell, but something else... say like some form of a defense boost?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No ports is my vote.<P>Rangers should be 2nd string warriors with useful spells. Rangers shouldn't be baby druids, they should be fighters with spells and abilities  that reflect their role in a fantasy setting - scouts, explorers, archers. Basically the border patrol for the good races. Those spells mostly come from the druid line but IMO druids should not be considered the parent class, warriors should.<P>Also what does 'balance' mean. If one of the meanings is that too many players are picking one class because it has too many in-game advantages compared with other classes (e.g Dr00ds); then giving rangers ports is unbalancing. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>SKs are 25% Necro and 75% Warrior<BR>Pallys are 25% Cleric and 75% Warrior<BR>Rangers are 25% Druid and 75% Warrior<P>What is unique for Necros?   Lifetap spells<BR>What is unique for Clerics?  Rezurection spells<BR>What is unique for Druids?  Traveling spells<P>Before anyone yells at me to much look at the spell lists.  These are at the end of the post.<P>When comparing all of the spells between the hybrid and the parent class there appears to be about a 20 level difference in spells.<P>I think that Warriors have been nerfed by pumping up the offensive and defensive skills of the hybrids.  WE ARE NOT WARRIORS!!!  These skills should be lowered.<P>But, I think we should get our parent classes "identity" spells 20 levels later.  Druids port.  Clerics and Necros don't.  The one thing that makes a druid different is that they can port.  RANGERS ARE PART DRUID.  The only thing Rangers curently get from Druids is Wolf form.  Sow is present in Shamans, Bards, Druids and Rangers.  SoW is not a Druid "identity" spell.  Pallys get Resurection and Rangers get wolf form?  Huh?  Rangers should get port.<P>Rangers aren't archers, warriors are just as good.<BR>Rangers aren't trackers, Druids and bards get it also.<BR>Rangers don't get harm touch or lay hands.<BR>Rangers are second class warriors that have terrible healing spells.  At level 21 I was still healing 10 points per cast.  I used bind wound it was faster!<P><BR>SOLUTION:  Warriors are unbalanced.  Give them a once per game day Decapitate skill that does 10 times the normal damage for one round and doesn't miss. Kick, bash, and all weapons.<P>SOLUTION:  If Rangers don't get the ring and circle spells 20 levels after Druids consider this.  Give them an ability at level one to cast "Circle of Life".  This would be an instantanious uninteruptable evacuation spell for one person.  If someone in your group is about to die you can cast it and they port to their home city.  IE.  Surefall glade, Freeport, Qeynos, GFay.  Their initial bind point would be used.  This would be a dual edged sword.  Useful but very dangerous.  A member of your group is gone.  They didn't die, but they are gone.  I'm not sure if your Enchanter would thank you for saving their life AND porting them to Erudin when the group is in Velious.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Maybe just make it their current bind point.

</FONT><HR>Being a relatively young Ranger, I am still learning my spells... but personally, I would much rather have a bind spell than a TP. I've only been ported once so far, as a favor to my travelling companion, someone came and picked me up because I was bound in Kelethin and died in NRo. I can travel without ports... as a matter of fact, I prefer it, because it means I remain self-reliant. But I still find myself needing to ask for binds when I travel, and many times have a very hard time finding one, which limits my enthusiasm for travelling far from home.

</FONT><HR>First to the person who said that Firefist was a useless night only spell try again. It can be cast any time and is a decent little self only attack buff, Sure its low level but every little bit helps.<BR>I honestly don't see a self only port to one spot on each continent as unbalancing however as another person pointed out it hardly makes us more desirable in a group and if (not holding my breath) it were to happen would just cause class envy which we get enough of as it is with no justification.<BR>Personally I was stunned when I found out eyes of the cat was self only. being a Wood elf all this ended up being was a waste of a couple plats and a used spot in my spell book this is one spell I would definitely like to be changed from self only.<BR>The fact is that the problem with Rangers is not a lack of gimmicky useless abilities (we've got those in plenty) its the lack of usefullness to groups. Its the fact that we bring nothing really useful to a party in the higher level except a marginal amount of damage and a serious mana drain on the healer.<BR>As it stands now we are a liability to most higher level groups our cost benifit sheet doesn't balance. And the whole world seems set against us getting it fixed the last thing we need is another non critical ability to cause objection to having our real deficiencies addressed. <BR>Hybrid as they currently stand are broke, With the exception of Bards (yes I know you have your gripes but I've never seen a bard lfging for long) <BR>Rangers and Knights have serious problems as witnessed by the shortage of high level mains in those classes.<BR>And every time we try to get these matters adressed in some way one of our parrent classes objects. Warriors don't want us to be worth a damn tanking or doing damage because they are afraid their role will be upset. Rogues and Monks don't want us doing more damage because then their role is threatened. <BR>Druids don't want us getting cool actually group benifitial spells because then their role will be threatened.<BR>Well why is it that the classes who suffered for two years under an unfair unjustified experience penalty have to play second fiddle to these other classes who were in general able to advance half again as fast as we did. Hell the only ones who had it worse than rangers under the xp penalty were Troll Sks any of you who advanced under the 60% penalty you did have my respect.<BR>Finally it comes down to this we didn't play a hybrid to suck. We didn't play a hybrid to just cast spells, we didn't play a hybrid to just fight. we played hybrid cause we thought we would have more flexibility and be moer versatile than our purebred bretheren. <BR>I read the Rangers description and I thought cool light armor but agile and able to avoid blows, Not able to deal out quite as much damage as a warrior but able to hold our own in toe to toe fight. Master of the bow (what a joke) cool so I'll just hang back and feather my enemies from a distance. Basically I saw the Ranger as a skilled hunter who would win through guile and cunning where brute stregth served others.<BR>Then I played the game. And now after 42 levels I feel like the little clumsy boy waiting to be picked for a team at school. Standing at the corner of the zone shuffling my feet while I wait for every one else to pick hoping that someone will feel sorry for me and pick me.<BR>And I do know that every Ranger feels like this sometimes and lest we forget there is always someone to remind us. <P>sonso shouts group looking for tank<BR>you tell sonso 42 Ranger here<BR>sonso tells you I said looking for tank<P>/em frown<P>So I say no to personal ports no matter how convinient and nice hey might be I believe that there are far more important matters for be addressed first and that personal ports would set other classes even more against us getting the improvements we need. <P>At this point two things would make me happy. Increased defensive skills Dodge riposte parry (we are supposed to be quick an agile) I can understand as a light armor wearing class that when I get hit it should hurt (alot) but I should be nimble enough to avoid them in fact I'd say we should get a higher probablity for success in those skills that would make up for lower defence.<BR>Make archery a viable form of combat (eg change damage to same as meele weapon dmg*2 adjusted for str or dex with level bonuses) Why should mana casters have a monopoly on soloing. Arrows cost money mana and inventory space so whats the problem?<BR>Make us the true masters of the bow (reduced dly on bows better hit percentages and min damage)<BR>Add double attacks to bows and let rangers only trip attack. K now we can stand back out of meele range and help the group with out frustrating the tanks who are trying to taunt or oom the healers trying to keep us alive.<BR>Give us fletching upgrades and make them worth while, Bows that are close to the best bows in the game. Imbued bows and arrows with dots and procs. <BR>Make us usefull that's all we ask. No one class should be required or shunned in most situations. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rangers should not get any tports.<P>"It wouldnt out balence or overpower us, just reduce our travel time."<P>Would you mind explaining to me how it is that only one melee class being able to teleport himself to any one of the 3 spots would NOT be out of balance. How is it you can justify a melee class having a teleport while no other melee class having one not being out of balance. <P>Furthermore, if the teleport is self-only it would be a clear benieft to that class and that class only. A benieft to a class is a power increase for that class. A benieft to that class that does not benieft any other class is by definition an over balancing benieft.<P>Finally, are you mad! What do you think the EverQuest communities reaction would be if they gave rangers teleports? Heck, many of them are pissed as it is because we have SoW. Many of them are pissed as it is because we have Dual Wield. What do you think they will do if we are given the benieft of teleports and not be able to help any other class with that benieft. Atleast paladins can help others with their resurections. At least shadowknights can help others with there pets and corpse summons. How would rangers be able to help with self-only teleports?<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger 55 summers<P>/em Shakes his head in disbelief that such suggested could ever come to a person's mind.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do not, and never have thought rangers should get teleports. I feel they have gone a little overboard on the spellcasting ability of all the hybrids, personally. I think the hybrids should be primarily MELEE fighters, with a smattering of utility abilities from their parent caster class. For the ranger, the Skin Like... line, the personal shields, damage shields, buffs etc are all fine, they support in the role of MELEE fighting. Teleports would be a little bit out there.<P>I do think rangers should get a self only version of bind. We are supposed to be scouts and explorers, after all.<P>Llyric Yeager, 53rd season ranger of Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Consider a "Ring of Life" once per day effect. <P>As a ranger, at level one, I can evac someone that is about to die to their bind point.  Instant, uninterruptable!  When mez breaks and we can't taunt everything off I can evac my chanter!  This would show the Druid side of the Ranger without overpowering them.  It would make them useful and welcome to a group.<P>Rangers are light, agile, warriors but we are also part druid.  We receive nothing from our druid side.  Clerics can Rez, Necros can Lifetap, and Druids can Port.  Pallys get Rez, Sks get lifetap, and Rangers get nothing.<P>As a special hybrid skill, Pallys get Lay Hands, SKs get Harm Touch, and Rangers get nothing.<P>I am a mana sink to any group I get in.  <P>/ooc Ranger LFG.<P>*chirp*<P>*chirp*<P>*chirp*<P>Rangers should get some special once per day ability that is group friendly.

I know shammies get SoW also, but melee class with sow is nice, ya gotta admit, just like I love the ability to be a "tank" (yep, "tank", a very sh!tty one, but a tank), and be able to heal almost as well as a druid/shaman. you get nice DD's/DoT's, I checked out your spell list, and I'm not sure what lvl it was, when you get a 302 fire based DD spell and then 2 I think lvl later you get  a 440 DD spell.. don't tell me you get nothing, ok....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
