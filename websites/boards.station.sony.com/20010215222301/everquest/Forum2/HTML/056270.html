</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056073.html<P>Author  Topic:   Magician Talk:  <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 02-07-2001 10:41 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They can solo for their entire career fairly well. Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome. There is some concern about the use of pets in higher level groups. Pathing in places can make them more of a danger than a help. And any creature with an AoE fear spell will exclude the use of magician pets. I'm not sure that these issues constitute any sort of imbalance, though. Fixing them, however, would most certainly eliminate any concern that magicians might have about having something to do in raids against the boss mob, or against the high hit point Velious monsters. Having powerful pets gives them the ability to contribute to the combat, regardless of the magic resistance of the monster, or the magicians available mana.<BR>So, most of what is listed below are essentially minor. The issue of a change to the way rain spells work crosses several classes, though, and is the only real sweeping concern here. The change to the way link death and logging back in works hit magicians pretty hard. The tedium and expense of summoning new items when you go link dead is harsh.<P>No Rent Items: We all know what happened when we changed the way players log back into the servers after disconnect, and how that affected magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items). The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. This would be a perfect solution (and one that I’ve heard the players suggest a few times).<P>Rain Spells: Can we remove the pets from the equation? Just this would probably make them useful without making them too useful. I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would probably overpower these spells by a large margin. We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high.<P>New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons: With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of the Sword of Runes) we also mentioned that we would be adding new proc’ing summoned weapons for them. Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few situational weapons.<P>Pathing: Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.<BR>Notes: Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst. <P>Pets and AoE fear: Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated about letting them make other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be expected by the players that immunity to fear would make more sense for necromancer pets than mage pets. But, as always, gameplay has to come before appearances.<P>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire: The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet. Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone check? If it is, should it be? Perhaps another careful examination of these pets is in order…<P>Spell Drops: Could someone look into the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) and Blizzard, just to see if they are dropping off the right level monsters? There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire. Is that really where it should drop?<P>Pet Names: How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets named by that name. It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of characters, and it would make people with pets much happier. Not to mention it would help diversify the landscape a bit. Or perhaps some other way to allow for more interesting names than the list they are randomly chosen from now.<P>Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool looks)?<P>Rage of Zomm: How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm?<P>DoTs: Why did we give magicians DoT's with Velious? It does seem a bit odd.<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: The claim is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well. We should up its ability to taunt. I don’t see a reason that it can’t be a super taunter. With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn’t seem to overpower it. Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much maybe we should give it a few more hit points. Also (or maybe instead), perhaps making it more of an escape spell would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<P>Higher level pet healing spell: By giving them a better healing pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, we can force them to decide if they want to heal or summon a new one in a tight spot. The last one they get is at 20th level, I think. It’s a good spell line that seems worthy of continuation.<P>Improved Invisibility: Why don’t magicians get this spell?<P>Phantom Armor: Two concerns here. The first is that it uses 4 components! That’s an awful lot of components to carry around. It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much. The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems to me that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also give additional regen…<P>Aegis of Ro: The players think that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all. I've also been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed drop off a dragon in Dreadlands. Perhaps a slight increase in the drop rate on this spell would be good. (Note: Obviously we've fixed this one since I wrote this. This spell never was dropping, but is now.}<P>Pet Fear Immunity spell: One idea that came in during the necromancer thread spurred me to suggest this. Area of affect fear spells make pets unwanted in some places. How about we give magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short while? (another note: See, the dev team DOES read these threads…)<P>Robe of Conjuration: Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield. How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<P>Pet Health Bars: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.<P>Ok, keep in mind that this list was written a while ago. Obviously some of these items have already been added. And some of them really are not class balance issues (I wrote this up before the idea of starting the class balance threads even existed). So, please, let's only talk about these ideas (if you don't like them or think I've written them incorrectly) and new ones. But please keep in mind, if you know you've stated it before and it is not on this list, that's probably because I purposefully did not add it to the list…<P>Alan<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bind Wounds - Every magician has a ready supply of bandages owing to the spell "Summon Bandage" and as an INT caster would have the brainpower to master the medical skills necessary to perform much better at Binding wounds than, say , a warrior.  When I play my mage I use bind wounds CONSTANTLY.<P>I read in a recent chat how Bind Wounds was getting its cap raised for additional classes but that only Priests and Pure Melee would be able to bind above 70%.  This makes little sense as a Priest class has a perfectly fine way to heal (healing spells anyone??) while Int casters would be forced to take the time to master the Medical arts in order to keep themselves healthy.<P>Why not let the INT casters (not the priests) have the 200+ Bind Wounds cap to reflect their scholarly knowledge.  I dont think anyone would argue that Binding of Wounds is infringing on healing that Priests do, whereas all the priest classes nuke nearly as well if not BETTER than the Int casters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Well, i've thought up a few other suggestions that might be kinda neat for mages to have.  <BR>1.) Have bard songs and group spells effect pets too, expecially our DS's, it's a pain to cast a group DS and either remem or have a spell gem taken up to DS the pet. <BR>2.) As for a useful summon spell, have mages be able to summon an in zone type gate potion.  so where ever the mage cast the spell the potion would bring the user back to that point.  just so it's not too powerful give it some kinda of expensive reagent like dots and like i said make it only in zone for tanks and such to get out of deep doungens a little easier.<BR>3.)  I'd like to see a no rent no drop unlimited or at least a multi charge mod rod type item. maybe worsen the ratio a little bit so it's not quite like a summoned mana stone, or limit it to 10 charges so we actually have some sort of mana regen like most other casters.<BR>4.)  I've heard it mentioned alot, but i'd like to see new pet graphics even if it's something like different colored mudmen just something kinda more interesting that the current blobs we have now.<BR>5.)  Give all pet casters voice graft, it really doens't have much of a use but it's fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>6.)  Please fix the pathing of some zones, most notably the pathing around BR/SR in Lguk, PoH, and Crystal Caverns.  I'm sure there's more but those are where i have had the most problems with controling my pet but in general almost all doungens could use a change.<BR>7.)  How about an escape spell other than gate, most other casters have an escape spell of some sort, it could be as simple as "Summon Wall of Force" where there's away around the caster for maybe 7seconds, just long enough to mash gate and hope you don't die<P>   well, that's all i have most of the changes i've seen haven't been really huge cause the mage class is pretty balanced, i'd just like to see some spells added to make us more group friendly.<P>Falkahnhan Righteousfire<BR>51 Elementalist<BR>Azure Sky<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No Rent: the danger of losing an expensive/rare item to your No Rent bags poofing on a LD is a nightmare (who'd like to lose their Focus items? agh!)<P>Rain Spells: not just that pet eats a wave, the simple fact these spells are GARBAGE in their present form (max of 4 hits, or 3 one one creature, and resists are contantly much higher)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> <BR>Also NPCs when they cast get a full three waves. That is so uterly UNFAIR  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Please make these hit all creatures in the radius ONCE, or one creature 4 times, one or the other  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Procing Weapons: Blades of Acid, Poison, Ice, Fire, Shards woudl fall well withing the Elemental nature of mages  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pathing: Yes this is a major concern! Hate stands out as the worst, pets are basically unusable, except in a "suicide run" on Maestro/Inny, then must be dismissed. plane of hate is a vital area for mages due to the drops of Apothic/Earth staff<P>Pets/fear spells: Why not make the EARTH pet have massive magic resistance? All the other pets have a resistance: Water=Poison, Air=Cold, Fire=fire, but the earth pet has NO resistances. if you made them have very high MR, this woudl make sense as they are the pet that "sticks on the target", and earth mobs in the Hole have high MR. Also gives mages in duels/PvP a pet that is appropriate for certain enemies (i.e. hard to fear it but it can't stun or nuke)<P><BR>Voceration Fire: yes these pets are useless in melee, 27 hp or so dmg and they can't taunt worth a damn. BEst use of them is on low blue casters, as they disrupt a lot. Please make ADDITIONAL fire pets same as the old ones, or let them act same as old ones plus cast a lot (i.e. one round melee one round cast). The caster pets are good in duels/casters but no use as tanks, which is the great use of fire pets, on unmezzable/unstunnable mobs like giants in Kael thats where fire pets rock.<BR>Also the Vocerate fire pets cast a DISPEL!!! arggh!! Get rid of this please it is very dangerous.<P>Spell drops: NEVER seen the water pets 54--60 yet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> And Call of the Hero is so rare, and so vital to mages actually being WANTED in a group that it's terribly frustrating.<P>Pet names: I like it but may cause problems with the system I can sympathize with the programmers on this one. Hm maybe make a caster pick ONE NAME for all his pets and that must stay until a /rename is used??<P>Rage of Zomm: no this pet needs ot have 500hp or more. It's only usefull in a raid,  and one riposte/AOE etc kills it, making it useless.<P>DoTs: these ROCK!! You have no  idea how useful DoTs are. Teh mage ones have a heavy "wallup" and disrupt casters, and arent very taunting so you can use when attacked by numerous giantrs engaging several tanks, causing damage without aggroing yourself. They do need fixed though, resist too much, unless they are given other abilties which I heard was rumoured, i.e. elemental effects such as root, blind (fire) etc<P>Dyzil's Decoy: not got that but mages who have all say the same: the Taunt is no use.<P>Pet Heals: thats a major concern at high lvl, healing 200 hp in the same time pet can take 400 hp is not really much use  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Improved Invisibilty: I would like that one but is it a "general spell" useable by all casters, or elemental? (i.e. air = invisibility). If YES then mages should get it.<P>Phantom Armour: yes, have to carry too many components  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> Also the enchanter Shade-type AC buffs also over write it.<P>Mages are elementalists but we have ONLY magic and Fire based spells. This seems unwarranted. Why can't we get poison (water), ice (water) spells? Also why no stuns?! several classes get an air based stun, also basiliks have a petrification (earth) stun.<BR>And mages don't get ROOT!! (earth again)<BR>Some say that giving mages root/stuns would make the class unbalanced: no it wouldn't! Try playing a mage, without a pet you are DEAD. So travelling in many areas is a nightmare.<BR>If this new spell on Test server (pet jboot speed) is brought out,that would help. But it seems totally illogical that mages can't root or stun. it takes time to cast these, and if you use them your pet will do the damage rather than your nukes so the pet will get the kill, which leads ot another point...<P>Pets take 50% Xp: since xp penalties have been changed only mages (and necros) get this totally ridiculous penalty when soloing. So if a group gets an xp bonus, why should yuo pet take xp? DOes a warriors sword take XP? Does a wizzies nukes take xp? Any other class would freak with that penalty! :&gt; You may WANt us to work in groups, Verant, but frankly we odnt' have the time etc to do so and some customers enjoy soloing. I do at times as it lets me read a book, chat with friends in RL or guild/in the zone etc. And many tiems frankly I won't join a group due to the risk, I LIKE playing with friends and folk I trust, so I dont' get stuck with a 2 hour CR that causes nothing but bad feeling (bad for business).<P>Inter-zone Call of the Hero: High level version of call of the hero to summon folk to the mage, liek a reverse TP, now that would make mages in demand  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Currently too much emphasis is on warrior-cleric-enchanter. Those are superb classes, but the others are not so wanted, mages in particular, how often do you see "group looking for a mage" ?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>The mage class rocks, I LOVE it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Could just do with some tweaks is all.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) If Mage pets can take exp from you or from the group, then they deserve to receive group buffs and bard songs.  The only fixes for this are to remove the possibility of the pet getting exp (which would probably unbalance mages), or allow them to receive buffs with the rest of the group (the better fix imo).<P>2) Give us the ability to see our pet's health.  I think the coolest fix for this would be similar to the latest exp bar addition that allows you to see intrabar exp.  Simply add a small thin line to our health bar that represents our pets health.<P>3) SUMMMON ROD OF RETURN (NO DROP, NO RENT, LORE) 50 mana, 15 sec cast, 1 expendable charge of return target group member to their bind point.  This would add NO power to the mage himself, only make him more group friendly.  I actually think this is very cool because it forces the mage to stay behind in the dungeon to port out all the melee first.  Very cool concept imo.<P>4) Different pet models for the epic (multi colored glob?), rage of zomm (large eye of zomm) and decoy pet (dual wielding high elf warrior same size as a brownie).  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>5) Some sort of defense spell - either a fast cast pet with few hitpoints or a fast terminating root (just long enough to gate).<P>All of the other initial thoughts in your primer post are excellent ideas that I agree with as well.<P>- Beg<BR>54 Mage of The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>   Fixing the chain research maldesign is easy.  All you have to do is eliminate the requirement of the previous level spell from the trade skill formula.  Then, mage research will work like every other caster class -- two looted random drop items combine into a new spell.  Only mages have to toss in the previous level spell, which is not just expensive, but drastically lowers the probability of success.  Remember, probabilities multiply.  If research is "trivial" for you (which we know means about a 75% chance of success at trade skills), then you really have a .75 * .75 * .75 = 42% chance of success at mage research when you're chaining through three levels.  It really does make a big difference.  The cost is also dramatically higher, for no apparent reason, both from the additional failures and the fact that the spells are much more expensive than the loot components.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>  The problem as I see it with the mage class is that Kunark/Vellious have removed our role. <BR>   <BR>  A mage, historically, was a damage machine that could outdamge any class in the game. Thus, you added a mage and stuff got killed faster.<P>  In the high end game though e.g. 55+, any reasonably equipped tank will outdamage me, even paladins. Verant, if you don't believe this, run the logs.<P>   So the question becomes, why bring a mage when you could bring a tank which would A) outdamage the mage and B) be able to tank some.<P>   The core problem of course is that mob in kunark/vellious got much stronger than their old world counterparts, while pets and magi nukes got only a marginal increase.<P>   The solution is to buff the 50+ pets considerably so that my 57 pet outdamages a 57 warrior with two jade maces by the same ratio that my 49 pet outdamged a 49 warrior with 2 yaks.<P>    I don't see this happening of course, which is why my mage is still 57 and my monk is 52 and rising. Its a melee/heal game now; no point in fighting the vision.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>As a very old Magician that has been around and seen some of the finest Mages quite there class I feel that your statement makes it pointless in Mages trying to improve there class.<P>You state that our class is balanced, and in some respects I agree with you but only in the context on 1 - 50. Over this level the Magicians where given trinkets as spells, DDs that where a minor upgrade, pets that are only a small percentage better and Summons that are only for fun.<P>What the Magician needs is group spells considering the soloing ability of this class was reduced on the release of Kunark.<P>Now understand that we all appreciate this but when our spells are broken, or even not looked at properly. Take for instance the Fire Pet, HOW long have we been on at you all about this, does it remind you of DUEL WEILD!!!!<P>And to be quite honest I have no confidence that you will do right by the Magician Class, as much as I do not beleive that ANYONE at Verant plays a Magician as his Primary, because if there was someone then the DOT spells would NEVER have been given to the Magician Class, and not in there current state if that.<P>Sorry fellow Magicians, but the only thing you will get in TRINKETS!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Make the lvl 52 and 58 Fire pet like the old Fire pet. I loved the fire pet, I personally used it alot.<P>After lvl 29 it became a very viable pet, and it was one of my favorites to use.<P>The new fire pet sucks. I would rather have a pet that was like a fire elemental. Beats on things, burns them, and things get burnt when they hit it.<P>It was a very well designed pet. All the pets are very well designed. <P>Don't know why they changed the mage pets in the first place, it was the one aspect of the class that really didn't need changes beyond making them dual wield like they were supposed to.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to say that even with your considerations against our power I'm very happy you are still considering a large number of these requests and it does make a big deal to the community to have them changed.  As you requested I won't be suggesting anything new, but I'll go over any of your points that need to be clarified.<P>No Rent Items: The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. <P>Awesome!  Only thing I'd add is please let our pets stick around too.  (And NOT go into PVP mode..)  Just as other PCs turn to NPC mages do too, but without our pets, even as NPCs we don't stand a chance.<P>Rain Spells:  We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high.<P>Aye they are..  Even against Malosied Frost Giants, the fire rains are resisted FAR more than they should be.  (You HAVE to cast malosi just to make sure there's a chance all 3 waves will hit.)<P>New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons: Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few situational weapons.<P>Like some ideas?  Weapons that proc; cancel magic, fire flux, tashan, whirl til you hurl, fear(lol can't blame me for trying..), weakness, and other low level debuffs and spells. (A creature type specific fear wouldn't be bad though..)<P>Pathing: <BR>Notes: Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst. <P>Um.. Plane of HATE, City of Mist, Cazic Thule (that pyramid is still screwed up.), The Hole, and Kedge off the top of my head.  Fear has some screwy areas too.<P>Pets and AoE fear: Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell...<P>Yeah, saw the changes on test. Awesome to get a spell to cancel it!  However if you do make it a spell please make it level 49.  Some of the biggest encounters mages are still going to do are Vox and Nagafen.. And everything beyond that point is just boss mob after boss mob.  Some with AoE fears, many others without. <P>What I would add is immunity to Charm though..  The one thing we have to count on is our pets being loyal (even if they are still as dumb as dirt..)  We're mere shadows of ourselves without them.. And should they turn against us.. Game Over.  I'd make the Immunity to charm as 59th level.  That would make sense.<P><BR>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire: The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet. Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone check? If it is, should it be? Perhaps another careful examination of these pets is in order…<P>Well not quite.. They hit like a level 16-20 pet..  They are supposed to make up for this by casting lots of spells.. Unfortunatly their spells aren't all that impressive, many times they'll run up and hit monsters anyway with their enfeebled attacks, and 2 point damage shield.   As I've understood the premise of the fire pet is that they are weak but can dish out the most damage over time.  Past 50 the water pet can do the most damage of the lot.   If mobs automatically got malosied first (so all the spells this pet cast could hit..) and the pet JUST chain casted spells against a mob, then it would be up to par.<P>But whatever you do.. DON'T forget the level 58 pet!  It's EXACTLY identicle to the level 52 one!  Whatever you do for the level 52 one, do it better for the level 58 one!  (This should mean casting higher level spells if it casts spells..)<P>Pet Names: How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) <P>Actually I'd say get one name for each type of element.  And someone suggested making a quest to do this.  Excellent idea.  Perhaps have a quest for each elemental spell that produces a pet one level above the normal amount alloted at that time, and they are named as well.  So everything the mage casts that quest spell his named pet appears.<P>For me though, not being able to name pets.. Very minor.  Not worried about it.<P>Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet...<P>Considering our elementals are 90% of what mages play their characters for.. Their looks are pretty important to them.. A matter of pride in fact.  We are still kinda wondering what necros got 2 changes to their pets appearance and we haven't gotten any.. (Even though since beta there have been rumours of other elemental pet models floating around..)<P>For high levels and ESPECIALLY the epic pet it would be nice..  Or, add in 4 more quests on par with our epic for new line of 60th level pets with different graphics and a tiny power increase.  (I dunno, if you change the fire pet back to melee type, maybe a new spellcasting line of pet with different models would be worthwhile to quest for.. Genies perhaps?  You have the models for the female and male ones already..  Just an idea..)<P>Rage of Zomm: How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm?<P>No problems with that.  Please fix it's usefulness though too.  I'd suggest, change it to an eyeball and have it only cast spells that are super low aggro.  It has 100 hp and works like the cleric hammer spell already making it incredibly limited as a mage pet..  Changing it so that it's considered the last thing the mob will want to attack will extend it's life and give mages more reason to use it.  (Remember the spell should still be high damage, as a stray hit at that level could kill it.)<P>DoTs: Why did we give magicians DoT's with Velious? It does seem a bit odd.<P>Yeah.. They simply aren't worth casting..  Greatly lower casting time so we can use them to interupt other spellcasters or give them some added effects, or even increase their efficently to the par of other DoTs.<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: The claim is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<P>Doesn't even have to be 2 second casting time if it can AoE taunt ANYthing onto it..  But yes, increase the HP of this pet by a fair amount, if it works the way it's supposed to the pet will always have at least 3 enemies on it in groups were it's being used.   And at that level they are going to be hitting HARD.<P>Higher level pet healing spell: <P>Someone suggested CH for pets later on.. Considering all the pet resummon tactics, there should be NO problem for Verant to put in this spell with a 300 mana cost and a 10 second casting time.  If you still think the spell is too powerful.. Make it quest only.<P>Improved Invisibility: Why don’t magicians get this spell?<P>Because we don't need it.  Hey, I'm man enough to say it.<P>Phantom Armor: Two concerns here...<P>Agreed on both parts.  (make it not overwritten by SoW and make it one component, a different one that costs more or the same than 4 catseye)<P>Pet Fear Immunity spell:  How about we give magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short while? <P>How about make pets past a certain level immune to fear?  At any rate see above for response.<P>Robe of Conjuration: Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield. How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<P>This a typo?  Change the LEGS to 56 DS?  At any rate.. Changing the robe over wouldn't overpower us.. Considering you make the casting times so rediculous anyway...  Beyond a certain point there's little use in making the casting time that much longer it just adds to frustration.  The point is about 10 seconds.  Past that even adding on 3 seconds will make someone still desire the expediency of the original spell.<P>...Sigh.. Off topic just ignore that.<P>Pet Health Bars: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.<P>Health bars would be awesome..  Probally too hard to implement.. We still would like pets to be able to be affected by Bard songs and group cast spells.<P>Just one more thing not on your list..<P>Mastery Staves:  As you guys put out new expansions and equipment that far outscores the old stuff don't forget to upgrade some of the equipment that has a special place in the game.  When the first few mastery staves came out they were an awesome idea, and excellent items at the time.. Now, they are incomplete, outdated and comparitively weak for their level.  The staffs now should have some stats to them or create some bigger brother staves that do.  They should also be changed to one handed unless they are giving very good 2 handed stats.  There's no reason a mage should want to equip his staff just to summon a pet and then put it away again.. They are our trademark.. Give us some reason to hold on to them..<P>Water:  It's pretty much fine, gives us reasons to going to  Kedge.. I like having reasons to go to Kedge.. Phinny isn't overpowered.<P>Earth:  Absolutely rediculous..  It's unsulting to get a 2 handed blunt stick with unlimited charges of a 1st level spell as a RARE drop off a god!  I still contest this thing should be given to Master Yael in the hole.. Makes perfect sense, and even gives people a reason to go kill him.  (Heck put a few more class specific unique items on him, I'd like to have reason to go to the hole too.)<P>Air: Sky has to be revamped and thats that.  It was great when it first came out, but now there's no good reason to go there..  Risk vs reward is completely out of skew.. (With Velious same thing is happening for Veeshan's peak..)  Needless to say the quest to get this stick is far too hard.  FAR too hard.. For it's worth.  Good place to put it though.<P>Fire:  Is still missing.  Please put this in the game.  Unless you are going to open up the plane to Solusek Ro soon I'd recommend making this staff a quest probally to be completed in the temple of Sol Ro.  There's no good setting for it otherwise.<P>You guys seem to be fans of creating better items rather than updating old ones.  So create better versions of the focus staves then.  Place them all about the world.  But even if you do, fix placement and balance of the current ones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think that the items currently on the list are a good start.  All of them are worth looking into, with the key areas to me being the No Rent/LD issue, and the effectiveness of some of our post 50th pets (Fire Pets and Decoy, plus the rareness of the 54th Water pet).<P>Issues not currently on the list that could stand some consideration:<P>1.  Power Level of post 50th pets - Prior to Kunark, the pet/PC tank power ratio was out of whack.  Pet were too powerful compared to warriors, and while this was somewhat balanced out by pets being stupid (and thus dangerous to have around in many situations), the balance was too far in favor of the pet.  After the release of Kunark, though, tanks were enhanced in many areas (and rightly so).  They got better weapons (the best 1 handed weapons used to have a damage delay ratio of aprrox. 1/3 ... in Kunark, that changed to approx. 1/2).  They got better armor (both in terms of AC and in the addition of right clickable effects).  They got disciplines.<P>At the same time, pets did not go up much in power.  They went up in level, which of course helps, but then again, they have to, since as well go up in levels, we fight higher level things.  But they went up very little in damage and in hit points.  And yet, they are just as stupid ... so the risk of using them is still there, while the benefit is much lower relative to what it was pre-50s.  <P>So whereas there was a real need to re-balance the power ratio between pets and PC tanks, the cumulative effect of all the changes that were made has, in my experience, pushed the balance too far the other way.  You, as game designers, may disagree, but I think there should at least be enough of a question about this that it should be added to the list of things to look at and discuss.  <P>To me this is the *key* balance issue for mages.  Our power/effectiveness is almost exclusively expressed by the power/effectiveness of our pets.  Any discussion concerning balancing our class that does not take a good hard look at the power of our pets is focusing in on the wrong areas.  You may conclude that the pets are just fine the way they are (I would disagree, but that decision is yours to make), but it is something that needs to be looked at.  <P>If you don't feel comfortable raise the power of pets, please look into reducing the risk.  Pathing is a nice start, but really, it is but a minor part of the problem.  Better pet control is a more important issue.  The high level game is a game of brute force mixed with fine control.  Unleashing maximum carnage at the right MOB (and *only* the right MOB) is how you get things done.  Even a small increase in the ability to control our pets would make a world of difference (/pet nonaggro, which means pets don't retaliate when attacked, or even having /pet backoff last for 6 sec, so that a pet won't re-aggro if attacked in that period of time), making us boons, in a game where breaking mez on even one MOB means disaster, instead of the liability we often are.<P>2.  Mage Epic - I can't say anything here that has not been said before, other than, the very thought of even starting working on my epic depresses me.  I know that epics are not meant for everyone, and I have no problem with that.  It is just that the time it would take to get the Staff and the Cloak for my epic is staggering.  And it would not be time well spent ... it would be time spent doing the most mundane, boring, 'why am I doing this at my level?' type of activity.<P><BR>Add the above to your list of things to consider and I will be a content Mage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I do not expect huge changes to the class, nor do I expect all of the things you are considering to be changed.  But I do hope that all the concerns of our class will be looked at as a whole, so that, in the end, mages can be truly balanced in the game, no more, and no less, needed/useful (in general) than any other class in the game.<P>Balo Lafarceur<BR>57th lvl Gnome Conjurer<BR>Allies of Honor<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Thanks a bunch for the new spells on Test! Hopefully they get through to my server.<P>There ** IS ** a solution to the pathing problem. It would require the mage to cast a buff on themself in order to guarantee SOW/JBoot had been disabled and they would be moving at the speed pets are supposed to move at. Once this buff is enabled, the pet could be literally bound to the outer edge of the player's collision radius. It can use the existing pathing system to TRY to get to where it needs, but it would always be tethered to the caster. This would result in the pet moving between the caster at the target during combat, away from walls and obstructions during regular motion, and I think may work to solve the pet pathing problem once and for all. I am very curious to hear what your opinion of this might be.<P>You asked for zone-specific information about where pathing is at it's worst. Hate. But really, problems exist pretty much everywhere and is seemingly part of the core of the game. I can't imagine you will be able to correct all the problems even if you really tried to. I would prefer that effort to go towards a new pet-leash type spell to just avoid the problem.<P>One comment about the spell which summons your pet - I wish it would summon the pet regardless of it's agro, it would be like CoH that way. The way I see it, the spell is intended to help with the problem of pets basically walking away due to bugs or weird agro problems beyond our control. It seems logical that the pet should be summoned regardless of his agro state because when they train away like that, there's really nothing we can do to prevent it. Disabling it when this unpreventable event occurs and happens to result in agro doesn't really address the problem this spell seems to be intended for. Even if we get this spell, chances are I'll be tapping my earthen boots before using it because risk of agro from the back end of the dungeon is an unacceptable risk. I think we deserve some leeway here because the vast majority of the time we would need this spell, it would not be our fault but the fault of the flawed pathing system.<P>I wish the summoned items with charges increased the number of charges based on level of caster.<P>I use the decoy pet for AE grouping, please don't reduce it's effectiveness there. More hitpoints and better taunt would be welcome, as would faster cast time for escape situations. <P>I second the call to eliminate the requirement for previous spells to be required for the research. Mage research is, at best, tedious and not fun. At worst it is frustrating and hateful.<P>It would be great for pet names to be persistent. Perhaps a /petname command which goes through a process similar to /surname and is only usable once per week or login or something. Gotta let pets be renamed though - poor ol Goner might bite it one day! If nothing else, "Soandso Pet" would be better than the goofy generated names.<P>Rage of Zomm : Big fat eye. Why not hehe it would be easy and fun. Sounds like changing a model index and scale value =)<P>Phantom Armor : With the no rent keys taking an additional 6 slots from my inventory it would sure be nice if I could just a single component. I'd pay twice as much happily for that.<P>Voceration: Fire.. I wish it had continued the HP and damage shield of the earlier fire pets. Then it would be pretty dang nice. As it is, it's a weak tank and the casting ability is too undependable to be, well, depended upon.<P>Pet graphics: Epic pet REALLY REALLY would be well served by having it be some kind of golem look. The same old pet model just doesn't do the epic justice. Ho hum another pet.<P>Pet healing: 400 mana for complete pet heal compared to a 300 mana for a new pet would seem like a reasonable balance to keep your buffed pet.<P>Pet health bars: Would sure be nice if they were represented as a new bar in your & your groupmate's HP bar. Targeting a groupmate twice should target their pet also. Too often a pet goes down because the cleric can't target the pet due to weird click problems and lag. Being able to hotkey groupmates twice to select their pet would solve this problem.<P>Epic: Earth staff on Minions of Innoruuk. Nuff said. Clearly the designers expected the zone to be revamped, as was the plan at the time, and mages have been suffering from this hideously random and rare drop for their epic for too long. Even a 1 in 1000 drop on the male revenants would be preferred to the current situation. This would stop uberguilds from going in and KSing Inny every time the servers go down and would bring the quest in line with what the designer clearly intended.<P><BR>Thanks for reading.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi, Grimstaff asked me to add my word on Rains. Well, I'm not sure he and I agree on the topic (we are both Wizards, also, not Magicians...) <P>Absor wrote:<BR>"Rain Spells: Can we remove the pets from the equation? Just this would probably make them useful without making them too useful. I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would probably overpower these spells by a large margin. We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high."<P>I say:<BR>If Absor is speaking only of Magicians, I agree 100%. Removing the pet bug and lowering the resistance would be perfect. BUT.... If this applies also to Wizards, then, no, it's not enough to make the PRE-50 Wizard Rains worth playing. You see, at least 2 of the pre-50 Magician Rains are acquired at levels at which there exists no DD spell, so, they will be worth playing with their current stats if the pet bug and high resistance are fixed. But Wizards always have a DD of equal level to compare their Rain with, and NO PRE-50 WIZARD RAIN IS WORTH PLAYING (except the level 4 Rain, which is hardly worth mentioning because of its short lifespan).<P>My two reference documents (my web page and my thread):<P>http://perso.wanadoo.fr/nicolbolas/aerain.html<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000121.html<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Uhhh, want some food or water?<P>2.) Post 50 our pets upgrades are almost nothing. 51 earth has 100 hp more and hits for<BR>     2 more maximum over 49? 57 hits for an additional 2? What happened to 200-300 hp <BR>     increases and up to 8 maximum damage? I can summon a level 41 earth pet with the 49<BR>     spell with roughly 2,600hp that hits for 56.

</FONT><HR>I agree that making pets immune to AE fear is potentially unbalancing.<P>One possibility is to make the pet return to the caster in the event that it is feared.  Instead of having them run for the hills, it should run back to its master when afraid.  That's what my dog does.<P>A second option is for a fear to act like a stun.

</FONT><HR>The biggest balance problem for Mages is really a Pathing problem, but I expect that has no easy fix.  HOWEVER, a neat idea that would address (1) Pathing Problems, (2) AoE Fear and (3) give us a useful Summons would be this spell:<P>Leash of Mardu<BR>Level 24<BR>This spell summons a magical leash (uses whip graphic) that can be equipped in the right or left hand slot of any pet user (my version envisions be able to give one to your Necro buddy).  While Leash is equipped, the Pet is unable to move further from the Pet Owner than the range of our Pet Healing Spell.  If the OWNER moves out of this range (like if Pet gets stuck or if Owner is soWed and Pet is not), then the leash could be destroyed or just rendered inactive until the Pet is back in range.  Whaduya think?<P>Other thoughts:<P>I agree that having a pet-health bar would be a great improvement.... perhaps a blue "inner" bar like we have on the XP bars would be the easiest to implement.<P>Hitting the appropriate F key twice to target a group member's pet would be good.<P>Having songs and group spells affect pets would be good and would not make us any more powerful solo.  Verant has re-defined pets to be "Pets" instead of NPCs so I would think that these changes might be easier to make now.<P>And how about a little honest explanation from Verant about what exactly was involved in the pet change from NPC to PET?  I think all these changes were pretty much server side, and largely unannounced by Verant.  I am NOT asking that you *justify* what you did (it's your world after all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> ), but I AM asking that you *tell* us what you did.  Verant's explanation of the changes to how XP worked was WONDERFUL.  I am hopeful that explanation was indicative of a trend towards better communication with the players.<P>I think some analysis of the mana efficiency of the Rain spells vs the risk inherent in their use is in order.  I am not asking that you change them, just look at them and decide if you think they are working as intended.  This is an issue for Wizards too.  I think the main focus would be on the pre-50 spells.  <P>A LORE, NO RENT Ring of Return would be a fantastic summoned item and make Mages a good bit more popular (has one charge of Gate).  Wizzies would be opposed to us getting this though probably.  But honestly, some useful summons in the 50+ range would be good (ok, the muzzel is useful).  How about summoning a Ring of Regeneration that made you regenrate like a Troll?  errr... sorry, wrong thread.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif"><P>I think the DoTs are GREAT and make perfect sense since Mages are very much about doing damage over time (i.e. our pets and damage shields).  Plus, my Mage is the only caster I have who hardly ever has to swap out spells.  Heck, I have played him ofr hours with one or two spell slots empty  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  The DoT fills a slot nicely.<P>Kudo's on the changes you have made so far, especially on the Rain/Pet thing.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is what I fell needs to be implemented to improve mages.<P>1. Summoning<P>I would like to see more varying procs on weapons summoned by magicians. However I don't just see weapons as an improvement. I would like to see an improvement to the arrow summoning.<P>How about 'Summon Quiver' which summons a wieghtless 6 slot quiver full of class 6 arrows.<P>How about giving magicians the ability to summon No Rent armour, and Jewelry as well? This could be rather interesting I feel.<P>Lets talk about damage shields. I would like to see mages able to cast group damage shields, much like what druids at high levels can do for their groups.<P>In the EQ manual it states something along the line that using the '/pet guard here' command will cause the pet to attack anything entering the area it is guarding. I have to be honest and state I have never seen a pet do this. More like it waits until something agros upon it.<P>I would also like to see an improvement in the renew line. This makes playing a mage a more strategic issue, 'Do I heal my pet or save the mana for a final nuke?'<P>I would like to see a relatively low level spell that can be used to summon your pet back to your side, when it has wandered off.<P>Immunity to fear has already been addressed.<P>Could we please have pets affected by group effects! I mean if a bard is singing his healing song, or any song at all my pet doesn't get any of the effects. Group damage shields are another item. Since I am a member of the group, and I include my pet, how about incuding pets in the effects.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A defense for asking for new summons:<P>Let us take the mages spell list for a moment and examine the different spell lines we have as mages.<P>We have Pets (4 spell lines)&lt;--will get to this<BR>We have Bolts (1 spell line)<BR>We have DDs  (2 spell lines)&lt;-- can we count vs. summoned?<BR>We have AoE (2 spell lines) &lt;--broken<BR>We have summons (2-3 spell lines)<BR>We have Shielding (2 spell line) &lt;--self only<BR>We have Pet Healing (1 spell line) &lt;-- not finished<BR>We have fire shields (1 spell line) &lt;-- no complaint =)<P><BR>The problem here is that we have NO utility spells that we can share with other players.  Not only that, but we have no utility spells that we can use on a day to day basis to make out lives a little easier.  We have summons that come many spell circles too late (39 on levitate??), we have broken and unfinished spell lines (AoE and Healing) and some redundant spells to boot (Bolt and DD)<P>We are left with NO ROOM for any other spells!  The mage lives and dies by his DDs and pets!  The pet spell line takes up four slots!  It ~looks~ like mages have a big list of spells, but if you weed out the redundant ones then we have a select few!  Take the Bolt/DD issue... we have spell circles where we get a Fire DD ~and~ a Bolt DD... for what good reason??  They are both resisted as fire spells, only one is harder to cast and gives a bit more damage for the trouble!<P>We have Rain spells that are hardly worth anything other than taunting MOBs off the Tanks.  Even ~with~ the 3 full shots on the MOBs, we are still dealing with insanely high resist rates and the chance that the MOB will move anyway!<P>We also have PBAoE spells... they fall under the same problems as the Rain!  Not to mention that, but why are we going to chance aggroing eveything ~that is already enar us~ right on top of us and still do no damage?  No matter if the AoE hits or not, the creature still seems to aggro.  Why use this spell other than to give the other players a few more seconds to make their escape?<P>Dismiss summoned.  Dont get me started!  The druids get it first, and even so, it is useful ONLY if we can find a summoned creature, and ONLY if we dont want to just use our DD!  Why bother?  Most of our DDs get better damage/mana ratio to the Dismiss anyhow, so why waste a spell slot on the minute chance that we even ~see~ a summoned creature?  "Oh, hold on guys, lemme mem my dismiss to get that random_earth_elemental_00!!"<P>Pet healing.... thanks for the lower level spells, but why did you quit?  Why stop the line where it would actually be a tactical choice of which one to use?  At 20, we have the chance to heal a good amount on our pet, and no qualms.  At 35, we have "hey, heal for 200 and watch it come right back off in two swings, or nuke again?".  No brainer!  We lose the functionality of the spell line at level 30!<P>Malise line... great line.  Should have started earlier, and why does it get resisted so much?  I am not even sure how much good the spell does, but why am i resisted by blues, and why is my resist de-buffer getting resisted?  How is that logical?<P>Our pets.  One major problem here.  Why are we penalized for using our pet?  Why are we charged EXP if our pet does more damage than us?  That is like charging the Wizzie EXP if his Ice Comet does more damage!  Why are you crippling our 'class defining' spell?  It is like saying, 'Hey, here is a car for you Mr. Mark Martin, but if you drive it, we will cut off your arms"  How does this make sense?  Remove the exp penalty or charge all the other classes exp for their defining spells.  TPs for druids, SoWs and regen for shamans.  Warriors for using dual wield and rogues for using stabbing weapons.  Pretty ridiculous, huh?<P><BR>So, there we have the major spell lines available to a mage.  The shield lines are pretty okay, the armour finally being useful (except for carrying around 4 stacks of Cats Eye) and the Fire Shields are wonderful (except the aggro and damage should be given to the wearer, not the caster)<P>The mage spells are bloated, and they still have very limited range of functionality!  Some of the summons are cool, but nowhere near the capability of the other 3 casting classes!  Take the general lines...  nuke, pet, shield and AoE.  That is what we have, but the others branch our tremendously!!<P>Wizzies get all sorts of damage spells, different for different encounters!  They get TPs, bind sight and damage absorption!  Root.<P>Enchanters get Charm, Clarity, Mez, Stun and root.<P>Necros get mana regen, health regen, fear, bind sight and snare type effects.  <P>Are you seeing my point, here?  We have NO variety!  Nothing!  (we dont get bind sight, which all 3 others get WHY?  and we dont get voice graft??  why?)  Mages are reduced to "Send in Pet... nuke... nuke... nuke... nuke... dead."  That is all!  <P>Give us variety!  We are literally being punished for the three extra spell lines that the pets are taking up!  We really only have one pet, but in 4 variations!  Why are we getting punished for the other three and getting jipped out of the extra variety that we should get?  We are not even just BORED, but we get jipped out of all the cool stuff and tactical stuff that the other classes get?<P>Why is this?  There needs to be a change, and i am not talking about nerfs!  We dont want to be carbon copies, but we are the most watered down of version of all the other casters put together and have NOTHING that is special to us.  The mages seem like an afterthought!<P>Most of this can be fixed in summons and repairs to spells, but you have to see the problem here and something has to be done.<P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think one of the biggest problems a magician faces (which I think most would agree on) is when the pet engages a mob (solo or grouped) and the mage is jumped by another mob.  We have no way to get the mob off us and the pet is useless since it will beat on the 1st mob till one of them dies.<P>I can live with the fact that mages get no form of escape because we are the "uber-pet" class.  We don't get root/snare/mez/fear/etc... we are supposed to rely on our trusted pets.  What I can't live with is the fact that the pets are dumb as a doorknob.  When soloing, I usually just flee when another mob attacks me.  When in a group, if my group is too busy to help me out, I can usually burn one down to the ground, but it wastes my mana and I'm effectively out of the rest of the battle medding.<P>Here is my proposal: with mage pets, give the pets a toggle (perhaps "/pet rescue on/off") that will give the pet the ability to come help out its master when the mage is in need of help.  No matter what the pet is doing, it will come to rescue him.  Sure, the other mobs might beat on the pet heavily but at least the mage has a chance to survive.<P>When soloing, the pet will probably start dying quick with two+ mobs beating on it now, but it will give the mage a chance to flee or maybe even win the battle!<P>When grouping, the mage won't have to run around like a beheaded chicken until the mob can be rooted/mezzed/etc...<P>This is not unbalancing (as far as I can see).  We are supposed to rely on our pets for nearly everything.  It's cool our earthie can root but what good is it when it is rooting something that isn't even hurting the caster?<P>What do you think about this idea?  Pros and cons.  I really can't see any problems with this.  It just gives the mage a "form of escape" by using the pet.  If we are pet masters, please let us assume this role.  We won't need any other spells.  Of course, if many mobs engage the lone mage, he'll die.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Spell drop rates are fine.. 54 pet drops just as often as any other spell in deep sebilis / chardok / etc.  You're just not going to find it in burning woods or off a zol knight, is all.<P>Call of the Hero is so rare that I saw two drop in 20 minutes in the four rooms area of sebilis.<P>Every level 60 spell (including Aegis of Ro, now that it's in the game) is easier to obtain than any 55 - 58 spell just because always-spawn boss mobs are generally 60+ (Korocust, Emperor Chottal, Kunark Dragons, etc.).<P><BR>Bolt spells are weak when you factor in the "can't hit a mob to save my life" aspect of the whole thing.  I enjoy finding neat ways to boomerang my bolt around PCs (mainly rogues, curse them!) and trees, but seriously, I'd rather stick to straight magic DD.<P><BR>I don't get the discussion about resist rates being too high.  In Velious I guess things got a little stronger, but pre-Velious I stick spells as often as I ever did.<P><BR>Pet-pathing is a huge problem, granted, but people who post strategy guides that say "Okay, now have all the magicians kill their pets" are a worse problem.  Even so, you can just look at a room with an uneven floor.. or perhaps a staircase or strange piece of furniture, and you just *know* that little Jobaner is going to cause some trouble.  Jesus just try making your pet walk across the first ice river in lower Icewell, it's ridiculous.<P><BR>Even without pet, though, if all a magician does on a large raid is Call new additions and Mala / Malosini all the big mobs, he/she is a large asset to the raid, making 80% of the participants more effective.<P><BR>My escape spell is called "SOW potions, Treant Staff, and Call of the Hero."  It is very expensive.  It also beats the crap out of root.  Don't you like having an Achilles' Heel?<P><BR>Without a manastone, what use does the small regen of the phantom armor have?  If you're on a raid, you have at least one of clarity or regen (and probably both, if you ask).  Perhaps if the lower armor spells (leather and chain) had regen and the higher armor spells (plate and *armor*) had.. say.. more ac than a similarly-levelled cleric AC buff (or lower ac but stackability since it is selfonly), that would be pretty neat.  5 extra points of regen at level 52 or whatever doesn't mean anything unless you're soloing seafuries.<P><BR>Damage shields are also kinda pointless at higher levels unless you are soloing or in a few select xp-grinding situations.  If you have someone who can slow, Cadeau is reduced to giving 33 fire resist.  Moreso for the group version, I guess.  Unless they last as long as.. well.. a buff, my standard DD does damage more conveniently (and probably more efficiently).  In conclusion, they are silly spells, and we are the masters of them.<P><BR>In my day, people begged for summoned fangs.  Now they beg for coldstones.  I hate monks.<P><BR>Voice graft would be great, but I'd settle for pets saying "Thank you for the Batwing Crunchies, Slaariel!" as they did many moons ago.<P><BR>Magician epic is hard, but people seem to always compare it to the Rogue and Cleric epics.  I don't see anyone saying "Look how easy that bard epic is!!!".  With fixed pet pathing, the magician epic is one of the best in the game and, with the exception of the 0% drop rates on earth sticks and the widespread desirability of pegasus cloaks, it's just fine.<P><BR>I think a lot of good points have been made for strengthening the anti-summoned line of spells.  I believe a good compromise would be to make them a much better ratio (including higher damage) than standard DD, but to keep them evocation as well.  (Also, we are the masters of summoning, but Druids are Nature's Champions and there is nothing so unnatural as a conjured elemental.  So druids getting the anti-summoned line first makes a little sense.  I mean.. we get "Reclaim Energy" long before they do, eh? ;))<P><BR>Charm / Fear Summoned would be way too cool, but I'm not holding my breath.  (I would also like Ice Comet Summoned, Root Summoned, Snare Summoned, and /pet assassinate summoned added to that list!)<P><BR>Where are the caster haste items!  Every other class gets items that affect the way they do damage.  Where are the items that let you cast spells at -10 Fire resist or -20 Magic resist?  Where are the items that lower casting time?  Where are the items that lower refresh time?<P><BR>There should be 20 or 30 new summoned items available in the game.  Some useful, most silly.  Hey maybe even a random summon, who knows?  BUT!  Every single one of these should be a huge week long quest.  ALSO (unless they are useful spells) they should be completeable by the magician and his/her small travelling band.  There is HUGE opportunity for a large NPC-supported magician "community" throughout Norrath.  It would make them more fun to play.. you know.. they'd be like the Bards of Int-casting.  You'd walk into a town or you'd wander across a zone and there'd be a wandering magician practicing his new spell, "Summon Small Rock"!  "Wow," you would say, "How did you learn to summon small rocks like that?"  "HahHAHahAH," he would say, "To learn the secrets of the small rocks, you must bring me a pile of vegetables for my stew, two fetid bass, and a VERY SMALL ROCK."  I dunno... there's a huge opportunity here that's all I'm saying.<P><BR>"You cannot scribe a spell that you already have in your spellbook."  Why the hell not?  If I want a page full of Gift of Xev that's my damn prerogative.<P><BR>Magician dots are silly.  I don't know what you'd replace them with, but I'd rather have "Summon Small Rock."<P>I'm done now.<P>-Slaariel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Repost (originally posted in the weird broken thread)<P>Since we want to talk about Balance, I will leave out any of the frivilous things such as pet looks, and the epic.<BR>The key things a Magician needs to wory about is his pet and damage spells.<P>While it is true that mages can solo, it is pretty much level 52 or lower that we can do so with any efficiency or use. Post 52 the mobs hit sooo hard that even with 3k hp our pets can not tank them for long and our DD spells do not do enough to take them down in a pets life span. This ends up requiring chain casting of pets, which to be honest, is dodgy at best. Even if you are not having a lag issue, the normal latency of the internet makes timing this extermely difficult. I used to team with a druid as we made a good team, but, the druid can solo much for efficiently than can I that we no longer team up as I am basically just riding the coat tails. Magicians are the masters of the Green Mobs. That is why many people see us as so powerful. Sure, we can take a pet in a lower level dungeon and wipe out everything in sight with no problems, but, this does not help us advance (it only helps us twink characters or make money to buy our high level spells which we can not get in the group for the drops most of the time).<BR>Of course, the solutions to our problem are not that easy either.<P>Solution #1)<BR>Upgrade post 50 pets. We have heard that our pets are already too powerful, and pre-50 vs pre-50 melee classes I agree. But, post 50, this is no longer the case. I do not think that raising the damage output of the pet is necessary to upgrade the pet. I would rather see an increase in hitpoints/AC for the pet. Then, we are not stepping on the toes of the monk/rogue/warrior/ranger who is there to deal out the punishment to the mobs, he is there as our own personal meat shield to protect us and absorb our damage. I think a 30% increase in the hit points of the level 51 pet would make the pet worthwhile (leave the damage where it is). <BR>Another note would be to increase the hit points on the 54 Water pet. His backstab, while missing more often than not and tagging maybe 170 pts when successful at max for me, is an insane taunt. My water pet with his taunt off, taunted a mob from three taunting earth pets and 2 level 51 warriors, needless to say, the pet died quickly).<P>2) Direct Damage Spells<BR>Our Direct damage spells are neither more damaging nor mana efficient before level 56. The best soloing grounds if we were to solo, would be burning woods/skyfire. Many of the mobs in these zones are fire resistant, which leaves us to rely on Shock of Swords for damage. A very old and outdated spell by that time (yes, at level 54 I am forced to still rely on a level 44 spell and will continue to do so until level 57 some 13 levels and TONS of experience points later).<P>I don't want magicians to be better than other classes, nor have the same abilities as other classes. What I do want to see is Magicians get scaled up along with the rest of the classes in Everquest post 50. All classes seem to have their efficiencies/abilities increased as they increase. But my level 54 Magician is the exact same power as he was at level 49, 5 levels before. Meanwhile I have been left in the dust by the other classes (except maybe monks). I only ask that a serious look at playing a magician at level 49, then at post 50 be looked at by the testing team by actually going to a live server, and tryig to find a group/solo. Then see what can be done to allow us to improve with each level as most other classes do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. the nukes being split between evocation and conjuration is very annoying. It is like asking me to change my specialization every 10 levels or so. They should all be either conjuration or evocation. We don't really get huge variety of them, basic 3 types (conj shock, evoc fire shock and bolt). There is absolutely no need to split them. Conjuration is much preffered, since we supposed to be masters of it.<BR>2. Phantom armor should have damage absorber component as addition to what it is right now.
