</FONT><HR>Well i think just about all the concerns i have about ranger balance have been raised already, most with perfect explainations so i will just recap.<P>Ranger defense increased to 230...the same as pally/sk offense/weapon skills.<BR>Ranger HP the same as paladins/sk<BR>Reposite cap increased. 175 or 200 the same as pally/sk.<BR>Tracking changes (already due)<BR>Archery to be worth using, damage pathetic unless using trueshot disc...as for this artificial 'double damage' at 51+...in practive we get this only about 10% of the time...as 90% of the time any mob we fighting(in group or solo) is either snared or rooted if not both. Unless this is fixed please don't even consider archery as one of our 'abilities' to determine balance.<BR>Maybe with both tracking and archery fixed rangers will have an ability to rival SK harm touch & pally lay hands.<P>And as a sidenote away from balance...it would be nice to have an upgrade to feet like cat & cold resistance...i believe we are already getting cold resistance. Nice one.<BR>Oh and the stacking issues with call of earth & chanter haste/agi buffs are VERY annoying.<P>Arrolas Lendel<BR>56 Outrider<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>After playing a ranger the majority (95%) of my time in Everquest (and in all other forms of RP since the late 70's), I really have very little complaints.  By no means would I stop playing my ranger if there was nothing done to improve it...sometimes it not about what you can do or cant do, but how you do it.  Theres always been a popularity of rangers mainly due to the image and ideals of the class, rather than the power of it.<P>But, if there were changes to be made in Everquest, I do think that there are a few improvements that could be made.<P>The number one complaint I see about rangers (from rangers and non rangers alike) are that we are a mana sink.  The most common phrase heard in any raid is "Casting &lt;healing spell&gt; on &lt;Ranger&gt;" (if we are ever invited to one...which reminds me our begging skill should go up each time we attempt to join a group).  My healthbar in a massive fight just yo-yos back and forth and I just hold my breath hoping that the little red bar never totally disappears.<P>Now there has been tons of requests for more hps/AC and solutions on these boards but with more ingame numbers than anything else.  If we were to look with some logic, the EQ ranger currently doesn't fit the "mold".<P>Let's look at a typical ranger image:  a hardy weather worn woodsperson, quick and stealthy, living off the land guided by the forces of "Nature".  Oh yeah, who own cool bows.<P>Well, one...we are far from hardy.  Paladins have more hps.  A class that is defined by excellent hygiene, great teeth, personal grooming and a dazzling smile, should not have more hit points than a weathered traveller of the lands.   I guess you can count in the paladin's devotion and training to give them some hp's but please, Ive seen the secret door in the Paladins guild that leads to their pedicurist.<P>Shadow knights, a class that hangs out in seedy dungeons, torturing small furry cute things and plotting in dark smelly underpits of the earth, also is hardier than the ranger.  Yes, count in the unholy devotion to wreak havoc and destruction to all of Norrath and you can justify their hp total also.  But arson, torture, murder and basic mayhem just is not as strenuous as planting trees and wrestling bears.<P>As you can see, the ranger definitely needs more health to live up to its image.<P>Now on to the defenses.  Rangers have always portrayed the quick and agile image.  Considering this, we wear armor that allows it.  With the exception of warriors, monks and rogues, I think rangers should have the highest dodging skills, and a slight hike in defense to theoretically support this.  I dont necessarily support raising of the other skills (parry, riposte), as we do want to keep in balance, but I do feel that rangers should follow the philosophy of "Be quick or be dead".  And yes, drop the disarm for the safefall....we do jump off the really big trees we climb without killing ourselves.<P>Now for the living off the land part.  Basically we do that extremely well in Norrath.  I would love to see the hide and sneak caps raised heavily in exchange for the fact that we could only use them in outdoors zones.  But really minor thing here.<P>Guided by the forces of Nature part....our spells.  Why dont rangers get more shaman buffs?  Really about the only one we get that we use alot is feet like cat.  I believe that we should get an upgrade to the spell at 49.  Dex buffs would be nice but totally unnecessary, but a stamina buff would be a major plus.<P>As stated before, regeneration would be a welcome addition at 49, as it is silly to have Chloro without regen.<P>And speaking of shaman, I think barbarians would be a welcome addition to the rangers profession.  They would fit in nice, although they wear skirts/kilts/whatever.  But please, no dark elf rangers...lets bury the Drizzt Do'Urden complex once and for all and leave it in the Forgotten Realms where it belongs.<P>Finally archery.....a nice skill.  Not class defining by any means and a way for rangers to stay alive and kite for a lil bit while. Almost never used in group situations except to pull.  I think an enhancement would do greatly..something like a set shot.  There have been many other ideas but a stationary ranger a few feet from the mob and taking a well aimed shot should do great damage to the mob.  And please add crippling blows for bows.  A crit is nice but 50 points to a Velious mob is like hitting a cow with a thumbtack.  Imagine a kneeling ranger away from a warrior tanking a frost giant plunking arrows into its back.<P>Well...I think Ive just about said enough.  I hope many more good things are coming for the rangers, but if not, there will still be rangers around.<P>I think I speak for many people when I say that rangers are one profession where RL players do take to heart.  It is probably the only class in EQ that you can nerf and make it unplayable and there will still be a large group out there who will play it.  Its a part of the RP genre and has been and it will remain so and nothing will deter those of us who are truly rangers at heart.<P>Sincerely,<BR>Earedsil Argiliath<BR>Valor's Own<BR>Ranger of the 45th Hunt<BR>Povar Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rangers are really cool and I love playing one. I have only one thing to really add.<P>The other Hybrids get a Unique skill, Lay Hands, Harm Touch. The Rangers do not get a Unique skill.  On top of having a few other disadvantages ie our armor selection.  I would assume that maybe you think track is our special ability. And while that is awsome and I like it, It for one is not Unique to us only, and I wouldn't classify it as powerful as LH or HT.  <P>The special abilities to me are like life saving things.  Either Wam, alot of damage and your saved, or wam your healed.  I propose for the ranger, wam you died but your near your body not 5 zones away.<P>This would be the only thing I'd change on a Ranger, add an ability like that.  Rangers Die alot due to lower HP, lower AC and such, how abou making our skill a Bind spell.  Once per everquest day we can bind ourselves somewhere.  Would give us the one balance thing IMHO to make our thing unique and diffrent from the rest.<P>Thats my 2 cp.<P>Geril the Ranger<BR>Vazaelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Make agility work to compensate for the lower ac/hp issue. Put in ranger only armor with high agility.<P>If you can do THOSE two things, don't bother with raising defense.

</FONT><HR>Oh! Absor....<P>Forgot one thing.  Lets say you were feeling really generous and rangers really needed a boost and you said what the hell, lets just give it to them... can you make it .... &lt;cringes&gt;  Pets?<P>Before you say NO! More than usability, I would love to have a wolf or a bear follow me around...it would be so rangerish.  Heck, they could be the black wolf or brown bear variety but it would add a lot to being a ranger.  Well least I could do is ask.  Sometimes its better to look good than to tank good.<P>Also, one idea I had for a spell I did not mention.  A high level spell that would allow outdoor only spells to work indoors.  Short duration, self cast only.  This would allow rangers some usefulness in dungeon crawling.  Not sure if this is possible or even viable.  But who knows.  I dont see the unbalancing nature of it at 50+ levels.<P>Earedsil Argiliath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've read these posts until I'm blurry eyed and it seems that it is a forum for post lvl 50 rangers.  The pre 50 ranger needs the same defensive upgrades as the post 50 ranger does.  In order to keep this short I will list a few things I think need to be changed.<BR>A.  Sow at at a lower lvl.<BR>B.  Some sort of a critical hit for bows that    <BR>    does major damage.  A ranger should be able  <BR>    to hit a vital organ once in a while.<BR>C.  Bind Affinity, A ranger is supposed to be at<BR>    home in the outdoors and yet we can't be bound<BR>    anywhere but in a city.  We should be able to<BR>    be bound anywhere whether by someone else<BR>    or by our own spell.<BR>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Besides uber mobs, I have not experienced any sort of aggro problem for the past few months. A paladin of the same level as me can keep a mob off me without even attacking. Taunt, stun and sit. I don't even have to use jolt.<P>Also, I have not been in a group with downtime for a few months. This means that extra defense  would do NOTHING for me except if I wanted to solo (which I don't) or be the main tank (which is another thing I don't do). Resourceful rangers do not need the extra tanking ability, and if the group already has a main tank a warrior is unwanted when they can have a ranger that can chloro, snare and buff as good as a druid of the same level.<P>A level 55+ ranger grouped with a necro in skyfire is some of the best and easiest experience I've seen. We are awesome at reverse kiting. Some rangers do not take advantage of their strengths and seem to dwell and what they can't do.<P>In the end, extra defense and hitpoints would have no influence on how much I can add to a group. Until a ranger can do as much damage with archery as they can with melee, then archery upgrades will have no effect on how I play. The only thing that will help me out is how fast I can make a mob drop (higher offense) and buffs that I can give to group members that help us kill more. (The new buffs from SoV are awesome).<P>Now that I've said my perspective... there are many rangers out there who do need the extra hp's and defense. Not every level 51+ ranger has a group of friends that know how to play together. After reading this discussion it appears that many rangers want to tank uber mobs with greater ease. It also seems like many want to be more effecient soloers (archery) which is sort of boggling to me.<P>I am slightly concerned for the warriors, a class that has to put up with a lot of struggles (no spells, no special ability to avoid death) just so that they out tank rangers. That is the ONLY thing that they can do better than us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am going to make this short, just highlighing things from other post.  But I could go on....  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Have our hps increase to that of at least the Sk/pally level. Rangers take a double hit on that with having some of the lowest Ac gear and hps in the tanking class. Its much like the hybird mana pool.  Every other melee/hybrid class recieves HP bumps 50+ leading to a 300-500hp deficit with other hybrids at 55+ (more than 1k behind warriors at 60, we'd just like HP similar to other hybrids)<P>Give us at least the defensive skills increase that all the other tank classes got at the release of Kunark.<P>If were to be the offensive hybird how bout giving us the dmg bonus that the primary hand gets in our off hand?<P>Being limited to lighter chain classes of armor would make you believe we should be able to dodge better then someone in full plate. Its pretty amazing if you look at it from that angle that ranger dodge/parry/riposte are lower then Paladin/SK's. I understand everyone wants more defense, but if our dodge was in the neighborhood of Rogues (who also wear likewise armor) and parry/riposte were more like warriors (whose weapon skills we should be equal with if the test changes go in) then I think we would be hit less often and not need a serious defensive upgrade. although 210 or 220 defense would be nice.<P>Please consider moving SOW to 30, it will help balance Rangers.  Our Druid brothers get it at 15, I think that 15 levels difference between parent and child class is enough.<P>Implement tracking changes!  We need a scroll bar.  A filtering system would be nice to so that you can get rid of mobs (by color maybe) from your tracking window.  <P>The bottom line is that we are suppose to be a good damage dealer.  We are not suppose to be able to tank like a warrior, but able to fight like one.  Our spells are suppose to be utility spells to help, but not our main focus.  I think that these changes will help with that.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dear Absor. First of all I thank you, and all of developers for allowing players such as I be part of the discussion regarding our class' balance.<P>I have chosen the Ranger class because of the "Light and Agile damage dealer". These types of characters have always appealed to me in all of roleplaying games that I have played. From AD&D trough Vampire the Masquerade, Ultima Online, Aheron's Call...and to Everquest.<P>At low levels, I must say that we do fit that bill...speed and agility. At the higher end though the Cap skills get skewed to the point that this is not the case. Classes who wear heavy platemail can outdodge and outparry us while we get hit.<P>I have some opinions as to how Rangers should be balanced. I hope that they are all viable and make sense to you and my fellow players.<P>   Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights are all hybrid classes (I hesitate to call Bards hybrids as they have unique "spells")<BR>   Paladins and Shadowknights are the defensive hybrids, this is shown by their armour type and armour Ac in comparison to our armour. Plate Vs. Chainmail.<BR>   At the level of 50 + the defensive hybrids get 230 skill cap of offensive ability and 252 cap of defensive ability.<BR>   In Comparison Rangers get 252 offensive, and 200 defensive, this is a 30 point deficiency between the main skills as to where they are capped at.<BR>   In order for hybrids to be balanced, our main caps should be mirrors of each other, ie: Rangers: 252 offense and 230 defense, Paladins 252 defense and 230 offense.<BR>   Another Issue, we are labeled as an offensive class such as Rogues and Monks. Rogues and Monks both outdamage warriors to a great extent. True that they do not have spells to heal, buff themselves with, but still their damage is superior to that of a warrior with equivalent stats and equipment.<BR>   Rangers as an offensive class, do not outdamage warriors by a margin nearly as big as rogues and monks, and while this might seem fair as of us being hybrids, it is not how it seems in other player's eyes. In the end the warrior is a be all middle class. Best tank, good damage dealer. They are not meele offensive class as a definition, but rather a class who can stand its own in the fray and do some damage as well. Damage dealing meeles are meant to outdamage warriors. If we do not, there is NO reason for a group to have us around most of the time, as they can just get another warrior  who is a better tank and can do damage just as well as us.<P>My proposition is as follows:<P>-Add Triple attack at lv 55<BR>-Increase our Dual Wield and Double Attack skill caps (along with those of monks and rogues) by 30 points (3 more per level 50-60)<BR>-Increase our offhand damage bonus.<BR>-Exchange Firestrike and Calefaction for a line of unique "low resist" "fast cast time" spells so that we do not have to loose meele time in order to cast a spell which might be resisted, interrupted, or plain old fizzle.<P>Rangers as a damage dealing class have one skill which is out of place in a damage dealer's repertoire: Taunt. <BR>I propose this skill be removed along with riposte, and the points used towards Riposte, Parry, Dodge, and to small extent perhaps Block.<BR>thats 205 points of skills that we do NOT need, and do NOT use.<P>Thank you for the time and Safe Travels M'lord<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've said this once before and I'll say it again:<P>Please don't forget the lower levels!<P>You can add all the 50+ ranger balances you want, but if you don't add some improvements by at the earliest level 20, playing a pre-50 ranger is still going to be just as boring and frustrating. All you'll have created, then, is an environment that promotes twinking and powerleveling.<P>We see this situation now with rogues. Rogues start being compelling around level 30 or 40, so nobody wants to play a rogue without twinking and/or powerleveling them.<P>Rangers are the same way. Rangers start to see their disadvantages at level 9, when we realize that our first set of spells - OUR FIRST SET - only contains one single spell (Snare) that's actually useful for something.<BR>This discouragement only continues as we realize that none of our spells are unique, interesting, or effective, because by the time we get any particular offensive or defensive spell, our level is so high that the spell is ineffective. Our healing spells are too wimpy at any given level to be worth the trouble of memorizing them. Our offensive spells get resisted, and our defensive spells aren't dramatic enough to have an impact.<P>What we need is a Ranger-specific ability, or some better spells, from - at the earliest - level 20.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A VERY simple summarization of what I have seen...<BR>1) We dont want to die just because a Mob aggros us... help us live long enough to at least allow the cleric or druid to heal us and get the mob on the real tank.  Increase HP or defense or whatever, as long as it keeps us from dieing like a caster.<P>2) Make archery matter... somehow... be it more damage, or increase hit rates, or lower delay or spell imbued arrows, whatever it takes to make archery matter.  That will probably involve making it work properly... but I had to ask.<P>3) Something to even out the special skills and defining Spells that SKs(HT and Summon Corpse) and Pallys(LoH and rez) get.  Hint hint: move trueshot to the level of LoH and HT, and some kind of port.<P>Dlaritan LionsBane<BR>31 Ranger<BR>&lt;Divine Prophecy&gt;<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
