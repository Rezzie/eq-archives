&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Last night, in culmination of a weeks worth of frustration, I cancelled my account. <P>I would like Verant - Gordon - The CEO and whomever else that has any control over EQ policy to know why. Call this a last attempt to help what I believe could be a wonderful game, but instead is not.<P>The last situation cleary displayed EQ and Verant's policy to it's paying customers, and finally brought me past my threshold of tolerance. <P>Friday the 17th my Nec Erudite character "Thaed" on Quellious was corupted while zoning from Paineel to Toxulia on a corpse retrieval. I spent a day on my own confirming that there was actually a problem with the specific character before before petitioning help from a guide.<P>The petition proccess took about a half hour and the Guide, Zathaka, worked with me for over an hour, determining that "Thaed" was in fact corrupt. He then recommended that I speak with GM Ozzmar, as he was the only person on Quellious that could resolve the problem, but that he worked on weekdays and I should come back then. (Zathaka was an excellent Guide by the way. Very friendly and patient).<P>I again logged on monday and petitioned again. Again about a half hour to 45 minutes to speak to a guide. This time Silverwyrm, who worked with me for another hour to two hours trying different ways to resolve the situation. Silverwyrm was also an excellent guide and helped me keep from becoming too frustrated with the situation. Especially when Silverwyrm informed me that GM Ozzmar WAS in fact the only person who could resolve the problem, but that he did not work until Thursday. Three days to wait for resolution. <P>How is it that an entire server can be left without salaried tech support for 5 days?<P>On thursday afternoon I again logged on to attempt to resolve the problem. This time at 5pm. A guide responded to my petition around 5:20, and after another explanation, told me my petition was being "elevated" to GM Ozzmar. At 5:45 I requested some status on my petition because I was running out of time. The guide checked and told me it was still pending. At 5:55 pm after telling the guide I had only 15 left, she informed me there were only THREE more on the list between myself and Ozzmar. Clearly not enough time. She advised me, if possible to log on later that evening as there would be more help, and Ozzmar would be less busy.<P>At 10:30 pm I logged back on and immediately put in my petition again. Again about a half hour before respond, and the petition was "elevated" to GM Ozzmar.<P>At 12:30 am (2 hours waiting) I requested a status on my petition and was informed that I should petition again. If the petition went through, then my formar petition was no longer in the queue. I immediately petitioned again, and the petition went through. I immediately informed the guide that my petition had gone through, and my last petition was more than two hours ago, and NO ONE had contacted me, and that I had to speak with Ozzmar and I was again running out of time.<P>She replied "Ozzmar will look at your petition when he Returns!"<P>I asked what she meant by returns. It was now around 1 am. She informed me that Ozzmar was at lunch. I asked when he would return so I would know whether there was any chance of me resolving the problem this morning. She replied that she didn't know. I asked if there was anyone there that did know. She never responded.<P>At about 1:10 a guide responded to the second petition that I had put in, asking the nature of the problem. I informed him that I had been waiting for more than two hours to speak to GM Ozzman, and that now I had been informed he was at lunch and no one would tell me when he was returning.<P>He informed me that I WOULD HAVE TO RESUBMIT MY PETITION.<P>At this point I lost my temper. 6 days waiting for some GM, the ONLY GM for Quellious, more than 7 hours of time in game, and more thann 4 hours waiting in petition queues! For this I pay, and you call it Entertainment.<P>I have tried to consider the challenges faced by the tuning team, when it deals with the "need" to downgrade classes capabilities. I have tried to understand the problems that leed to the horrible camping issues. I tried VERY hard to believe that the Totemic Helm quest had been changed entirely and that Verant had not once again made the terrible now IMPOSSIBLE.<P>But I had found myself CAMPING a GM that spawned once a week, and required 5 hours for the drop. And then it wasn't even certain.<P>This was not a corpse retreival or lag death complaint. This was a BUG in SOFTWARE that had EATEN my character. And TECH SUPPORT was non existant and required me to wait for more than THREE HOURS online WITHOUT ANY CONTACT or CONFIRMATION of EVEN a TIME that I MIGHT be able to speak to someone who MIGHT be able to help. And at every step of the way. "Dont get out of line (do anything but stare at the monitor waiting for a response) or you will wait again, for us to even acknowledge you.<P>This is not tech support. This is NOT customer support. This is ABUSE. The only place I have seen people treated this poorly is in breif exposure to INS with a friend. But they can get away with it because the people they are dealing with have NO RIGHTS. This was heinous enough for me to write to the attorney Governor of Texas. <P>Here I can only write to you.<P>One GM per server may as well be none. Especially when that GM does not work for 5 days at a time.<P>The only real customer support received in this game is from Guides and they are VOLUNTEERS!<P>The progression of this games mechanics is one of continually limiting the effectiveness of the classes.<P>The attitude that "all players want to win and it is our job to prevent you from wining" while well meaning if terribly flawed.<P>Who wants to spend their entertainment time in a world with a saddistic god, bent on destroying your every effort to evolve?<P>The game should evolve as the players do. Rather than nerfing in reaction to player evolution, let the NPC's evolve in response. Then you have a situation with continued evolution (and new developements) rather than an ever dwindling capacity to effect outcome.<P>This could be a wonderful game Gordon. As it stands, between the smallest CS department I have ever seen, and a Saddistic god mentality, it will be overrun by competition within the next year. <P>Everquest is the Syquest of the MPO gaming industry. Many will stay solely for accrued investment, but it wont save EQ. It's all too easy to do better and care more about the customer than what EQ does now.<P>Steven R.

</FONT><HR><BR> Every time I read a post like this, I get so pissed off...<P> I cancled my account last year, due to simular 'support' from Verant / Sony. Never, EVER have I seen such a blatent lack of respect towards the people who pay for a service.<BR> 6 DAYS... six days of waiting for someone who in all likelyhood would have responded with Verant's Patent 'Sorry, nothing we can do'.<BR> And you know what's sad? It will take at least another year before everyone wises up and leaves the Nazi Death Camps that are Verant's Servers...but by then, Verant will have already made several, SEVERAL million dollars...so they don't care.<BR> All you people at Verant should be ASHAMED for the complete idiocy at your 'Support' ( HA! I wipe my @ss on your version of support)<BR>center, and if it was up to me, I would line you dolts up, bent over your severs, and pound every copy of this game you have sold strait up your @ss.<BR> Would it help? No, but then you might realize what a PAIN IN THE @SS YOU PEOPLE ARE! <BR> Then you would feel raped and violated just like all your customers.<P> Not as eloquent as the previous post, but hey...I put up with Verant's sh!t, they can chew on mine for a bit. They don't read these boards anyway...heh heh!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>While my anger at being abused, and that's really what it feels like to have no control and be told to sit and wait without any gaurantee or promise that anything will be forthcoming, or for that matter that they wont tell you to start over again, is as extreme as yours, Im so certain its the support staff that deserves my hatred.<P>I don't know this Ozzmar, who never talked to me. It could be he was buried in issues to deal with. (I would hope he didn't just delete me from the list, but I will never really know.)<P>But for Ozzmar to be the ONLY GM on Quellious and for him to NOT work on Quellious from Sunday thru Wednesday, points straight at Verant. An undermanned staff can only do so much, and by all appearances, there is very little staff at Verant CS. For this to happen it is because VERANT WONT hire them. Because they dont want to pay for them.<P>Simple.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You know, in six days, 4 hours time was it?  In that little time I could get a lvl 1 necro to at least lvl 30 depending on how much time I had to play during this amount of time...you said you started an erudite necro?  Well considering it's a new class/race combo I would expect that you wouldn't be very high, so you wouldn't really need to complain about it, just delete the character and start a new one, and if the character has certain items your new character doesn't just keep on with the petitioning and continue your fun with your new character.

You couldn't get one to 30th in 6 days, otherwise they would've nerfed them again. <P>As for hours played perhaps you can tell me how many hours I'd played the character since you seem to everything else about it, without me telling you.<P>And if that is the solution to non-existent tech support, then who cares about a 50th level anyway.

</FONT><HR>Ok, Im an idiot.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>And was mildly irrational in the midst of my anger.<P>Calmed down now. Sorry for the flame NeoTheo.<P>For my benefit, anyone who reads this, does it not seem unreasonable to have to wait that long for CS?<P>I know, NeoTheo your attitude would be to start again with a new character. I had only 12 - 13 hours in on that character. But still that's 12 hours of MY time for something I spend money on. And if it goes this was for a character with 12 hours, it could happen for a character with a few hundred. That scares me, and angers me. Mostly I think because I felt powerless to effect anything. I was at their beck and call.<P>The only "control" I had was to cancel. And in truth all that really means is personally not subjecting myself to what I believe is poor treatment. It means nothing to Verant. It certainly doesn't influence them, I am one of what 250,000 now? Big deal.<P>The scary part is, I miss the game. Thought about playing a couple times, even logged on. The problem, outside of "not doing what I say I will", is that nagging concern that they can do whatever they want. I could put the time in to make that character 45th level and they could nerf the hell out of the class or it could get corrupted, and I would have no recourse.<P>What do they care? That scares me. Regardless of this being entertainment, it really is an investment. Not just in money but in time and something more. you begin to identify with a character even by level 16. And someone else has control.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, I kinda figured you'd be a little mad. I'd be swearin' like a sailor if that happened to me. Maybe after Kunark comes out they'll fire the kunark team and hire some people for the servers. Maybe also split all the servers and add a few. Seriously, 99% of MUDs out there are free to play, and have immortals or whathaveyou on 80% of the time. That's insane, $15-25 million a month and they don't want to hire GMs? I'd do five hours a day for a few months for a great computer. Although realisticially they'd probably have to pay 7 an hour or so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=001208&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=001208&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
