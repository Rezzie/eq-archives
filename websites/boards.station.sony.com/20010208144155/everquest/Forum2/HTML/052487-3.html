</FONT><HR>one thing i would like to add to this. I have hunted the bulthors in cobalt scars with some friends for the last couple days. The exp is decent but the loot is totally out of whack. All of them were blue to me at 54, and the named one (bulthor hurder or something) did summon when he spawned so he was 51-53 since he was blue to me. They dropped the occational vendor loot(opal bracelet and the like) like drops off of seafuries in OOT but these were even rare. They mostly dropped stuff like the dervs in nro. silver rings, bloodstone rings, and the occational jasper. Also the named one dropped the same stuff as the regular ones but was quite a bit more difficult.<BR>Oh and one more thing, some stupid otters path by these things and try to KS them when you are fighting them. What we ended up having to do is have someone root the otter and then that person(and anyone who had to heal them) camp after the battle, this got tiresome. Maybe either make it so the otters don't path so close to the buthors or make it so they don't fight each other.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its funny, a number of posts are saying that Velious is not popular because it take more than one group to do something (something that is not even a special raid like raiding a plane, ...) and we know that mostly only one group in a multi-groups will get XP, because the game engine in EQ was never built to give XP to more than one group.<P>Don't say make balanced groups, its is hard to make them balanced, nearly impossible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a midlevel (38-41) perspective on Velious.<BR>I'm 44th now but haven't been back since 41st.<P>ICECLAD:<P>Seemed like a nice zone, I didn't hunt here much.  I loved the humor in the gnomes.  A few too many dervishes by the portal.  Garou killed me, but it was a fun fight.  My only concern in this zone is binding.  Is it possible to bind at the gnome igloos and/or gnoll camp?  If not, please add that ability so we don't have to run to Thurgadin just to get started adventuring.  I thought Coludoth was a bit silly--perhaps something to eat druids who see a named up on tracking and say "hey, a green, snare... SNARE please... um, snare?? ow ow ow ow ow".  <P>Still, this is a general problem with NPCs -- there are a lot that "aren't meant to be killed" but the players have no way to know that an NPC isn't meant to be killed without trying to kill it.<P>Also, I've almost given up asking NPCs for quests.  It seems that you expect people to look up stuff on spoiler sites now.  Otherwise, I don't even know what kind of difficulty I am undertaking or what kind of reward to expect when I start a quest.  Part of the problem is that there are just too many quests in the game without any in-game mechanism for keeping track of them or pointing me to one that would be appropriate for me to attempt.  I keep a notepad by my computer, but it's too cluttered with quests I've tried to start and never got to finish (too difficult, couldn't find what I needed, couldn't get the next quest guy to respond to me talking).  This applies to Kunark and the Old World, too.<P>TOWER OF FROZEN SHADOW<P>This zone seemed to look interesting, but it bored me quickly.  I got tired of sitting on the second floor fighting difficult encounters and getting no interesting loot and no key to the third floor.  Also, requiring a rogue to sense/disarm traps was just frustrating, can we please have LESS "required" classes instead of more?  I don't want to have to spend more of my time organizing an adventure than actually adventuring.  As it is our small group (ranger/ranger/monk) just asked a high level wizard (who was also stuck on the 2nd floor with us, looking for a key) to evac us out after 4 hours of unproductive hunting.<P>Also, the nonstop whispering was starting to drive me crazy.<P>EASTERN WASTES<P>Had fun hunting here, but things seemed to be very difficult for their level.  Didn't have too many problems with MR.  Ry`Gorr armor is very pretty and very nice stats, so the difficulty is probably appropriate, especially if the experience modifier in this zone makes up for it.<P>CRYSTAL CAVERNS<P>This is the best zone in the game, bar none.  It's very pretty, and very well designed.  I -loved- the mine maze area, it made me feel like I was running around in an M.C.Escher painting.  Encounters are difficult but spaced enough to allow you to adventure without getting overwhelmed.  Excellent loot placement, with nice items that aren't overpowered for their difficulty.<P>It may be too late but I wish you would add robe models to all races; there's no real reason why the only druids that can wear the Crystal Covered Shroud are humans... it's just they are the only druid race that also has robe-wearers.<P>GREAT DIVIDE<P>I didn't really hunt here much, just used it to get to Thurgadin so I could bank/get bound and go back to hunting in Crystal Caverns  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>THURGADIN<P>The most fun city zone in the game.  Neat scenes evolving at all times (although to quote a previous poster: Can they change?)  Interesting plots.  However, I have a few complaints.<P>Quest text:  There are a lot of holes in what people say, and trying to get people to talk to you is incredibly frustrating.  For example, there's the carpenter who talks about Argash putting him out of business by bribing the Council, but I couldn't get him to ask me for help, and when I tried to confront Argash I was just met with stony silence.  Please make it easier to figure out what I need to say to people.  I know you want to remove the brackets from quest text now, but I'd rather play an adventure game than a "guess the phrase you need to say" game.<P>Exploring: I went exploring off the entrance bridge in Thurgadin, and was very upset to find the only way out was to the bottom of Icewell keep, where a red KOS cube was staring me in the face.  I eventually begged a wizard to port me back to Iceclad after being stuck under the bridge for an hour.  Please design your zones to ENCOURAGE exploration, not discourage it, or else I'm just going to be forced to go to a spoiler site before I go anywhere, and I'd really prefer to enjoy the game without that.<P>--<BR>Kiatha Kittenpaw<BR>Feir`Dal Ranger<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. Faction issues , the biggest being no way to raise faction with the dwarves in Crystal Caverns.<P>2. Experiance , the number one reason being that some zones have green mobs that can only be handled by a full balanced group of 50+ , Velketors Laberynth for one. Experiance in other zones seems to be way to low for the risk involved Kael Drakkel and Skyshrine.<P>3. Please work out all the bugs in all advanced quests.<P>4. Take a serious look at the risk versus reward on the Quest Armors versus PoG armor , as of now it is 10 times easier to just get it in PoG.<P>5. Fix all the helm graphics.<P>6.

</FONT><HR>Eastern Wastes - I Don't like the Super Aggro Mobs here (Like Dervs and Cougars).  I play a level 56 Wizard and running through this zone guarantees me a trail of 3 cats and 3 dervs.  The only thing I have going is JBoots which make the run less Dangerous (or invis).  I can see Dungeon zones like Sol A having this aggro, but an outdoor zone?  From an Animal?  This is just a bad way to keep me busy.<P>Tower Of Frozen Shadow - The keys should be better done.  1) Why hold 6 different keys? 2) Death on a level makes CR almost impossible to do.  You HAVE to have a Necro with Summon Corpse or a group of Friends to get you out.  This is not meant to be a solo zone, yet the mobs in there start at 20 or so (This implies it is can be solo'd for exp).<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>all raid lvl encounters in velious basically remove the balance you had gotten in kunark.<P>mobs that are totally MR with tons of HPs means the actual final encounter can only be effectively handled with warriors and clerics (throw in some rogues for the insane dmg too)<P>the zones are for the most part really cool (with the exception of Sirens Grotto which is just kind of a deathtrap)<P>but class balance in uber encounters is completely gone now, sure you need a few support classes to get the melee's and clerics ready , but there sure isnt a need for more than 1 or 2 of each of these, while the warriors,rogues, and clerics better be there in HUGE numbers if you want to succeed </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>oh yeah on thing i would like to add to my reply.<BR>I know that it has already been said but my biggest dissapointment is the lack of a pickup group zone. There seems to be a concensus that sirens grotto and Velketors lab need to be revamped. This seems to me like the perfect opportunity to correct this mistake of velious and make these zones pickup group friendly. Oh, and it would be nice to have them factionless. Nothing like having one group of my friends on diff factions from another group of friends. At some point i have to say i can't hunt with them, and that's no fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

As it stands, the only possible way to raise it is by extremely long, boring, repetitive quests that give minor faction boosts. Tormax faction can be raised by killing guards in Icewell Keep, add some NPCs that give Yelinak faction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There really, really needs to be more bind points in Velious.<P>You're not helping the cleric monopoly problem with the extra Hybird and Melee death penelty. :-) same thing goes for Kunark as well...both of them have large zones, with big underconning MOBs. It's a big problem for all of us, it's just that it's below the priority of getting wanted on raids and new abilities.<P>That being said, I have not spent much time in Velious. To make a run safely to the nearest safe "good" bind point requires a melee to be at least level 45, unless you have an ample supply of invis potions or a caster willing to escort you for half an hour....<P>There's also the issues of the MOBs being too hard. Because you have scaled the difficulty in Velious and Kunark to the point where there's now a maximum amount of players allowed to join a raid, generic classes such as druids, shamans, and hybirds seriously get the shaft. Simply put, these classes are often not worth their lag, or group spot, in most encounters.<P>Both of these issues expand to Kunark as well, and not just Velious...it's just that Velious has magnified the issues, just like it has magnified the need for "pure" classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fix the pathing around the portals. Mobs shouldn't roam right thru them.  There is usually a dervish parked at the iceclad portal.  <P>Some of the mobs have way too many hps for their levels. Snow cougars come to mind and manticores. Mostly these are good zones. Bunnies are a nice touch. <P>One problem in Kunark was mobs roaming across the portal area. We would appreciate it if you'd fix that in Velios. <P>The quests for armor are ok but what on earth are you thinking making flawless diamonds a rare drop off Maestro(at least from what I'm told). Isn't it bad enough that you make Maestro's hand a rare drop but now these?  Look you've made it so warriors will almost never get their FA weapons, but to keep every class from having the remotest chance of getting a quest bp is over the line.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The zones in velious are beautiful, but some of the levels seem a bit off. I was hoping for one or two more sebilis, howling stones, or chardok type dungeons. I don't mind that some of the dungeons in velious are really tough, but it seems they all seem to be either really tough, or go from easy to too tough too quickly (Labyrinth). Doesn't seem like there are many areas one group can do safely.<P>Was also hoping for at least one more outdoor zone that was intended for the 50+ crowd like skyfire. <P>The design of them are great, some of the most impressive zones in the game.<P>On major problem I have with the zones is that I haven't upgraded my system since EQ came out. My computer ran the old zones no problem, but in velious I'm starting to experience problems. My zone times over there are long, and I'm starting to experience lag. If you develop any more zones, it would be great if you tried to keep close to the original system requirements. I understand though that you need to improve the look and other aspects of the game and upgrading is a necessity, but try to keep some of the people that don't have tons of money to upgrade their systems every year  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see the Siren's Ghetto problems have been duely noted by now. Just walking into the zone requires 18 people, which is absurd.<P>Velk has similar issues, but the common mobs were fixed awhile back (they would resist enchanter mez, but not bard/necro mez). The loot on Velketor should be examined though - one "good" piece, two crappy ones. Please stop dropping useless loots on major mobs.<P>Cobalt Scar portal seems rather silly... why wasn't this put in Western Wastes?<P>Kael Drakkel has an enchanter specific problem in that you can't always command giants you charm. /pet attack usually works, unless it's attacking something already (and that something is often someone in your party). None of the other commands do because of the giant's height. Even levitating you aren't close enough for them to hear you and respond to pet commands.<P>L55 spells for all classes are only dropping in Plane of Growth. This is great for me and my guild since we can trade things like bear form and druid pet for absurd items, but it really isn't fair.<P>Plane of Mischief is unitemized and too hard to get to. See below.<P>Sleeper's tomb key should be soul bound (not making it soul bound just leads to the same stupid rez tricks that caused the creation of soul bound items in the first place). And giving it bad dragon faction makes it unaccessible to those that choose to ally with dragons (more below).<P>Necropolis is a great zone, only one problem - roaming mobs that cast gate, gate to the other end of the zone practically, and then start summoning and killing. (Side note - ever since summon was changed to a say instead of shout it's been far too dangerous. Please have a say/emote occur both at the mob's location and the player's, so nearby players know what just happened).<BR>- Plane of Growth is mostly too easy, excepting one thing -- roaming mobs that are unstunnable and gate (Necropolis problem but worse). They aren't unkillable, but it's not worth the danger since it often leads to a total wipeout.<P>Faction is not fair right now, in a wide variety of ways:<BR>- toss dwarf faction and you've eliminated the only place to buy gems in Velious, and the only place to buy Velium bars period. Add gem/bar vendors to Skyshrine and Kael Drakken please.<BR>- toss dragon faction and you are KOS at half the portals in the land. Yes, they're "dragon" portals, but this seems a bit silly.<BR>- toss dragon faction and no Sleeper's for you. And yet, Jalel Dar asks you to awaken the sleeper. Killing ClawsofVeeshan faction monsters is not required to gain access, and all the mobs inside are kill-on-sight regardless of faction. In theory the choice would be that you shoot for either Sleeper's or for Temple of Veeshan/Plane of Mischief.<BR>- Dragon faction doesn't help you get to Plane of Mischief now, since the entrance is at the end of a hallway that is KOS to everyone and has invis seeing monsters. Do you really expect people to have to spend a day fighting to PoM just so they can spend a day there?<BR>- don't toss dragon faction and you can't get some rather nice items. Where are the quests in Skyshrine for things like Wurm Lord Mantle or Oilskin Greaves? These certainly shouldn't be quests in Western Wastes or Temple of Veeshan.<P>Llarn, Officer of Prophecy<BR>L59 Enchanter, Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Velketor's could have been it.<P>Going on to the things I don't like about Velious:<P>Velketor's -&gt; WAY too hard for no reward.<P>Siren's Grotto -&gt; NO point to even hunting here.  30 people going to WW got owned here thanks to bugs and screwy pathing.  We then summoned bodies and killed dragons all night.  Walruses are harder then dragons?  Yeah..<P>Wuoshi -&gt; Please move him somewhere where he does not make the Wakening Land portal a waste of a spell slot.  Or make his agro MUCH less.  Thanks.<P>Stormfeather -&gt; Make him spawn please.<P>Plane of Growth -&gt; Way too easy.  Way too easy.  Sorry but it has to be said.  Also please fix the paladin quest, its broken at the moment.<P>Now for the things I like in Velious:<P>Thurgadin -&gt; Great zone, I love watching the dwarves do funny stuff ;p<P>East Wastes -&gt; Garadain's quests are awesome.  Nice zone for lower level people.<P>West Wastes -&gt; Fun zone!  I like this place.<P>Cobalt Scar -&gt; Killing Kelorek'Dar is just the thing to get you in the mood to go to WW and kill more dragons...<P>Basically I give Velious a 5 out of 10.  It could have been a LOT better.  I don't pretend to have seen it all so far, but I am staying in Kunark for exp and will only go to Velious for quests or raids.  It's sad there's no real place for higher level people to get reliable Exp....<P>Also one more thing about Velious.  Give the paladin spell Flame of Light the appropriate Graphics (Fire, etc.) and sounds please.  It currently has no sounds or graphics what so ever attached to it.<P>Also please give SK's/Paladins the defensive discipline, and higher Offense/Defense skill caps.  We are worthless vs. high end mobs without these skills.  We might as well be wizards tanking for the amount of time we survive vs. them.  Thanks.  Also evaluate rangers with this too, they need a place in Velious.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That's annoying.<P>Definitely dodgy paths in Crystal Caverns, takes ages to move from the zone enterence to eg Queen room with the pet - there are some places where pet just doesn't want to go, instead it gets lost, and it takes a while to find its way. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If only one thing comes out of this thread, I hope it's a complete and total tone-down of Siren's Grotto, making it both a hunt-able zone and relatively easy to transit through invisible to see the other zones of Velious, much like Kael Drakkel is now.<P>As it is, very few people even have their Cobalt Scar keys, making it impossible to get through the Grotto without having someone intrazone teleport you through is not going to unbalance a thing.<P>PoG is fine, with the way the drops were nerfed, it's not any worse then PoF/PoH is. At least I have some Bonecaster armour, not like I've ever seen a single piece of blighted drop yet.<P>Again, Kudos on Crystal Caverns. have the layout person who did this zone re-mob and re-itemize the Grotto and Velkitor's Lab please.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Much of Velious seems to be geared to large raid guilds.  There doesn't appear to much opportunity for individuals in the 50+ range to put together single groups and do things.  Last count, on my server, there are 3 large raid guilds.  Maybe 300 players in those three guilds.  Think of that, 300 players out of how many thousand are the only ones able to enjoy Velious.<P>They are  all having a great time in Velious because they can quickly mobilize raids and do things.  The rest of us have to contend with hours of downtime trying to organize raids. <P>Part of this is because EQ just doesn't have good communication facilities for non-guilded players. Using tells, shouts and ooc to communicate for raids is horrid.  Being able to utilize a common chat channel shared by enough raid capable folks and say, "starting a Kael raid in 15 minutes, be at the entrance ready to go" must be very nice for raid guilds.<P>What would make Velious more fun would be to gear at least some of the zones towards 50+ players that would accommodate pickup groups, short of improving the communication facilities to make large scale raids more feasible.<P>I would overall rate the NPC difficulty as too high if it takes more than a single group to take it out.  Once again, I'm biased against these large raid encounters because of the difficulty in organizing them. <P>Risk/reward I can't comment much on because I've spent so little time in Velious because it is simply to difficult to get raids together to do anything.  I will comment that what few Velious raids I've been on there netted 0 spell drops.  People are selling the Velious spells for 10,000 plat on my server because they're so rare.<P>Postive comments are:  It's great to have a city close to a teleport location (Thurgadim).  And the city itself is really neat.  Just love the personality the NPC's have been given, especially the gnome pirates.  The quests look nice, but again the armor quests are too difficult due to having to organize raids into Kael.  It looks like  folks in the 30-40 range have a lot of opportunity to group and do things.  But the range from 40-60 seems like a barren wasteland unless you're in a raid guild. <P>The tradeskills continue to be poorly implemented, yield marginal results for the plat and time invested.  To date, there are still a number of broken recipes, missing ingredients, missing recipes (in the old world), and difficulty levels set WAY too high with no intermediate steps to take.  In general, we tradesmiths are very frustrated, many are giving it up perhaps to come back to it in a few months when you've gotten around to looking at it. :\<P>That's it.  I can sum it up in a single run-on-sentence my biggest issue:<P>Raids are difficult to organize and not terribly rewarding in experience or loot, yet Velious seems to be geared to the raid type of encounter that most folks can't or don't enjoy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Vellious == Halas<P>Too hard to get to<P>Too hard to get OUT of<P>So it is very hard to get a pickup group.<P>We have had people quit the game for a few days after they got stuck over there and couldn't get back.<P>There is NOTHING that groups of 2-3 people can do since everything resists out the wazoo and has one boatload of hit points.<P>You need some part of one zone which is suited for small groups like the Overthere but for L45's instead of for L40's.<P>Overthere is a glorious zone, complete with the trademark verant poison pill (the dragoons).<P>----<P>Just seems to me like you put HUGE amounts of programmer work in to all these zones (and a lot of money invested) and then set them up so only 1% of your customers who use 50% of your band width can join them.<P>Velkator's labyrinth is a perfect example.<P>Extremely well designed.<P>Good points<BR>Challenging<BR>VERY COOL looking<BR>Interesting mix of mobs<BR>Nice increasing difficulty as you ascend the labyrinth<BR>EASY for tanks to leave early if they have to go (couple quick hops for about 400 points of damage and you are out of there)<P>Bad Points<BR>NO loot to speak of in the entire labyrinth.<BR>So unless you are a group of Mid 50's who can do kobolds, the dungeon is just a big empty grinding hole.<P>Given it's location (only L44 porters can get you in and out of there reliably) and lack of loot folks wisely just don't go there.<P>---<P>Verant has asked from day one why some zones are crowded and others are empty...<P>The answer for most empty dungeons is NO LOOT.<BR>I mean- Sebilous is difficult to get to incredibly hard to get into but it's packed almost 24/7.  Meanwhile chardoc, kaseora, droga, nurga are all empty.<P>No don't get me wrong- I love nurga as an old DND person because it is a great crawl (and so is the 70% of droga which has NO LOOT) but it's kinda hard to convince most folks to go kill things and get nothing.<P>However!  We can't just keep adding items to the game.  For one thing- there will always be a best item.  And folks will pretty much ignore the second best item (and not even buy the third best item).<P>So I think you guys need to make up a bunch of items with CHARGES.  One charge, three charges, 10 charges.  The point is you can make a very good item that you know will leave the game.<P>Second- velkator's needs some Camps.  A couple good mobs on the floor who drop decent L45 type treasure once every six to eight hours.  At least two more good camps up in the maze.<P>Velkator could be the key to building up the great divide and Thurgadin area IF it was the L48 Guk/Sebilous (and guk is really too low (L35-L48 really) while Sebilous is really L52 and up.<P><BR>Like wise, if you add some recoganizable camps to the Great Divide besides the dragons you MIGHT get more players out there.  I mean for pete's sake- we have 2000 players on each server yet these zones and their support hardware is under 10% utilized.<P>Meanwhile there were THREE Simulataneous raids in Hate last saturday.<P>I guess what I'm saying about all these zones is that if you set up an area with decent loot big enough to support a couple groups near the entrance then they will always have someone there.<P>Zones have to be reachable in less than 30 minutes.<P>Some part of the zones should accomodate folks who will be there about 2-3 hours.  not all of it, not most of it- just some part near the entrance for casual players.<P>Otherwise they'll remain empty.<P><BR>But if you want to FIX velkator- then weaken him (and his treasures) to be a L58 type mob that can be beaten by two groups.  make him spawn every 1 to 24 hours so ubers can't count on when he will be up (kinda like Phin).<P><BR>---<P>I wish I could tell you more how to fix it but to be honest, I just can't get many people to go there (and these are folks who are on 4-5 hours solid 5 nights a week) because they don't have the 8 hours a lot of these areas require to get to anything that drops loot.<P>Now- you will have a lot of L60 types in another 12 months (unless they quit because they can't find anything to do).  Creating content for them was a good idea.  But how about creating content that a GROUP of SIX L60 types finds a challenge.<P>A nurga or droga for groups of L60's.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have only done a bit of Velious so far, and this is what I see:<P>Aesthetics:<P>Zones I've seen (iceclad, EW, GD, Thurg a & b)seem to indicate that Verant has learned quite a bit from Kunark, in some ways. Zones in Velious seem to be better designed, less ghosting, more theme (i.e. snow cougars roaming the iceclad tundra = makes sense; voracious brutes in dreadlands = makes no sense). None of these homogenously-dispersed random wandering mobs type of areas, which is good. Graphics and topography are also a good step up. All in all Velious zones have a good deal more character than Kunark zones.<P>Gameplay:<P>Here there are some serious problems. Why would any enchanter or shaman go to Velious? 100% MR = no fun for these classes. They can't do what they do best, what fun is that to play? The absence of these classes on Velious narrows the scope of the game considerably.<P>I'm not sure about other dungeons in Velious, but the only one I have been to, Icewell Keep, has some of the worst pathing I have seen, even worse than Karnor's Castle. Stuff will be aggro yet run back and forth over the entrance bridge for minutes before getting to you.<P>I also have to say that it was perfectly true to form for the Plane of Mischief to be unitemized and broken.<P>I can't express how much Verant needs some experienced play testers and a detailed and systematic quality control system. This is the #1 failure of Verant since EQ came out and the problem that is most persistently ignored. Having one or two people to check out bugs as they are reported simply doesn't compare to running simulations of actual play. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>With more and more average players reaching the 55-60 level range, Velious is nice in that it provides more of the end-game environment.  Much more places to raid, more difficult encounters.  Once you reach 60, doing Seb and Charasis over and over gets dull.  It would have been nice, however, to provivde a new exp dungeon for the 55+ crowd.<P>Issues I see:<P>1)  Make the three cities equal.  It's obvious a lot of time was put in to making Thurgadin.  It has all the merchants you need, story content, etc - it's a lively, fun city.  Kael/Skyshrine on the otherhand are bland and lack most merchants as well as the fun, festive feel.  They need animation.  I'd be happy, however, if those that decided to side against dwarfs had the same access to merchants, class guilds, etc.  All three cities should have equal access to all the trade skills vendors, guilds to train, supplies, etc.<P>2)  Make Kunark 55+ spells drop on SoV 55+ mobs.  Level 55-58 Kunark spells are very rare, even after 10 months.  I've not even seen two of my spells drop despite multiple trips deep in Sebilis, Charasis, Chardok, killing Trak, VS, and clearing VP.  I'd like to explore new lands and not worry about camping the old stuff for spells.<P>Zone impressions:<P>Icewell Keep:  The lower part of this zone (cubes, tents, golems) can be a fun and challenging place for a small group.  Loot and experience is nothing great, but it can be entertaining.  The upper part (dwarfs) is just a boring means to get giant faction.  MR on the dwarfs is insane.  As a 60 enchanter, I can't even land my level 60 dictate spell on them.  The green plate armor that drops here is way too common for how nice it is.  Exp is ok in a mele/cleric group.<P>Velkators:  This zone was a blast the first couple times.  The layout was nice and exploring with one group was fun.  Due to exp/loot, however, this zone has almost no replay value.  We went, we explored, we tried camping different areas.  There's just no reason to go back once you've done it.  Despite what many have said, this zone is easily done with one group 55-60.<P>Kael:  As a city, this place blows.  You really punish people for taking sides with giants.  Yet, you provide no reward for siding with dragons/dwarfs (my guild switched after realizing you're limited to killing in Kael/ToV when siding with CoV).  Please make this equal to Thurgadin as a city for us giant lovers.  As a dungeon, it's average.  There are some fun high end enounters such as Vindicator, Statue, and Tormax.  The temple area can be fun for one to two groups with decent loot/quest items.<P>SkyShrine:  This is the same as Kael.  Sucks as a city, average as a dungeon.  Please fix Yel so that the GMs stop /killing him.<P>Sirens' Grotto:  This zone is a joke.  Highly mr mobs that can not be snared, rooted, stunned, mezed, etc make this a huge challenge.  That could be fine.  However, those same mobs have horrible pathing, run at half health, charm, complete heal, etc.  If you have multiple complete healing mobs in concentrated areas.  Also, being a mixed land/water zone, you have to deal with only being able to attack a land mob from land and only being able to attack a water mob from water.  When a mob runs in and out of water, it's very difficult to deal with.  I suggest this whole zone gets revamped.  This could be a perfect alternative to Seb/Charasis for the 55-60 crowd if done right.  Make it hard, but make it doable by one group with just rewards.<P>Western Wastes:  This zone bores me, others love it.  Guess it depends on your class.  Being an enchanter forced in to a do nothing but buff role, having most mobs cast aoe dispell is a real pain.  My only role is to buff, yet the mobs make buffs almost a waste.  <P>Necropolis:  This is a great place for one to two groups.  Decent loot, fun to explore.  Only problem is its remoteness.  You must pass through that hole called Sirens' Grotto to get here.  That limits its usability by one group.  With no dragon ring in Western Wastes, and no mele bind point beyond Siren's Grotto, doing Necropolis can be a major pain if something goes wrong (ie if you take risks).<P>Temple of Veshan:  The test area was fun, but the quest rewards for the increased difficulty made keeping CoV faction silly.  Also, the faction bug made recovering from wipeout in this zone a real nusiance.<P>Plane of Growth:  This place is just boring.  The zone is way too easy and spread out.  I normally have problems staying awake when my guild goes here.  I really don't know how you could make such a large and open zone more challenging without making it impossible, especially considering you have to clear the zone to attack Tunare.  I'd rather see it smaller and more concentrated.  Sort of a Plane of Fear for level 60s.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>just wanted to  toss in my thoughts , and be brief.<P>The zones mentioned like Kael are pretty much raid only, they are NOT fun at all for  6 man group since you wont get any XP or loot and most likely die.<P>The raid guilds have a blast choosing sides and have 12 clerics and 15 warriors and 10 rogues.  The rest of us guilds are still hunting in Sebilis and the hole since with a 6-12 man team we just dont have what it takes to kill those uber mobs.<P>We havent even bothered trying to raid the dorfs, we tried the giants, no one got XP noting good dropped and we had to do hard CR, in fact the only zones in SoV we even want to go to anymore are the PoG and the PoM.  Its just not fun when there are tons of green mobs to a lvl 55 group in Kael, yet they can kill you instantly</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>General Problems in Velious<P>-Underconned Mobs, mobs that hit for 170 and con green to a lvl 55 and is MR resistant, is underconned Especially when they drop loot meant ofr lvl 40s...ie 4 pp...<BR>-Insane MR , which prevent mezzing, stuns and snare/darkness which is fine i guess cept...<BR>-MR mobs which cannot be stunne,mezzzed or bashed or slowed/snared/darknessedwho decide CHealing, or Gating or deciding to run.. <BR>-which brings us to the uber HPs on the mobs, Look verant all this has additional mobflation you done just makes the 60% of the classes out there even less useful than before. Casters cant nuke because the mobs hps and resistances have gone beyond the expected limit.<BR>-non specialisted melee are even more marginalised Because the fights last longer, and their lower melee potential and higher resistances coupled with less defensive ability makes them even more useless..<BR>-Crap risk vs reward, the quests and the drops which are appropriate in terms of reward vs risk has already been identified and camped, all the rest are ignored given th genral difficulty. IE why bring 30 plus ppl to Siren grotto for the extremely large chance of dying to get caster armor which caster twinks do not even want??<BR>-Low xp generally in most 50 plus areas ( and the aeas whicha re meant for 40 plus IE velkators lab is not for 40 plus ppl. more like 55 plus which they con green too..)<BR>-Lots of unfinished and broken quests.<BR>-If you wanted to design areas for uber guilds , fine do so, but please, get this in your thick skull, You cant beat them, You are just playing into their hands and you are alienating 95% of the player base by doing so with **** like SG, VL, etc etc.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052487&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052487&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
