</FONT><HR>hehehe, as far as the taunt goes... PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF TUNARE GIVE WARRIORS BETTER TAUNT!!!<P>balancing classes by nerfing ther more pwerfull ones is NOT the way. I play a ranger, dont even have taunt hotkeyed, and many warriors are incapable of taunting off of me. This is a bad thing, i dont want a better taunt, would love for warriors to have it, but get it away from me. Not far from Jolt and cant wait.<P>Warriors are the best all around tanks. I have no problem with that, that is how it should be, however i feel each hybred should have a givin area of speciality in which they do excell.<P>Paladins i feel should be able to soak damage at least equal to the warrior if not slightly higher, they are your stalwart shield warriors, lent extra strength by their gods to endure. Of corse the warrior should outdamage them by far, the paladin should never take joy in the kill, in the destruction of the undead maybe but not in the killing of the living. less HP, but higher defence/ac should be how the paladin is build IMHO. (warriors take the blows and keep on goin, paladins, in their holy armor concentrate more on the defence)<P>Rangers i feel are duel wielding machines. i have no problem with being poor at tanking compared to a warrior, however as is it is a bit to extreme. i would at least like to be on par with a rogue in damage soaking ability. with the skill caps as is even the rogue out tanks a ranger.Monks having better duel wield is understandable considering the nature of monks, however the rogue outdoing us rangers in this department is an insult. i understand that rogues and monks are damage specialists, but please, i have seen rogues backstab for near 800 damage, throw in double backstab at 55 they ARE damage specialists why do they duel wield better than the ranger? in the fantasy settings in which EQ was based on rangers were the uncontested masters of duel wield. rangers i feel should be counted amoung the melee damage specialists, however we no longer compare, with tripple attack on warriors my duel wield is a joke. the skill caps increases givin to ranger dodge/parry is apreciated, for that is how a ranger is supposed to tank, light agi tanks. this straegy however doesnt work especialy with our very low skill caps, even after the very small increase to theese caps, the caps simply were not raised enough.<P>Shadowknights i have a less clear picture on, especialy in a group. when i picture a shadowknight in a fantisy setting i dont think of the a class that plays well with others. i think of somethin more of an EVIL cleric, and servants of evil gods dont show devotion by fasting and praying, they go out, they slay innocents and generaly wreak havoc. a Warrior with an evil heart granted powers by dark gods to to kill, destroy, and generaly bring terror to all. this however isnt what they are in EQ... well i guess they are a weak version hahaha only one undead minion what kind of dark overlord are you.<P>yes, i do think hybreds should get disciplines, but not all of them obviously, certain ones to each class. the all reposte mode thing is very rangerish would serve well on a paladin as well. the all crit mode would be nice on a SK (yes i realize SK's dont go into bezerk mode but im sure they can work it in for the use of the discipline alone) the stonestance, or whatever the monk ac thing is would fit paladins nicely.  just think and its not hard to immagine what ones seem fitting to who.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Look all of you are saying that hybrids suck and should be made more powerfull to catch up to the other classes and very few of you are offering solutions.(or balanced solutions). I for one agree that there is a def imbalance where the hybrids are concearned, and have heard many arguments otherwise.. But for one the main reason they say that a pally has a poorer offence is because of his (her) superior def and healing capabilities... Hmmm not true.. War's get more hp's and a better ac.. bye a lot.. And yes a pallies healing abilities are useful and do not think they should be on par with that of a Cleric's.. Or that a pally should get DD spells since they can do more damage with combat, and should stay as they are cept maybe Superior healing should be given at a little lower lvl..I. E. 54 or 55.. K Now aside from making bash a more effective tool and making it more desirable for all classes including pallies.. I.E. little more dam and a more effective stun... these are the things that would make a pally more fair and not effect the ballance of the game.. (of course this is purley my opinion) A pally is  a warrior/deffender of the faith; so why would the gods not grant him all the yaulps and  most of the def buffs as a Cleric? I'm not saying give him all of the Clerics spells, just def spells that are on a par with his/her lvl. You don't have to raise his offence, just make him a better defender of the faith as said by all the critics. Since all of his or her spells are given from the gods. Why would the gods not denote his strong defender of the faith with better def buffs and maybe yaulp 3. With that sugestion you could balance the game conciderably without changing offensive numbers to make it unfair to anyone.. <BR>I am very happy with my palidan as is and will NEVER stop playing with him. I have other charecters such as a rouge and a mage that i enjoy, but i still think my pally is da sht, and i am very happy with the time i spend playing with him. I do not need the most powerful charecter in the game to have fun, and i agree with the creators of the game about keeping balance.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok here goes my 2cp worth of coment on the hybrid thing.After reading the posts,and I may have missed a few, but the only shad's that seem,happy with there class seem to be trolls and ogres,while the others of us trail in there wake(I'm a 31lvl Delf shad BTW), there natural strength and hits over the rest make them hit harder,and absorbe more damage than the other races and they never seem to have,anybother finding a group if there is a spot,but time and time again I seem to spend more time,just trying to find one that A will take me,and B doesn't dump me,when my body is halfway down the sewers in caz,"cause WE NEAD an enchanter" (this actually happend to me one time) My oppinion on the whole structure of EQ is that it is horribly wrong, ALL classes reguard less of there race and skills, should be adressed, so that all have an equal chance to,contribute to a group,and have the same oppotunity to solo when one is available,I'm not alone in this thinging as several of my friends that have played both hybrid tanks and pure warriors,have deleted them in favor of a necro or druid because they "solo" far easier then other classes, i don't know on a personal level having not played either.<BR>  For the time being i intend to soldier on with mine,with ever increasing frustration,and depression,until either a fairer balance is found or I get fed up and cancel my account,because who want to pay for sitting infront of there VDU and smoke for the first hour and a half of each playing session<P>   living in hope <BR>     Talisalenia  Very miserable 31 lvl SK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like your "smoke an hour and a half" before each session. That sexactly what I do. Everytime, I get excited about the possibility of getting into a group, I would drop my ashes all over the keyboard to find out that they do not WANT a paladin. At least for SKs, you have large races with amazing hitpoints and strength. At least for SKs you get to have a nice little pet to tank for you when ya camping low level dungeons for stuff. At least you get to FD when you feel like having a SH*T while refusing to camp out, and also in cases when the entire party gets cleared, you can FD and be quite safe.<P>Paladins do not have large races, thus we have low strength (exception dwarves) and low stamina. We cannot slam with 2hand weapons thus. We have Lay on Hands which everybody thought of as godly, but it actually when the paladins STILL have it that we MAY be considered useful to a group. Once we expended it, we gotta wait like an hour and half smoking, waiting for it to come back. Incidentally, during this period of time, there is possibilty you may need the LOH skill.<P>Whatever it is, improve paladins like what I sugested in my earlier posts, and maybe we would fare better. In fact, on my current server, we have only 4 paladins with the Fiery Avenger (which is not so uber anymore), and 2 of them got so sick of the fact we got screwed by Verant, they left the game. 2 FAs on a server, boy are paladins suffering the nonchalant attitude of Verant toward us.

</FONT><HR>Ok while I have not yet read this whole thread (god its getting long) I do want to make a couple comments then go back to reading it. <P>I have to agree that Hybrids should get more for paying out the XP cost and that they dont quite get enough as it has become apparent to almost all that most hybrids are not pound for xp cost up to par with the pure classes.<P>I also want to say that I'm a stubborn SOB and I will continue to play my ranger, not that im high level yet, but I played AC till the cows came home and can see the advantages / disadvantages of the different classes.<P>Why did I pick the Ranger class?  I COULD have picked a class based on theif ability to excell but i didnt. Because I wanted to be a Ranger, thats my persona. I usualy play rangers or similar charactors as that is the type of charactor I played in AD&D. I will keep on playing and i hope one day to be on par with all the other classes with my own uniqe abilitys rather than parts of other classes but untill that time my RPing alone will have to set me apart along with my few druidic spells.<P>Gwydeon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Real easy way to show the difference between a warrior and a hybrib, or a Caster and a Hybrid.<P>I am a lvl 27 Ranger who is moderatly/heavily twinked;  I'm wearing about 4k worth of gear at this point so you figure it out.<P>The other day in Gfay there was a little Duel thing going on.  I went over and was challenged by a lvl 21 Troll warrior.  He wasn't twinked at all.  I won but just barely.  I used all my mana and had almost no health left when he died.  About 5 minutes later I accepted a challenge from a lvl 24 druid.  Again he wasn't twinked.  I died..... 4 times.  He never got below 1/4 life.<P>Hybrids suck. plain and simple.  Why give a Hybrid a spell that his caster-counterpart got 15 levels before? ok.. ok.. we aren't casters.. we should still be comparable in power to any other class ay any level.  Play style does matter however there's not much style involved when you get killed by a low level warrior in melee combat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hybrids are not doing the things that they should do or should hv the power to do in EQ now.  What do U think of a level 50 Ranger can do now? He even can't find a group now.  I can tell U that unless U r a member of those great guilds, you can't even find a group in normal playing hrs.  When a group is shouting for a tank, Ranger will NEVER be welcomed.  The groups will only look for true tank - Warrior and semi-tanks - Pally or SK.  <P>If there is warrior in the zone, both Pally and SK can't even join a group as well.  If Hybrid can't find a zone in all the new zones, how can they advance to level 60?<P>Pls, help to find out a way for all those Hybrid to level to 60.  They r not a true tank and all the spells r nearly useless.  Pls review the AD&D rules for all the Hybrids.  We r taking up all the disadvantages but none of the advantages of being a Hybrid!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why I am posting a reply to this thread is a complete mystery... but I have 2 things to say.<P>1) Paladins can make effective tanks. Shadow can make effective tanks. Warriors are better tanks. Shadow Knights, and Paladins each can add things to a group. Shadow Knights have offensive utlity spells (dooming dark, Shadow vortex, heart flutter). Paladins have defensive spell lines... (Sup heal, various buffs, stun, root). A well played hybrid, can make an enormouse differnce to a group.<P>2) Plate wearing hybrids are not that far off in tanking ablity. I have been extensively testing this over the past month. AC is with in 50 on a well equip shadow/paladin. Hps are another story. Large Race SKs are with in 150 to 300 hps of a warrior. Small races range between 200-400. As for skill caps... Well they aren't as huge of a factor as purported on these boards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I think Hybrids are quite ok in Groups till around Level 55. <BR>A Group going to take down Juggernaughts or Shroom King in Sebilis with 6 PPL with a Hybrid in a group will be back at Zoneline looking for Ress and Summon Corpse in about half an hour. Why? Well, because the group isnt fast enough to do enough Damage to do the Job in these Spots.<BR>Paladins Melee Damage with normal Equip (like Wurmslayer, DMHWS, SotM) is insufficient comparred to a dualwielding, critcals hits doing, slaming / kicking Warrior wielding Lamentations - I would say around 30to40% less Damage in a normal Fight against 1 Mob. Defensive the Warrior has around 50ac more (assuming Pal uses shield, if using 2H its up to 100 AC) and around 400+ hp more &lt; selfbuffs dont count here, because Cleric is always in group.<BR>Ranger does not much less damage than a warrior (Execpt criticals), but has around 150to200AC less and around 600to800 hp less. Well, better to let a pet do the job than the Ranger...<BR>Shadowknight does approx 20% less Damage than Warrior, same AC and HP rules as to Paly apply here.<BR>With skill, these spots might be still doable, and a Paladin with FD and Full Deepwater Armor can almost outdamage a Yaks wielding Gnomewarrior in Crafted Armor, but it is just not normally possible.<BR>Okies, so it is still doable to reach 60 as Hybrid in normal groups, but as an Hybrid you need lets say 2 months longer. When I do a /who all 60 on my server, I got 1-2 Pals, 1 SK, 0 Ranger, 1-2 Bards and around 8-10 Warriors, 4t-6 Monks, 1-2 Rogs what the Melee Classes concerns.<P>But now lets get to the point, when XP Leveling is done. If you are not a player who wants to bring 8 chars to 60, you likely want to participate in Dragons Runs, help in Epic Quests, want to explore Skyplane and Veeshans Peak and soon Velious. Well, take a look at the guilds rooster cabable of doing so: <P>max 2 Paladins<BR>max 3 Shadowknights<BR>max 2 Rangers <P>But:<P>around 6to10 Warrior<BR>around 6to10 Monks<BR>around 4to8 Rogs<P>Well, see the point? In my guild, 2 Paladins are powerleveling their Warriors and equiping them, because they are sick of beeing Raid Ineffective. Its all about time in Big Raids, you can not successfull fight a dragon around 10 mins. Trakanon lasts on our server around 1 hour and 10 seconds after a patch (1 hour to get all needed people down, 10 seconds to defeat him). Its all about getting the melees close to the dragon, using highlevel disciplines on him, let em hit and taunt him, Mage/Sham malos and Wizards blow him off. Get loot, ress max 2to3 fallen, gate out, thats it. 1 Warrior / Monk / Rogs counts like 10 Hybrids in this Situation, because only 10 Hybrids are able to do the same damage than 1 disci using Melee. Thats why Hybrids are not anymore wanted for that kind of guild activities. Before Rok, it doesnt really matter if you had 5 Pals instead of 3 Warriors in a Dragon Run. Try that with Trakanon, and I wish lots of fun doing CRs in Sebilis.<BR>For my part, I am playing a Level 55 Paladin with decent equip and I think I have some skill in it. But I am tired currently, to advance more further, by knowing that I cant contribute anything special to guild raids except lag (*sarcasm*), and I dont have the time nor the will to start over a Monk or Warrior, like a lot of Hybrids are currently doing. So there is only one other way to me, and that would be to quit the game, which a lot of Paladins did already.<P>So its all about Velious now, to make Hybrids a reasonable class again, I guess if there would be a /transform command allowed to Paladins 55+ to turn into WAR / MNK / ROG, I guess 90% of the Paladins would hit it currently, at least 9 of 10 Paladins I know would do this without thinking twice about it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fellow hybrids despair no longer! All those levels of struggling through the experience penalty(its fun to get paid the same amount as other people for time and a half's work), hours shouting for groups(who needs groups? this is a solo game right? we solo just as well as necros), days spent wishing we could go on a VS raid (watching is fun!), getting laughed at by uber-guilds(its okay my feelings never get hurt because I picked a class that best suited me, its just a game right?), contributing nothing to a group anywhere (can't really think of why someone would pick a pally/sk/ranger over a warrior anywhere) are gone! Our disciplines are here! Even though the melee classes get them 21 and 11 levels before us we still get them! WOOOOT! For a second there I thought we would be left in the dust AGAIN!<P>I can't recall how many times I've been killed because my resistances weren't just a few points higher (I think 3 is a good number that woulda saved me). Oh wait we do now! Hybrids are invincible!<P>Boy I hate when I get feared. Maybe with a +3 MR addition I won't have to waste my 11 precious seconds of being fearless. But nevertheless if I use it its ok, it'll be back in no time! pffffffffffffffffffft, just like my 2 bub heal LoH right? <P>And since I'm a paladin I'll rant and rave about our own disciplines. Everyone will want me on a dragon/VS raid because I can kill those undead beasties (oh wait there aren't any) good with my level 55 discipline.** At least bards/rangers got an auto dodge/parry disc that ALLOWS them to take action on a VS raid ** No serious time commitment there. And hey hey hey wait just a minute, I almost forgot the other discipline. I become invulnerable from MOST harmful spells for 10 seconds. Oh wait didn't I get this at 55 (5 levels ago) while my one of my parent classes got it at 1? Nope, must be mistaken. Silly me.<P>Thanks Verant, all this unbalancing has come to an end, finally I can play EQ.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>Maybe I can mug someone and steal 20 dollars just to try these things out in SoV since I don't think its worthy of my own money. I can't wait to spend hours exploring the new SoV continent BY MYSELF!(since no one in their right mind would want to group with a pally, hell I wouldn't, and because all my friends are levels higher than me now anyways).<P>And of course all my previous points and concerns before the prior paragraph will go ignored/thrown out/made fun of/etc etc etc because all of Verant's attention will go to the one sentence I made about it not being worth my money.

</FONT><HR>  i was wondering what class specific skill you metioned earlier if it's track druids get it to and theirs tends to be used more often then ours due to the range factor the group wants to know what mobs are close not on the other side of zone like ours does and as far as the taunt factor goes i have to use less damaging weapons compared to what i could use just to keep it so the high ac and hp party members can keep the mob on them i love playing a ranger and won't stop but they are not as group friendly as most think our heal spell  is about completely useless at all lvls we get snare but that is better left to a druid if in party because there is another major taunt along with the dots we get which taunt very well but as far as actual dmg to the mob are not very effective at all i don't know about jolt yet as being only lvl 53 but i know firestrike is not a spell worth buying at lvl 52 due to the extremely long casting time and call of flames is nice but the recast time on it allows it to be cast maybe twice during battle i can understand the less ac factor due to the fact we are only supposed to be allowed chain or along those general lines but a better dodge, parry, and reposte should be allowed i think due to the fact we generally use fast weapons and are supposed to be an agile class hence the feet like cat at lvl 15 and another thing i would like to see is a higher skill cap on bows that is a rangers big weapon yet to be honest is not a very usefull skill at all i am 209 in archery yet i miss the mob 2 out of 3 shots and when i do hit is only a 40 point shot not much dmg for the cost of the arrows it takes to do it this may sound like a flame but if they don't want to make us group friendly could they at least give us some kind of soloabilty PS i hate to solo but when no group is available it's the only way to advance still</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I wish I could understand any of this.  I think the hybrids stack up to the normal classes  (ranger has some downsides though).  I never have had any trouble finding a group (I'm a Sk btw).  I have never felt inferrior overall.  The only time I or a cleric I've been with has noticed a great tanking difference in me and a warrior is when I was in the 40's and underequipped with a warrior who was "over equipped".  Sure warriors are much better for CHing but I've never seen a cleric complain about how fast I can pull the mobs off the casters.  I'm not even  the "best" race for tanking as a sk and I haven't had any of the problems you guys seem to be experienceing.  My only complaint would be the Xp penalty.  Though I don't think it is that bad.  I feel that we do die less often than warriors so that's how we make up for the extra XP.  What game are you guys playing?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well you may not have problems grouping because you group with your friends/guild. I don't think strangers are gonna pick you for a group over a straight melee any time soon. And as for not dying as much therefore we should get an exp penalty, what on earth are you talking about?! When was the last time an auto-riposte discipline has saved you? Oh wait ours suck. The only reason YOU probably don't die as much is due to the fact that you as an SK have FD. Rangers and pallies sure don't. I can LoH myself (if its up) to buy myself(If I'm greedy) some extra time, heck it can't even completely heal me. Rangers can just die. I'm not referring to bards, they at least have uses in groups/raids and no problems getting into groups.<P>That last sentence reminded me of the disciplines hybrids get in SoV. Paladins and SKs STILL do not have any new powers which make them wanted in a group or be involved on a raid. Rangers and bards get auto-dodge and auto-parry. We truly are obsolete. The points I listed are only the tip of the iceberg. Several people have put their thoughts, input, and time into this thread but it probably won't get recognized by Verant or just dismissed.     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm.  I acutually group with pick-up groups most of the time.  Many of my friends either outleveled me or I passed up.  Though I'm at a point where I can group with just about anyone higher than me.  And once a ranger hits 39 he gets sow.  I know so many warriors who die and would have lived if they had it; and rangers who have been saved numerous times becuase they could cast it.  They also have snare and root.  Paladins also have root.  I don't know one person who hasn't been chased by a mob that was blue but they died becuase they just got out of a fight and were low on hps.  A paladin can stun to get away or root it and run.  A warrior just hopes he can make it somewhere safe and often can't make it.  If I'm telling you this for the first time I pity you.  There are other tactics as well that us hybrids can use.  I hope you can see what I mean though.<P>Do you want to know the secret to finding a group if you're not and enchanter or cleric?  Be nice to people.  If that's what you mean by me grouping with friends I guess I do.  I like to make friends with everyone.  If you play well and work hard in a group people will talk to you again when they see you looking for a group.  Even if you were playing a shepard who can't cast or melee and has a sheep pet who just sits there and you're a cool person to hang out with and you use your sheep and cane well people will invite you back.  But by no means are hybrids shepards.  I've said this before and many people know what I'm talking about when I say if you think you're hybrid is underpowered you don't know how to play it.<P>(Maybe you are on a picky server.  I'm on Xegony and have never had a problem since level 1)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think we're necessarily under-powered.. It's just that everyone else is over-powered in comparison to us. Don't believe me? Read the 70 or so previous posts, lots of great examples in there. <P>And as for root/stun or sow saving a hybrids's life as compared to a warrior dying thats usually in solo mode. We're talking about finding groups here. If a group has a cleric and a warrior there is NO, I repeat NO, added benefits to having a paladin there. Rangers are also made useless in the presence of a druid. SK spells w/ necro = useless. Hey I'm not asking that we be made gods I just hope that we can be a little different from our parent classes and a little more group friendly. After all we're paying for SOMETHING with the penalty. Not to be obsolete and get the worst of both worlds.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You are right in many ways that the hybrids do start to find shortcomings when their parent class is preasent.  But I still have to disagree that they don't live more in groups (with the exception of the ranger.  They are huge taunts with low AC and HPs compared to a war.  But if they pressed that taunt button it's probably their fault).  But if you're a pally or Sk and haven't saved a group because of your spells and you made it to thirty then you aren't doing very well.  Do you know how many times I've saved a group with fear or darkness?  You want an example?  It happens ALL the time in very different situations.<P>In dreads fighting (probably around level 40) we were fighting happily and we just got an enchanter in our group.  Most were lom.  And the enchanter said pull a lot.  So the warrior jumped up and started pulling.  The others said lom.  I saw the warrior come over the hill with 4 mobs and one waiting on the hill for him.  He aggroed one on us and went back for the 5th.  OMG!  His hps were dropping rapidly by now and died before the cleric could get a heal off.  What did I do?  As soon as I saw that I started to fear them knowing it was more than the enchanter could handle.  I feared 4 mobs that were activly beating on us and just when I was done she said Mezzed %t  But it was the only thing left to fight so we were activly fighting it.  I know a really good enchanter might have been able to control those mobs but even the good ones get resisted.  And if they do in that kind of situation they could easily fall.  <P>My point is that these situations happen every day.  I've seen hybrids do some amazing things for groups.  Sure their parent class has the same abilities and can probably do them better.  But if they don't do them a warrior can't make up for it.  If everyone was perfect and we could always have perfectly balanced groups there would be little place for pallies, sks and rangers.  If you want to make a story board about amazing things we've seen done by various Hybris I'd be glad to post 20 messages in there.  I've seen just as many amazing things done by some of the other class too.  But that's my point...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah BTW you said that the root/stun thing saving is usually in solo mode.  Well that's usually when warriors die because they don't have it.  Not even trying to solo but just trying to get somewhere.  Include that with the skills to save the group and you might make up for it.  I admit the good warriors out there don't die that often because of things like that and the bad hybrids do...  But on average I think that's how they can justify they xp penalty.

</FONT><HR>Well what most ppl forget here is that the problem isnt with the amazing things some ppl can pull off (that happens in every class). The problem is, that most Hybrids (especially the paladins) feel shortenend with some changes Verant made in comparision to them.<BR>In my estimation most hybrids reallz need some change and that isnt done with just giving them some fake disciplines (other ppl get them 10 lvl earlier).<BR>If one uses the AD&D table (upon which Everquest is supposed to be founded) A hybrid character gets exactly half the xp of his parent class and is therefore 1 to 2 lvls behind them. Ok Hybrids in everquest only get need roughly 140% of their parents class, but get similar skills only around 10 or more lvls later.<BR>Another thought, Hybrids are based upon the ranger or paladin of that rule book...well anyone has ever looked how fast the gain spells after getting the first one?<BR>Well on whatever foundation the everquest advancement table is based, Hybrids are shortenend when reaching higher lvl (and i mean high 55+). At lower lvl they are ok and sometimes more powerful then another class of the same lvl (but well they pay more xp to get there). But around lvl 50 that all changes. (true it changes earlier, but at that lvl the gape widens signifacantly). During the next 5 lvls Hybrids go from well liked in a group to "Huh, what do you want here? Get lost...". There is no way that xp penalty has any reason there.<BR>If you now cry Havok, that the class is balanced with the others, well just one statement.<BR>Everyone will agree, that an ogrewarrior is superior to a dwarf warrior of comparable lvl and equipment. Well he pays more xp for that.<BR>Where is a hybrid superior to another "Single" class?<P>Greetings from Kark (not played Paladin at Bristlebane Server)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This has made quite interesting reading so far, here is my two cents on the subject...<P>Long ago, I used to play a ranger. It was the class I really wanted to play. Up to level 50 and pre-kunark everything was fine. Post 50 and after multiple deaths in Karnors when a mob turned its attention to me for longer than 5 seconds, I began to think "Hmm, something seems wrong here". I began to notice rangers becoming objects of ridicule and got kind of fed up sat waiting for a group in Karnors/Sebilis as endless streams of warriors passed me by and got a group.<P>The end result? I made a warrior and here I am today at 54th level. Am I happy I changed? No, not really but Im a hell of a lot more effective in a group and I actually get requested for groups all the time. I see a few people posting here that warriors cant taunt effectively. Maybe the dumb ones can't but try using a couple of fast proccing weapons and lo and behold the mob hates you.<P>The hybrid problem seems to me to be a couple of things. Firstly, and most importantly I think peoples perceptions of hybrids has been damaged by all the whining that hybrids do (myself included in the past). Some of the whining is justified and yes, hybrids need upgrading slightly.<BR>Secondly, the difficulty of many high level dungeons means that you need to build an ideal group just to survive and in most peoples minds, this does not involve hybrids (unless there is no alternative).<P>Having said all this, the intelligence of the player, in my opinion, is far more important than what class you are playing. So once I have the basic building blocks of a group (cleric, enchanter and me), I tend to look for people that I know play intelligently regardless of their class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well actually I've played 3 characters past 50.  A cleric, a druid and a SK.  The Sk is mine and the cleric and druid are my friends which I often have to play when those classes are needed in a group.  And as a cleric I'd rather have a Sk and a paladin than 2 warriors in my group.  Or even 2 paladins.  (Rangers unfortunatly are better suited for outdoor places and have less value in places like seb).  As I've said many times your paladins and Sks are fine.  And if you think their skill are useless go play a warrior or learn how to play your class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Also, in EQ this was not always the case.  When the game first came out, all melees where pretty much equal in the way of damage output.

But ther is not much that is going to be done about it, they are too woried about the normal classes to have anything to do with us,the best thing we can so is to keep playing our hybrids, to let EQ know that we still are out there and they still need to descuss things with not not just the other!<P>Im sure that everyone that likes there hybrid will agree that they have to fix us sooner or later, but there really isnt much we can do till that day comes<P>THANKS; for taking the time to read my comments, good luck to all hybrid lovers, and kick some butt out there<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No one really wants hybrids, esp in big raids. We do not do enough damage to let the group get the exp. So we are a liability. People usually do not want a paladin in normal grinding groups when hey have a healer. Paladins take too damn long to do the same damage as warriors, monks and even rogues, esp the new zones have creatures that spawn like every 5mins or so. By the time we kill the mob, another would have spawned.<P>This sucks, even with our new disciplines. The crits against undead shoulda been inherent, instead of a discipline.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Doh Biggo<P>Bards are utility players who speed up the game for the players. With your speed song, u kill mobs faster. With your mana song, casters can almost blast at will. Downtime is reduced.<P>In EQ, downtime is hard time. Either you speed up the kills or reduce the downtime. Bards can do just that. <P>What can paladins do? Stun and stun until oom. Biggie to many peeps. Post battle healing - where do you get so much mana to heal after stunning and stunning? Buffing - Your spell does not hold. Melee - "You missed. You missed. You missed." Defensive tank - "A juggernaut hits you for 150 damage. A juggernaut hits you for 198 damage."<P>Paladins survive nowadays because they have friends to group with them, friends who readily accept these flaws in them. I have been on EQ ever since the launch. I have so many friends in EQ. I feel so embarassed sometimes that I am in their group slowing them down. The good thing is that I am a good puller, but this is my skill, NOT the paladins' inherent skills. If I am a monk and have the same pulling abilities as my paladin, people would choose the monk over the paladin anytime. EVen if the monk has bad pulling skills, people would still choose the monk coz he can FD after a bad pull and not drag down the party.<P>I have 5 full bubbles in level 50 before Kunark came out. I am been in the game long enough to make a good value judgement. The paladins before Kunark, despite being weaker than pure classes, are still manageable. After Kunark, the disparity becomes more evident, and we paladins become less useful (notice I did not say "more useless"). Experienced at my paladin, I can still manage to solo during the many times nobody wants a paladin in their grp. My heart sinks when I see other paladins trying to solo and failing miserably. <P>By all means, paladins are not meant to solo. However, a paladin should be able to terminate a blue creature who is near green. At the moment, this is not really the case. It takes a lot just to kill a near green creature.<P>I admire the paladins who blindly stick by their faith and think that they are very well-balanced. Many of them are low levels and do not understand the hardship of paladins at higher levels. I admit that at lower to mid-high levels, paladins are a joy to play. Sadly, they become very unplayable at the really high levels becos nobody wants a paladin in a group, and the noticeable decrease in usefulness of a paladin to a grp.<P>For me, I have gone so far, and done so much. I DO NOT discourage playing paladins. I believe sincerely that I should INFORM paladins-to-be of the disparity concerned.<P>EQ is about camping items, levelling up, meeting with friends and doing fun raids or quests. MANY people concentrate on levelling and farming more than the latter 2. This is what makes the game so mercenary, and so life-like. It makes life for the less useful classes less desirable and less enjoyable.<P>I would strongly encourage paladins who are at least past level 50 to post here, rather than pre level 50 paladins who know nothing about the impact Kunark has made on us.<P>Cheers!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have read over most of the "Hybrids are obsolete" thread, but I skipped over the ones that seemed to lead into <BR>pure whining. <P>I DO see the need for class specific abilities (or you can call them Disciplines) for each<BR>of the hybrid classes. I know that verant had tried to come up with something and handed us <BR>these discs, but that was not very well thought out. I am approaching 50th lvl with my Ogre<BR>SK and I can see how sk's, along with other hybrids, start to peter out post 50 in comparison<BR>to other pure melee classes. There is very little reason to have a hybrid in your group<BR>when they are not contributing anything new.Don't get me wrong though, I love playing my sk and I'm glad that is my primary char. I enjoy a small amount of pride when I do /who all ogre shad 46 60 on my server and see that most of the time I am usually the only one on the list. Most others had quit to play other characters or just retired from eq all together. It's a good indicator to verant though...  <P>It's true though that there is a little bit of a contradiction in statements though since<BR>they(Verant) feel that it is easier to get bugs out of the game by having players find them, but we <BR>know that they do not feel the same way about character balancing issues. <BR>For myself, I believe that sk's are well balanced enough. Paladin's as well. (I think rangers<BR>should get a higher evasion rate though). We don't need these hand-me-down disciplines in order<BR>to keep up with the current trend of getting spells and skills of our parent classes way<BR>behind when they get them. <BR>We need ANOTHER class-specific discipline in my opinion. But that is the hardest task of all<BR>to create, so I can see why we were just handed the discs we were given. I can't speak for <BR>verant or know how long that they spent trying to come up with a solution for hybrid discs, but<BR>it feels like a quick fix more than a well thought out solution to this. <BR>I have had a few thoughts about what kind of disciplines we could get, maybe some of you could<BR>provide some feedback on what you think about my ideas. I don't propose that we get all these,<BR>they are just IDEAS. Again, I don't propose we GET ALL the discs I'm listing, but they are<BR>just IDEAS.<P><BR>Shadow Knights<BR>-An additional Harm Touch that would require a full bar of mana, then it would drain all the<BR>mana away after using it. This would have a REALLY LONG re-use time. <P>Paladins<BR>-Same as SK's but with Lay on Hands<P>Rangers(I need some help with this one, I think that they don't have any problems doing dmg) <BR>-Ability to sucessfully dodge all attacks for 15 seconds<P>I think all the classes with discs currently each have a disc that is class-specific. I would <BR>think that some of these would be good since they build on things that the class already has.<P>Some other general ideas I had were:<BR>-Be able to have all their hits land for 15 seconds.<BR>-Be able to cast through any hits<BR>-Full haste(90% or 100%) for a duration of 15 seconds<P><BR>Just having hybrids follow the same old tired pattern pre-RoK and SoV just is not cutting it<BR>when you have the feature of being able to level up to 60. That is why people are disapointed.<BR>I think we get a few interesting spells from our casting parent class, but nothing to write home<BR>about if you know what I mean. The discs that I propose would at least make hybrids welcome<BR>in the big raids somewhat more than now. <P>My 2 coppers...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's been awhile since I posted here (got tired of being ignored, I guess).  Well, Scars of Velious has been released, let's see what has changed:<P>- lots of new Warrior and Rogue weapons.  One Paladin-only weapon so far (it sucks).  The trend of rewarding pure meleers at the expense of hybrids continues...<P>- all classes but Paladins, Rangers, and Druids receive armor upgrades in Plane of Growth.  More hybrid abuse here, clearly.<P>- new Paladin spells useless except for the level 60 spell that FINALLY (thanks Verant, though it's too little too late) gives us a buff that clerics don't have.  200hp at level 60 is rather pathetic, unfortunately.<P>- Paladin's best spell, Divine Might, is rendered obsolete by the Enchanter werewolf spell (which doesn't stack with DM).  Add to this the fact that our quest spell is now inferior to standard spells given to Rangers and SK in SoV, and the situation for Paladins looks quite bleak.<P>- Paladin/SK new disciplines are useless 99% of the time.  I'd trade them all in for just getting critical hits (as warriors, though not as effective of course because of lower skill caps, inferior weapons, etc) all the time, or AT LEAST vs undead all the time.  Thanks for, basically, nothing, Verant.  Of course, when viewed in comparison to Rangers receiving a defensive skill, it makes Pal/SK disciplines look even worse.<P>So much for hybrids being very pleased with the expansion, as Absor promised.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Discs ummm what can i say.... USELESS <BR>Holyforge umm well did anyone find a highlv dungeon with undead or a undead boss mob? i know 2 Boss mobs and Hate could be a place to use it but hey who is still hunting in hate at 60.<P>Not me that i know<P>3. New spells umm the 39 spells in nice at lower lvl and it stacks with every regen spell but at highlvl encounter 12 hp per tick dont cut it at all.<BR>Lvl 50 spell ... decent again but to tell the truth a nuking Paladin ???? Fire??? from which parent class did we get this? aah mage is another parent class now i know why we pay this insane exp penalty  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Lvl 55 spell woaaa a group heal for only 450 mana .... who needs that at 55? every blue mob at 55 hits for 120 and more well this heal couldnt help for 1!!!! round anyway nice try there <BR>Lvl 60 here verant had a good idea but really what are 200 hp ?<P>4. LoH <BR>I am a Dwarf pally and fully buffed i break the 4200 hp mark so LoH gives me about 2 bubs hp back could this safe me aye it could but not with mobs hitting for 250 and more. (btw even the Captain Belvous&lt;sp&gt; in Kael hits for that much)<P>5. Weapons hmm i am not going into this but we all know nothing changed for us still not 1 decent Paladin weapon in SoV. No i dont mean weapons that other classes can use too i am talking about Pal only.<P><BR>in my opinion Hybrids(Paladin) are dying in the Highlvl game even faster now. <P>I am one of those <P>Urgas Ironfeet<BR>retired  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hybrids are iffy. if I want to make exp so fast my head spins the group I look for is warrior, rogue, cleric, enchanter, me (ranger) and if possible another rogue or monk. Why? rogues do more damage then god and they can tank pretty well. warriors do great damage and my god they can take an amazing beating. Me.. cause I like myself and hate leaving myself out. No actually, rangers are worth having for our lvl 12 spell... snare. we have the best anti runner spell and since snare is UBER taunt we are the best equiped to take being beaten cause we snared.  It seems to me that it is pathetic that my main roll in a group is snare/sow/chloro and to park when needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another round of changes by Verant, and still we are lacking.<P>I don't care how long my holyforge discipline lasts...I need a defensive discipline like all pure melee and Rangers have.<P>Resist Disease is a complete joke.  It's almost as if Verant went out of it's way to find a spell that would be worthless to high-level Paladins.<P>Great, Lay on Hands will heal an extra 160hp for me now.  It is still thousands short of being a Complete Heal.  And getting one every 72 minutes at level 60 is hardly a class-defining ability.<P>/sigh Verant</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000270-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000270.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000270-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000270-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000270&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000270&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
