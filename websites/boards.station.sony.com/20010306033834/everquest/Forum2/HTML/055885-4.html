</FONT><HR>I think that level 20 Velocity type spell on the test server was a great idea.  <P>On the escape issue, the only reason I can think of not giving magicians root is... I CAN'T! Why don't we have root?! Clerics, Paladins, Necros, Wizzards, Shamans, and Enchanters get root.  Druids and Rngers get snare.  Even Brds get a form of snare.  Rogues have snare posins.  Shadow Knights get the necro snare/dot series.  All that's left are, Monks, Warrriors, and ....Magicians.  Are we the dunces of the casting world or something?  You'll be running across those seeminly endless plains of Karanas, and be completely defenceless because of some unknown reason, being the master's of conjuration, able to pull rabbits out of our hats whenever you want to, being a Mage, you can't <BR>cast a spell that your pet can!<P>Just thought of this<BR>Summon Throwing Rabbit<BR>summons a stack of 20 no rent throwing rabbits</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Teram: yeah you can nuke it out against green mobs, I do it sometimes myself.  That didn't work when I was under level 30 though.  Well, maybe once in a great while.  Usually I'd get interruted reapeatedly until I died.  Hell, at 40 I stood toe to toe with blue mobs and nuked them to death (usually in dungeons when my pet is busy keeping something else off me.)<P>What I'd like is another option is all.  I don't think we really NEED it, it would be fun to have.  You make yourself sound high and mighty with your flame of those asking for root and snare.  It was not necesary, I'm 90% sure that the dev. team knows not to give magicians access to snare or root or mez or fear or shadowstep.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let us get down to buisness-<BR>First- giving all our summons to class specific armor was a major slap in the face. Why not give our PoG and such armor lvl 50+ wizie dds? Why becasue they would complain, same thing here, why would a rogue need summoned throwin daggers when they could goto tower of frozen sahdow (like 5th lvl) and get a dagger that does that for htem easy.<P>second- More pet commands.. such as pet ignore all targets. pet back off (and staff off) pet no aggro..<P>third- Our pets arnt efficient tanks in a group. The mobs are to smart, and they know that killin a PC is better then killing a Pet. Why is this?<P>fourth- give us some new summon weapons that are pet only that proc dd's such as the old SoR did. Might wanna look into more items like Muzzle of Mardu but wit AC or Regen components<P>fifth- do not change the spells to evocation. I have alrdy mastered my specialize evocation and it took me 36 lvls. <P>sixth- The problem with the FA is not how difficult it is, its yur opinion on difficulty. Our fa is really very simple. Thast the problem. there is NO difficulty in camping GREEN mobs in a GREEN zone.. Its also very hard to get guild membesr to wanan camp green mobs ther too. Other FA's are more succesful becasue their drops are off HARD mobs in HARD dungeons. Being able to camp quillimane in SK for a week straight isnt showin skill. I would also move our earth staff to an equally difficult mob in PoH, but not have it be a rare drop(look into this for cazy skin with wizards too)<P>seventh- I always wondered why we didnt get a pet heal post 20. the lvl 20 pet heal costs 100 mana and barely moves the pets HP 50+. Recasting a pet only takes 200 mana and wit PoG items u can rebuff him for free. <P>Lenaldo<BR>Seekers<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Below level 30, I didn't bother trying to nuke mobs -- I just RAN AWAY.  The vast majority of the mobs couldn't keep up with me if I was running and jumping!  And if I had SoW, forget about it.  Only thing that ever caught up to me was a Shadowed Man, and we know how fast they are (in case you don't, the only thing in the game faster than a Shadowed Man is a high level bard playing Selo's Accelerando with a Selo's Drum of the March).<P>Sorry if it seemed flamey, Goladus, but I've been hearing the same drivel about "Mages *NEED* root/snare" for months now, and seeing it yet again annoyed me.<P>It would be "fun" to have?  How do you mean?  An escape spell would be functional to have, not *fun*.  Voice Graft would be fun.  Root would be an actual powerful combat tool.<P>The upshot of all this is, mages do not need any more ability to escape than we already have.  We *especially* do not need either root or snare.<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know from experience, but I think the difference between PC and pets is this:<P>-PC's generally have a much higher magic resistance.  ( I think )<P>-If a PC is feared, agroed, and killed, the mobs that killed him stay where they are when he dies.  When the mob kills a pet, the owner is placed on the agro list.<P>-Pet's are generally much lower level.  If any mobs are green to the average PC they may still agro the pet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>An issuse that effects magicians, wizards, necromancers and druids more than other classes is also the fact that all spell balancing was done based on equipment that was out before the release of kunark. Since the release of kunark, melees have gone from useing a "top of the line" weapon that was 7damage 21 delay to weapons that are 9damage 19delay and easier to get haste items while the casters are still useing the same spells. Past 50th spells are only minor upgrades to the pre 50th spells, while the hybrids get major upgrades to thier spells and all melees have major damage and armor upgrades. Melees are also givin increased versitility as they get armor that casts spells for them to the point in Velious with monks getting to cast a level 55 magician spell.<P><BR>Weapons that were considered good at lower levels before Kunark are now considered crap. Now velious is making things even worse, as more weapons and armors are poping up for melees and older armors that were very good for thier time are now obtainable by lowbies for a small price. The net effect is all melees are becoming more powerful with all the new toys entering the game while casters all remain the same.<P>With magicians, necros and wizards lack of use other than damage, they becomes very undesierable in groups. Why would you bring someone that has to almost chain nuke to keep up with melee damage and create extra downtime for the group, instead of just grabing that twink rogue overthere.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[Mage Epic:]<BR>Keep it really rare, but change the items to all fall off of ultra rare outdoor mobs. It should be nearly impossible to get. Why? Because it makes the other Mage pet spells obsolete. This should be something you get at level 60.<P>BUT!<P>Add a new Mage Epic quest for a staff that gives some nice stats, and a sizeable focus effect for all pets. It would be nice if it proc'ed a spell too, but nothing too unbalancing. And please, please make this quest doable by any Mage of the appropriate level. It should be about as difficult as the rogue epic, and not involve any rare drops off of gods or dragons.<P><BR>[Item Summoning Spells:]<BR>1. More proc'ing weapons would be nice.<P>2. Add Summon Lockpicks and Summon Drum.<P>3. Summon Shield of the Planes. This would be a Planes-only shield that gives great AC and resistance bonuses. If possible, make the shield poof when you leave the plane.<P>4. Summon Doppleganger. Summons a copy of yourself that runs when struck and is unattached to anyone aggro-wise.<P><BR>[Escape Pet:]<BR>I liked that idea. A fast casting weak decoy pet could come in handly and would be appropriate for the class.<P>Alternatively, add a spell like Summon Doppleganger, described above.<P><BR>[Suicide Pets:]<BR>There should be a level 44 suicide pet, and these types of pets should be enhanced to be usable in situations that normally excude pets. A low mana, no component, one battle pet that won't wander off is the way to go. It should be immune to fear and die if it gets too far from the caster. Also, creatures that aggro on the pet should not aggro on the caster if it dies.<P>One way to make these types of pets safer is to have them automatically die after a certain time (they could automatically have the old burnout effect where their health degenerates) and also add a sort of dead person switch. The pets could suicide if they are not constantly told not to by the mage. Maybe it the mage doesn't tell it to attack something every 10 seconds, it kills itself.<P>[Reverse Rod of Modulation:]<BR>How about a summoned item that converts mana into health? These could be usefull for hybrids   in big battles and enhance their effectiveness. Maybe it could have a couple of charges.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why not? for example, everytime I cast ageis of ro for my group I have to wasted another spell slot if I want to damage shield my own pet. Same thing goes to the cleric's group buffs, enchanter's group resist magic and so on, I hate to ask the cleric/enchanter to cast another spell and waste mana cuz my pet couldn't share the group spell.  I don't see what so unbalance to let our pet share the group spells/bard song.  <P>#3 <P>Increase drop rate for Staff of elemental mastery earth or move it to another mob in Hate.<P>#4<P>New pet graphics for higher level pets, I like the idea but please don't give us monster graphics that are already in game, our pets are ELEMENTALS! improve the current pet graphic like adding legs/head/tail/wings whatever, come on be creative!<P>#5<P>Increase our pet's attack rating a bit, right now my pets miss alot against uber mob, mage is nothing but offense power, if our DDs are resisted 80% of the time vs. dragons/gods, then make our pet hit more. <P>These are what I can think of right now, will post more later.<P><BR>Yuzz<BR>Level 60 Arch Mage <BR>Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for this post Absor first of all <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I agree with most of the points you brought up, but I would like to point out a few things that are 'too good' with magicians IMHO:<P>The 51+ pets are balanced I feel, but the 49 pets are absolutely overpowered.  The reason why the 50+ pets are such a little step up from the 49 ones is because the 49 pets are really overpowered, nerf them a bit and boost the 50+ a little bit.<P>The new DoT spells that magician got with velious would be a great addition to the class if they were more mana efficient than our DD spells at that level.  What is the use of a DoT if it does less damage and is less efficient than the DD's we have available at that level?<P>Pets & XP.  Magicians take an experience hit when soloing if the pet does more than 50% of the damage to a mob, this is a proven fact.  What Abashi said about pets taking at most 1% of experience in grouping situations is bollocks, because if a pet does more than 50% of the damage to a mob, the pet will take half of the experience, and the other half will be split among the group.  Could you please remove the pet taking experience both solo and in groups?<P>A pet /no attack command would be great, and a nifty spell would be elemental form (we turn into one of our pets, or we gain control of one) not sure how pratical this is, but it would be really cool.<P>More/better summons would be also nice <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Mearis<BR>52 Magician, Gankos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I agree that you are on the right track with it, but it needs to cast 34-44 spells in the least to keep up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Javafiend<P>Shamans have pets and have root, Echanters have pets and have root, Necro's have the second best pets and have root.  I could see not giving us root because you want to force magicians to use our pets. Necros, Shamans, and Enchanters can play without their pets.  I don't think that's the case with magicians.  I think Verant wanted to force magicians to be reliant on pets.  If you had root would you stop using your pet?  We probably have the 3rd best nukes.  Our mana efficiency is much less then that of a wizzard.  Why would you play without your pet. You might as well just play a wizzard then.  Its much better to move yourself to the top of the hate list of the mob by over nuking then using Jboots to run from the mob while you pet whitles it away.  Root wouldn't really help you in a fight, its why I hate the earth pet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>New weapons summonings are a total waste of time. They are utterly useless once you reach 34th level, your pet dual wields naturally then. ANY and ALL weapon summonings should have been granted by 24th at least in my opinion, probably much earlier since weapons add no additional damage beyond level 24. <P>The 'fun' summonings come way too late in the game. While other classes get their 'uber spells' (i.e. clarity 2, lure series, uber-mega heals), we summon beer and fireworks, I have issues with that. Give us 'improved bandages'(additional healing), Rings of Flight with more charges, a Journeyman's Staff (with single/multi use Jboots effect), or a no drop multicharge mod rod (this will NOT be unbalancing, we cannot snare or root (only casting class that CAN'T), and the pace we set is based on pet health, not how much mana we have).<P>Debuff spells aren't mage material to be honest, they're the stuff of enchanters and shaman, not mages. I would gladly give them up for the enchanter illusion:elemental spells with a slight upgrade. Elementals are mage territory, buffs/debuffs are enchanter. Same thing goes for Monster Summoning, not mage material, it's cute, but not us.<P>Group damage shields come too late in the game, no reason why we couldn't recieve a group shield one spell level after you recieve the single target version. Druid damage shields are nearly comparable with ours, which is unacceptable.<P>We desperately need a way to heal our pets, whether it be a pet only regen spell, or perhaps a Restore Voceration type spell.<P>Magician research is a cruel joke. We by far have the HARDEST time getting our spells, especially once you reach 44th and 49th. If you don't make runs to the planes, you will NOT have all your 49th pets, words of Bondage and the appropriate components are so damn rare it's unreal. For example, for the 49th water pet, you must reseach a copy for level 34, 39, 44, and then....MAYBE...you'll get a 49th water pet, assuming you don't fail any of the above steps and have to START over again. The 49th water pet is an 'epic' unto itself.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was in S Ro the other night looking for the Ancient Cyclops and Sand Giants.  I found the AC as it was killed by a druid of much higher level.  In conversing with the Druid I find that the AC is immune to Fire based spells.  HMMMMMMM big problem at level 39 where the only damage spells that a mage has from both 34 and 39 are fire based.  We are the masters of elements.  What about water, earth and air based damage AoE and DD spells?  It would be nice to have say for instance rain of boulders (earth based) or shock of water as a damage spell at around this level.  I have no way of affecting a battle with an AC that is a blue con because all of my spells at this time are fire based.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Magician Balancing<P>Fist off, prefacing my post with the title "Magician Balancing" will most likely do nothing for my cause.  I will use it, though, to promote continuity.  A few issues with Magicians that may correct some problems.<P>1) Magician Pets (Post lvl 50) <BR>   Would coolio graphics be cool?  indeed.  Making an elemental look anything like a pc, however, would not solve the "problem".  I was in PoA last night and made an air pet &lt;-- Happy Mage!<BR>I think that the graphics for post 50 pets should be that of the "genie" that is desplayed when making an air pet in PoA. (I.E. White clothed genie= AIR, Brown Clothed=Earth, Blue Clothed=Water, Red Clothed=fire).  This lends nothing to balancing, but it does allow for mages to feel cool and noticed, which will help you to make us stop our collective bemoaning of the class.<P>2) Conjuration DD Spells<BR>   Magicians are the masters of Conjuration.  We rely most heavily, however, on Evocation based spells for direct damage.  2 ways to correct this-reduce the casting time on the "shock" series of spells to a number comparable to their Evocation counterparts -or- increase their damage to make their damage output worth the cast time (i.e. almost 7 second cast time on shock of swords for 600 DD compared to 4.5 seconds for Char for up to 702 DD.) Agreed that we can just as easily use evocation, but as the masters of summoning, it would be nice to have our summoned DD spells pop a little faster.<P>3) New Procing Weapons<BR>   Make a series of ""elemental Blades, daggers, staves, i.e. blade of fire, staff of earth, dagger of water, laredo of air, that allow a proc with similar effects of that level's pet. Earth = Root with small DD, Water = Ice strike, Air = Stun, Fire = Evoc based DD.  Making the new proccing weapons in this manner stays within our range as the "Masters of Conjuration"  Another idea, make the weapons level based in the same manner as our pets.  i.e summoning a 49th lvl Laredo of Air allows for the "stun" proccing effect.  Give a 10% chance that sword will be able to effect lvl 49+, 20% chance of effecting 40-49, and 70% chance of effecting 40 and below.  The inability to /c a weapon will allow for some semblance of balance. Obviously only one "elemental weapon" should be introduced per spell level, and to keep it in further balance, make the weapons tied to a quest of some sort (above lvl 44)<P>4)"Rain" Spells<BR>   More of a question than a suggestion... why are the Blade Rain spells tied to Evocation?  Shouldn't they be tied to Conjuration (to keep continuity with the other "blade" spells)<P>5) Mage DOT Spells<BR>   I agree with giving Mages DOT spells, even though I do not have any with my character yet.  I would love to see the damage increased a bit to make the spell worth while to use.  The only balancing issue involved with that is the increased aggro from the target MOB.  Mages will have to decide if it's worth it to use the DOT for damage versus the MOB being really ticked and frenzying on the caster.<P>6) Mage porting<BR>   I would never advocate mages being allowed to port groups, but we are the "Masters of Conjuration"  Would the idea of allowing mages to summon no-drop, right clickable stones that allow for the mage to teleport himself to basic points around the world (i.e. the basic port points that the "porting" classes get in lvls 20 and 24 (wizards)) The port "stones" (or spell, if its more appropriate) would not be introduced till lvl 44 or so and would be, again, self only.<P>There are a ton of issues that could be addressed, but these are the ones that I find myself saying "would be nice to have" every night when Kobober (and I) are fighting (insert mob's name here).  Thanks for the ear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK here's the closing argument for Alan until he responds.<P>You posted that the AE efficiency of Rain Spells would be unacceptible if they worked properly and the way GZ apparently thought they should (and the way Verant believed they did until shown otherwise).<P>The example given was this (Lightning Storm is a level 24 spell, by the way, you should be using  Frost Shock instead of Inferno Shock, that is level 24, but level 24 works out very well in this argument for other reasons):<P>"Level 29 best blast Inferno Shock (110 mana) <BR>Level 29 Rain Spell Lightning Storm (162 mana)<BR>Blast = 1.85 damage per 1 mana <BR>OLD Rain = 1.77 damage per 1 mana<BR>NEW Rain = 5.31 damage per 1 mana."<P>However, that isn't entirely accurate.  The most you can hope to get the rain spell to hit is four waves total, not three.  Against a maximum of four targets, the most you will ever see is one wave hitting each, for 4 total waves.<P>In other words, the total maximum power against a full group of targets with the AE Rain listed here is this instead (75x4=300 damage max): 2.19 damage per 1 mana.<P>Now, we examined the PBAE spell Cast Force at this level already against its maximum understood number of targets (it might hit as many as 12): 9.181 damage per 1 mana<P>But there is another AE spell that level, Column of Lightning.  Column of Lightning hits 4 targets maximum, costing 130 mana and doing 136 damage.  In other words, it has this efficiency: 4.19 damage per 1 point of mana.<P>Now, lets look at your example one more time.<P>LIghtning Storm, if properly designed to hit up to 4 targets with up to 3 waves of effect would have a maximum efficiency of this: 5.31 damage per 1 mana.<P>You said this was unacceptible, yet PBAE eclipses this, and the Pillar spell comes very close.<P>Pillar spells are instant, not 3 waves of effect, thus cannot be resisted separately and does not take 12 seconds to take effect.<P>If AE rain spells are left  unchanged, their efficiency is less than HALF that of Pillars, and has more limitations and disadvantages.<P>Does this make more sense now?  The spell line, if left as is, is not only a terrible spell against a single target in terms of resistances and efficiency, bit it is EVEN WORSE as an Area Effect spell.<P>Please please respond to this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My issues with the magician class, some will probably repeat though I will try to give my perspective on some missed aspects of the repeats:<P>The level 52 fire pet had its *only* use nerfed away.  This is two issues in one.  A) we're the only caster that has no form of mana regen (we're allowed to count necros as mana regen for clerics, right?), and B) why will I ever summon this pet?  If it rooted itself and then did pure DD casting, sure, it could be useful sometimes.  I don't want the stupid pet meleeing.  That's guaranteed to get it killed, probably me killed, and the only thing that won't get killed is the one thing that was supposed to.<P>Casting times need improved on some spells.  The ones that come to mind are the 57 shock, the DoTs, and Rage of Zomm.<P>I am cutting and pasting this next part, yet again, because I really feel it is the crux of the magician class.  Our reputation (earned) up to 50 was as a purely offensive class, number one damage dealer, with some severe drawbacks to balance that power.<P>"A pet summoned by a level 60 magician should always be able to make a respectable showing next to a level 55 warrior. They don't. If this isn't fixed to put us back at the top of the damage output list, then our role needs to be adjusted away from that of high damage output only.<P>If we are no longer #1 (or even #2 or #3) in damage output, but we have nothing else to offer (#1 offers feign pulling, #2 offers picklocks and corpse retrieval), then something needs added to give us some defensive power (since magicians have basically no defensive abilities at all)."<P>I want a summoned item with infinite charges of voice graft.  It's not a balance issue.  It's a fun issue.  Another useful spell to add to a summon is bind sight.  That way we could at least enjoy watching that massive train forming when our pet jumps to the other side of a dungeon.<P>Spell drops are insane, and not only for magicians, but our dropped spells are often our most important spells.  55+ spells (54+ for magicians, go figure) drop in three places.  Total.  And not off just any mobs in those three places either, you have to go to specific spots and/or fight specific mobs.  Ridiculous.  Spells that I do not have at 55, that I have never even SEEN offered even at a price I couldn't dream of affording, are: Vocerate: Water, Muzzle of Mardu, Velocity, Bandoleer of Luclin (WHY?!?), Greater Vocerate: Air, and Rage of Zomm (I'm not counting Velious spells as they deserve more time, but Kunark has been out nearly a year now and I've still not had a single opportunity of getting the above spells).  I think Call of the Hero might fall into this category as well, but even it seems more common than the spells listed.<P>The eye spells need to last longer.  Their usefulness is already suspect due to not being able to use them with a pet.<P>What is the title of a 55 magician?  Conjurer.  What should a 55 magician be specialized in?  That's right, we are not "Evokers."<P>Rain spells need more work besides removing the pet from the targets (that's a start, but won't make me mem one).  Either they need the maxed targets upped (make it 6 rather than 4 and I might see it actually hit for 3 waves, something I've never seen in 55 levels), or they need the mana cost/casting time reduced to make them more appealing in spite of the increased risk factor of using a rain.<P>Pathing.<P>Oh jeez, pathing.<P>This was, I thought, the trade off for being the number one damage dealer (along with having no "tricks" to escape with).  Since we're no longer number one, this needs fixed as it's a penalty with no balancing "plus."<P>Sol A.  You cannot take a pet from the entrance past the first room of this dungeon.  Try it.  There are multiple spots where if you get a little bit ahead of your pet he will teleport to... well, I'm not quite sure where he teleports to, but it's no longer next to me.<P>Sebilis.  Mob gets pushed through a wall (also a problem), pet can teleport to mob, but is then stuck and for some reason can't teleport back to me (if he finishes the fight, if he dies it's a whole 'nother problem).<P>Lake of Ill Omen.  Summon a pet outside the sarnak fort and head to the Chancellor of Di'Zok's room.  Where's your pet?  I don't know either.  Summon a pet inside the Chancellor's room and head out of the fort.  Where's your pet?  He'll meet you outside, running back from somewhere outside the front gates.<P>Hate.  Ummm...  Just summon a pet in Hate and watch its antics.  There is no way to list all the pathing problems in Hate and still have this post fit on one page.<P>Honestly, I feel there are far FAR too many spots with pathing problems for you to even come close to fixing a small percentage of them.  It is so second nature to me to walk certain paths, get rid of pets in certain places, and yes, "exploit" the pathing in certain places that I don't even realize I'm doing it anymore.  Anyone play the ping pong game with the Shin Lord in Upper Guk?<P>And last, summons.  Summons will only be useful if they are useful.  Hard to believe, eh?  Your average level 40+ *anything* has no use for 99% of our summoned items.  Our current summons with spell effects need to have the number of charges made infinite or at least increased drastically.  The stuff is no-rent, there is no abuse here.  Any future summons need to be appropriately powered.  A breeze-stone, bind-stone, gate-stone (20 second cast time is fine), voice graft-stone, bind sight-stone, etc.  These would be useful and/or fun.<P>Yili En'Dream<BR>55 Magician<BR>Dragonflyers<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a repost from the mage summoned-items thread. I leave it intact in it's entirety because of its general comment on class balance, and suggested fixes.<P>Well, I am not sure how thorough other people have been, after all, after about a dozen 1/2-full page posts detailed the class I play, I kinda tuned it out. After reading it all though, I decided to do the one thing that seems to be the most important thing to me, and to a lot of magicians out there. That is to evaluate our summon spells, the non-pet spells at least, since it overall looks like most of the players are content, or at least willing to deal with our other line of spells.<BR>Warning: This will be a long post as I will evaluate -every- summon spell we get at every level, as well as make a few conclusions, and suggestions.<P>Level 1:<P>Summon Dagger<BR>Mana: 10<BR>Casting Time : 5 sec<BR>Recast: 6 sec<BR>Effect: Summons a 3/21 magic dagger, wt 3.5<BR>Comments: The first, and basic summoned weapon. 1 pt of delay better then the newbie dagger, and magic as well. The perfect newbie weapon to get us through those first 4 hardest levels without a pet.<BR>Suggestions: None, leave it alone.<P>Summon Food/Water<BR>Mana: 10<BR>Cast: 4 sec<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons either one black bread, or one globe of water, depending on which spell you use. Basic food source, but free. Weight slightly more then rations.<BR>Comments: Free food, what more can you ask for?<P>Level 4<P>Summon Bandages<BR>Mana: 15<BR>Cast: 6 sec<BR>Recast: 6 sec<BR>Effect: Summons a stack of bandages, 1 bandage per 2 levels. Peaks out at 20 at level 40. Usefull for soloing mages who still melee a bit.<BR>Comments: Only complaint is the recast time is a tad long, takes a long time to build a full stack or few stacks. Otherwise damn good.<P>Summon Wisp<BR>Mana: 30<BR>Cast: 5<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a Wisp. A lightsource equal to a lightstone or torch, held in either hand. Can also be given to pet, which causes it to glow. The first real 'visual' assist for non-thermo seeing races.<BR>Comments: None, works perfectly fine for its purpose.<P>Level 8<P>Dimensional Pocket<BR>Mana: 40<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a 4 slot pouch, which eliminates the weight of anything placed in it, and can fit any sized item.<BR>Comments: Great for most weight limited casters, (which they all seem to be) but suffers from the same problem all dimensional bags do, vaping on linkdeath and destroying anything inside it. See Comments at the end of the post for possible solutions.<P>Staff of Tracing<BR>Mana: 20<BR>Cast: 2.25<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons a 7/40 7.5wt 2 hand blunt which is magic.<BR>Comments: Besides being woefully slow for its damage, this weapon is good for practicing 2hb skill for mages. Otherwise this weapon has no purpose, esp. with recent bug corrections as relates to our pets.<P>Level 12<P>Summon Fang<BR>Mana: 40<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a magical 5/26 dagger.<BR>Comments: Once again, a summoned weapon with absolutely horrible damage/delay ratio of more then 1/5. Only redeeming value is it's ability to hit magical creatures. Most mages that still melee won't even touch this weapon, making it useless.<P>Level 16<P>Staff of Warding<BR>Mana: 40<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons an 8/38 2hb with 5 charges of gaze.<BR>Comments: This is our first in our line of items that we use to cast spells other classes get. 5 charges of gaze is a novelty, but rarely used, and the damage/delay on the weapon is so bad it never gets used in melee. Would be a pet weapon, but pets were fixed, and no longer need them.<P>Summon Heatstone<BR>Mana: 40<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons an item, ac 4 with infravision, fits in ranged or neck slot.<BR>Comment: Absolutely perfect, first of our high demand items for all those night blind hummies out there. Also good for CR where you can put a little ac in any slot you can get.<P>Summon Throwing Daggers<BR>Mana: 20<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons a full stack of 6/25 range 55 throwing daggers.<BR>Comments: Neither good, nor bad, though I think these cannot hit magical critters. If not, they should. Rogues -rarely- request these to practice throwing, as well as casters.<P>Level 20<P>Spear of Warding<BR>Mana: 60<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a Spear 6/27 +5cr +5hr. 50range Primary or ranged slot only.<BR>Comments: Only usable by classes that can use spears, this weapon is -never- used for melee. At level 20 a damage delay of more then 1/4 is just unusuable. Occaisionally used to place in ranged slot for resist bonus, otherwise no demand.<P>Summon Arrows<BR>Mana: 30<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a stack of 20 damage 3 range 75 magic arrows.<BR>Comments: Proving our usefullness to groups, this item is in demand by pullers all the time. It has decent range, and the fact that it can hit magic critters definately increases its usefullness. No real change needed here.<P>Summon Waterstone<BR>Mana: 40<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons a non-stackable item which expends in one charge of enduring breath.<BR>Comments: Another group friendly item, lets you pass them to other group members so they can use them when they need them. Lack of stacking makes it rather cumbersome though. Making them stackable would increase its convienience w/out unbalancing them too much.<P>Level 24<P>Cornocopia/Everfount<BR>Mana: 25<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons 20 food or water, depending on spell.<BR>Comments: Cuts down on downtime a -lot- due to not having to summon full stacks of food/water one at a time. Reasearch words not found on mobs until roughly 24th level. Increasing the drop rate on all mage's research items would greatly improve their frequency of use.<P>Staff of Runes<BR>Mana: 60<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a magic2hb 9/36, with one charge of cancel magic.<BR>Comments: This weapon is -never- summoned commonly. It's awefull combat stats, and only 1 charge of cancel magic make this one of the least seen summons in the mage's inventory. Increase the number of the charges on the staff, and it would see more use.<P>Level 29<P>Summon Coldstone<BR>Mana: 75<BR>Cast: 10<BR>Recast: 10<BR>Effect: Summons a necklace with ultravision, and ac4, fits in neck or ranged slot.<BR>Comments: A -great- spell. I'm always getting begged for these by hummies, and no one refuses them. As a gnome, I definatley use it as an upgrade to my own infravision.<P>Sword Of Runes<BR>Mana: 75<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a 7/27 magic 1hs with effect ward summon. A 50pt dd against summoned creatures.<BR>Comments: Once again, bad damage/delay kills what could be a usefull item. Only used now to give to pets when fighting summoned creatures. With the rarity of those creatures, limited usefullness.<P>Level 34<P>Dimensional Hole<BR>Mana: 120<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a 6slot weightless bag.<BR>Comments: Same as dimensional pouch.<P>Staff of Symbols<BR>Mana: 80<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a 10/34 magic 2hb with 4 charges of see invis.<BR>Comments: This item used to see moderate use, to allow tanks to cast see invis on themselves, but never used in combat. Now that items are showing up that cast see-invis on their own, this spell sees less and less use.<P>Summon Shard of the Core<BR>Mana: 50<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a no-drop ranged slot only item that gives +15 pr and +15cr, as well as ultravision.<BR>Comments: On a pvp server, this spell sees some use when going into pvp situations, esp. against necros or shammies. Otherwise useless as most mages have a ranged slot item of better value. Allow it to be placed in the ammo slot, and/or remove the no-drop flag.<P>Level 39<P>Dagger of Symbols<BR>Mana: 100<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons a 5/20 magic dagger with +5mr +5 pr and +5dr.<BR>Comments: This is a great little item to build resists for pvping, one each of these in my ranged slot in and primary hand, and I'm gtg. If it could be confirmed, or denied whether stat bonuses on items work on pets, might make it as a pet weapon to help prevent it getting feared/rooted, etc.<P>Ring of Flight<BR>Mana: 100<BR>Cast: 6<BR>Recast: 6<BR>Effect: Summons an ac 4 ring with 2 charges of levitate.<BR>Comments: A great item, though it seems to come a little late compared to when other classes get levitate. The spell seems to wear off too quickly, perhaps either lenghten its duration, or increase the number of charges on the item.<P>Level 44<BR>Modulating Rod<BR>Mana: 200<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons an expendable 1hb 8/26, one use of 225 health to 150 mana.<BR>Comments: The only time this item sees any real use is during CR to feed clerics mana as fast as possible. The health to mana ratio seems a bit off to make this truely usefull as a last ditch mana dump, esp. considering how large a chunk of life that is for most casters. At level 55 I still only have 1100 hp.<P>Level 51<P>Gift of Xev<BR>Mana: 40<BR>Cast: 4 sec<BR>REcast: instant<BR>Effect: Summons 1 10 slot weightless backpack, 1 stack each of food/water/bandages.<BR>Comments: Yet another downtime reducer, this spell summons everything most mages summon when they first log on. Adding the 10 slot backpack just makes it better, allowing us massive storage, though with the same problem as the other dimensional containers.<P>Level 52<P>Bristlebane's Bundle<BR>Mana: 50<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: instant<BR>Effect: Summons 20ale/cake, 1 firework (blue) and 1 'spin the bottle' (effect: whirl to you hurl on self)<BR>Comments: The ultimate party pouch, I get many hours of amusement from wandering through fv distributing these to people hanging out, makes me a very popular gnome. Cake is actually food though, not consumable, some sort of effect attached to that would be appreciated. Also, this spell takes up a post 50 spell slot with what many consider to be useless effects. Personally, I enjoy the fun, but also agree something slightly more combat oriented or support oriented might be nice. Maybe something that summons a ring of flight, a waterstone, and a modulation rod, all in one cast.<P>Level 53<P>Quiver of Marr<BR>Mana: 60<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons a 6 slot quiver and 60 damage 3 range 75 magic arrows.<BR>Comments: The logical upgrade to our puller support spell summon arrows. This spell sees reasonable use, and adds to our support capability. No real changes needed here, though perhaps filling the quiver per cast might be in order, at a higher casting cost.<P>Level 54<P>Bandoleer of Lucin<BR>Mana: 60<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons a 6 slot pouch, and 60 10/33 range 75 magic throwing knifes.<BR>Comments: The few people I know who still use their throwing skill -love- this spell. However, that number of people is rather small, as a result, this spell sees limited, uncommon use.<P>Level 55<P>Pouch Of Quellius<BR>Mana: 60<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: Summons a 4 slot pouch, and 60 shuriken 7/23 range 100, with +4 dex and agi. Rogue/monk only.<BR>Comments: I haven't even -seen- this spell. Like all mage spells above 54, these seem unbelievably rare. From comments from rogues and monks, this would see limited, uncommon use as well, but mostly would be used just for the minor stat boost it provides.<P>Level 56<P>Muzzle of Mardu<BR>Mana: 100<BR>Cast: 4<BR>Recast: instant<BR>Effect: Summons a face slot item with haste, currently estimated at approx 10-15%, usable on the pet.<BR>Comments: A minor pet buff item which seems to be an upgrade to burnout without actually upgrading burnout. I've heard that this might be no-drop, or unequippable for anything other then our pets. If this is true, it should be changed to allow others to use it. Esp. on a pvp server, many high levels still have no haste items, so our able to summon one would really help our party contributions.<P>Ok, that's everthing, finally. All of our summons laid out and examines. What follows is a few suggestions, and comments regarding our summons, and -only- our summons. Our other class issues are known well enough.<P>1. The horrible damage/delay on all of our weapon summons. In all cases, I have not found a single class that would use our weapons in almost any circumstance. They used to be for allowing our pets to dual weild, and increasing our pet's damage, but with the recent fixes, that seems to no longer be the case. My solution would be to scale the summoned weapons to allow them more use as actual weapons further on. The lower levels 1-16 should have a damage delay of around 1:5, this makes them for the most part, practice weapons. At the 20-39 level range, the weapons should have about a 1:3.5 or 4 damage delay. 44-54/55, let the weapons have about a 1:3 damage:delay ratio. And finally, give us some weapon summons at peak levels 55-60, which can get to a delay of 1:2.5 or even 1:2. I think using this guide, you could give weapons damage/delay that would still make them substandard at their equal level drop counterparts, but still usefull in certain circumstances.<P>2. Give us more effects on our weapons, anti-undead, or other procs would increase the desirability of our summoned items greatly, as well as give us more variety to contribute to groups for special circumstances.<P>3. Resolve the linkdeath bag-vaping problem. Possible solutions could be that bags turn into triple weight no-drop bags when linkdeath occurs, or other similar measures.<P>Those three I think are our most pressing concerns as to regards to our summoning spells. We are supposed to be the master utility class, like the swiss-army caster of the eq world, yet most of what we can summon is limited in use at best, and utterly useless at worst. Variety, as well as general improvement to some outstanding problems is the best possible solution to improve mages in EQ.<P>Finally, despite the fact that I said I was going to cover only the summoned items in this post, I also believe that I should address the major issues about our class. Seeing as this is the best place/time to do so.<P>1. Nuking:<P>Issue a; At high levels, our magic based sources of damage become few and -very- far between. At 44 we get both a 600pt magic based nuke, as well as a 600pt magic based DoT. The next overall improvement to our magic based damage capacity is at 55, when our dot goes up to 800, and our Nuke at 57, which increases in damage to 825. -Some- kind of improvement to our magic based source of damage seems desirable between those two extremes. Perhaps push back our level 55 dot, and level 57 dd, and place an intemediary set of spells between those. This would especially be helpfull against kunarkian high level mobs, which are almost completely immune to fire, especially 'dragon' based creatures. This brings up...<P>Issue B: Besides our magic based DDs, we -only- get fire based nukes. We are supposedly the masters of elements, and yet we only can cause damage with one of the four. The addition of some ice, or possibly wind like spells would greatly add to our usefullness to certain groups, as well as demonstrate the mastery we supposedly have.<P>2. Pets<P>Issue A: My only real issue with our pets comes in the late game, ie, 50+ levels, of course, this relates to the fire pet line of spells. Pre-50, our fire pets were the 'berzerkers' of the pet world. Low health, but high damage, and a strong in-built damage shield. Post 50, it was changed so that they have become wizards, completely reversing their original purpose. I could see no real problem with that, if they did more then simply switch between 3 mediocre nukes, and do relatively pathetic amounts of damage. The simplest solution to this would be, I think, to give the pet the wizards low level AE snare spell. This would give mages a reason to use this pet again, but balance it by making it much more limited in scope. There becomes fewer reasons to use the fire pet, but with much more effectiveness in those times.<P>Issue B: The rarity of our water pets. It was promised that the drop rates would increase, but I have barely seen any change. I would simply like to know why it was determined that our water pet spells should be any rarer then any of our other pet spells, since supposedly they are 'balanced.'<P>3. Pet Healing<P>Issue a: Mages recieve a pet healing at level 20, they then never recieve another healing spell for their pet again. On our level 51 pet, this spell heals approx, 7% of our pet's health. This obviously does very little to prolong our pet's life when it is in direct combat. I realize that you do not wish to promote soloing, but there are many cases where my pet is tanking for a group, esp. in corpse recovery situations where the real tanks have no gear, and the cleric is rezzing, and eternally lom. As a result, a more signifigant heal might be in order, either in 2 ways. Either make it a pet complete heal, with cost approx. to the cost of the pet, thus making you decide between saving the pet, or summoning a new one. Or make it a low efficiency spell that perhaps heals 25-30% of a pet's health. Not enough to signifigantly prolong a pet's life, but enough to give others a chance to either heal it, or take over tanking duties before the pet dies.<P>4. Epic Quest<P>Yes, I know you've heard it before, but I believe it bears repeating. I also know you plan on reevaluating the epic quests again. However, a rare drop off -Innoruuk-? Of which maybe 4-6 will see the light of day a year per server? I realize the epic quests are supposed to be completed by only a few people, as they are supposed to be challenging, but the sheer luck required in our quest seems to place it out of reach of 90% of the mage population, which is not an unmentionably small amount of the general player population either. Increasing the drop rate on this item would greatly mitigate the bad feelings most mages seem to have about the quest, esp. for what is such a desirable, as well as excellently designed reward.<P>This is all I can think of as major issues for the mage class. Overall I enjoy my class greatly, I am glad I started with it, and I have no intentions of ever deleting this char. I also believe our class is relatively balanced, emphasizing our requirement to having pets, as well as our general summoning ability. With just a few minor adjustements, which are not major balance issues, I think the mage class could become one of the most fun classes to play in EQ.<P><BR>Laranos Lostpuddle, Level 55 gnomish Magi of Tallon Zek.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, if you must skim, please read the first section most carefully.<BR> <BR>1) Pet control: <P>I would like to see either a pet-only snare and/or root spell. A slow/stopped pet is easier to control but is less flexible; the drawback of these spells is built in. In fact, I would prefer to have a pet snare spell than a pet j-boot spell, as is currently on test. The j-boot spell only really helps us solo (with a couple rare exceptions), and I'd prefer spells that improve my utility to a group.<P>Petted classes have the ability to accidently slaughter their entire group or an entire raid do to factors beyond their control (buggy pathing, especially when combined lag). Needless to say, this is the number one source of apprehension about groups accepting mages. EQ is about grouping and helping each other; it is *not fun* to know that at any moment I could be the cause of extreme suffering for all of my comrades due to little or no fault of my own.<P>I can not overemphisize this point. Pet control is the NUMBER ONE problem facing mages in GROUPS, the point of the game after all.<P>2. Monster summoning<P>The series is fun, but the utility is dubious. It is almost always "better" to just use a regular elemental summon. And if we never use the spell, we will never get to enjoy it. I suggest some combination of (preferably all three):<P>a) removing the component (so we can summon something when we are dead and trying to do a cr)<P>b) Always making them the "decoy" type, so they will represent an alternate pet type from our standard 4 consistently<P>c) reducing the casting time substantially [2 seconds] (but put in a long recast time to prevent uber chain casting pets [30 seconds]) so it can function as an escape spell or emergency pet<P>3) Summoning items:<P>I would suggest allowing us to summon items equivalent to commonly available items in the game that are awkward to lug around. Specifically, there exist pretty common itmes that proc stun [gnoll hide lariat], weaken [dagger of dropping], and velium shards [velium weapons] that have a low market price (5pp for the first two, velium weapons are often just sold to vendors for about 5pp). I suggest three spells that all require a peridot (10pp) as a component and are available at levels when one can commonly acquire the items in the game. Since these items are already in the game, and there is a component cost, I don't see this as imbalancing: just convenient and fun (as it reinforces our position as masters of summoning)<P>a) summon mystic whip, level 34, 6 28, 1hs procs stun 100 mana<BR>b) summon dagger of pain, level 29, 5 23, piercing procs weaken 100 mana<BR>c) summon flame sword, level 49, 9 25, procs our level 4 nuke, burn, 14 damage, 100 mana<P>4) Mod rod update<P>I LOVE mod rod (at least at my level 51). It gives me the powerful option of transferring mana to others (especially clerics) and increasing everyone's mana pool (how often do casters scrimp and save trying to get that extra item that results in a net increase of +30 mana or so? Give them a mod rod and their mana pool just went up 5 times that much). With specialize conjuration and clerics with superior, complete, and celestrial healing the mana transfer rate is excellent.<P>I think mod rods are the mage's compensation for not having any ability to regenerate mana faster, and I'm quite happy for this unique ability. I would love to see a lesser version of mod rod (summon mana stone, lore expendable, 1 charge canabalize, 50 mana, level 20) and a bigger version (summon purification rod, 10 24 1hb, 2 charges of modulation, lore, expendable, 400 mana to cast, level 56) The big rod does not need to be any more efficient; in my view a mage with specialize conjuration with a cleric in the party can get great efficiency transfers as it is. The super rod would just increase the speed we can transfer and the total mana pool we can increase.<P>5) Evocation versus Conjuration<P>While I personally prefer to specialize in conjuration, I think ideally both specializations should be viable. Choice, options, strategy, diversity: these are all good things. The trick is to make both options viable. I personally feel the two choices are almost balanced (pre-level 44 the "better" dd spell alternates. Post 44 one must consider the ability to easily summon mana transfering mod rods and easily chain cast pets as plusses to the conjuration side) However, the consensus still seems to be that conjuration may be slightly weaker than evocation. Adding a mod rod update post 55 would I feel bring the two spheres into balance, especially considering the rain fix.<P>6) Last, and most controversal, CoH update<P>I think EQ is a fun game because it is about  working together, building friendships and communities. One of the major obsticles to grouping is getting people together. Casual players may not have lots of time to get together. People with lives may have to leave at any moment: if your group's one healer leaves becuase of a real life emergency while you are very deep in a dungeon, well, your whole group basically has to pack up, leave the dungeon, and start over. The tower of frozen shadow represents a severe version of this problem, as it can take an hour to safely clear a path deep into the tower. The difficulty of getting a group together is one of the main reasons why soloing or remaining outdoors is often times a more "efficient" path to advancement.<P>CoH was added to help address these concerns and the addition is welcome. However, the spell is pretty high level (55) and grouping concerns are an issue throughout the game.<P>I suggest you add a heavily gimped version of CoH; I'll call it Hero's Convocation (HC) at a fairly low level, say, 34. Gimped in what way? Give the spell a silly high casting time. I mean silly. Like 30 seconds. Useless for rescuing bad pullers (Except maybe a fd'ed player) But useful for saving everyone an hour leaving a dungeon and fighting their way back in just because their cleric had to log, when all you have to do is send your leader to the entrance and call the leader in with a new healer. Make the spell have a silly high mana cost for the level. Like 500. Make the spell have a pretty exspensive component for the level, like about 10pp.<P>Yes, this spell would make mage's "more powerful." But it would also go a long way to making this a more enjoyable game for casual players, not to mention beiong appropriate for the style of the class. Make it gimped so it is useless for any other purpose, and does not tread upon the toes of normal CoH. But I think this spell would make the game more fun for everyone.<P><BR>Cydmab Promethean<BR>Level 51 Elementalist<BR>Morell Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The recap failed to mention some of the important aspects of what magicians have problems with in class balance.<P>Poor defense spells.  <BR>--------------------------<BR>No damage absorption line of spells.  Magicians like all casters can and do get meleed in multi mob situations.  A pet does not act as damage absorption in those cases.  This happens every day in all dungeons.<P>The phantom armor line is just useless the AC add is a waste on a pure caster and the regen is not even useful in soloing because its your mana regen that helps you there.  The hp regen componet was added as an appeasement but hp regen has no use in group play where a healer is available.<P>No outdoor evasion/escape<BR>--------------------------<BR>A magician does not survive encouters with anything that runs at sow speed if they happen to be far from the zone boundry.  This covers every sarnak, frogloc shaman, and raptor in kunark.  Most of which are 20-25 levels green to me.  Magicians die while any melee would just beat them down and any other caster would fear/FD/mez/root/stun/mini-tp and go on their merry way.  So please fix it so a 60th lvl magician can to evade a 35 level green sarnak.<P>Pet control<BR>-----------------<BR>Even the best magician can only midigate pet deficiences in combat.  On any pull of multiples if a magician or her pet gets hit its time to dance around your pet with "/pet back off" and hope the enchanters stun and mez goes off at the exactly right time. <P>And don't tell me about pets being powerful.  I can't even keep up with a warriors damage output even with spells included at 55+.  I can live with that, but pets need to be better behaved.  Otherwise from the class balance standpoint get another tank is a smarter choice.<P>So please, please add "/pet no attack" command.  Or How about a personal pet stun with mem blur at the end of the stun call "Heel" 1 sec cast time.<P>Unique Summons<BR>---------------------<BR>There are none.  And 5 of our 55th level spell slots are filled with summons that are better suited to a 30th level characters but in no way are fitting for a 50+ character.  <P>And the summons are considered so worthless infact there is no balance issue in handing these summons out as right clickable effects.<P>I'm still waiting for the bristolbane's bundle, gift of xev, and quiver of marr bracer myself.  I bet they are in the game already.<P>There are too many good ideas to mention in the items summoning thread please winnow the chaff Absor and dig in.<P>Finaly, Woot new spells!<BR>---------------------<BR>Our new spells partially address problems but there they are esentially flawed in exectution.<P>&gt;8) Magicians <P>&gt;a) New level 59 spell, Valiant Companion, makes pet immune to fear (own pet only) <P>Why does this spell come so very late in a magician's life?  There are plenty of monsters which cast fear before 59th level.  And I see 54+ level characters of all types slugging away at all the varrious Kunark dragons.  Plus, Resist Magic just doesn't cut it against Vox or Nagafen.<P>&gt;b) New level 39 spell, Summon Companion, if pet not noticed by any hostile npcs, pet returns to you instantly. <P>Summon Companion does help navigate bad pathing areas as it stands so thank you for that.<P>Casting time of 5 sec much too long.  Even if you notice your pet went awol immidately 5 sec allows a pet to get very far way and get into lots of trouble.  And if this is suppose to be an escape/evasion spell might as well cast gate in 5 sec.<P>And Summon Companion totally does not help with the situation magicians wanted the spell for to begin with.  To help with a pet has gone missing and gotten into a fight.  I can happen in a number of ways, gating mobs, casing a fleeing mob, bad pathing, warping to a safe piont ...  <P>Have this spell clear agro agro like CoH (for both the magician and pet).<P>&gt;c) Rain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities they can damage (all rain spells) <BR>Rains are weird for an AE in that it's just more useful to cast vs a single target rather than a group of them.  Why not just have rains behave like a column/pillar spells (still 4 target max) that hits the same area 3 times?<P>&gt;d) Expedience for Mages at level 29. Target casters pet, J Boot speed buff for pet only<P>Well this would solve not having a guardian pet to accompany you while crossing zones.  Woops!! Too bad it's only a 20% foot speed increase and jboots is a 35% foot speed increase.  Explain to me again how a pet is suppose to follow you when it can't keep up with you in Jboots?<P>On soloing<BR>-------------------<BR>Magicians do not solo past 55th. Why? Because unlike any other solo class mobflation caught up with us at that point and our pets cannot tank long enough to burn something down before the pet dies and we have to flee.<P>And why does 50% of exp go to the pet if it does more damage than the magician.  While the shaman, druid, or necromancer root-dotted much more safely using the same amount of mana and they get full experience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok id like to say I think verant is getting as close as possible as can be to balancing all classes. I really do not think it is possible to have it 100% balanced in any class bases mmorpg but I am very impressed with the job verant has done thusfar since EQ's release. Now of all the classes in Norrath I feel mages do need the most work but its not alot of work really a few simple things would make mages much more desirable in group.<P>1. Pets and fear = bad. this has been stated yes but its a major issue and waiting till level 59 before you can use this wont cut it, valiant comapnion should be a 50 or 51 spell.<P>2. Pets and groups, make the pets HP bar visible to the group members somehow please! I would almost rather the pet hp bar visible over my own. ALMOST  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>3. Make bard songs and group spells affect pets! this does not seem like it would be that hard and it would be a major improvment for mages.<P>4. Fix the pets and rain spells this has been done on test thank you Verant.<P>5. Let us summon players across zones, this would make us so desirable in groups and raids and it seems like something a master summoner should do.<P>6. Let us summon mobs would be nice but has serious potential for abuse but I still think it could be worked in somehow.<P>7. summon weapons that proc for our pets! hehe nothing major I am not talking about summon Ykesha or what not but some minor stun or DD swords would be a nice touch.<P>8. an unresistable DD? not likely to happen but a nice thought would have to be a level 60 spell and have high mana cost and not the greatest dmg but seems like something a mage should do like a summoned boulder that drops on your foe or whatever how exactly would you resist getting crushed? hehe<P>9. an escape spell of some sort other than gate, summon etheral chains, summon prison, heck even transporting the mob somewhere away from you like a huge shadowstep you cast on the mob.<P>10. pet casting why cant we order our pet to not cast spells?<P>11. how bout giving illusions to our summon plate line like they originally were supposed to have, and look into the componant cost of these spells its rather high for a spell that does so little.<P>12. more summoned items, we really dont have any summoned items that are entirly to usefull i get asked for food on ocasion arrows on ocasion and throwing stars on ocasion but not really that often and its not like anyone will get a mage in a group for some free arrows.<P>13. pet names let us a pick a pet name or even give the pet our name like npc pets have anyone who has ever been charmed while you have a pet knows this is possible.<P>anyway there is my wishlist  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> will add more if I think of anything</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well something I would like to see is the ability to at least put my Pets name in emotes like we do with Targets. I would like to see "Cravin tells %E to help %T start pushing up the daisies" I would also like to be able to target people and use the %T to put their names in to macros using /say %T would be great to use asking for clarity, heals, buffs ETC. May well those are to extreme but would be nice additions.  I have seen lots of great ideas here and am hopeful that some of the things I have seen on test make it to live servers is AWSOME the pet Jboot speed SOW is great and sorely needed. That and the ability to summon wayward pets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cydmab2 said:<P>"2. Monster summoning<P>The series is fun, but the utility is dubious. It is almost always "better" to just use a regular elemental summon. And if we never use the spell, we will never get to enjoy it. I suggest some combination of (preferably all three):<P>a) removing the component (so we can summon something when we are dead and trying to do a cr)<P>b) Always making them the "decoy" type, so they will represent an alternate pet type from our standard 4 consistently<P>c) reducing the casting time substantially [2 seconds] (but put in a long recast time to prevent uber chain casting pets [30 seconds]) so it can function as an escape spell or emergency pet"<P>Please don't! In my experience, the monsters summoned are quite random, but many are actually far more powerfull then normal, focused pets. At least for Monster Summoning I. Leave them be.<P>Btw, I summoned a melee-only Monster the other day. It cast no spells, and had no built-in damage shield. It was a terror! It did massive damage and had a ton of hitpoints.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hamiclar<P>&gt;I am interested in the whole Pet fear thing. How is a pet being feared and running to get mobs any different than a player getting feared and pulling mobs back? I don't see the difference.<P>Pets are about 10+ levels lower than the mage.  Thus they are more prone(lneght of the fear and distance they run) to fear due to level and lack of gear.  Also they run very fast when feared and can make it WAY back to things that a PC could never make it to, especailly since pc's are in walk mode to avoid this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"They can solo for their entire career fairly well."<P>I hate soloing.  I have soloed maybe 4 levels out of my 52 level career.  I dont care what I can solo, I enjoy grouping, so if I am of less use to a group than my wizard buddy, something needs to be fixed.<P>Balance the classes so they are all usefull in groups and raids 50+, dont balance them so they can solo.<P>Can we by any chance in where-ever have a spell like lure that is unresistable?  There are so many situations where I cant use a pet, and I cant nuke (becuase of high resistances or totally immune to spells), and therefore I am useless doing nothing.  I dont care if its a 90 pt nuke, I just dont like sitting around doing nothing!  There are too many situations where a mage pre 55 will be able to do absolutley NOTHING for hours on end in a raid.  I dont know another class who has the same complaint.<P>Do something about the staff of elemental mastery on innoruuk.  There are so little mage epics because of it.  After all, the water one is so common, whats wrong with the earth one being the same rarity?  I can think of soooo many people with everything but the earth staff, and everyone who has an earth staff is not commited enough to finishing the quest.<P>More summons would be nice.  Dont be afraid to add more fun into the game.<P>As for pathing, ummm check the /feedbacks.  I can think of about 5 I have written offhand on pathing(although I have written more than that), and I know others who do as well.  Its all there.  But if you want to start with bad pathing:<P>The Hole:  Everywhere<BR>Sebilis:  Almost everywhere, partiucularly guardian area, 4 rooms area.<BR>Hate:  Everywhere but maestro's room, thats actually ok.<BR>Mistmoore:  Go run the whole zone with a pet and you will see what I mean.<P>I'm not too impressed with velious pathing either, but I have not had enough chances to judge the pathing for sure.  I remember 2nd or 3rd floor of tower of frozen shadow was preety bad when we first went through there when velious opened.<P>Also, read the old "what do you want to summon" thread.  There were alot of nice posts there.<P>Again, dont balance us so that we can beat XXX class, or solo XXX mob.  Balance us so we can be usefull all around in a group and large raid.  Pets are great for grouping (if pathing allows), but they do not make up the difference in large raids.  Man I hate sitting on my butt during a raid.<P>Search some of the other mage boards, look for respectable names and ideas there as well.  I have seen some posters here that I highly doubt play mages seriously, or at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's my 2cp.<P>No rent items: suggested solution is great.<P>Rain spells: Sounds good to me. Pet's don't count toward wave hits, and check resist rate.<P>New summoned proc weapons: Hurray! Also maybe summoned armor? Maybe armor with specific effects like ultravision (like a coldstone?). <P>Pathing: Here's some:  Hate Plane (if you ask around you'll find out that mobs in hate used to have pets...but the pet pathing was so bad that all pets from mobs were removed....but of course us pet classes can't use pets up there). Velketor's Labyrinth, certain areas of the Hole (Like the tower, or the underground docks)<P>AOE Fear/Pets: Anything that will make me more useful in these large raids is a plus. Against mobs like Talendor...I really have very little to contribute as he's pretty inmune to magic/fire...guess how many non-magic/fire nukes we have.<P>(Greater) Voceration: Fire - I wouldnt say that they're less useful than a 29 pet.  BUT they *are* a heck of a lot less useful than the 49 fire pet. I never personally use the fire vocerations anymore (after my initial excitement of having a new different pet). I just summon my 49 fire pet. <P>Spell Drops: Greater Voceration: Water. Never seen it drop...I bought it from someone that looted it from a Juggernaut (level 57 mob in trak's lair). Haven't seen burnout 4 drop either btw...I hear it only drops from dragons in western wastes....so I guess if I want it I have to go kill dragons there...and ruin my faction. Never seen it for sale.<P>Pet Names: personally...don't care.<P>Pet Graphics: Yes please. we used to be ablet to tell at a glance when a player's pet was 49 summon. Now the level 57 to 60 pets look just like the 49 ones. Would be nice to see some sort of change (no need to make them bigger please..they're big enough).<P>Rage of Zomm: Eye gfx would be cool...although I'd suggest an evil eye as opposed to the eye of zomm model as the eye of zomm model is very simple (an eye painted on top of a roughly spherical model). Also please look at the pet's health...at high levels it's not really worth using because a single riposte will kill it.<P>DOTs: I dont mind getting the DOT...I think it should do a bit more than what it currently does as it's a rather underpowered spell compared to our nukes. <P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: I don't really care what you do with it as long as its useful. I never cast this pet. Also...please make it at least blue to a level 55 (the level of the spell). <P>Improved Invis: We get invisibility before wizards even...but we don't get the improved one? <P>Phantom Armor: Should not get overwritten. Should not use 4 reagents. <P>Aegis of Ro: Haven't seen it drop yet. Yes I've been on dragon hunts.<P>Pet fear inmunity: This is covered earlier.<P>Robe of Conjuration: Effect is nigh useless compared to all the other class chest pieces I've seen drop in PoG so far (not counting the poor bards). Please give us something useful like the heal on the monk chest wraps *grins*.<P>Pet Health Bar: Hmm...interesting...if you could find a way to do it without cluttering the UI, it'd be a nice addition.<P>Ok...so here's thigns that were not mentioned:<P>Mage epic quest: This quest really needs to be looked at please. ALL of the steps require camping of one sort or another. Can we PLEASE PLEASE I'm down on my knees begging now PLEASE get this quest changed so that we can spawn the NPCs that drop the items we need much like the cleric quest does things? Orb of mastery...camp for days for power of fire...camp for days for pages of mastery. Staff of elemental Mastery: Earth....Drops from Innoruuk who spawns once a week and seems to have a one in thirty chance of dropping the staff. (and mages are not the only ones with this problem...wizards and necros suffer too).  In brief: Rare drops from rare mobs suck. An item that drops every time from a triggered encounter from a mob that hits for 560+ and requires a guild to take down--&gt;good. Make the quest hard....not tedious from hours of camping.<P>Bracelets of Conjuration: This item has effect: Reclaim energey with a casting time. Uhmm...that means now we have about 10 items that have this effect....except this one is the only one with a casting time....joy I can't wait to get these! On the other hand monks get a level 55(!!!) mage spell on their bracers. <P>Boots of Conjuration: Effect: summon bandages. This might be useful for a warrior..but it does nothing for me. It's a level 1 spell for crying out loud. I'm not even saving mana using this...I can't even tell mana drain from casting this spell a bunch of times.<P>Also in general...all of the PoG and quest armor in Velious for casters just adds resists to the stats already present in old pre-velious planar armor. However, PoG/Velious quest armor is generally far superior to pre-velious planar armor. Not really a balance issue...just saying that when I first heard of the new planes I was hoping for some new gear...only to find out that the only two pieces worth getting for a mage with full Hate gear are the robe and the pants. Dissapointing at best.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know this thread is vital to our class.  The mage class is hurting, and I think some non mages are making posts here.  <P>1. We do need a defencesive spells or give us a more powerful healing spell past 20 for our pet.  That is the same thing.  So whether we have a better healing spell or a root let's say.  Same thing.  But yes mages have no defencesive spells.<BR>Our pet is dead I'm not going to NUKE an Ice Giant to death while it's beating on me.  Dead pet, dead mage.<P>2. Post Kunark summon spells suck.  Anyone who says otherwise is crazy.<P>3. Now I think mages at circles at 29 and 39 need to be addressed.  Some mages don't like DOTs I can understand their feelings.  I like DOTs but hey I also run a necro and I know how powerful DOTs are.  But some sort of a boost needs to be done for those spell circles.  I don't care what anybody says.  A mage a 33rd level or 43rd level just plain suck.  Not until we get our upgrade to DD at 34 or 44.  I mean it is like a mage has to go through a hell level at 30 and guess what you get another hell level at 33 to boot!<BR>  <BR>4. Mage research sucks.

</FONT><HR>And because I forgot:<P>Yes, the 52 fire pet is broken, but only in some people's opinions.  If it chain casts, its ok, but in guess tests (you cant actually log the true damage, but you can guess by spell type and some other tests) the 49 fire pet still does more damage than the 52.  Thats if it chain casts, which I have seen my fire pet do once out of 50+ times, whereas some (but few) mages see it chain cast all the time.  Honestly if all it did was chain cast stuns I would use it more, otherwise I will never use that pet.  The only time I use a fire pet now is my 49 fire against ae fire mobs.<P>Leave 54 water where it is.  Its a good spell, way ahead of its level in my opinion.  Nothing wrong with putting in some effort to get a spell of that magnitude.<P>And also, at least fix the broken things with mages, adding in anything to sugar-coat the class is not going to help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pet Names:  Gonna chime in and say that [Player's Name]'s Pet would be a good solution.<P>DoTs:  My view is that Magicians are very much about damage over time.... (our pets and damage shields being prime examples of this).  The DoT seems to be a logical addition to me.  The fact that they save vs Magic instead of Fire give the mage a nice (and needed) bit of flexibility.  So I'd vote to keep it please.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Conjuration:  Several of our spells could have (and in my view should have been) Conjuration rather than Evocation.

</FONT><HR>I see one problem with the magician class, we give up all defense (we have the worst defense of all classes) for the "best" offense, our pets are our life, without them we are pretty much dead, a 5 second gate is the only escape spell we got, you cant cast a pet because it takes twices as much time.<P>This was fine pre 50, now it isnt anymore, the magician was the best damage dealer in a group, however forgiving up all his defense it was fair enough, now we are just somewhere in the middle. Rogue/Monk will outdamage us without a prob, and they dont need mana for their attacks. Im not for giving us better DD spells, no i dont want to stand on wizard toes again. Let our pet deal out more damage, im not talking about more tanking ability, no just damage, a necro pet will outdamage our pets because they dont cast spells (they may do damage, but you must agree those spells do not make up for a few lost melee rounds), they proc a lifetab, let our pets proc their spells too, this would be one step in the right direction.<P>Our pets damage output was increased from lvl50 56 points to 60 points , or with focus from hate/kedge, 58 to 62 points. Thats just 4 losy points, 4 points for the 10 hardest lvl in the whole game ? And necro pets received the same upgrade, is that balanced ?<P>Another thing which buggs me, the mana cost for our pets are way to high now, at lvl49 it used to be 200 mana, at lvl51 it was 300 ,now at lvl57 it is 400. Thats way to high, you may argue necro suffer in the same way and their pets have high mana cost too, but didnt you forget that we dont have any mana reg at all ? Please keep the mana cost low, after all we are THE pet class, 250 at 51 and 300 at 57 seems to be fair.<P>We are elementalists (at least that is our title from lvl51 to 55). Why ? Because we have 4 types of pets, fire , earth, water and air. But we have just fire based damage spells, doesnt seem very logic, at least another cold line similar to the Magic line would be fine, just 1 spell every 15-20 lvls like the magic one.<P>The fire pet, it has no use, maybe for fearkiting till you get your air one, but it runs oom very fast and you know it is very unlikly that it casts lure spells, so a lvl42 pet vs a lvl50+ isnt that good. They only cast lvl16-20 wizard spells, it should be lvl34-39 to keep up with the damage output of the other pets, velious has shown us that magical damage isnt very efficent, go melee GO.<P>Hehe and now something you should at least take serious, the title at lvl60 we get, Arch Mage isnt that nice, did you know that Arch sounds very similar to the german word a-s-s (translated)? Would you like it to be called an a-s-s mage ?<P><BR>I hope you see that our class is far from fully balanced, there are alot of things that still needs to be done.<P>Regards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055885&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055885&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
