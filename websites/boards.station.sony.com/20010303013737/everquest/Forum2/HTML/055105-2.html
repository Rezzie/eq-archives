</FONT><HR>I, for one, would give up the nifty horn that makes you look like a werewolf, plus all the capped at useless rogue skills and way-too-late combat skills for greater song effects, a removal of stacking conflicts, and maybe even a few new "strange"... maybe a song that makes the entire party look like creatures from the zone they're in? Or... better yet, make them look like the closest creature that's not part of the group. Term it an enhanced version of sonorous clouding, making a group "blend in" better... and put it on the same spell routine as our invisibility so that it only works while playing a wind instrument... This sort of silliness is part of what a bard is and needs to be enhanced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My bard is only lvl13. I've played exclusively in groups, and I have to say that when I'm grouped with a tank that can't taunt, I die way more than any other character I've played. Just twisting Anthem de Arms, Elemental Rythms, and the Stamina song had every orc in the throne room of CB pounding me.

</FONT><HR>I think that is because the unattached creatures... i.e. the ones that aren't being pounded on by the group, look around for the person who is doing the most... since you're constantly casting "spells" on the entire party... that would be you. Rest assured, though, in a few levels there will be a couple of songs available that let you deal with it to some degree. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few ideas that would make the bard slightly more group friendly at higher levels:<P>1) Round out the chant series of songs with a disease and a poison debuff version. It will not strengthen the offense of a bard, since we already have 3 we can twist together, but it will let us reduce resists that most other classes can't touch.  Since we have a psalm song for every resist, having an equivilent debuff isn't out of character.<P>2) A self-only evade song.  Each pulse would move us down the targets hate list, so we can sacrifice 1 group buff/song cycle to attract less attention from the mobs.  This post is full of complaints about the unwanted attention a bard in a full group gets, this would help without having to change the dynamics of the hate list system.<P>3) If hot keys had 2 more lines, a recycle command, and would stay depressed, macros like this could be build:<P>/pause 27, /cast 1<BR>/pause 3, /cast 1<BR>/pause 27, /cast 2<BR>/pause 3, /cast 2<BR>/pause 27, /cast 3<BR>/pause 3, /cast 3<BR>/repeat<P>Once you press the hotkey, it stays depressed, cycling through the songs.  When you press it again, it breaks the cycle. This will mean a bard could build macros for occasions like downtime, so a bard isn't having to hit a key every 3 seconds to be their most efficient.  This adds nothing to the game, and gets very annoying.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I won't pretend to know or understand the issues of playing a bard, but I do know some from the perspective of grouping with them.  For all the benefits of grouping with a bard, there is one issue that as a caster I find very annoying, and that is that my target is never clear for more than three seconds.<P>One of the benefits of soloing or grouping without a bard is that if I get hit, I can almost immediately start casting snare or some other evasive spell, knowing that whatever just hit me is automatically on my target.  Clearly that just isn't possible where songs are concerned.  In some cases it leaves me random-clicking through group members trying to find the one mob I need.<P>This, I imagine, is even more noticeable for my Chanter friend, who continually reminds me of his distaste for the current behavior.  When he is managing a pack of 3 or 4 mezzed creatures, and one breaks, it usually goes for him.  With a clear target, he immediately gets the awakened mob, and getting it mezzed again is simple.  With a bard in the group, his target is not reliable and he must search to find the one that just broke.  Clearly not a healthy situation to be in.<P>If it's possible to special-case beneficial songs (not all songs, don't want to give bards an unfair disadvantage in PvP) to not change the target, I believe casters everywhere would rejoice.<P>Thanks.<P>Elphin<BR>52 Druid of Tunare<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to know what adding Manasong at level 20 does to address anything that bards have brought up in parts 1, 2 and 3.<P>This leads us to believe that the "Vision" sees us like nothing more then manapumps, which is what 99% of the population blindly sees. Any bard worth their drums will tell you about what else we *could* bring to the group/raid, but what's the point? At high levels, the subtle influence of the bard is non-existant. You always have a shammie or chanter around, and if you don't, likely you won't be attempting anything too hard. They take care of slows/haste, leaving the bard looking at their lute, contemplating which of 2 songs to play that pulse, Cantina or Manasong.<P>What needs to happen for bards to become balanced:<P>1) Our small effect haste/slows need to stack. There's a haste cap already, and after playing 1 1/2 years at it, I don't think allowing groups with less then the best equipment to reach it would be overpowering. Plus is saves some stress on shammies and non-epic wielding chanters in the fact they don't have to have their best haste on the tanks all the time.<P>2) Let chanter mez overwrite bard mez. Most of the time I let the chanter in the group deal with the CC exclusively, but when things are going really bad, it would be nice to lock down one or two mobs to let the chanter get his/her situation in order so the party might live.<P>3) This whole mana requirement crap. From level 39 to the low 50s, I dreaded getting a res after my inevitable death. Why? Cause I lost all my mana, and that means no charms for the next 30 minutes or so. There were times I would eat a death in a easily accesible dungeon just so we could continue. (Me and 2 other bards were the primary source of CC in my guild for a long time, <BR>it took a lot of coordination for us to do anything, like the entrance to the Hole =P)<P><BR>Double Attack will not help bards, we have enough problems with agro as it is. The defense upgrade will mean I live an extra second maybe if something decides that I should die now. More hps, well, that's not really what barding is about. We enhance the group, subtly, and that's what I'd like to be able to do.<P><BR>(To all you no-mana jerks, yes most bard songs take no mana, they take 33% of our resources.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quite contrary to the tenor in this threat, the Bard NEEDS to be ballanced in Level 20 to 25.<P>The class is at his weakest then. No Tank any longer, no support to speak of.<P>But a Breeze Song is not a solution we should accept. It will be replaced just 12 Levels later with excatly the same song, yet more powerful.<P>As Bards go, move Manasong to Level 20, and make it better as we level, to reach its normal efficiency at 32 and so on....<BR>It would be the same from a gameplay point of view, but would fit better in the Bard Class.<P>Plus, we got a free songslot at 32, which is to be filled *eg<P>Dunno about Post 50, but to 50 hes fine, and very fine indeed =)<P>Tilo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I hope you make a note of this one. It's short, sweet and to the point:<BR>1) Thanks for defense increase.  Perhaps a minor offense increase is in order, perhaps not.<BR>2) Songs that please need to be changed:<BR> a) Melody of ervaj (5% haste stacks with other haste buffs): assuming you swap instruments and weapons very fast, you lose 1/3 of bard melee damage output to increase group damage by 1/20.  Only useful in rogue heavy group with enchanter.  Either make instrument optional, increase haste, or revert to mana drain, as in pre-release.<BR> b) level 23 / 51 snares: Ranger/druid/necro/sk/wizzie snares mob, does not have to recast for a *fixed* amount of time.  Bard casts chains.  Chains may break in 1 second or may last full 15 seconds.  Consequence: even with bard devoting 100 % effort to casting snare, mob can escape.  This fact has gotten my group wiped out more than once.  No other class has this *severe* limitation on their snare.  Please fix duration on song at 3 ticks, same as every other (except for instant cast and 1 long DoT) song.  Increase resist rate if needed for the "balance" issue.<BR> c) Song of Twilight (53 mez): Good song, but big problem: Enchanter Tashan line breaks it (god knows why heh), but enchanter mez line doesn't!  Please make enchanter mez overwrite bard mez, not the other way around.  Many times I see my enchanter getting beaten on by 4 or 5 mobs.  I cannot help him because I will only interfere with his mezzing process.  The current problem would be like making a cleric unable to CHeal the tank after the druid GHealed him.<P>Address these concerns, and I consider the bard class balanced.<P>Cantador de Batalla<BR>Troubador of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I would just like to clarify few things:<P>1)  Bards are NOT hybrids.  They paid the hybrid penalty for a long time, but not even other hybrids consider bards hybrids.  Hybrids all have taunt and the ability to inflict damage with both hands (dual wield or two handed weapons) twice (double attack).  Bards are a "plate" class like clerics, with a decent armor class.  They have cruddy offensive and defensive skills.<P>2)  For balancing purposes, bards should not be treated like weak enchanters and lousy warriors.  Since our songs are such short duration, the death of the bard immediately changes the buffs on the party.  Only a clerics death has a bigger immediate impact.<P>3)  Bards do NOT cast spells.  For game mechanics, there may be some coding that makes songs act like spells, but bards sing, not cast.  Songs and spells should not have stacking issues (in most cases they do not), and haste should stack.<P>4)  For the 50+ game, bards should have something to add to even a balanced group.  One of the ways to do this is to give songs a longer duration as the bards reach higher levels, such as allowing four song twists at 40th and five song twists at 50th.<P>5)  Bards should probably not have a mana bar.  Denon's Desperate Dirge should be on a timer, and the 39th charm should be comnverted to a mez song without level limits (except for mobs flagged as unmezzable, or maybe only mobs of lower level than the bard).  This would be totally in line with singing/not casting bard concept.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think in the first post by "NOR_BARD" in the beginning of this thread pretty much covered everything.  What Thott has said here is also very accurate.<P>I have a 52 bard (with high end equipment) and I have played other classes up to mid 40's, and have grouped with high 50's of other classes.  What I have noticed time and again is the way ALL other classes greatly surpass bards in power, post level 50.  It's simply RIDICULOUS.  We need more offensive power to bring us in line with other melee hybrids.<P>A glaring example of this problem is how easy it is for my 45 magician to destroy everything in a level 30 dungeon.  My 52 bard has a hard time and has to rest and/or retreat or suffer death.  Granted a magician is a soloing class, but bards should be able to be at least as powerful when you look at the level differences here.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more overlooked issue:<P>Please, please give us SOMETHING that we can use to work with pet-casting classes.  In a group with a necro or magician, we can't buff the pet, heal the pet, DS the pet, haste the pet, or anything else that might be useful.  And whatever we do, we end up taunting mobs off the pet, which is probably exactly what we DON'T want to do.<P>For a while, briefly, we had the targeted version of Jonathan's Provocation, which gave us one song that actually helped make a pet more effective.  Then you took that one away, as well.<P>Fixing how we interact with Enchanters is priority number one, but it would be nice if there were something we could do to work with pet casters as well.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that its fairly obvious that the biggest concern is Haste/Slow stacking.<P>One of the other interesting ideas that I've seen so far is that of giving the bards the ultimate mana drain/mana STEAL abilities. I think that would go a long way. If we had good mana steal abilities, we could eliminate the problem with the Dirge and other mana based songs that need fixes.<P>*chuckle* someone mentioned that bard-mezzed mobs need to dance.

</FONT><HR>OK, wish list here again, two things I have ALWAYS wanted to see ever since I started playing this game.<P>#1- Barbarain Bards.  Come on, there is No reason why Barbarians couldnt be Bards.  Call'em Skalds or whatever, but it fits in RP wise great, and it would probably increase the Bard population as well.  <BR>I cant envision an Iksar, High Elf, Dark Elf, Gnome, Dwarf, Halfling,  Ogre or Troll, as a Bard.  I dont think Eurdites would fit the bill, although they are "Humans", they just dont seem to be the type of race that would employ themselves as Bards.<BR>But Barbarians?  Heck yeah, they got nothing better to di in Halas then sing songs around the campfire and pass on ancient legends and crap. <BR>Please look at this new class combo, at least consider it.  I cant think of any reason not to do it, but then again Im biased cause I KNOW I am right LOL<P>#2  I brought it up in part 1, Ill bring it up again here.  BARDS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SELF BIND!!  We are wandering minstrels, we should be able to bind ourselves.  Even if it is only in locations where melee players can bind, and we dont get the full caster version of bind most anywhere.  We should, by class defination, be able to wander freely at will and call most anyplace home</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pre-comments:<BR>I don't know if you are reading this far.  I hope you are.  Also, I haven't read all of the bard issue posts.  Unfortunately, my employer wont pay me to do that.<P>Comments:<BR>What's a compelling reason to play a bard?  <P>We need to have something that adds significant value to a group.  At level 47 (and I believe at higher levels), I feel that we have too much competition with Enchanters and Shaman.  When either one of these classes are not present, I play haste, slows and crowd control during combat and mana song on down time.  <P>If a enchanter is present, it is more efficient for me to play mana song at all times to reduce the overall downtime of the group.  At which time I will melee.<P>If a shaman is present, I will do the same as I do as with an enchanter but also add in crowd control.<P>The above two sitiuations are not my vision of what a bard is to do.  I don;t think they are Verant's vision either (though that is only a guess).<P>Obviously, group makeup has a huge effect on what I do, but, in general this is the situation.<P>So, how can we solve this?<P>Well, the obvious is to make haste/slows stack with enchanters and shaman.  I (think) that you don't want to or cant do this.<P>There is another solution.  Make our slows and hastes in close to that or better than shaman and enchanters of our same level.  The reason is that it will help in reducing the down time of a group by letting enchanters and shaman conserve their mana by letting us play one of those songs.  This in turn will make us more attractive to groups that already have these members in them.<P>I know that increasing our haste/slow effectiveness will enrage a lot of the enchanter and shaman comunity.  But, I don't think think that change will make them useless in a group.  They still have class defining attributes (Enchanters with crowd control, shaman with buffing/dots/DD).<P>Anyway, thanks for taking the time and reading this.<P>-Tremelo, 47 bard on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I am a Bard to the bone. I started EQ about 5 months ago playing only 1 charectar: My Bard. I won't go into specifics, but I have played almost everyday since I first started and I am only at lvl 30. (Yes I have a family =) ). While I have no knowledge of post 50 syndrome, I have spent 2 hrs. reading the pages upon pages of previous posts. Here is my input...<P>Twisting- Do NOT change twisting. We get manaless songs that last until the effect has ceased being twisted. Is it a pain in the butt? Yes! But it is one of the more defining skills of a good bard. It took me almost my whole bard life to realize that I am neither a healer nor a tank. I have just recently started going on an instrument only format when a tank is present and all I can say is WOW. Not only am I more effective twisting my songs, but my group comes out of a battle with near health. Feels good not to need the cleric to go OOM all the time. I have twisting down to a "T". We knew when we were getting into this class what we were in for in this. If auto twisting gets implemented, let it require that our mana decreases per 20 ticks or so. That is only fair compensation.<P>Defense- I think that it has been well pointed out that we are MOB magnets. Give us some HP and AC. While I agree that instruments are the best tactic of attack in most cases, bards will find the need to melee in some cases. The fact that casters have 100 or so less HP than me is utterly ridiculous. That is 2 hits from a MOB in the 30's. If we have caster HP, then we should have stronger songs. If it came to a choice between a bard and a cleric dying...who will see the Loading screen? (At ANY level)<P>Armour- I think that the quests are reasonable. You can ask a party to loot or kill it yourself. Not too bad. Contrary to server speculations, Lambent armour was NOT meant for a lvl 10 bard to run around in. Needs to be earned. I do have a beef with SS armour though. I currently own the boots and the gaunts...the 2 most readily available pieces. My gaunts completely rock. I got them 5 lvls ago and can travel underwater with a drum in hand and Jax playing all day with no fear. My boots...well not so great. It is rumoured that they are to proc at lvl 45 and summon 1 at a time. My biggest complaint is not in fact the effects (although more than lame). Why do my gaunts proc and not my boots? To kill and earn the items yourself, you need to be at least in a group of 46+ players...maybe even 50. At lvl 50...I can go up into the planes and get better no drop equipment. What is the advantage here? Obviously the AC is great on all SS items, but why make them proc at such high lvls? Both my obsidian shard and blade of fiery lamentations proc all the time when used and come off mobs around this lvl range. Seems silly to have one piece of the armour proc and let the others no squat until you really won't need them anymore.<P>Instruments- Make more of them please. A mino horn has same effect as a Brahms horn but the mino horn is readily dropped. (Is there still a Brahms horn??) Only advantage is the Brahm's horn is named which impresses all the lvl 10's out there. Same thing with lutes. Gypsy/Lute of Gyp. Princess both common drops and have the same string effect. Neither of these are much more than a store bought. At lvl 30...5 gp is really nothing to buy one. By the time those lutes do any REAL good (Of course I am speaking of Hymn) Kelins is a possibility. If we are NOT healers...then why do we have to wait until 45 or so for these lutes to do any good? With the pathing of MM being the way it is, it is hard for a bard in low to mid thirties (Even see 40's get whacked) to camp these without pulling the castle. I have a Gyp/LOGP as well as a store one...not any noticable difference. Percussion...well I must say kudos on that. I think that it is fine as is. Brass...need another brass. Have heard of a conch...noone has heard of the drop or the quest on my server. (I have asked literally 50 bards) M.horn dropped off Vox and so are scales. We need both. Any "Raid" I have done lets the item go to a usable class. I can get a great horn or an awesome NO DROP scale needed for my epic. If I loot the horn, I am inelegible for the scale. If I get the scale, I can';t roll on the horn bc it is not NO DROP and sells for some good pp. Need a scale down of M horn like Nostrolos tambourine is to Selos drums.<P>On a personal note...Blade of Fiery Lamentations procs an ae "Fingers of Fire" Unless the proc graphics are changed...it will keep procing LD for party members. Please scale down the proc. WAY too much lag and LD.<P>I appreciate the thoughts and do not envy your job. I am, however bothered that it has taken this long to get a bard recognition. I am just getting over the fact that Verant refused to fix selos with drums until a next patch and did not consider it an emergency. (You trying running from a train with singing selos and see how many times YOU die) I think that bards can be a great class to play. They are challenging yet beneficial. Like I said in my opening paragraph, I am lvl 30 and have zero knowledge about further up except from those who have obtained it. I remember when Everquest was new and I was amazed to hear the singing when a caster cast a buff on me. Lately, I have wished that I wouldn't have played my bard this far...<P>It's not easy to give up a kid once you are attached to it...<P>Rewen Sweetnote<BR>Bard of the 30th song<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

In the beginning, bards *for the most part* didn't have "lines" of songs, there were no upgrades to songs.  Didn't need them, cause songs scaled up as bards level.  This was the explanation for casters having SOOOO many more spells than bards have songs.  I know scaling of the songs has been brought up as an issue, but...<P>It seems more and more of our songs post 50 are upgrades type songs.

</FONT><HR>I agree with Kerouac... songs should be scaled upwards with levels, rather than cut off and replaced. The tack taken with the early defensive songs, where they are different, exclusive of one another, but still both viable in different situations is a much better model than having two songs that do the same thing, but are artifically cut off at a certain level. (Look at the charm songs, for instance...)<P>The balance I can see is: increased range for utility songs so we can actually use them without mailing and killing our party, scale up the damage/protection/etc over levels on EXISTING songs so that they remain useful later in life, and let enhancing and debuffing songs stack with magic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To reiterate before adding new material:<BR>The most appropriate enhancement avaliable would be to make the normal bard haste songs stack with all non-song based haste. Ideally at the current values (given how comparatively weak the bard hastes are in comparison to the alternatives ... all of which require well less than 1/3 of the enchanter/shamans mana regeneration to maintain) although making them stack at half value wouldn't be all that bad. An alternative would be to drastically increase the haste value of the erjav songs, and remove the instrument requirement from them. I'ld rather see the normal haste songs stack (recall, this becomes an issue as early as 16 when enchanters get quickness) and the erjav songs replaced with a viable mana drain, as in the beta. <P>But a new issues has arrisen:<BR>My bard attends services at the church of Solusek Ro and I would like to be able to wear religeous jewelry associated with my god. Currently, this is wizard only. Can any magicians worship Ro? Might want to add them in too. I hate to think my diety doesn't love me. I'll have to sing chant of fire and psalm of warmth more untill his trinkets accept me.<P>At least I didn't pick Veeshan.<P>P.S. <BR>Slide, not waddle!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Or the other wish list stuff like Drum animations or Waddle/Slide?<P>Even the "auto-twisting" stuff is pushing it, but at least that issue addresses real physical issues that are better solved sooner than later.<P>Bards are regen machines right now. Shaman and Enchanters, and even some items have taken the place of many of our most usefull group skills.<P>Our Offense needs buffed badly, far more so than our Defense. <P>Our songs dont Scale in power/usefullness nearly as well as other classes spells and skills scale with thier levels.<P>These arent whine issues. They are examples of serious problem areas of the class. <P>What once was a fairly Balanced class has degraded over time. A great many things have contributed to the problem, and real adjustments need to be made.<P><BR>Aanani<BR>Paradigm<BR>Sol Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see an Invis to Undead song.  <P>I think a good level for this would be around 14th lvl.  I don't think this would be horribly unbalancing because of the fact that it would have the Same AoE Radius as the Invis Song (Shauri's Sonorous Clouding), and require a Wind Instrument to play.  Not only that but at lower levels it would help out tremendously in traveling some of the more Hazardous Zones.  Granted that it will not have a huge Radius but it would help Bards in Areas such as Lower Guk, Kithicor, Tower of Kurn, and half a dozen other Undead Zones.    <P>Short, sweet, and to the point. <P>(I am not responsible for bad grammer or words spelled incorrectly...I didn't have access to my spell checker  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>Arick Dunn,<BR>Darkened Blades<BR>37th lvl Mana Battery....err Bard<BR>The Tribunal </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Carpel Tunnel syndrome caused by weaving is probably the biggest problem with playing a bard. =P  It'd be helpful if there were an easier way to weave songs.<P>I was thinking that it would be helpful if we had some sort of /delay command for use in building hotkeys. You could have it "/delay 3" to delay 3 ticks, with the hotkey remaining depressed until the 3 ticks are up. That way you can weave songs with three hotkeys similar to this:<P>Hotkey 1<BR>/cast 1<BR>/delay 3<BR>/cast 1<P>Hotkey 2<BR>/cast 2<BR>/delay 3<BR>/cast 2<P>Hotkey 3<BR>/cast 3<BR>/delay 3<BR>/cast 3<P>Or you could just build them all into the same key  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A level 20 mana song.  Did you read these posts at all when you suggested that?  Nothing we have brought up has been touched by Absor except our need for higher defense, which they gave to every single hybrid.  So really rather than an actual improvement it was...an afterthought.  Where are you Absor?<P>Our debuffs suck, my lvl 30ish debuff is resisted by almost every single mob and debuffs nothing.  <P>We need some improvements on the rogue skills we were given or just tak them away.  As they stand now they are worthless.<P>Make our SONGS (they are not spells they are songs) stack with spells.<P>Make us a viable group class, its what we were apparently meant for.<P>Get rid of the charm/mez cap except on tagged mobs.  <P>Allowing our song duration to increase with level.  4 songs at 40 5 songs at 50.  I would gladly get rid of my 55 discipline for this.<P>Make our songs scale to lvl.  <P>Perhaps read this thread, respond to it, or even acknowledge that bards are giving you real, viable class balancing issues.<P>Shyelok Chanson<BR>Dissapointed lvl 54 Minsterel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not going to repost on the main issues, since they have already been well-covered, repeatedly. However, a few new ideas have been popping up in the threads, so I wanted to add my own thoughts on those.<P>1) Barbarian bards -- Well, this isn't really a balance issue. Also, the starting CHA would be insanely low. However... it does seem kind of neat. I'd probably start a 2nd bard just to try it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Doubt it'll happen, though, since then it opens a whole big 'why not THIS class with THAT race?' can of worms.<P>2) Manadrain songs -- These have been covered somewhat before. However, there was a post on the 1st page of this section of the bard talk which had a _wonderful_ suggestion. Specifically, it suggested that our manadrains should be the most powerful in the game & should serve as a way for us to recover our own mana.<P>Having our manadrains be more powerful than enchanters would serve a positive purpose for balance. Firstly, this would give bards a niche in the post-52 raid, when resistances are (from what I've heard) less important than on the 45-52 raid. Secondly, this would give bards a role to play in groups with enchanters. Thirdly, because enchanters would still have their own manadrain spells (as well as the MANY other things they contribute), it would NOT take anything away from another class.<P>Using stolen mana to replenish our own would also work well for balance. Because it would (obviously) agro the mob being drained, it would not allow bards to run around casting Denon's Dissension willy-nilly & then grabbing mana back from mobs for free. Draining & battling enough mobs to replenish the bar would still take a fair amount of time, & would entail the risks involved in any fight. Obviously, PC's (on regular servers) & charmed mobs will be immune to this song, as they are to any offensive song/spell. Furthermore, this would fit from an rp perspective -- we don't 'med' for mana like the true casters do, but 'steal' it, in keeping with our roguish nature.<P>I hope that the idea of bardic manataps will be considered for the balance discussions.<P>Snapdragyn Feybaerd &lt;Mystic Alliance&gt;, Bard of the Thirty-seventh Song<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although I agree with many of the requests here, I think the biggest bard issue is that bards have no defined role or at least a limited role at best. A couple ideas I've had for a role would be:<P>1. The masters of mana (since we have no need for it)<BR>   Perhaps add a song to give all our current mana to a target (and empty our bar), more efficient mana drain songs, and perhaps a drain mana from the enemy into the group. If this was to be the case, I could see ALL our damage songs being converted to mana-drain instead. This would give bards a powerful position for grouping and would remove most of their soloing power.<P>2. The masters of stacking (since these are songs, not spells)<BR>   Move our damage shields to a lower level so we can stack/use them when we are in the melee action. Starting at 27 or so (or when both chanters and shaman have haste) give us haste songs that stack and have a large range so we can stay back a little. Make our chants do no damage but the debuff stacks and each pulse lowers the resist more(ie: 5...10...15...20...ect). Of course, make all these stack with existing spells  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>3. Jack of all trades (masters of none)<BR>   What we are supposed to be the masters at now. This could be improved by allowing a switch that would make our 'buff' songs hit all pc's in range instead of just our group. This will allow us to have a much greater effect in any multi-group event. We would need an agro-reduction for this though  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>4. All of the above<BR>   What can I say? This would completely re-define the class and would really shake things up. Could be a bit much though, but hey, I can dream  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As a final, unrelated thought, another possible song would be a targeted song on a groupmate that would taunt the enemies around them towards that groupmate. Would address the tanks taunt problems at higher levels and also help out bards. This would be a level 50 or above song though, imho. Thanks for listening in and I hope you can pick a few good things out of my ramblings.<BR>-Nvar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055105&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055105&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
