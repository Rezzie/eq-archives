</FONT><HR>Ok i'm quite upset at this..<P>I play a magician on a Live server.  I recently acquired a spell (Acumen) and scribed it.  Though it did not show my class on the spell, I knew from various web sites that it was in fact a magician spell.  Considering there is no ingame list, on a vendor or otherwise, we have only the websites to go to for information.  <P>According to the Bug board, this spell was a mistake, and should have been labeled as 61 and NOT 16.  Ok valid mistake.. However those of us that traded VALUABLE rare drop spells for this are basically being told, tuff luck it's being changed.<P>Is there any way we can either:<BR>1) Be reimbursed for the actual scroll so we may trade to another player.<BR>2) Able to keep casting the spell (even if it's level 60)<BR>3) Have the spell replaced with another kunark drop spell which we don't already have.<P>I understand that mistakes happen, however this has been around since Kunark was released, posted on various sites, etc..  Much like the manastone or deceiver mask, many people have given up alot of items or spells to get this, all we ask is to be reimbursed in one form or another.<P>Meraxes Glibilskym<BR>Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>We're fairly open about the fact that things in game are subject to change at any time.  This includes the prospect of both positive and negative changes.  People making trades in game need to be aware that that there exists a chance that any item is likely to drop in value or usefulness after you buy it.  It's sort of like buying stock in a company in that regard.<P>The spell was never supposed to be usable by magicians, who ended up able to use it only because the level restriction was transposed by the designer.  I really wish we'd caught this sooner.<P>-Gordon<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If the spell did something remotely on the lines of what a mage can or can't do then I could see some sort of arguement, but Acumen does nothing even close to what a mage usually is.<BR>Before you purchased the spell you knew it wasn't for a mage (not listed on the spell itself as a class that could use the spell) and you went from 2nd hand information that the spell would even work at all. You took the risk of purchasing the spell and trying it, and I agree with Verant that you cashed in on a bug for a short period of time, and now that the bug will be corrected, you want compensation, and I have to agree that none should be given :/<P>&gt;Though it did not show my class on the spell, I knew from various web sites that it was in fact a magician spell. Considering there is no ingame list, on a vendor or otherwise, we have only the websites to go to for information<P>If it doesnt show your class on the spell, then you're not supposed to be able to use it. I wouldn't say that "it was in fact a magician spell" cuz it isn't. It's clear that it isn't :) but it was a nice try though I'll give ya that :)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It fits my definition to a tee<P>why not make up for this nerf by giving us something really useful, (along the lines of the exp spells) like summon fishing grubs at level 60. Then we could travel around norrath selling beer and grubs to fisherman for phat lewt.

</FONT><HR>Actually your wrong Leolo on a few points.<P>1) I did not know it was a non-magician spell.. Yes it didnt' have the "magician' label on it, however I can think of several spells all KUNARK that also are 'labeled' wrong.  There are literly DOZENS of items ingame with incorrect descriptions so why should a spell be treated differently.<P>2) As for this spell not doing what a mage can do, that's also false.  We have a See Invisible spell, we have a spell which grants ultravision to other people as well. The only other benefit this spell had was a stamina buff , which is really only usefull in one dungeon in the entire world.  This spell was a convience for casting 2 different frequently asked for spells.<P>3) I'm not asking for any 'special' items or favors..  All that should happen is that the scroll should be returned to mages.. nothing more nothing less.   That way we still have our purchased/traded item and no harm is done. <P>If the fact that we were able to scribe  it at all was a bug then REVERSE the bug, or allow us to continue casting it.  To remove it 5 months later is just plain wrong!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>repost- from Casters Realm, in case Abashi should care to comment..Thanx Durmas for pointing this out<P>---<BR>Gordon,<BR>Tsk tsk tsk. Once again, you've gone and made a brash statement without thinking about how it might conflict with previous statements made by you or your company. As a former press secretary for a California State Assemblyman, all I can tell you is that you might want to think about a career change while you still can, because you have to be one of the worst PR guys I've ever met, and I've met some really lousy ones.<P>Here's a direct quote from the new item reimbursement policy from Verant:<P>"Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation.<P>You have admitted that this was a bugged spell, and you've further said multiple times in the past that, by design, the game provides players with as little information as possible to keep in line with the mystery and intrigue of the game. WIth those two factors in mind, and keeping with your new reimbursement policy, you are, in effect, committing a breach of contract if you do NOT reimburse players whom this has affected.<P>You can't merely hide behind some amorphous philosophy that things could change at any moment, A) it's unethical, B) it's unprofessional, C) It's illegal.<P>Perhaps you were absent from school the day they taught any of the above concepts.<P>Take some ownership here and reimburse those that will be negatively affected by this.<P>It's the right, moral, and obligatory thing to do.<P>Duramis Fizzlespell<BR>51st Level Wizard<BR>Innoruuk<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oh please.  A lvl 56( I think)  Shaman spell, and magi's get it at 16!!!  LOL, "I had no idea it was a bug!!"  Im seriously LMAO here.  EVERYONE knew about this bug, so did you, you said before you scribed it you saw it wasent mage usuable.  You also said you saw it on the bugboard.  You scribed it anyway?<P>This is a 50+ spell for shamans but all of the sudden Mages get it at 16??? Hahahahaha.  Im a 55 mage and I knew this was a mistake, so did every other 50+ mage on my server, just like the Malosi mistake several months ago.<P>Look at the logic.  Its a 50+ spell that doesent say mage on it yet you say you saw it on a website as a lvl16 mage spell.  Didnt that clue you in  that it was a bug????<P>Please people dont have sympathy, otherwise every single Necro that had a pet dual wield with a delay of 12 should have that restored, its the same principle.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Zowies. <P>You need to read a bit more carefully before you post.<P>First, I never said I didnt' know it was a bug.. I said I was not aware it was not a magician spell.  The level was clearly wrong, but not necessarily the ablity to cast.. Just as the malosi 'bug' you mention, we retained the ablitity to cast it. <P>Second, If you read again, you'll see that i mentioned that I did see it on the bug board as being Scheduled to be changed.. That was posted a day or two ago.. NOT 5 months back when Kunark was released and info on spells began to filter to the populace.<P><BR>The Duel weilding delay 'bug' (so claims verant) was not the same.  There was a MAJOR oversight in the power levels of the pet, this spell does not make a mage more powerful, only the added convience of the mana, and possibly the inclusion of the stamina regen which has extremely limited uses (1 dungeon).<P>Someone also pointed out to me ingame, that indeed this spell steps on the shamans 'toes' so to speak, by giving the magician another classes ablitys.  To that I'd point you all to the various Summoning spells which are now avaiable to any bard or rogue above level 45.<P>It seems obvious that the general public (or those that post here at least) thing that keeping the spell in magicians spellbooks is unacceptable. Fine, but what about refunding the scroll so we can give them to shamans or replacing it with another spell (though I dont' think that's possible due to codeing )<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"People making trades in game need to be aware that that there exists a chance that any item is likely to drop in value or usefulness after you buy it. It's sort of like buying stock in a company in that regard."<P>Just as an aside (not that this really matters), when you buy stock, the stock doesn't lose its functionality or become something that is was not when you bought it. It may lose value, or it might now be represented by a new company who bought out the old company, but a share of Coca-Cola won't become a Twix bar, meaning the nature of the share won't be changed because the company intended their shares to be less powerful or they didn't somehow coincide with their policy. They can do a stock split if they want, but only your per share value goes down, not your entire portfolio. <P>Imagine the uproar if Microsoft announced tomorrow that they think that too much of their company is publically held, so it is removing 50% of the shares from those who bought it.<P>What's the point? In EQ things change which have a dramatic impact on something people pay to experience as a challenge, as a social event, and as fun. I think ebay has proven that virtual items have real value and time is certainly money so noone is denying that items can have their real or fantasy value diminished. What is not right is when they have functionality diminished. <P>I'd humbly suggest that if VI cannot adequately game test items as they enter the world, that maybe they should hold off until smaller sets of items or spells have been more thoroughly tested. <P>I know the argument will be that tens of thousands of players can find bugs and uses for items far more easily then VI can. If this is truly the case, Abashi, perhaps each time a new item is introduced VI should make an announcement warning people that the following items are under "probation" and should be considered what they are...beta items which may be changed at any time. At least in this way, we don't have the false idea in the back of our heads that the world won't change just because someone else made a mistake.<P>I'll just chalk it up to poor word choice, and if you could see my face now you'd know this isn't a flame, I just think it was a bad metaphor for your gameworld, and a few suggestions to help avoid these annoying changes to items and spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yes, it's a blow to find the bug being fixed, but this was *known* to be bugged, and therefore known to be even more subject to change than everything else. You took a chance, and ended up unlucky, as VI fixed the bug before you had much use of the spell. Well, that's sad, but it happens. <P>Perhaps Paladins should get re-imbursements for all the trades they made for Deepwater Helms? They have a far better case. It's not going to happen for them, it's not going to happen for magicians. Live with it. There is no conflict with the recent statements on item re-imbursement, and the stock analogy - well, please, if you put money in a risky stock it can plummet at any time. Yes, I'd be mad if this had happened to me, but if you take a chance you sometimes end up losing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I think you should retro-actively fix all the crap that people have exploited if at all possible. <P>Now if you would just fix the charm pet bug in PvP I would be happy as a clam, but that is another thread.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Okay, quit flaming Meraxes on what he knew or not and when he did or didn't know it.  You're assuming the worst about his motives, and ignoring the facts he himself stated about when and how he learned things.  But that's the side issue.<P>The main issue is deciding what the most appropriate response to the 5-month old bug is, and whether Verant still needs to take further action to be fair and even-handed about it.<P>Those who flame Meraxes would ban people who flocked to the moss-covered twigs, exploited pie tins when they learned the price was going to change from Test, got manastones, masks of the deceiver, and even rubicite, etc., etc., etc.  That list is just for starters.  Basically, at least a third of the players have been just as "guilty" of something.  Do you think moss-covered twigs are going to just disappear from inventories, with no replacement?  Should they? (No)  Did manastones or masks of the deceiver disappear?  And you can bet if they did, they would be replaced in inventory by something semi-useful.<P>Acumen is a utility spell of very limited utility.  But at least it gives magicians some marginal usefulness to others when the vast majority of mage summoning spells do not.  So what if it can be scribed at level 16, since it takes a LOT of time from a level 50+ to actually get the scroll?  The spell itself is a combination of spells that magicians get in the low and mid levels anyway, except the Stamina component.  But, the stamina component isn't actually that huge, and not that big a deal especially when you consider the rarity of the spell.  The main reason any magician would get it is just because there are so few unique things to differentiate one 50+ mage from another, and this is rare.<P>Instead of just deleting the item from everyone's inventory, Meraxes was only suggesting that Verant do something like offer players who have a bugged item the chance to trade it to a GM for replacement with something of the sort of value that is appropriate for where the item was dropped.  Which is what they've done for numerous other, similar situations.  By that token, it should be replaced with a much more powerful spell, LOL.  But I think the people who got Acumen would be content with a scroll that does substantially the same thing, minus the Stamina.  It should summon a no rent item that confers Ultravision, See Invis, and Gaze.  (Yes, one of the low/mid level mage spells already summons an item with the effect of Gaze, another with Ultravision, and they can directly cast See Invis at 16th level.)<P>A reasonable suggestion, and something that would be consistent with Verant's previous actions.  It's also just the professional, courteous thing to do.  And makes good sense to anyone interested in treating customers like people instead of cattle.<P>-talan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Why not just make the spell usable by the magicians who already have it, but not until level 56? That way those who bought it, whether they knew it was a bug or not, get their spell in a more game-balancing way. It sounds like a pretty lame spell anyway, usefullness-wise, when compared to many other spells in the 30 lv range.<P>So, just make it castable by Mages at lv 56, but nerf it so it can't be scribed at all by mages anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>*chuckle* The real joke is Acumen being a level 56 spell at all. See invis, Ultravision and _stamina regeneration_ (?? What exactly does that component has to do with vision ??)... that would have been decent level 39 spell or a so-so level 44 one for a shaman, with an Acumen Mask being a nice summoned object for a level 44 or 49 magician. But a level 56 shaman spell? Ridiculous.<P>Not quite as ridiculous than a mage thinking he could get away with casting it at 16, though. Yeah, Magician get a see invis. And they do get an ultravision item (eventually at 29!). And they certainly do not get anything that regenerate mana, hp or stamina, EVER. <P>Did you really think you suddenly had a spell (at level 16, no less) that could do all three and that this was not a bug that would get fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004665&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004665&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
