</FONT><HR>First off let me say these changes are great!  I play a bard, and I am very excited about the exp changes.  But while we are on the verge of a big exp change...<P>Why don't you get rid of Hell levels.  I am not advocating making it easier to reach 60, nor post patch exp refund so to speak.  From my understanding of hell levels, due to the exp curve it takes more exp to gain exp on the 5th level(30,35 etc.) and visually hurts alot more in the next level if you die.<P>Why not make it so that the exp from say 41-45 is evenly (with each level being a bit harder to get obviously) spread out over the 5 levels as opposed to the majority clumped into 45.  45 would seem like an easier level, and 46 deaths wouldn't hurt so bad visually( i.e. what the player sees on the exp bar,) but the exp required to go from 41-45 wouldn't change.  Just the perception would change.  <P>Perception is reality.<P>Sadira<P>Oh, and fix my drum =p</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm working my way (WORKING) through level 45 so that I can accompany my guild to planes raids (On Tholuxe Paells the new server, everyone's getting ready too mostly).  But, I can tell from 45 that I couldn't stand to make it in the 50+ levels.  This might just make it bearable!<P>Finally Verant!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all I must say kudos goes out to the people at Verant for making an attempt to help out what I deem to be classes in need of some help.  Now that I've gotten that out of the way I need to complain a li'l bit. First of all this has been a known problem for about 2 years.  After a bit of tinkering with various classes upon release, I finally settled in with a ranger for my main character.  I have absolutely LOVED playing him.  Still the most fun class to me.  Unfortunately because of this newfound plethora of exp to be had by all, this will only hurry me along to the point where I can no longer play him.  At level 41 I'm already starting to see the lack of groups outside of the people I know/are in my guild wanting a ranger in their group.  No, it's not just rangers lacking in that area either though. It also includes (altho not to the same degree) pallies and sk's.  And it stems from the fact that they are not as powerful in ANY regard as their parent class.  It was mentioned earlier in posts that the  exp penalty is something that 'most every rp'r has come to accept as fact that hybrids will suffer an exp penalty, but will also have some BENEFIT from being that hybrid.  Now we don't expect to be full bred warriors walking around with the spells of necros/cleric/druids, but please don't ignore the fact that there are many hybrids out there (high level especially) that are lacking in grouping opportunities due to the fact that they are hybrid not because they "suck exp".  While not being the most powerful class around, I  DO feel that in a good group my ranger CAN and IS a valuable member (for now at least, not sure about 50+ as I'm not there yet).  I feel I play him well and a good group that knows their business e.g. my friends can bring out the best in him.  Unfortunately I'm not friends with the entire server as I'm sure all hybrids are not.  So often times I'm shunned from groups just because of the class I play.  Why take a hybrid in the group when you can have the parent warrior class?  And this problem only increases as we level. The mobs hit harder and harder and hybrids just are not geared to take that beating.  And our spells, while useful, are not enough to make us a good addition (in most peoples eyes) to a party; especially if the casting side parent class is present which pretty much annuls most of our spells.  I know this has turned into a rant somewhat.  I also know that Aradune/Abashi have mentioned earlier that they are NOT completely finished balancing the classes.  So I ask you to PLEASE not ignore this fact on ALL hybrid classes in your deliberation of what is "balanced".  In the beginning, we traded that exp for what should be a powerful character.  Please help us to be so.  If not THE most powerful characters around, at least try to make us useful enough to where we can still get in some good groups now and again   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> .  I know it's been said but I'll say it again, " if you doubt this, create a highish level hybrid and go to a zone in which no one knows you.  ask for a group when pure classes are also asking."<P>Overall this should be a bonus that's applicable to every class.  And whether this remains a final fix, or a partial fix until later for hybrids, kudos again to the Verant team for your efforts.  We thank you for what is most definately NOT a nerf!  =)<P>W.T.<BR>Ranger of the 41st level on Innoruuk server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only downside of it is say for high level people with a penalty they are essentially losing alot of exp because the change is not retroactive.<BR>for int casters roughly 9%<BR>for monks roughly 17%<BR>for hybrids (that includes bards?) roughly 29%<P>by that i mean if someone powerleveled an SK after the "change" they would need 29% less exp to get to the same level as you.<P>They're arguement for not doing it is that hybrids and monks will jump a few levels. eg. a monk over halfway thru 54 would become almost 57, or a 55 ranger would become 59. <P>*shrug* <P>I can see both sides of the arguements for not making the change retroactive. Although if you asked me I would say the hybrids that are going to get this jump have done the time, a 55 ranger isn't going to learn that much more becoming 59. Hell a 55 ranger can know alot more then a 59 ranger depending on how the person got there.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, I'm impressed.  I'm a 49th enchanter who likes to solo because I almost always get better experience this way.<P>If I kill 1 mob every 5 minutes (normal rate), that's 12 mobs an hour.  A full group would have to kill 72 mobs minus 7 mobs (10% bonus), or 65 mobs an hour.  That's 55 seconds per mob, sustained without pause.  Good luck.  Then factor in xp penalty classes in the game pulling an additional 5-10% of my xp per kill, my grouping bonus was just barely cancelling that out.  So I got better xp solo or partnered, and grouped for entertainment or to aleve solo boredom.<P>Intelligence casters like myself will receive 10% xp tacked onto their xp/kill group award.  Snooches.<P>Monks will receive 20% xp/kill tacked on in group.  Boochies.<P>Hybrids will be receiving 40% xp/kill tacked on in group.  Sweet.<P>NOTE to Hybrids - My 'chanting butt ate that xp penalty right along side you for those levels, so don't act like you're the only one who suffered.<P>Now... those on the 1.0 modifier (Wisdom casters if I recall) see no change to their xp/kill.  No problem.<P>EVERYONE who ever grouped with an experience penalized class no longer suffers for it.  Great.<P>Now for my questions I have:  I would greatly like to see an Abashi/Absor reply to this as I hope to take advantage of full disclosure here.  These are issues likely thought of, but I want to know what is and isn't being changed:<P>1.  Warriors and Rogues have 10% xp bonus, because they require 10% less xp.  Halflings require 5% less xp because of their races.  Will they be receiving and xp "penalty" in group to keep them from shooting ahead of group members?  This seems justifiable.<P>2.  Races that have an xp penalty (5% for Barbarian, 15% for Ogre, 20% for Troll/Iksar) will fall behind group members.  It's not a "small impact".  20% means that in 5 levels advanced with a non-penalty partner, they will have advanced 6 levels.  Granted, being level 45 when they are 50 isn't a HUGE disparagement, as you will not be ungroupable.  How is this being viewed?<P>3.  Solo fighting hasn't been mentioned.  While EQ is group-oriented, it's acknowledged that many solo do to various desires.  Will this "xp out of the air" apply to solo as well?  I'm under the impression the answer is no.  That means that my dark elf necromancer will require 15% more xp than the halfling druid over there soloing.  The halfling warrior will level MUCH faster than the troll shadowknight while soloing (very viable through level 20).  That's a 15% bonus to xp table for the halfling warrior, and a 60% xp penalty for the troll shadowknight.  So the question again, will the "free xp" be applied to ALL kills, or just grouped kills?<P>I understand the reasoning for just adding the "free xp".  It stops the penalty dead in it's tracks and doesn't require recalculating levels.  But if it's not going to apply to soloing, then hybrids are going to be FORCED to group to advance well.<P>4.  Last question.  As everyone is losing xp at death on a 1.0 scale now instead of 0.9 from warriors, and penalty classes will lose additional xp based on their race/class.  Will halflings/warriors/rogues lose LESS xp?  This seems like they should, even from a coding standpoint--it should likely be a blanket multiplier.  (Level-1)(XP Factor) = XP lost.<P>The reason I mention this is the impact SOLOING will have.  A dark elf necromancer is out soloing *gasp* and bites off more than he can chew, and feign death doesn't save him.  He loses xp at a 1.1 factor based on the previous level.  No problem--everyone is affected this way.  Now he starts earning the xp back--SOLO, is he getting xp/kill on a 1.0 factor or 1.1?  This is a GIANT penalty to traditionaly solo caster classes (necromancers especially).<P>Xornn Mier'noen (Nameless Souls)<BR>49th High Elf Enchanter<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Increasing the loss due to death is absolutely appropriate as per the other changes.

</FONT><HR>I have just one question.<P>If the graphical representation of your numerical exp, your "bubbles", is relative to your current amount of exp, then with the changes, upon death, shouldn't it look like you lost the same amount of exp, regardless of class? Using the example, the SK loses 126,000 exp, where he also has more exp to lose that from, and as the cleric loses 90,000 exp from a smaller total exp, so the total graphical change should be the same, shouldn't it?<P>Kryss Tallin<P>45 Bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is the most disgusting change ever made, I completely agree with Metreus and some (only a few of course) others, and like him I find it hard not to vomit.<P>For more than 50 lvls I have been playing a DE SK as my main character, dealing with all the penalties and such, because SK's and other hybrids were supposed to get better as they lvl, and their versatility and special abilities should make all of it worthwile in the end. Verant still didn't find the right ways to reward the hybrids for that efford though. Penalty yes, reward no. But there was always the hope they would find the right way, and actually, some of last weeks changes made one hope.<P>Now they said that instead of rewarding the hybrids, they gonna make them equal to the other classes played by people that didn't want to take the challenge to play a hybrid. All has been useless and in vain.<P>All mages, necro's, clerics who easily got to lvl 60 and have billions of pp will just create twink sk's, pals and rangers and lvl them to 60 in no time. These changes are in no way helpfull to people who always have played a hybrid, they are intented for people that wanted to play one but where too wimpy for it. Its a slam in the face to everyone who did put the effort in it.<P>Its so incredible stupid a 'solution' I can't find words toi describe it. Instead of fixing the problem (missing rewards for effort put into the game), they make it so everyone can now do the same without the effort. It's a complete lack of respect for paying customers.

VI has just announced the greatest boon they have ever given us since the creation of the game, and people are whining about it?! Gods...<P>Those complaining about the increased xp loss at death: Did you somehow instantly forget the fact that you would be getting MORE XP OFF THE SAME KILLS when you saw "higher death penalty"? This, by the sound of it, MORE than nullifies the increased death penalty...<P>Learn to read, people. Learn to appreciate gifts. So what if you've already gotten your main char to 60? Your next char will get there faster... Be thankful for that. First people whine because they don't level fast enough, now they whine because levelling has been sped up.

</FONT><HR>Abashi said:<P>Breeze, <BR>The problem that you suggested was considered, but it *really* isn't the case. Basically, everyone is back to losing the same percentage of the experience required for the level at which it was computed. In other words, if a cleric loses 20% of the experience for the previous level (a bit extreme), so will the paladin, but the paladin's is a larger number (Since he required more experience).<P>(end)<P>Abashi,<P>Actually you are wrong.  Say the ranger takes a 40% penalty initially.  He still does take that penalty by the way BEFORE any further calculations are made.  Then, after taking the 40% penalty he takes a 40% increase of exp that you claim is taken out of thin air.<P>All the added 40% does is exactly offset the penalty incurred earlier in the calculation.<P>So, the end result is that upon death the ranger will take a 40% penalty without anything to offset it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Overall, great patch.  This Ranger thanks you from the bottom of his heart.<P>However, one thing to think about with level based experience loss.<P>You are level 43, you die.  You lose experience based on being level 43 and gain experience based on being level 43.<P>You finally ding 44.  You die and lose a level.  You JUST LOST the level 44 equivalent of experience death IN LEVEL 43!!.  And to make matters worse, you are only accruing experience based on level 43!  You just took what could be a huge death penalty there.<P>What are the level based percentages?  This is important to know because, now you have shifted the problem of people not getting groups based on class, to people not getting groups based on level.  If the level percentages are extremely minor, please let us know that.<P>And, like I said before, thank you VERY much!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, it only took them 2 years to realize something was wrong.  Because for a year now I've been in 3-4 person groups, and if we can hold the spawns, I don't like to let other people into the group who would suck up exp. Similarlily, I've sat in dungeons for 3-4 hours begging people to let me in their groups. And I don't really blame them when they don't, because I realize that by letting me in their group, it means they would level much slower.  Finally, this is going to be fixed.<P>Do you realize what this means Verant? It means I can go back to playing my Troll SK after 9 MONTHS of abandoning him because I could never get a group.  It means I can play the game again.  It means people will have MUCH more fun and much less downtime.  <P>I have to say, I am very happy with the new changes, but I can't believe it took 2 years to figure out these problems when players have been crying about just that for months now trying to get them changed.

</FONT><HR>Heh, I suggested this exact method of dealing with the xp penalty about 6 months ago, when Verant first claimed that there was no easy way to get rid of the xp penalty.  Maybe someone was listening after all.  Long time readers here may remember this formula:<P>hybrid_xp_for_mob = xp_for_mob * (hybrid_xp_for_level / warrior_xp_for_level)<P>That being said, as nice as it is, it does nothing to address the main issue facing Paladins and Shadow Knights (and, to a lesser extent, Rangers), which is our lack of specialization that makes us a NEEDED class at the highest levels, against the toughest mobs in the game.  I guess, though, that the xp changes will result in more people reaching level 60 and realizing that they are in the same boat they always were in, which may result in more whining and perhaps a change, since whining is all Verant seems to listen to (see: Verant's numerous Ranger enhancements).<P>What still needs to happen:<P>- Pal/SK offense improved (raise Offense and Weapon Proficiency skill caps, Bash and Riposte).<P>- Ranger Defense improved<P>- more non-Cleric spells for Paladins, whose spell selection looks great on paper but in reality is rather weak because there are always Clerics around in high-level groups, thereby rendering most Paladin spells useless.<P>- better weapon selection for Paladins, who have for some reason been given far less class-specific weapons than any other melee class since the introduction of RoK.  And 1-handers are the key here, since Paladins have an Epic class 2-hander. <P>- More and better shields are a must as well.  Shields haven't improved much since before RoK, though weapons have, which results in a disadvantage for those who can't dual wield (SK and Pal), because their offhand is not equipped with level 60 caliber items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Xornn-Nameless,<P>&gt;&gt;3. Solo fighting hasn't been mentioned. While EQ is group-oriented, it's acknowledged that many solo do to various desires. Will this "xp out of the air" apply to solo as well? I'm under the impression the answer is no.&lt;&lt;<P>You are thinking of a soloer as a special case, but I suspect they are treated as just a group of one. Notice that when you loot a mob when soloing, it says you split the cash with the group?<P>I am placing my bets that the "xp out of thin air" applies to soloers as well.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think getting rid of the hybtrid XP penalty is simply outstanding.  It should have happened a long time ago, but it's still a very positive change.<P>That being said, I think your choice of implementation (keep your old 1.4-penalized XP-level table, but get a 1.4 bonus on XP per kill) is an embarrisngly poor kludge.  You really should make a one-time conversion of XP (ala mapping 34.59% of the way through level 35 into the new expereince table, maintaining the status of being 34.59% of the way through level 35) for each person.  The way you are doing it is programming nightmare and the userbase isn't going to grasp the subtleties.   There should be "One True XP Table" that any person can refer too and quickly understand, race penalties be damned.<P>Still, I'm glad you guys finally backed down on this 'dead issue'.  I'm very happy with EQ.  Thanks for giving me such a wonderful and economical avenue of entertainment.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047840-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047840&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047840&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
