</FONT><HR>Over the last several weeks of watching the class talks and then seeing what has been put on the TEST server, I have noticed 1 consistant thing, Wizards have been almost completely left out. The only thing I have seen you do is nerf one item (dagger of frost) we have and you [censored] it up pretty good. Now you cannot even use it to kill a wisp because the nerf made it NO DROP and NON-MAGICAL! Why!?<P>Are you so completely stumped with the wizard that that you do not know what to do for us? I have waited patiently for some true class adjustments that will make us desireable in groups. NADA.<P>Maybe Verant should clean house and get some people in there who can figure this out and see what needs to be done to balance this. I don't see any responses from Absor on this issue either. Nor did I see any decent ideas that would make wizards group friendly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  The problems with the wizard are blatant and obvious.  It's been that way long before Velious came out.  But apparently buffing up druids is a more important priority at Verant.<P>And yeah, somebody at Verant has a tough time grasping simple logic.  They're so defensive about preserving the cleric's role as healer while they dole out wizard-calibre DDs to every caster in the game.<P>Wizards have a ridiculous quest to get a lower aggro spell while enchanters, clerics, rangers and rogues can either buy from vendors or train in it.  Then Absor defends the brain bite quest by saying it's a "great spell" and we should have to earn it.  UHHHH.   That would be OK if the other casters/meleers had to form a RAID PARTY to get theirs too.<P>We, the "masters of DD" have to loot/research for Ice Comet while druids can buy a spell of the same power right off a vendor.  Plus Sunstrike is loot/trade only.  What the heck.<P>Druids can buy their Velious ports off a good base-faction druid vendor while we have to either raise dragon faction or get somebody to buy them  for us.  MAJOR inconsistency.<P>ALL wizard quest items are NO DROP.  I can't even sell this stuff when I get something better. <P>Our epic quest item grants breeze and a hp shield while being in the top 3 most difficult quests.  Mages have tough one too but at least they get a truely awesome reward.<P>Druid and shaman get right-click free DOT gear and meleers get OUR spells on weapon procs while we have to raid frickin Veeshan's Peak.  Heck there's a ranger weap that procs Conflagration.  Drops in Howling Stones.  That's really fair.<P>I could run through EVERY SINGLE spell level and find another class with a DD virtually the same as wizard's.  Whether that be in damage per cast or mana efficiency.  We also get beaten in several different types of AE DD at some levels.  See level 51 mage PB AE and 49 druid AE Column for examples.  Or enchanter level 39 AE column.<P>Meanwhile these other classes get a full set of soloing skills and/or very nice grouping spells.<P>And that's the worst part.  Wizards have to go through hell and high water to be equal or barely better in ONE area while having a tough time finding groups at ALL levels and lacking self-sufficient soloing ability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, <BR>I have to admit that being a wizard does have a few advantages. When I go on raids, if I want to go afk....say to go grocery shopping or if I want to cut the grass, all I have to do is /follow on one of my group members and then come back whenever I want. The reason wizards are able to do this is because any contribution they make really isnt enough to be noticed and can be done by most other casting classes.<P>I do have to return for the end of the raid though, so I can port folks out.<P>Now, this really isnt why I choose to be a wizard, but I will enjoy this part of my class. I can solo when Im not on raids (hard to find a group though).<P>I wish however, that the choice to be a wizard came with a disclaimer. I choose not to be a necro/mage because I didnt want to solo the whole time. I have soloed from lvl 29+ due to the difficult time it takes for me to get a group. I also thought I was going to be good at dealing damage....which I am in a few limited situations. Unfortunately, so are most of the other classes. I  play the other classes.....most to about lvl 20 and only the enchanter had as hard a time in those early lvls.....I was soloing yellows with the others.  I figured there would be reward later for picking a wizard. Oh well.<P>Again, this is probably my last online game of this type.....I spend to much time as it is doing this....I enjoy playing and have leveled steadily with soloing, but wish either my class came with a warning that I would suck in groups (I cant keep up with constant pulls) or that I had picked another class.<P>Sarmaldor<BR>59 wiz<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are the albatross around Verant's neck.<P>In many ways, Wizards are a great example of how little Verant know about its own game, and how little it respects its players.<P>Wizards have almost zero group utility, almost zer reason to pick them over someone else. <P>Verant said:<P>"WHEN IT COMES TO DISHING OUT DAMAGE, WIZARDS HAVE NO RIVAL"<P>They have been proved wrong time and time again about this.<P>They have waffled about the meaning, when the meaning to all the wizards was obvious.<P>Velious just makes it worse. Wizards are practically usless in groups.<P>You go on a big raid? You want to make sure you group gets no exp? Invite some wizards, you're sure to get none.<P>No class fails to live up to its promise like Wizards...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You Wizards do have something to be happy about.<P>They have upgraded both the people in the game who are closest to you in DDhood - mages and druids.<P>Which means, if they give you better nuking abilities, they are quite justified.  After all, mages pets are now nearly universally useful.  They can put them down in a corner and summon them.  They can keep up without sow.  They are immune to fear.<P>Druids can heal, they have unique buffs, they can regen.<P>Before, often, their primary use in a group was nuking.  Now, they have stuff that they can contribute without nukes, even in ubermob encounters.<P>So, while before they could have some arguement that you being amazingly better at nuking was unbalanced, now you, and SOL[1], can point at their recent upgrades and say 'but, you just got something quite nice, shut your trap.'<P>It is your only hope.<P>[1]: SOL: Sony OnLine.

</FONT><HR>Ok Verant, this is getting rediculus. Every other thread in EVERY section of the entire forum is about how bad wizzards are getting the shaft. This has been going on for a while now. So, you improve other classes, and then do it again. Including rivaling classes, which should never be able to rival our DD (but do anyway). And what about us wizzards? Nothin. No comments in the forum. Not one. No news about looking at wizzards, no nod to our pain. Nothin on test server. No inclination that you give two craps about how bad you have nerfed an entire CLASS in the game. So, I mean, what do you want me to take from all this? Cause, right now, I'm takin it to mean a big "SCREW YOU" to the wizzards. A big middle finger should pop up every time I choose my wizzard. Maybe a lewd animation depicting actions normally only found in prision. Cause that's exactly what you are doing to us. And not only are you doin it, but it's like you're enjoying it. Like you're all just sitting around, laughing your a** off, playing a game with us. "lets see here, if we screw them little by little, lets see how much we can get away with before there are no wizzards left". Well, as much as I hate to satisfy you guys, you know what? You wont get away with much more before you've pushed us all out the door. And I don't know about the other wizzies around here, but if I am forced to del my wizzard, I am buying Diablo II, and deleting EQ off of my harddrive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are clerics without CH!<P>If you really think about it thats what we are. Take CH away from clerics and then compare them to shaman or druids and thats the relationship that currently exsists between wizards and their rivals the magician and druid.<P>Wizards do DD and thats it, we should therefore be given a definitive advantage when it comes to that. Really when you think about it wizards should be nuking for twice what any other class can do, its only fair.<P>Realistically though i think the recent silence about wizards isn't them ignoring us (god knows that would be in character) but because they are doing some seriouse overhauling and its just going to take some time. With the huge increases to druids and mages i truely hope wizards will get some nice things.<P>Mysthyl </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

He always had me rolling on the floor in laughter.  Grim had just started posting back then when I gave up and made a cleric.  Now I wish I made a druid.  'Course if I did or do, 6 months later, 2/3's of my available mana pool gets "nerfed" into oblivion because of "imbalance" or "VI intelligence improvement".<P>Good luck guys.

</FONT><HR>Yeah I have been at this since around July of last year, when it became clear something was sadly wrong.  The message boards seemed the only place I could try to get something done or at least noticed.  Sadly most WIzards at the time were so ignorant of other classes and how their own damn spells worked (most thought AE spells were suicidal) that they thought the few of us who saw the problems were just whining idiots.<P>Oh well, times have changed and even Verant has finally started to say something isn't quite right.  In time we'll see, but guys, lets let them work on the other classes and get their damage and healing and such worked out.<P>Think about it a bit.  Getting Wizards done without everyone else being looked at in the context of Wizards is why we have Clerics and Druids blasting harder than Wizards for the earliest levels.  Its why Magicians get a bolt that does more damage than WIzards and Druids get a blast that casts faster than anything we have since level 4.  They didn't spend even a few minutes looking it over and that's why we ended up in this situation to start with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK I'm not defending Verant in the least, The only thing that keeps us from getting upgrades in damage spells is our soloing abilitys. You give a level 35+ wizard a pair of JBoots or a couple stacks of sow potions. And we are probably in the top 3 classes for soloing, if not the best class.<P>And the problem with these % damage spells, they would have to have a insane amount of recast time such as harvest. Or next thing you know you would have Wizards kiting dragons and such. (a joke but you get the point)<P>So Verants whole problem is, how do they make wizards more balanced without,<P>1. over powering our solo abilitys and making us the power level kings.<P>2.give us other classes abilitys and making it look like they are trying to turn us into soemthing that we are not.<P>3.make us better without hitting us so hard with the big fat nerf stick, "such as take away snare" that you would have every wizard in the game screaming in horror.<P>While I agree 100% with every single persons post about the short coming of wizards on this thread, It is very hard to come up with a idea to make wizards better and not unbalance the soloing ability that we already have.<P>As a wizard we have the freedom of travel which is absolutly one of the most to say the least convenient spells in the game. So we can go anywhere we want to hunt in almost under 10-20 minutes.<P>We do have some serious issues with grouping and I have suggested that we get some kind of self only breeze spell. But still that would give our solo abilitys a plus. And I really think Verant hates us being able to solo so easily. They have mentioned already that they wanted to find a way to nerf kiting/quad kiting because they thought the reward far outweighed the risk. But i totally disagree, You take your character and suffer from 10-15 minutes of downtime between mobs. And see how long you last without getting so bored you just dont hit that camp button.<P>In short I want to be more usefull in raids and have more group friendly spells and feel wanted/needed in the big picture besides playing Taxi. But if we look at the things through Verants point of view. It becomes very obvious why they are having such a hard time making any upgrades to wizards.<P>Domy Nation &lt;L'Malla&gt;<BR>48 Wiz<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
