</FONT><HR>On why some players choose to solo rather than group:<P>The point of soloing is to try gain experience at a faster rate so you can level faster and gain better spells earlier than your peers so you would be more helpful to them. If you're useless to your friends in the end why do you still play this class and endure 60 levels of boredom (assuming you are really stupid enough to solo all the way)?<P>Now, with the two expansions, the world is designed around the concept of grouping. Group and dungeon experience bonus, group/raid friendly spell additions, hybrid experience penalty removal, Skyfire as the only post-50 soloing zone, outdoor soloable spawn time change and numerous other changes have made it much, much better to group than solo. No one in their sane mind will solo all the way from 50 to 60.<P>Now, the power of a class is measured by their ability to contribute in a grouping situation. Not everyone can see through this, but to someone (I don't) who has both a 60 enchanter and 60 necromancer, he can easily see just how weak and pathetic the necro class has become. So tell me Absor, about the immense power that the necromancer wields. Show me where such power lies in a 6 player group and a 36 player raid. Explain to me the logic of placing artificial restrictions on necromancers spells so only *one* necro is needed in any group AND raid when Brad goes around telling everyone to group.<P>In my humble opinion, the necro class at present is far too weak.<P>What are Sedulous Subversion, Touch of Night and Emissary of Thule compared to:<P>1. Greater Voceration, Scars of Sigil and Aegis of Ro<BR>2. Gift of Pure Thought, Wonderous Rapidity and Rapture<BR>3. Lure of Ice, Sunstrike and Ice Spear of the Solist<BR>4. Focus of Spirit, Malo and Turgur's Insects<BR>5. Protection of the Glades, Wildfire, Shield of Blades<BR>6. Aegolism, Complete Healing and Celestial Elixir<P>There you have it, arguably 3 most useful spells to a group from each of the 7 classes and you can see other than the necromancer, the other 6 classes are GROUP-FRIENDLY.<P>Sedulous Subversion is NOT group friendly.<BR>Touch of Night is resisted.<BR>Emissary of Thule dies in a few seconds of AoE or ripostes.<P>End result: Necros? Oh they can summon corpse! And that's it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have led Trakanon raids before, which is arguably one of the hardest organisation tasks in the game. Being raid leader I have to know, intimately, the abilites of ALL 14 classes so as to form the best groups and use each class to the best advantage of their abilites.<P>And I can tell you straight in the face. The 60 necromancer is so weak in a group and raid it's not even funny.

</FONT><HR>I don't understand why everyone thinks that giving up 4 hours of play time for a res is acceptable -<P>Are we just afraid of asking for something?<P>Reduce downtime - make clerics happy by reducing load on them - give us the 49 res with a component that costs lots of cash - just TAKE OUT the emeralds...  <P>How can it be group friendly or make us balanced - no other class in the game has to pay for a utility spell with other people's time played.<P>You want to make the game better on downtime - you want to blance our class - if we could backup res this would make us one more class that people would want.  <P>We have the best ability to survive an encounter with Harmshield, Fiegn Death, Gate, etc.  - if the group gets wiped out having just us survive can get us back up and running - it would be a GREAT HELP to groups.  <P>I still don't understand why everyone thinks EE's are good even for the res spell - to little to late - I would understand using EE's for a res spell that necro's get BEFORE clerics (i.e. we get a 50% res at 29 that costs an EE that we can use on lvl 20-60 people) That would mean we necros are ripping the power of clerics from them at a high price... however to get the res after a cleric - and be less effective - is not worth the price to pay.<P>A necro doesn't become a lich for the looks and women.  He does it because it is so much more power than others - even if it costs him for it.  Keep this in mind - I really think if we have such a high price to pay for our spells/power we should have the power we pay for.<P>If you keep EE's in the game the necro res should do 100%  res.<P>- Ckorik</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Scenario: We recently killed a particular mob that if aggroed upon would easily kill our entire guild, (guild representation was around 30 that night wiht lvls ranging from 53 to 60) Okay, this is one bad boy. Strategy: Summon a few pets from a particular class. Send pets to kill mob while clerics cast Com Heal on pets. Necros dumped mana to clerics. The rest of the guild sat on their butts and watched. The warriors were chomping at the bit to fight..but they had to stay back...we had to use our brains rather than sheer firepower. Two spells were cast in that entire battle... Complete Heal and Sedulous Subversion (each spell was obviously cast several times). My point is...many classes were rendered useless for that ONE battle. But without the Necros dumping mana, we would never have won. How do I know?...because this was our second attempt on this mob. The first attempt ended with a TPW because we tried to Blast and Slash like usual."<P><BR>Powerbait, we're all very impressed with how you used fire pets to kill the Queen in Chardok. (Or maybe Rak'Ashir in CoM if your goals are lower.) In fact, we're snickering on IRC about your attempt to conceal the mob, and even the type of pet.<P>It's hardly a required strategy, and hardly "secret". Stop trolling - this thread is for our own benefit.<P>For everyone else - I'm impressed. Everything I could possibly think of, has been covered.

</FONT><HR>I would rather you change nothing at all then you nerf the Lich line of spells.  This spell is something a necro uses 99% of the time.  If for some reson this spell is nerfed (or fixed as absor put it) our soloing capabilities would be reduced by atleast 30%.  There is no way VI could justify making us a barely passable solo class and useless in raids.  We have to be desirable in raids (meaning that we would be able to perform some roll better or atleast as good as any other class) if our soloing ability is hurt.  Currently we can't do anything even 1/3 as good as a top class in any skill desired in a raid other then poison buff.  That is just a complete joke.  <P>Mana Battery?? heck, even with the massive ammount of Mana I have, I can hardly give a caster more then a couple high level spells more in a fight.  <P>I say leave us alone as far as everything goes except please throw us a bone and fix the bones series of spells so they aren't useless against raid mobs.  Fixing Defoliation is a no-brainer, because the spell is only able to be cast on 1 blue mob that I know of at the level it is obtained (hangman).  <P>--Vaevictis Asmadi<BR>level 57 Necro Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess one thing i do not understand about Necromancers in this game is why they can only summon skeletons? I heard you can also summon a spectre at really high level, but what about the rest of the undead. Skeletons are a good staple, but it seems to me that Necros should be able to have other undead as pets too. The advantage would be different undead would have some sort of special ability.<P>IE: <BR>-Zombies are rotting flesh, so would have some sort of nausea effect. Maybe this would translate into am AC debuff.<P>-Vampires is not hard to figure out.<P>-Most spirit undead have some sort of life drain, str drain.<P>-Liches have spells.<P>Other effects could include disease (mummies), curse (lowers attack), fear, etc.<P>Necromancers are supposed to be the masters of ALL undead, not just skeletons. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The more of the thread I read, the more disheatened I became towards my future as a necro, so I decided to stop reading after the first set of pages and just post and depart.<P>My views are that of one who has played 2 mages to late teens, 2 enchanters to late teens, 1 necro to 25th and my present necro (main character) to 35th.  As such, I can not speak on the post 50 issues other than to say that if mannabattery is still our role when I get there I'm going back to a mage or enchanter.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In our early levels we get some self only buffs (Grim Aura, Vampiric Embrace and Banshee Aura), but to my knowlede there are 1 shot spells that do not branch to a full line later.  I would very much like to see these lines expanded with an upgrade that is castable on our pets (other players would be nice, but a bit unreasonable).  Mages who are the master of pets have several ways to make their pets better, so it seems reasonable to give the secondary pet users some way to extend the functionality of their pets as well.  When you consider that if your pet does more then 50% damage, having additional ways to buff your pet's offensive capability would effectivly become a trade off between safety and exp.<P>Siphon strength is another spell that could be expanded to a full line as well as branched to drains for other stats.  Or the inverse of those as well if you wanted us to be more group friendly.<P>I also like the idea of a self only TP, but I dont see much hope for it.  My idea for sucha  spell would be shadow gate and could only be cast at nighttime and be self only.  The locations for such a spell should be limited and also more dangerous (maybe TP you to a shadowman alter, or to necro guildhalls which would bring faction in as an issue).<P>I'm realy hoping the lich line does not get nerfed, but I'm not too optimistic about that, so I want to bring up another idea.  In the enchanter thread you seemed to indicate that you felt enchanters having skeleton illusion was not appropriate and that it treaded on necro ground.  If that is the case, how bout necros getting a skeleton illusion that does not give any hp/mana conversion. (as an iksar, I was glad to get CoB since its better faction for me in some places than my race faction, but if it is nerfed to be as intended, its usefullness for travel will also be mitigated).<P>Darkness spells.<BR>I would GLADLY sacrifice the damage aspect of the darkness line in order for less resists and/or less agro caused by casting it.<P>Some of my next ideas have already been suggested in various forms, but I'll add my 2cp for my support of the ideas.<P>Alternate pets.<P>Summon Drybone<BR>Summon Icebone<BR>Summon Ghoul<BR>Summon Mummy<P>ANIMATE DEAD (new spell)<BR>Similar to magician summon monster line.<BR>Instead of summoning a monster, allow necros to animate a mob they have killed, but have some atrophy to reflect its undead state.  When the monster is summoned, it should have around the same hp, but hit for the damage of a pet of that level instead of its native damage.  This has the added balance that the monster must fist be killed, and can not be looted in order to animate it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If the intention of Verant is to make necromancers group friendly (and I hope it is), there are 10 things you should change.<P>(1) Make 50+ lifetaps unresistable with the level cap. Easy way to do this is to make them save versus disease and therefore this change will not affect shadowknights whose best lifetap is Drain Soul, the 49 necro lifetap.<P>(2) Maintain current ratio of mana transfer to keep it as a downtime reduction method during mass buffing rather than something strategic during boss encounters. Read my earlier post on page 2 in Part 2 which details how changing this ratio affects delicate game balance.<P>(3) Maintain current dots and make Ignite/Chill Bones a normal DD with an upgraded damage to mana ratio without the recast, skeleton illusion and unstackability OR give new dots that are the reverse of cleric's Celestial Healing/Elixir (ie. GROUP FRIENDLY dots) and maintain current recast time of Ignite/Chill Bones.<P>Note: Chill Bones is 510 damage for 210 mana (bad ratio), 6 seconds casting time (long), 12 seconds recast time (very long), all or nothing (high resistability) and skeleton illusion. But necros use this spell extensively in normal every day grouping for want of a more group friendly damage spell.<P>(4) Make 50+ pets a linear upgrade from 44 and 49 pets with immunity to normal fear, good magic/poison/disease resists and dagger speed buff. This makes it our primary source of damage. The 59 pet should be able to outdamage a 59 warrior but not out-tank him. Remove lifetap proc if you wish but lifetaps are there to break root so it already has its disadvantage. Also, this justifies the higher cost of our pet buff compared to mages.<P>(5) Make Convergence return 96-100% experience. Make Infusion a similar spell like Harvest (with the lower mana boost) that requires but doesn't consume an Essence Emerald OR make it require another reagent and remove its recast time. Make Trucidation require the same recast time with no reagent OR remove its recast time and make it require a peridot or a special gem bought from Neriak and Cabilis.<P>(6) Remove night-time only requirement on Levant, Skin like the Shadow and Quivering Veil of Xarn and give Death Peace at 60. If stacking issues of Quivering Veil of Xarn is too hard to fix simply remove the spell and give Death Peace at 58. Also, remove the 115% magnification on Skin like the Shadow. If you feel the need to balance out the spells for removing the night-time only requirement, here's what you can do. Make Levant suck up caster mana like wizard's Evacuate. Lower duration of Skin like the Shadow as a fixed invisibility spell. Remove some benefits of Quivering Veil.<P>(7) Make Defoliation work on all plants. Give us 29 Defoliate. It currently does not exist.<P>(8) Lower aggro and resistability on Scent line of spells. Make the spell debuff more and covers all Fire, Cold, Poison and Disease (not magic). Give an upgrade to Scent at 60 that is unresistable like Tash, Malo and Mala.<P>(9) Move Demi Lich to 55 and keep Arch Lich at 60. Lich is currently 20 hp to 20 mana, so therefore make Demi Lich 26 hp to 26 mana and Arch Lich 32 hp to 32 mana with spectre illusion. As for the Lich bug, test the benefits of using Lich, Demi Lich and Arch Lich against using Clarity 2 in various grouping situations. If Lich is overpowered, then fix it. If it is not, then maintain current 3:2 ratio on spell and leave the bug as it is, or change the ratio to 1:1 and fix the bug.<P>(10) Change current Root spell order to the proper order of Root, Enstill, Immobilize and Paralyzing Earth.<P>These 10 points covered all my concerns for the post-50 game and goes a long way to make necromancers group friendly and wanted in raids in the grouping EverQuest of today.<P>If the intention of Verant is to make the necromancer a solo class with hardly anything decent to offer to a group, then sadly this game only has 13 classes. It is easy to see why the necromancer class requires the most upgrades since it's caught like an odd child that is designed to solo at the beginning while the game has changed significantly into a grouping game half way through, with the release of Kunark and Velious.<P>Sern<BR>59 Defiler<BR>Harbinger of Storms</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*Sigh* Not sure if anyone else has brought this up or not, I don't have the nerve to sit down and read all of these posts but here I go.<P>What exactly do necromancers have unique to them that no one else can do in any shape way or form? Well now that Shadow Knights can summon corpses, my guess is that it is nothing... Enchanters for mana, Clerics for heals, Enchanters for Mezzing, Magi for pets, is it just me or have we no origionality to our class? The first thing we had going for us way back in the day is we could heal our pets... wasn't much, but when magicians could do it, I admit I got ticked.<P>Then Summon Corpse was around and we had that for a while before shadow knights were able to do it. I propose that we have some sort of unique ability that only necromancers can do. This would help with the sacrifice/infusion idea of transfering it to a target rather than a necro, but that makes only just so useful.<P>Anyway, I am hoping that someone can come up with some type of unique suggestion for us, as my experience over 2 years has been we are a copycat class that just barely does what everyone else can do except for DoT...<P>-Nalidiae Shadoweaver<BR>Chosen Heretic of Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Developing team, Absor and oher Verant Employees,<P>Hey here is a role for the necromancer in a boss mob situation.  Have us be able to cast a spell that makes a necromancer a terrifing or troubling distraction to the boss type mob, preventing it from being able to "Summon other player" for say all of 10 to 20 seconds.<BR>I know that wizards with there lore spells and other casters would love us then on a raid.  Casters always need to becare not to over damage, like a wizard can.  Why not remove that fear.<P>Hey you could even make it have the high refresh time, longest casting, most mana co****l, resistable, aggroing spell in the game and I know necros would be still loved on raids by all casters.  And we would not even have to do damage to the creature and we would finally have a place as "Say a Scary Distraction."  <P>Kinda corny but hey I gave it a shot.  And if you think about it is not a bad role for a necro 8).<BR>Why is being able to do damage to a Boss mob such a big thing anyway.<P>-Dave</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please do not mess with the Lich line of spells. They are not bugged. I know lots of necros who have DIED using them. If you make it take anymore life away for mana the spells will be cast aside for Clarity spells. We have enough useless spells as it is. <BR>I am also curious why Iksars are left out of some of the best INT items in the game? GEBs for one. We have enought of a challenge getting our INT up. Why do we have to loose the ability to wear some of the best caster gear out there as well as suffer from low INT?<BR>One thing I think Necros should have is a AOE Fear spell. I don't see any way it could really be over balancing and I think it would be great for groups.

The frog comes to life as an undead creature with some small graphical modifications to reflect this undead status. How powerful the new undead creature is depends on the level of the spell. There may be Animate Dead I, II and III and each new "pet" made has a unique innate proc. The idea for these procs can come from shadowknight Shroud line of spells.<P>I am sure this spell will appeal to all necromancers for sending an undead frog back to kill its comrades appeals to our evil and sadistic side.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My first reaction to reading this bs about this supposed Lich Line "Bug" really reminds me of the supposed Pet Weapon "Bug"... This mana/life ratio has been in place since the beginning of the damn game...and "WOW" suddenly it's been found out...um, yea right.  The Pet Weapon delay "Enhancement" was first expressed by VI to be just that.. an enhancement by giving your pet weapons... then "WOW" it suddenly it turned into a Bug and was "Fixed".... <P>A small background...<BR>I've been playing since Beta 3 and have been through EVERY NERF dished out, directly experienced EVERY NECRO NERF along the way.  VI has completely changed this class from the class I choose to play in the beginning. Some changes minor, and some MAJOR.  Pet Nerf was major and the last one I'd stand for.<BR>It's, frankly, too late in the game to suddenly say ,"we just found out Lich Line is bugged..."<BR> then threaten us by using this nerf against us as a barter not to enhance our class along with ALL the other classes post 50.  Spewing things like, "if we ehnance necros now, we will have to fix this bug (NERF the class in a major way AGAIN)..."  This is BS.<P>Why must something good always be countered with something bad????  Who is paying for this game???<BR>Why can't the people paying to play this game be satisfied?<P>If you can't enhance our class in a positive way, as with the other classes, then PLEASE just leave us the hell alone.  I cant/wont stand for another nerf of such magnatude.  We use our Lich line 90% of the time...<P>It really bothers me to have to even deal with this issue, as if there arent enough issues in RL to have to put up with? Now, my fantasy character that I've spent over a year building, coping, and playing stands to have the Governement (VI)step in a tax him (Nerf) some more instead of letting him keep a little more of his hard earned cash (original abilities).<P>As I stated before, Nerf my class again and there will be no more pleas from me to not screw our class further, as my account will no longer exsist.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Why must it always come to such an extreme?

You seem to single us out, hold a threat of a nerf and then tell us to work around it.  The mage summary you fall over yourself in saying that no-rent needs to be mage friendly, pet fear buff should be needed--and you say that even though you would see it as a necro thing, doesnt matter give it to the mages and not necros anyway.  You state that maybe some new artwork can be done for thier pets...we only get skels and then at 59 a spec....oh wow hold me down.  You also run to give them a better heal and pet buff...umm hello we have asked the same and its to unbalancing?  Absor, just come out and say you dont want to improve the necros lot in EQ and be done with it.  Dont give us false hopes, then run back and give everything to others and then nerf our lich series(and dont think we dont know that canabilzie would also have to be fixed).<P>WE JUST WANT THE TRUTH AND SOME HELP AT GROUPING!!!!!!!<P>If VI just wants to nerf us to death, tell me and I will switch to my cleric and mage and forever long for the days when my necro was powerful and feared.<P>54 Heretic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Let me also say I am not high enough level yet to have anything valuable to add the LICH discussions or those of the EPIC so I will not even go there.  But I do hope my necro brothers will be at least heard on these topics.<P>1st<BR>Please look at the darkness line of spells.  These spells become less and less usefull rather than more and more usefull.  Please consider lowering thier resist rates so that they at least will find a spot in a spell gem.  Currently anything after 29th level "Dooming Darkness" is not used by most.<P>2nd<BR>An upgrade to Feign Death seems like a natural.  This is something that Necro's should know more about than anyone.<P>3rd<BR>Please look at the snare spell erasing my darkness line.  This doesn't seem to pass the common sense test.  My 29th level darkness spell, that cost me 120 mana is removed by a level 1 spell that cost its caster 15 mana?<P>4th<BR>We currently have many deadend spells that with a small tweak here and there would make us more valuable without increasing our "SOLO ABILITY".  Please look at a change our buffs.  Allow more of our buffs to be shared in a group.  An example - upgrade to banshee aura making it targetable, and an upgrade to this spell at higher levels with a longer duration/higher damage would be valuable in a group.  If we got upgrades to Grim Aura (targetable), Impart Strength, Banshee Aura, Spirit Armor, we may find some welcome in groups.  We would never reach the level of a Chanter/Shaman/Cleric type class for buffs, but we could find a spot in groups that are lacking these classes. You want us to group, please help us to be more valuable in a group.<P>5th<BR>Necros are masters of the undead and death.  We create our pets from bonechips from day one.  Why should we not be allowed to create some small weapon from bone chips?  There are already numerous drops in game that are bone weapons along the line I would envision (Fractured Femur, Cracked Femur, Noclins Femur).  Allowing the master of the crypt to fashion weapons from bones that he can already fashion a animated slave from seems to meet the common sense test.<P>6th<BR>Pets resistant to mind control type spells.  This is something that I think should happen at a given level, say 34 or 39.  Pets from that level higher should be immune to Fear or Charm.  How can something made with my magic and couple of bone chips be feared or charmed (same goes for mage pet, but I'm not a Mage and will not go there either) (oops guess I just did sorry)?<P>6th<BR>Just a simple request to give me something more to look forward to post 50 than being unwanted in groups, never seeing a really big raid, and spending my few small raids pumping mana to others.<P>Thanks for giving us a shot at talking these things over, please continue to be open minded about our issues, every class thinks they are picked on and that all the other classes have advantages.  You have been very generous with many of the other classes on TEST, please at least take some of our concerns to TEST to let us show you they are not unbalancing and that they are deserved.<P>Thank You.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>    I REALLY like the idea of summoning other types of pets, only prob is what's in the global/local file.  Now if they gave us something similar to the mage's monster summoning series, except only undead can be summoned, that should work.  I mean realistically, should you be able to summon a human/elven skeleton in a place where humans/elves have NEVER been save a very short time?  Even then, corpses have not had enough time to accumulate in the numbers needed to summon many pets.  IE: if your in a zone w/ iksar skelies, you summon iksar skelies.  If there's vamps, we get vamps(or mby some other oddball ones like the whisps in sky  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">).  With nothing in the zone, however, we just go back to the other summon spells and work off thoes.<P>     I have no expierence with any spells 54+ or the epic and since thats where most of the problems are comming from ill let them lie.<P>And thanks VI<P>[53 Heretic]Awein Annuminas(Dark Elf)&lt;Steel Templars&gt;Zone:Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DavidY21:<P>I like your idea, sounds nice, i wonder if it fits nec rather than enc but it sounds fun all the same.<P>Well but I'd like to stress one thing.<BR>Post-55 EQ raids have fallen back to the good-old Hack 'n Heal game play. Essetially only tanks and healers are needed there.<P>Among caster classes wiz can at least affect the battle with their lure line of spells, enc can't do anything against the bosses directly but good in buffing and mob controls. These classes still have their part in a raid because they can play as the way as their basic characteristics were designed, i.e., nuke and enchant.<BR>Now what about mag and nec?<P>I'd leave mag issue to mages. Regarding nec it WAS supposed to be LT/DoT caster. I can easily prove this by pointing out the number of various LT/DoT spells we have in our aged spellbook.<BR>So, do they work in post-55 say epic or SoV raids? HARDLY. LTs almost never and no DoTs ever land on bosses or tougher mobs (except for Pyrocruor in limited places), and DoTs aren't even allowed in general because of the poofing anyways.<P>Caster without an effective spell isn't really a caster. We can't play offensive roles if we have no means to offend. What are we then, here comes VI suggesting roles as enhanced mana batteries, I'm really sorry but that's a joke and it's not funny at all, that's distorting the role of a necromancer.<P>I read many posts about pets, Ignite Bones (I'll be killed by my guildmates if i cast this on Gorenaire),ST, Shadowbond stacking issue (i hate when I ask druids to set SLD instead of SLN), night limited spells (I put QVoX on my spell slot when there are absolutely no other effective spell that worth the precious slot, and sadly this happened a few times), cast time of darkness line spells(good point i felt sad when i was told from my guildmate to use 29dark instead  of 49, i had to admit that i was a fool) and so on, yes I agree with you my fellow necromancers, but IMHO those are not the point, relatively just minor issues misleading to a dead-end.<P>Some people seem to have forgot that we have DoTs, although disappointing I can easily understand they've forgot it indeed, since it's been prohibited in raids way too long. But I'd like to remind you that If they worked properly we could dish out more than 10k dmg had we 2 minutes and full mana. With a 2 or 3 resists it would be rounded down to 7k or so, with 4 or 5 resists would be down to like 3k, but what do we hit in practice? ZERO, NADA, NONE since hardly a cast takes hold on the bosses. Pets? I told you, that's relatively a minor issue.<P>You all know my opinion now. I don't want VI to add any unfamiliar ability to us at this moment. If VI will kindly deal with the minor issues thanks but do it later please.<BR>I want you to:<P>1)Eradicate poofing caused by DoTs. It's unacceptable that you still have it on your list to look into, which means people will never believe that you actually fixed it. Guarantee it never happens again or at least provide supporting means so that people can get back what they lost. Maybe you can simply respawn the exact mob which poofed (this is a horrible idea but better than waiting for the spawn for another 60hours.)<BR> Any idea to circumvent the actual loss, anyone?<P>2)Make the bosses and the likes less resistant to spells. It's not fair only wiz and enc have places in raids. I'm not just talking about LTs. The whole spells. Give us back what we are supposed to have. Mag and healers would benefit from this as well which might not be preferred, but I don't really care. Healers are made to heal so they will stick to healing. Even if mag gets better in DD I'm convinced it won't overcome wiz. Nec can find it's place in raids simply because they are more powerfull than any other casters in a long battle. What's wrong with it, we still stay the most useless casters in a short battle. Tell me what's unbalanced in this.<P>3)Allow the same DoT to stack. 5 wizards means 5 times more damage than a wizard, why not it apply to necromancers? DoTs can't be called mana efficient anymore compared with DDs like Rains and Sunstrike. Along with the resistance and duration problem there are reasons to doubt if 5 lvl60 necros can overcome a lvl52 wiz. If you persist in this stack restriction, I really hate to say but you have to nerf all the DDs so say they hit 1/5th when cast by 5 casters on a mob in a certain time window.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So powerbait, necros are useful on raids because your guild exploited the epic mob that doesn't aggro on pet casters? Go ahead and keep exploiting thinking you're powerful because you have a use vs one particular mob. Personally I want to do more challenging things...<P>And people who still keep arguing pet immunity to fear would help us no end - um no. Very few (if any) ubermobs AE fear without also using AE damage spells. Fear immunity helps mage pets immensly because their pets each have specific immunities, necro pets don't. Even if my pet is immune to fear it won't last longer or do more than a 100 or so extra damage as it will die next AE damage round, unlike the mage pet.<P>Back to the lich thing, if it is 'fixed' is it Verant's intention that enchanters C2 spell is better than our lvl 60 lich? Because if lich is 'fixed' C2 will be preferred over demi-lich in groups. Why should a targettable, no side-effect spell be more powerful than a self only spell with a massive drawback? The only real argument against lich in it's current form is this 'creating extra mana' theory whereby through liching, mana dumping and cleric complete healing tanks things get very efficient. Firstly this doesn;t in the least become overpowering, maybe if yo could have 200 players fighting a mob you could have teams of necros and cleric creating this highly efficient pool of mana - but EQ's engine doesn't allow for that and never will. Secondly if mana dumping is the issue that could lead to us being unbalanced then take the $^%&$& spell away from me, when did necros ever ask to be able to dump all their mana on people? If you can't see how incredibly stupid it is that a class is forced to dump their mana (at a pathetic ratio) on other classes on the game's highest level encounters just because all their other spells are rendered useless then there is no hope for the necro class, or EQ itself really as Verant simply have no grasp of what they are doing.<P>For Innoruuk's sake please someone release a competeing MMORPG so I can vote with my feet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>HI FRIENDS<BR>I dont really know what im talking about because i play a gnome druid so im just gonna make up stuff!<P>anyways few things i have noticed playing a necro. Yes we are a powerful soloing class, yes we regen mana faster then any other class. our pets are the 2nd best in the game well at 49 atleast. no we cant do crap when it comes to boss mobs i dont care ill be a mana pimp and a dmfer person yeah k dont bother me a bit.<P>But if thats going to be the case then beef up or pets a bit, why is the 59 pet is frail and almost loses to a 49 pet?<P>nerfing lich? why if you nerf lich and to it being about the same as c2 what would be the point of fixing life taps on boss mobs (besides us being able to dd! OMG) if you make lich in the same lines as c2 whats the point? that makes us unique in that we own and regening mana, just like clerics own at healing, druids own and quad kiting HEAHA well you get my point (one would hope)<P>K MY IDEAS ON WHAT WE SHOULD GET K?! <P>first off necros are wut? master of the undead and what do we really get to master them control them? undead pets and charm undead (which in any case is useless if im charming a undead mob its cause im in oasis playing around with the newbies) why dont we get undead mez? its not gonna take chanters out of the eq world by no means. i would give up st for it, for the fact st sucks at high lvls and it takes a month to cast.<P>the whole essence emerald thing really is pointless. its better off sc if things come to using a EE. so here is my idea why not give us res? but not the normal res our res would have to be a questable spell thats really hard to get but no complety out of hand ( WHY CANT I SPELL). or just take the EE out and give us revive or something. <P>Summon corpse 39 spell? something like that why the heck did it take me to 53 to get it? and i had to fight with sks to get it at that. but anyways why not move the New summon corpse back alittle (if you say anything along the lines of unbalancing that game i will assume you have to vaild reason cause how is getting corpses for a cheaper price a "unbalancement" yeah k i dont know what lvl but early 50s<P>epics why is it that 100000000000 clerics on my server have their epics? and like 1 has a necro epic. Rangers have it ez and rogues. And infact warriors kind of have it ez besides the meastro hand or what ever. why? i dont get how these epics are remotely equal in hardness to get. Pally is also hard to get cause you make mobs that a lvl 53+ cant touch why? if people dont want to buy kunark or sov why do they need uber equiptment off vox or naggy. Necro epic looks gay and the effect stinks too. give us like free sc or something hehe or a regen effect!<P>there is other things but i know it wouldnt matter anyways cause you wont read down this far.<P>so i bid the a far well</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thank you for allowing our necro class a talk board about the issues we have.<BR>I have been level 60 for a long time now, and my main role as a 60 necro for the last 6 months is to help my guild and to go on raids, actually I go on raids all but about 4 times a month and I play every day. I do like playing a necro much more than any class I have tried but when we started doing kunark and trak and VS and the other uber epic mobs, I noticed rather dismally that I am no longer a damage dealer, although it may be nice to have a mana battery spell, it is the last thing I wanted to become. After level 60 all that most people do is raids, thats why we got to 60 so we could see the major mobs and kill those suckers or die trying. On a typical trak run I am the puller of trak, I dmf everyone(time consuming since we do not have group DMF) then I cast harmshield(not that other spell thats supposed to be the upgrade because its hardley ever night)and I pull trak to the right place and then die although my pois resis is above 250. While it is fun to die like that countless times it is not something that I really do want to do. (why not have me pull I casted dmf so now other than a small time mana battery i am pretty useless)If I die no big loss. ON VS the main thing I do is to cast subversion on the wizzards(oh thrill i get to help a damage dealer to do damage)<BR>Which means for me that I am not doing what I wanted to do when I made this character, all in all you hurt our class very badly. Of all classes the wizzards, the mages and definately the necros should be able to cast damage on all, yes that is correct on all mobs. Necros should be one of the main  classes to always be able to do damage to all mobs, why? Because of all classes we are the only ones that are supposed to be the masters of death, which means we should always have something that will cause death and harm to all mobs. Please dont say well you have your pet, on trak a pet lasts about ...hmm 20 seconds, so he did about 200 damage heh not real good damage. In pog we have plants (treants, flowers) and we cant use defoliation on them? also in pog you have mobs that have 1 million hps(could be more but at a rough calculation I came up with 1 million hps)<BR>needless to say on those mobs all spells do land and I thank you, but there are several with huge amounts of hp that I can not land anything on and they are plants. One poster had a great idea, make one spell from every class be able to land on the uber mobs, I think that is an exceptional idea, for us it would be vexing, Bod, and our taps, when mobs have as much hp as some of the new ones do in velious we need to be able to do some damage.<BR>now for some ideas to help us, overall I will say I am mostly pleased about our class and I would say it is fairly balanced, what we need tho is to do some damage on all mobs. So here is my suggestions.<BR>1. please make all of our life tap lines work on all mobs<BR>2. As far as I am concerned get rid of the mana battery line<BR>3. Make our ignite and chill dd's turn the mobs a different color(red for ignite blue for chill bones) they can have the same resists  but at least it would still have an effect if that is what you want and no one would mind that we casted it.<BR>also on that spell line mayby letting us have another at level 59 that does 710-800 with the same casting time would not hurt.<BR>4. umm duckstick needs a different effect and look, I am surprised that enchanters got a cobra, looks wicked, for us something like a medussas head with snakes would be much more appropriate, or even CT's head or innos head would not be bad, the effect tho has to go, ours is the second hardest epic to do with the worst effect. Mages may be harder but at least they got something worth waiting for. A componentless conjure wouldnt be bad, or totally new spell such as a pet buff that makes any pet its casted on unfearable, which is something that would go with what we are supposed to be about. <BR>5. an upgrade to screaming isnt a bad idea, I for one like to be able to mes a mob everyonce in awhile.<BR>6. In velious we cant even use our dark line of spells on a lot of mobs ( when casted on mobs in velious you get a message that says this mobs run speed can not be changed or altered)which absolutely makes our duckstaff totally useless. <BR>7. nope not really a seven just put it in to say I dont think we really need anything else:P<BR>There has been many good ideas posted some not so good, just make us do damage, after all, some of the most powerful mobs in the game we have to kill are necroes, and we cant even land spells on our own kind?<P>Farr<BR>warlock<BR>veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056290&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056290&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
