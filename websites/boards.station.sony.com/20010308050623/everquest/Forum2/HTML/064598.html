</FONT><HR>Not sure how it goes on other servers but on Mith Marr most high lvl guilds are going through major major changes.<P>Guilds that have been around for almost 2 years are falling apart.  The reason? Many guilds are forming up that are following the Afterlife "model"<P>Afterlife was founded a while ago by players from many guilds that were raiding together a lot (before kunark was released) they left their guilds and formed a new raid guild.<P>Afterwards they recruited players to help them from other guilds and still recruit players they need (mostly clerics)<P>When the drinal came along Cats in Hats and Clan Skallagrim and some other guilds left for that server.<P>Afterlife continued on Mith Marr, after a while, many lower lvl guilds began losing players , and a couple new raiding style guilds sprung up.  Complete with level limit requirements, gear reqs etc...<P>These newer raid guilds were built on the premise similar to afterlife, forming a guild for the purpose of raiding high lvl areas.<P>Now what has happend is they too have to recruit needed players for raiding.<P>So what is happening.  These raid guilds are recruiting all the high lvl druids, paladins, rangers  and necros for their raid guilds.<P>Err.. I mean CLERICS WARRIORS ENCHANTERS hehe.  Of course they are NOT recruiting high lvl rangers and necros.<P>yes they are taking clerics from other guilds, most noticably high lvl clerics.<P>This leaves the other guilds full of the "useless" raid classes.<P>Lets face it, even with the cleric nerf, they are still the core batteries to any raid.  <P>So basically slowly but surely older guilds fall apart and die, because as more and more of their clerics and warriors leave little by little, the effect on the guild is exponential.  1 lvl 55 cleric leaving a guild is like 10 of any other player.<P>As the new raid guilds recruit the "needed" classes the other players get left behind wondering what went wrong.<P>The recruiters say "we cant help it if they want to join our guild because your guild is boring to them"<P>Those that lose the clerics say " we are growing and were getting more ready to do the high lvl content but with a cleric lost there and a warrior over there, we get less and less able to do so"<P>I have witnessed no less than 10 lvl 50-60 clerics leave guilds that they were in for a year or more, even officers and leaders of, watched them just pack up and say "later"<P>Why are they doing this? because Verant felt it necesarry to design Velious to be raid only high lvl uber zones.<P>Basically if you want to do anything on Velious you need a raid guild behind you.<P>Now months later Verant decides they are going to "fix" this problem by nerfing clerics.  Well nerfing clerics just means instead of 10 clerics on a raid now we need 15 clerics, which means more recruiting which means other guilds dieing off again which means the rangers/druids/paladins/necros are left sitting wondering what happend to their medium powered guild..<P>You know the guild that raids hate/fear a couple times a month, raids Kael/Thurga a couple times a month, does Sebilis / Karnors most of the time, has 1-5 epic weapons and maybe 20 lvl 50+ players.<P>A guild with 20 lvl 50+ players is fine, but take 1-2 clerics and 1-2 warriors out of that make up and suddenly you have 16 lvl 50+ players and not enough clerics to do anything other than farm Hill giants.<P>that guild is essentially dead.<P>thanks to $0V uber guild only apply, guilds that have flourished for 22 months are dead in their tracks, devistated by the raid guilds NEEDING to recruit clerics.<P>The ONLY solution on my server is to join them, yes and this is what I see, friends giving up on their main characters and twinking up clerics so they can join the raid guilds too.<P>Its very sad, and its the nail in the coffin for many respected old guilds.  They are dieing, guilds that used to have 100 members and 30 lvl 50+ players have been completely picked apart, 3 lvl 50+ clerics leave and boom the guild has been reduced to raiding Naggy and Vox again.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's why you join a guild with friends, people you can trust.  If someone a cleric in my guild would just get up and join another guild it wouldn't bother me at all.  Why not?  Because they obviously aren't the type of player I want in my guild.  Your title talks about the Casual Player Guild, well casual players don't care about uber-guilds or raiding non-stop so I don't see how you can compare what you are talking about to casual guilds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If people are leaving (your) guilds because of Loot and Raids... then I'm sorry, they didn't belong in your guild to begin with.<P>It seems to me that they were just using your guild as a stepping-stone, because they knew the "Uber" guild wouldn't take them until they got to a certain level/equipment.<P>The guild I belong to will NEVER have to worry about me (Cleric/Paladin/Warrior are my characters) leaving the guild.  It just won't happen.<P>I am a member of the guild because it is run by someone I like.  It has a large number of people I enjoy chatting, joking, RPing and hunting with.  It espouses the ideals that I myself followed even before I joined the guild.<P>Our big advantage is our Reputation.<P>It's easy for our high level members to get invites into Kael/Kedge/Naggy/etc. raids... why?  Because our guild is known for having level-headed people who WORK AS A TEAM.<P>We have a reputation for helping others, being polite, and getting along without being pushovers.<P>We have a reputation for being friendly,  following the "need before greed" ideals and giving even total strangers a chance.<P><BR>I am a member of the Aurrorean Knights on the Xegony Server.<BR>If you agree with the ideals I set down here, let me know... and if you're on the Xegony Server and looking for a Guild, contact me.

</FONT><HR>Well, I think you'd find similar happenings on most servers, including former MM players on Drinal.  It's simply getting more and more difficult to get 24-36 people on at once with the proper mix of classes.  Also, more and more you find people growing bored with anything short of an epic encounter.<P>Still, you have a few that have stuck mostly to their roots.  There are 4 nearly intact Mith Marr guilds that do VS, and 3 that can kill Trakanon guild-only.  <P>Oh, and the AL model involves small numbers, familiarity and trememendous discipline/ organization.  You can't toss a bunch of high level people together and expect them to mesh.<P>-FF, 60 bard, Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The original poster is exactly right.  I am in the same situation.  My guild is a fairly small, mid-level guild that I have a lot of fun with, but on their best day couldn't do Vox or Nagafen.  My warrior just hit 50 and is the highest-level char in the guild.  I now have the opportunity to join one of the larger guilds on the server, and I will probably do so.  I have friends that I hate to leave, and I know that if everyone leaves when they hit 50 the guild will never be able to do a high-level raid, but the only way for me to experience any of the high-level game is to get into a bigger guild.  For the time being, I'm going to leave my alts in the other guild so I can still play with my friends, but I can't think of any way to get in on any raids without depriving my guild of it's only high-level warrior.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
