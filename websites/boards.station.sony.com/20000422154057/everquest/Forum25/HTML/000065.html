&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT><HR>  It was a fine day to be hunting in the Mistmore area. The sky was clear, the dark ones were not rushing us, and I was in good company. Old friends and close companions shared the alcove near the hill with my beloved fiance, Kegas, and I. Woodwind, my dear Druid brother, Trill, my sister of the sword, and Artel, a noble song Master, were making the pulls easy and simple. Yes it was a grand day.<BR>   Then, naturaly, it happened. There were the usual screams associated with Mistmore, screams od pain and terror, but the large mob that suddenly set upon us was not preceded by a shouted warning.<BR>    We had been fighting a pledge near the entrance to the hallway when a multitude of armored Dark Elves (ever notice they are all women?)fell on us. Our bad fortune also lent us the Negotiator.<BR>    Though there was no need, we screamed at one another to run for safety. But, alas, I would not join my companions in the safety of the forest.<BR>    One moment I was running for my life, the next I was hopelessly srvile to Her. My mind yelled to run but my body ignored it. She had me. The Negotiator. It felt like an eternity was passing thrugh me as I stood guard by her. A docile pet. She spelled and buffed the other hated creatures as they passed before she turned and lead me to the hallway leading to the castle. I knew what was happing and I was helpless to stop it. I would be taken to the castle and lost to the vampiric embrace of Lord Mayong Mistmore. I could not fight her, however, so I followed her to my doom.<BR>    Suddenly a familiar voice rang out around me.<BR>    "Keera is charmed!" cried Desiel, a good friend. Just as suddenly he was there with me and Marzokk, a would be tank mage, stood with him. My friends. But she still commanded me. <BR>    I fought with myself to the point of mentle exhastion but I had no choice but to obey. I crossed swords with Desiel and couldn't even scream. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Marzokk fall to an ancille and I wept from within.<BR>    Desiel was attacking my Mistress and I fell on him from behind. It seemed my Mistress admired his barbarian strength and courage for she began to weave a web of enthrallment over him, or tried.<BR>    Her concentration was so completely on the warrior that I found my mind free of her control. She lost Desiel with me so we bolted together to the safety of the forest. I fell as a red flash struck me downa the ramp to the exit. Everything went black and then a tunnel of light pulled my soul to safety.<BR>    In Greater Faydark I cryed softly for the sins committed against my dear friends. I looked up as Desiel jogged up to me in Spirit Form. He put a big hand on my shoulder and smiled gently.<BR>    "I wasn't goning to let them take you to the castle." Then he was gone, disappearing into Lesser Faydark.<BR>    Marzokk came up and I fell in his arms thankfully and wept. He smiled and smoothed my hair.<BR>    "I had to help he said," he said simply.<BR>    To this day these two men have my loyalty and affection, no matter how dangerous that may be  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>      Dedicated to the fighters of Mistmore, especially Desiel and Marzokk.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>                          Keera Mahal<BR>                        Pheonix Knights</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Keera,<P>That was an awesome story.  I too was in Mistmoore last night and I was also charmed by the Negociator's strong hold.  Myself and 2 other of my group members fell into her arms.  Luckily she got us near the zone entrance and as I walked into walls and turned and paced back and forth and attacked the weary runners trying to get to the zone, I wondered how long I would stay under her spell.  <P>After a few moments of nothing she started walking down the ramp and as we hit the bottom, I broke free.  Having only 2 bubs of health left, I had no choice to try to make a break for it.  As I did my 2 other group mates started to attack me and I made it to the zone with about  50 hps left.  The other group members broke free shortly and was able to zone out to safety.  <P>I'd have to say, that I've never been rooted or charmed so many times in MM since that last few days.<P>Blaade Goldernheart</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I like your story very much, dear sister-in-law.  I hope that in the future other brave adventurers will thwart the vile efforts of the Negotiator before she lures into the evil clutches of Mayong, a severe enemy of the people.  I am sorry that I wasn't available to aid you as I would certainly have given my own life to see such a dear family member as yourself escape without harm.

Needless to say, I pray for all who venture into the darkness that resides forever in Mistmoore. One day the light of Mithaniel Marr shall shine upon the land of Mistmoore and purge the evil that resides. That will be the day that Tunar's children shall see the green grow in Mistmoore.. <P>I have had a many adventures there, yet have always had Mithaniel Marr's light upon me and protect me. I am not at such a great strengh, but I will always be willing to lend a hand to you and your family should you be in need.<P>Nate "Mystic Guardian"<BR>30 Mage Rodcet nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If you need elven brethren of strong wisdom to resist the charms of those blue skinned ladies (and I know how hard it is - lol) then feel free to call on me, or my noble ranger brother Dwaveon (he's been living in Mistmoore for the last ten levels - heheh). In fact I'm surprised Dwaveon wasn't with Artel, Woodwind and Trill - good friends all.<P>A few weeks ago when none of my friends were online (a rare occurrence) I wandered into Mistmoore and joined a nice controlled group holding the ancille pit - Dyermaker (enc), Aoeb (pal), Foxtrot (clr) and Kerien (war) were my compatriots that day. We held the pit for about an hour against all that Mistmoore could throw at us (I have a screenshot of about 15 ancille corpses - we barely had time to loot, the spawns were popping so fast - thank god for clarity). It was then we espied a Teir'Dal caster on the cliffs above and, seeking a greater challenge to test our mettle, we began the arduous climb up the steep path to the castle - to meet this sorcerous lady, and maybe to meet our doom. But something within the castle was calling to us and we could not resist (for me it was the call of a nightshade wreath - heheh).<P>We assaulted the heights and the death toll was impressive. With true steel, brave hearts and the wonders of group mez  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> we managed to almost clear the hilltop. The sorceress fell, and we fought our way towards the gatehouse. Our combat must have caused more fiends to stir from deathlike sleep, for a vampirish horde rushed across the drawbridge and we knew we could not beat them, exhausted and trapped as we were. My companions were ready to sell their lives dearly, but crying out to Tunare to save them I channelled a wind that whisked us away to Butcherblock and safety. <P>It was then with horror we realised that brave Aoeb was not with us, and we feared him slain, fighting the ever growing tide of dark brethren to buy time for our escape. Fortunately he was still guarded by the ghost of a brave wolf I had called to watch over him and speed his steps (or SoW as the heathens call it - lol) and he escaped the wave of screaming terror at his heels.<P>I made a few plat and picked up some nice fine steel and bronze armour as well, which always makes for a happy ending  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Truly epic, but I'm dying to get inside that castle (or is that dying once I get inside that castle - lol). I've heard a rumour that wolf form renders me non-aggro to the mobs in the castle, like against the undead in Unrest, but I haven't had a chance to test it yet. I'm sure one of you knows, maybe my old friend Blaade if you've finally tired of living with the frogloks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>As much as I like Cazic Thule (spent a lot of time there), and even Sol B and Paw (just don't mention Perma - lol), something still pulls me back to MM from time to time. Maybe its just that ancille are prettier than greater kobolds  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">. Or perhaps it is the mystery of the place, never knowing if Lord Mayong is home and watching you from a high tower window (maybe waiting on a pathing bug to call him out - lol).<P>Please call on me if you ever need another sword arm and the blessings of Tunare to hold back the vampirish tide. Any friend of Blaade, Artel, Trill or Woodwind is a friend of mine. Besides, giantslaying and troll-bashing is starting to get real old  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Keep safe and well - Tunare protect.<P>Giliad Stormdancer<BR>L35 wood elf druid<BR>Leader of the Crimson Blades<P>OOC: I'm quite lucky that with my high WIS I shrug off most Charm spells, but I will never forget both times a fear spell has got thru.

</FONT><HR>Hehe since everyone seemed to have a great MM story I figured I'd add one of my great adventures with my 3 friends (Artel, Trill and Woodwind)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Artel, Trill, and I were in the GY just picking on stuff till Wooders arived and we could do some real killing when lo and behold one of those super rare Trains ran through the GY!  Wow surprised me to for maybe a second...  Anyway, when all was left the negotiator was hasting stuff out front as usual then walked to the double spawns place on the left side of GY and just stood there.  The rest of the place was clear and we were feelin' lucky...<P>So Trill rushed the negotiator, I was right behind with cancel and snares a flyin', then comes Artel with his songs a pourin out.. it was a tough battle.  We killed the pet first while Artel charmed the negotiator herself.  The pet fell easily and we started into her finally.  After some fierce battling we finally defeated the wench.  She attempted to charm me twice, Trill once, and Artel once, and only succeeded on the poor bard  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Yeah I guess my whole 73 wis allowed me to resist both haha.  <P>And for this mighty feat we got a king's reward and more.  Why we got a whole 4 gold off of the negotiator (yellow con to a 31  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).  Well it was still fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>I highly advise anyone 20 and up to come to Mistmoore.  I'll give you a tour and recite every spawn point and secret about MM from the zone line to the front of the castle (never been in there yet, will soon)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Hehe I only leave when the sung clan leaves and that's usually to hunt somewhere else for a day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  It's a fun place.<P>Dwaveon Mistwalker<BR>31 half elf ranger of Surefall Glade<BR>(2nd home in Mistmoore just above where Enynti spawns)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Crimson Blades officer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

After protecting the zone line for her against any invaders from the lower faydark she proceded to take me back into her lair, Though the graveyard she took me where all i could do was look upon the dead warriors and think of the fate that was about to befall me. Up the secret stairs and into a room we went where there was a necromancer waiting with a pet at the ready. She commanded me to attack the pet, i tried to resist but alas I could not stiking the skeleton with my mighty langseax of the wolves.
