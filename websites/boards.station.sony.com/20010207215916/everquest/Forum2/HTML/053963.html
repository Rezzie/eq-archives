</FONT><HR>As a level 60 warrior, I agree with Alan that we are a balanced class. We are valuable in every high end encounter, and desired in all groups.<P>We have minor flaws and problems, and there have been great suggestions for a skill like the Intimidate skill (long recycle, kind of a fear/get out of jail thing for those times with no SoW in a long zone with a MOB on our tail).<P>But I seriously love the class. Alan is pretty correct, we are balanced.<P>But, if Verant thinks about nerfing me and my skills (read:defensive), they are gonna have some hell to pay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You have NO concern whatsoever about the fact that a similarly equiped Rogue, SK, or Paly can have an AC within a few points of yours?  Just one of many points I thought deserved a tad bit more attention, but maybe I am blowing it out of proportion??

</FONT><HR>I think so, because you have to weigh in all the points.  Pound for pound, a warrior is going to be able to shred an opponent much quicker than any other class.<P>The warrior has high hp, high ac, killer skills and the innate ability to fight.  i noticed last night that the SK was not hitting for full damage as much as the warrior, and that the warrior was hitting more often.  <P>Then you have things like double attack and dual wield... hey, and warrior dual wielding a couple fast weapons will easily out damage any other class, except maybe the ranger, and the ranger would get chewed up!  <P>No, the warrior is a good, solid class... one of my favorites.  i keep wanting to trade in my lvl 30 mage for one, and the only reason i wont is because i have put so much time into him.<P>The only thing i do have a problem with, though, is the whoel dead horse binding issue... but that wil never change...<P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I hate to say it, but I wonder why they even bothered to ask Warriors what they feel needs improvement.  It's obvious that they aren't going to listen and already decided not to do anything to us anyway.  I don't even think he really read all the posts.  Many things were completely ignored in Alans post and some of what he said was incorrect.<P>For instance, he said he would not address 300,000 (?) pieces of equipment, but if certain items had problems, he would look at those.  Specific items WERE mentioned in these posts, including Cobalt Armor and the Epic Weapon.  Yet he completely ommited that.<P>Also, he posted that half (?) of the Warriors here are able to taunt perfectly well.  Where did he get that from?  From what I read, Taunt is a problem for most Warriors especially if they aren't twinked.  I have an incredibly tough time taunting.  At level 28, much of my Armor is still Bronze (working on the crafted quests right now), and my main weapon is a GZ or PGT+Lang (I also have 2 Lariats for fightin caster types with which seem to work OK, but don't do much damage).  None of my weapons can out taunt Rangers, Monks, or Rogues after a BS and getting MOBs off Clerics is almost impossible after they heal you.  Soon I will be able to go to LGuk and maybe get myself an SSOY.  Perhaps that will help some, assuming I am able to even get one.<P>No, there really aren't many problems with Warriors.  Equipment is by far the biggest I know of.  It's just not available to those of us who need it.  Most of the time the only option is to buy it since it is camped most of the time.<P>I guess it doesn't matter, since Verant intends to do absolutely nothing about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>With respect to taunting off of Rogues (since I play a level 30 one at the moment ..  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, I've never grouped with a warrior yet that had a problem taunting off of me.  I wield a Burning Rapier (7/20, procs a 37 point fire dd) in the main hand, and a Bloodstained Fang (9/32) in the off hand (to give you an idea of my damage capability).  <P>Now, granted, there could be a number of reasons for that.  Maybe I just end up grouping with an inordinate amount of twinked warriors, but I don't think so (I'm fairly certain I haven't seen many in full crafted or anything better).  Perhaps I have sub par weapons (but again, I don't think that's the case).  But only rarely do I have to worry about getting pummelled, even when evade fails.  If I fail evade once, usually by the time it cycles up again the warrior (or any other tank) has taunted off of me.<P>Of course, this is just my personal experience.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2 of the most balanced class' in the game (Druids and Clerics) <P>Druids aren't what you would call balanced in the 'end game'.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have NO concern whatsoever about the fact that a similarly equiped Rogue, SK, or Paly can have an AC within a few points of yours? <P>A lvl 60 warrior, similarly equipped will have AC about 10-15% higher than the 3 classes you mentioned. <BR>Warriors also have 1000-1300 more HP than a rogue and 600-900 more HP than a Paladin or Shadowknight... not to mention superior damage avoidance skills.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hell, I have a d00d buddy that can come within 80 points of AC of my similar level Warrior....<P>I assume you mean druid. If that's the case, you must have some pretty sad gear on your warrior. I'll bet you are wearing Fire Emerald and Black Pearl jewelry. Perhaps some serpentine bracers and maybe a platinum ruby veil? My warrior's AC is about 200-300 points higher than an equally leveled druid.<P>In my opinion, warriors are the most balanced class in Everquest. My Paladin is nearly 56 and I basically gave him up in order to be more useful on guild raids... My warrior is level 46 and has superior HP and comparable defense and offense skills. The only area in which my paladin exceeds my warrior is in AC... this is entirely because my Paladin is in full Deepwater. Even still, the difference is less than 75AC.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was a little surprised<P>The warrior thread had some very valid points.<P>The one thing that didn't come up enough though was that the Warrior class is balanced through their equipment. I still believe that:<P>1/ Cobalt drops are out of whack<BR>2/ The Epic quest (which I have no desire to be made easier) is a badly thought out quest, designed to irritate ones guild for a weapon that is not Epic. I'd rather we had to kill two more uber mobs provided the quest component drops everytime. Equipment is THE defining warrior element and as a result, should be BALANCED with the other Epic Quests.<BR>3/ A 40's armor quest for the rest of the crafted pieces (Warrior only no drop) would alleviate some of the issues.<BR>4/ A once a Game day Heroic Taunt (LoH or HT refresh like skill) that will guarantee the mob switches focus to the tank<BR>5/ An inspire fear like skill for travel issues.<BR>6/ Disarm should have a small stun component vs armed mobs. (This will benefit all classes with the Skill)<BR>7/ Indicolite drops also need looking at - Cleric PoH drops way more - check the guild info pages on their drops from PoH raids.<BR>8/ AC needs to be explained further - IS there a soft cap?<BR>9/ An AoE Taunt would be a nice tactic to consider if it did not break taunt<P>All of these would keep Warriors balanced if the other classes are also "adjusted".<P>I welcomed the chance to share my thoughts on how warriors were unbalanced in abilities, and also unbalanced in playability, so yes - I was surprised and disappointed in Alan's response to the warrior thread.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus,<BR>I think you need to research before you respond my friend.  Gonna keep this short, but to the point, my 51 warrior has as AC of around 890 unbuffed....No, i do not wear ANY item for stat purposes, with the exception of the Hero Bracer and my FBSS.  I have Cobalt Gaunts and Boots, Indico Helm, Sleeves of Ancient, just to name a few of the upper AC items i wear...my "d00d" (You know exactly what I was refering to) friend focus' on AC as well, since he does an extreem amount of Kiting, and his AC is near the 800 mark, just a tad over if I remember correctly...a caster should NEVER be close to our equal in the AC area.  I have a rogue buddy who has similar gear to myself (couple pieces of planar, couple class specific yada yada) that has an AC of 870ish...How can a rogue get so close to a "Tank" in AC ??<BR>As for you comment that d00d's are not balanced in the end game, I have not experienced that yet, not to i ever expect to...I have druids in virtually every group I am in, with or without a cleric...They are group friendly and can do a WIDE variety of different things at will, either grouped or solo...IMHO, Balanced.  I am not saying that warriors are not balanced.  My point was, that many many good ideas to promote more of a sence of balance were brought up, and got totally ignored.  Were as all of the other class' that have been looked for that I have read about seemed to get at least a legit list that will eventually be taken before the teams at VI.<BR>10-15% on the AC is way off, in my opinion.  I will, as a result of this topic, start polling some friends of other class' just to see for myself.  In my opinion, even if you are by some reason correct on the 10-15% figure, do you believe that THE tank class should only  have 10% better ac than a hybrid with a wide variety of other abilities (sk's, paly's, etc) ??  I personally do not.  I do not ask for much here, but I DO think that warriors should far outweigh other class' in that area.  We are fine in HP's (you brought that up for some reason, i have no complaints in that regard), but AC is just a pet peve (sp?) of mine since I dedicate so much time and plat in getting the best AC i can.  Then, I turn around and other class' (caster class' no less), have AC's that are close to mine...<BR>Does VI think warriors AC is "balanced"?? Aparently so.  Do I expect to ever see a change in this? No.  <BR>Please do not reply to my post with such a negative attitude friend.  It is my opinion, and that of others as well, if you read the warrior thread a bit more.  I love my warrior, and as that is the case, I would have appreciated some of the good ideas that people brought up looked at a bit more, instead of being brushed aside.  That was my only point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Doesn't anyone remember when warriors were the WORST class in EQ?  Back when a ranger was basically equivalent to a warrior, but had spells to boot?  <P>Warriors have been slowly un-nerfed, and that has resulted in a class that now shines in one very narrow, specialized application: tanking boss mobs that don't DT, slow, lifetap, charm, or banish.  Which, being extremely generous, constitutes perhaps .01% of the encounters in the game.<P>We are easily outdamaged by monks and rogues, and have far less utility for "every day" activities than rangers, monks, rogues, paladins, or SKs.  <P>Warriors can't: pick locks, disarm traps, sneak, hide, feign death, resurrect, divine aura, summon corpses, cast sow, cast invis, fear, lifetap, harmtouch, heal in melee, cast any buffs, safe fall, lay on hands, evade, backstab, etc.<P>Warriors CAN tank.  We didn't ask for anyone else's "class defining" abilities, but for some strange reason, everybody is asking for ours, or suggesting (per absor's comments) that they might need to be nerfed!<P>The "warrior talk" thread was meant to be about balancing the warrior class; since it's a "staple" class, almost by definition it's NOT overpowered.  Over a thousand posts were made on this board and others, with several nearly universal themes (Taunt is broken, our epic quest stinks, etc) but instead the focus seems to be on what needs to be NERFED?<P>Invis potions can be bought on VENDORS for perhaps 10pp... do those need to be nerfed if cobalt legs are?  That's the ONLY really "nifty" spell effect on the kunark armor, and Absor wants it gone???<P>The defensive discipline allows us to tank significantly better than any other class.  Um, that's the whole point of a warrior, right?  How, exactly, is that contrary to the "vision"?  It *doesn't* help vs spells, procs, or damage shields.<P>People, please- keep some sense of balance here.  Just because one particular guild on one server has a pile of tanks and clerics with CHeal bps, does NOT mean an entire class (or two) needs to be nerfed.  EVERY class has weaknesses, and some particular strength that defines it.  Address the unreasonable weaknesses, NOT the class envy issues.<P>My $.02,<BR>RdT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I am not against warriors getting some tweaks of their own. But the assertion that SK's are in any way close to a warrior in combat is blatantly false. <P>Higher HPs, AC, attack skills, defense skills, magic resistances, and innate abilities like kick, crits, riposte, dual wield, crippling blows, triple attacks etc, etc creates a very large gap in combat performance.<P>Our spells are not balancing in this regard. I am not going to go into all the reasons why, such as casting times, resist rates, fizzle rates, interupts and mana costs, but suffice it to say, we lag considerably behind in combat efficiency.<P>You guys keep listing things like a need for better taunts. Frankly, being able to taunt mobs more easily and reliably than you guys is one of the few abilities we SKs have that makes us wanted in a group. It certainally isnt our damage potential or damage avoidance.<P>You guys keep pointing to feign death as a "balance" factor that should keep SKs inferior to you guys by a larger margin. And yet you seem to forget that warriors STILL recieve an additional 10% exp bonus, that we do not recieve, on EVERY kill. Meaning the times we survive by feigning and you guys die, only evens out the exp score.<P>Yes we can invis, but so can you guys with a little effort. And if Im not mistaken your castable invis is also not self only like ours.<P>My point? Nothing really except to say, that you guys ARE the standard the rest of us are aspiring to be balanced with.

</FONT><HR>I am not at all surprised at his post on Warriors. It is essentially the same attitude in his posts on clerics and enchanters.  His comments range from "You are already balanced" to "You might think you want this, but I doubt it will do what you think it will".<P>As far as I am concerned all the "class improvement" posts have quickly devolved into massive class envy flames from other classes about how Warriors, Chanters and Clerics are over powered because of poor design of Post 50's encounters.  Since the post 50 game is arguably a "raid based encounter" rather then a "small group based encounter" many classes feel that they don't have a role in post 50 game play.<P>Clerics, Chanters and Warriors are just as guilty of the class envy flames by the way, they just seem to be the favorite target.  So, in closing, I would suggest that we all play the classes we like to play, and be happy that we have a variety of unique classes that we find fun.  Or, we could go play AC and all have the same skills and abilities.<P>Tarf Crackleberry<BR>44 Cleric<BR>Quellious Server<P>/auction WTB Celestial Heal, offering 1kpp or trading for other 44 spells, ... anyone? ... anyone?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi again-<P>Some observations:<BR>-At level 60, 10% exp bonus = so what?  I take a bigger hit than that for being a troll.  Having to run across multiple zones, naked, with NO hope of surviving an encounter with any aggro GREEN mob (excepting skeletons) = standard for a warrior.  ALL the other hybrid classes have something that can help them 'escape', warriors don't.  BIG gameplay difference.<P>-hybrids are perfectly viable as tanks at 50+, with the ONLY exception being a VERY few boss mob type encounters.  I know a shaman that self-buffs to over 1000ac, and with the AC softcap at 1100, any sk or paladin that can't beat that at level 55 or so (with buffs) just isn't trying.  SKs in particular make EXCELLENT assist tanks, they also pull much better than warriors do (FD).  With LoH, paladins effectively have MORE hp than warriors for a single encounter, plus enough mana and self-buffs to increase that even further.<P>-If a paladin chooses to wear +wis gear or used his attribute points for wis instead of STA or AGI, who's fault is that?  If a SK did the same with INT, is it the warrior classes fault?  If you want to tank w/ a hybrid, you have to be smart about it- pure AC over all else, good ratio weapons, maximum haste.  Cake + Eat It Too does NOT equal "class balance".<P>Each of the hybrid classes has areas where they are exceptionally good; for warriors, it's tanking.  Learn to maximize your strentghs and minimize your weaknesses.  Someone else pointed out that it's poor encounter design, not inherent imbalance that is causing the problem; that's probably very true for about .1% of the encounters in the game, up to perhaps (being very generous here) 20% of the very high level ones.<P>Just my $.02,<BR>RdT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Andervin, look at it from a hybrid's perspective.  Prior to Kunark, hybrids were the casting melee classes.  We had spells that were used by groups (invis, snare, darkness, fear, etc.)  The spell casting was reserved for the hybrids.  Kunark through this all out of wack by adding effects to armor pieces.  We were no longer relied upon for our casting abilities, which really minimized our need in a group.  That's where he's coming from.<P>Do I think they should remove something that's been given to them?  No.  I think they should just leave the armor as it is and move on.  But I think the point he was trying to make was that warriors with Cobalt armor really infringed upon ground they should not have been privvy to.<P>As far as warriors are concerned, when Everquest was released, warriors didn't have much of a place in the game.  They didn't have a significant HP bonus.  The armor available to warriors wasn't any different than was available to the plate-class hybrids.  Then Verant started making changes.  They added hitpoint bonuses.  They added warrior only armor with higher armor class than was available to paladins and shadowknights.  They added critical hits.  They added a lot of stuff to make them more attractive to the game.  They balanced warriors.  And they are now finally balanced.  Like most of the people here have said, they can use a few tweaks, but overall they are a balanced class.<P>For whomever was saying that a rogue's armor class is the same as a warrior's armor class, you are dead wrong.  You have to compare apples to apples here.  A naked rogue might have similar armor class to a naked warrior.  When equipped with similar genre of armor (ie, warrior in full cobalt compared to a rogue in full mrylokar, or a warrior in full indicolite compared to a rogue in full woven shadow) the number changes considerably.  The rogue is and always will be a chain class in Everquest.  They will always suffer from chain class restrictions and their armor will always have lower armor class than warrior armor of the same genre.<P>A warrior doesn't do as much damage as a rogue, monk, or even ranger in a particular party with those classes present.  Why?  A warrior is standing toe to toe with the mob.  They are tanking.  A percentage of their hits are being dodged, parried, or riposted by the mob.  Meanwhile, a rogue and a good monk or ranger will be behind the mob removing the damage avoidance of the mob by removing dodge, parry and riposte.  All the classes are doing their job.  The warrior is eating damage and doing some good damage output.  The rogue, monk and ranger are dishing out great damage.<P>This does leave the question of the purpose of the shadowknight and paladin though.  The real benefit of having a warrior eating mob damage is that they have a significantly higher number of hitpoints.  Paladins and shadowknights fall somewhere around 600 hitpoints behind a warrior at level 60.  They can't take as much damage, therefore their categorization of being a "defensive" tank is somewhat questionable.  The paladin can heal, DA, and LoH.  The shadowknight can FD.  I really see no defensive quality of a group member feigning death so they don't die.  It makes little or no sense.<P>The question that's going to be raised over the next few weeks is, how much of a penalty do you impose upon the hybrid classes for their spell casting capabilities?  If paladins and shadowknights are the defensive tanks, give them tanking abilities.  That includes increasing their armor class to warrior levels, as well as increasing their hitpoints to warrior levels.  The warriors will still have a vast edge on them in damage dealing.  Would it even out?  Heck if I know.<P>Lastly, I'll talk about rangers for a second.  Rangers are deemed the damage dealing hybrid.  Rangers fall 4th in line in damage dealing capabilities at level 60.  Rogues, monks, and warriors all outdamage a ranger.  For being the "offensive" hybrid, they are penalized with no defense skill updates.  I play a level 56 ranger.  I am pretty much uber equipped (almost full Tolan's armor (no bp yet), lozidal shell shield, lots of +AC items, epics, etc.)  My unbuffed armor class is 926.  That's at level 56 with nearly all of the best of the best equipment available to me.  Does my being 4th in the damage hierarchy warrant my extremely low armor class?  Fully buffed I can get to about 1050 AC.  That's with every stacking AC buff there is.  Fully buffed, the level 58 warrior I play with all the time (uber equipped) has 1342 ac.  This makes sense.  The level 60 rogue I play with, fully buffed and uber equipped, has 1260 ac.<P>These are all balance issues that are being brought out into the open by Verant in an attempt to help balance things.  Everyone will always want their character to have 1500 ac and 7000 hitpoints.  But that's not going to happen.  Warriors will (and should) always have the highest armor class of any of the melee classes, as long as they are equipped properly for their level.<P>To whoever was talking about armor class on your warrior at level 51 being 890, er, you are now coming into your own with respect to your character.  You have 1 piece of indicolite on.  You have sleeves of the ancients, meaning you haven't been to the plane of hate enough times to get more pieces of indicolite.  You are still building your character.  When your character is built, you WILL have higher armor class than any other class out there.  And every time you see that little "You have gained a level!" message, you will start tacking on a little bit more armor class.  As you get more items, your character will grow.  A similarly equipped paladin or shadowknight at your level (ie, one that hasn't gotten any planar gear and has a couple pieces of Deepwater armor) will have at least 30 ac less than you.  A similarly equipped ranger at your level will have 100 ac less than you.  The gap will widen as your character grows.  When you start getting disciplines, things will begin to change for you.  At level 56, if you get in trouble, you can just hit the riposte discipline and get a few seconds of auto riposte.  This can guarantee you a cheal in time to save your life.  An SK will have to hit FD and hope like heck it takes.  A paladin will have to hit LoH then wait 90 minutes for it to recycle.  A ranger just dies and gets a ressurection.<P>I play with warriors every day.  About the only thing I can say a warrior needs is a bit more ability to taunt.  When I play with the warrior in our guild that has epics, this is not a problem.  Once he procs, I never get agroed on again.  If I get agro before his proc, I simply jolt the mob off me and get it back on him.  I would love for taunt to actually work 100% of the time for a warrior at level 60.  It would ease a lot of the odd agro problems that arise.  Other than that, I think warriors are pretty darned balanced in the end-game.<P>If you want to look at classes that need help at level 60 for end-game events, go look at the druid and necromancer classes.  Both classes need some serious work to be group friendly when killing epic mobs.<P>Lewick Goodheart<BR>Level 56 Outrider<BR>Knights of Eternal Good<BR>The Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Granted, Alan started the warrior discussion topic, and I think we all know that he really was doing it out of fairness, and not because he really thinks that we can offer any suggestions for the class that would "balance it"<P>Yes, I don't think he is reading, and yes, I don't think he cares. He has his notions of the class, and quite frankly, we're not going to convince him that anything needs to be done.<P>I'll put money on the fact that absolutely nothing will come from warrior talks. <P>Do I care? Nope, I'm pretty happy with my warrior.<P>Turgon_Galvorn, I am level 60. I still wear a crafted bracer. I have no cobalt helm, bracers, pants or BP. <P>I have Beserker pants, and incarnadine BP, and I still can get 1200 AC buffed without the l33t gear. I can out tank any other class, and that's as it should be.<P>Yes, cobalt drops for helm and bracers sucks. But I'm sure that all classes face rarity of a few pieces of armor. Shaman BP and bracer for example, Cleric Donals gloves&BP, Ranger bracer and boots, etc. Its just part of the way they set it up.<P>Our epic is rough. Having it (which I DON'T) is a symbol of prestige and the very fact that it isn't the best weapon we can get (try a willsapper and BoBDE combo) makes it nonessential to our class. Ranger epic is essential to their class. Ours is a status symbol, and nice, but far from the end of all the weapons we can get.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
