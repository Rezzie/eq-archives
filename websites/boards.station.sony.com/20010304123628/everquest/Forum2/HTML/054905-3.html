</FONT><HR>Ok all, lets make a clarification here. Defense and Offense are just skills just like parry, dodge, riposte etc are skills the word defense does not include all the other nice things that you must be thinkin it does. Give my bard same defense as a warrior, well thx, but he is still gonna get spanked around and die 15x faster than any warrior why? because he has low dodge skill and extremely low parry ( that we dont get to 53 ) so givin bards higher defense isnt saying much so get off your high horses folks.<BR>All i can say is i hope this isnt all of the changes. High lev Bards are not only the weakest defensive but also weakest offensive of all the hybrids. Our songs, buffs, debuffs, etc are not even 1/3 that of shamans, chanters. A grean 20 levs below us can kill us if we dont have dots memed and some room to run and 5 min to kite the mob. We begged for somthing besides clarity to get us into a group and all we got was another clarity song. So plz get a grip be glad you have gotten what you did and as for me my bard is shelved until they "balance" bards to other classes and if that means to take away some stuff, just so we can add somthing at high levs, or do somthing well enough besides be a mana generater then fine! Take it from us but make our songs comparble to other classes we can only do 3 things at once with decent lag if in laggy area or so called "router" problems might be down to 2 songs and on raids try one song and the worst melee dmg availble. And with those 3 songs being sub lev to all the other classes i find my self askin whats the point? Now who feels worthless who feels like there just takin up space? The bard. Some people are happy to stand there play a lute and look cool but im not i want to feel like im adding somthing to the group and as it stands i dont so my last 10 months and my 48 bard is shelved I'll play one of my alts and solo 4 blues with my druid or solo a whole floor of a dungeon with my necro cause hey its all being balanced right my bard will be fixed at some point right?<P>Well im not holdin my breath haha<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Umm...  hello??<P>Hitpoints.. AC.. the main things.  Compare any warrior with any hybrid of the same level.  Warrior has more HPs and more AC, if equipment isn't out of whack of course.<P>Why?  Well, warriors just have more HPs period.

</FONT><HR>OK.. I play a warrior as one of my chars too and this is getting out of hand now..<P>I agreed generally that paladins and shadowknights as such should be improved, but not overimproved. I NEVER figured out VI's views on the fact that a plain fisted monk is supposed to deal out more damage period then a warrior with 2H weapon or 2x1H weapon. But go figure, VI thought that's a way things are.. So for a some time now some "half-naked" monk can just stand next to me and with -plain- fists pound on -armored- moster and do that much better then I do it with any weapon..<P>Then the rangers started to deal out the same damage as warriors. Ranger, whos main combat mode should be RANGED, archery. But no, the tracker person is as I am, or even better in combat as me, a -professional- warrior. Go figure out again VI's points of view.. At least the AC was left lower for rangers, if that would be raised I would have to delete my warrior - there would have been no chance against a 'spellcasting warrior' then.<P>Then suddenly VI started to think that rogues should be also able to deal damage out like it's a last day of existence. Nevermind the fact that rogues main goal in any game or story etc is to stay OUT of combat, to do his scount/assassin work (assassination is HARDLY a tedious melee combat with the target btw)/thieving work. A dang good thing they didn't yet increase the AC that big time and left rogues still weaker then warriors!<P>And then there were of course paladins and shadowknights. Those 2 were a warrior types with smaller combat abilities, but with spells to compensate and also special powers (like LoH, HT). SK's get even a pet the higher you get. You know VI, funny thing is that I have seen many times SK solo HG/SG's for a cash with a pets help, and I YET have to see a warrior do it. And even paladins, while having less combat prowess, still could heal themselves, buff, damage mobs with spells. Warriors couldn't, still cant. They are totally dependant on other classes, while others had some sort of special abilities/spells to help them. But, at least they also lacked some things which still made a difference between them and a warrior.<P>And now?! The only difference coming out form last changes is that a warrior has only somewhat more AC and HP, and that's just it! A warrior, master of arms, who's primary and ONLY way of living is melee combat, is getting outdamaged and overpowered by other classes who have different special abilities far beyond warriors aside to their melee abilities! What is this?! My only difference as a high level warrior from ranger/paladin/shadowknight comes from 400 more HP (which is 1 or 2 hits from monsters we fight) and some little difference in AC score? I can take now 2 more hits from big bad monster then a paladin, and then paladin uses LoH and can take more hits, while I will already DIE!? SK who wants some cash will just go and hunt giants for fun with his pet, while I can't even DREAM about such thing?!<P>I don't want to have only such differences! A warrior is supposed to me a MASTER of armed combat, not someone who has just a bit more HP and AC and is nothing else then a meat wall! A warrior should always be ABOVE paladin or SK or ranger in his main area - armed combat! Hybrid melee classes kept yelling how no-one wanted them on big mob raids (though they are always presented on such!), and now you are turning them into WARRIORS with spells and special abilities which usual warriors lack!<P>And then what? You increase something for warriors too? Somehow I didn't see a -thing- about that in last patch message, besides the fix to 2 obvious and old bugs! Maybe you eventually raise something of a warriors too, so that hybrid classes will again scream for more power?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Banadan, monks *should* outdamage warriors (preferably with fists).<P>As a pure melee class, we have lower HP/AC than you do, and as such we should do more damage.  This is how it was pre-RoK, and how it should have remained.  As it is now, a well-equipped warrior will outdamage a well-equipped monk post-50 when the skill caps become equal or nearly equal.<P>And warriors will still way out-tank hybrids, I can't believe some of you don't think that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>First of all, I'm a 41st season paladin.  I love being a paladin, our ability to help in a group is unquestionable.  We can heal when needed, we can buff when needed, and we can tank to a degree.  I believe these upcoming changes will change a warriors role in groups.  And indeed it should.  However, as far as I can tell, it will only make your job EASIER.  Why oppose something that will only benefit the group as a whole?  A higher defense cap for paladins and shadow knights will mean that we can actually help you by taking less damage, which will make clerics and other healers more free to nuke the mobs, which will make killing go faster, which will make everyone happy.  A ranger being able to hit harder will mean that mobs die faster, again which only helps the group out.  Those of you who have played both sides to the subject, I salut you.  You guys are the only ones who can make a fair and honest judgement for these changes.  Those warriors who say that they can't solo.. well, guess what, neither can we.  At my level, the mobs hit hard and fast enough with our lower ac and defensive skills that I can't cast regularly.  I can take low blues, but that's it, if I get a mob even close to my level, I have to run from it.  Lay hands you might say? that'll work for ONE fight per EQ day.  kinda worthless to be able to fight something my level once a day.  cast root?  and do what?  we can't nuke so having distance will only allow us a few seconds of med time.  a few seconds?  I'm lucky if I even get to see the mana bar move in that time.  And even if I was able to solo well, why would I want to?  It's completely unefficient and a total waste of my time.  Groups will ALWAYS out-exp solo melee class.  So that point is irrelevant. <P>Final say:  making classes balanced will only benefit everyone.  It makes everyone useful to a group and therefore much easier to get groups going.  For those of you that feel making a class equal to yours is going to hurt your abilities or your usefulness to a group, get off your high horse and realize that the game does not revolve around a single person, it revolves around the THOUSANDS of players that log on every day.  Each and every class has it's benefits and drawbacks, realize that your class has it's perks and be glad for that, but stop thinking that making classes equal is going to hurt you.  It won't.

</FONT><HR>I'm watching this post closely because I'm a warrior and want to see what everyone thinks. Initially I was upset about making the hybrids have certain numbers the same as a warrior. The I realized something...I almost excusively group with the same people. These changes won't affect me in the least. The people who want to group with me will still do so. The ones they will affect...the ones who will log in one day and suddenly see ability increase messages...have to learn how to replay their class. No more will that ranger be able to sit there and pound away with impunity...now he has to re-learn when to nuke, what weapon to use...all so he doesn't get his butt handed to him by that uber-mob he forgot he can now agro as well as a warrior. And the Pallies, SK's and Bards...heck you guys taunt away, and when you see that the defense cap doesn't seem to reduce the damage when you get hit, and that the hits for 180-200pts drop your health bar faster than that newly changed druid can heal you and you die...remember, you wanted these changes. I'll still be there hitting my ineffectual taunts, trying to keep you alive but in vain (its hard enough keeping ill played monks and rogues alive, but I try...its what I do). good luck in relearning the char you've been working on for these past 2 years. I won't have to...there is one thing I do question tho and I hope it gets answered "Warriors have the best armor and weapons" you said...what weapons exactly were you talking about...I look at one of the sites, sort the 1hs weapons by ratio and have to go up to the 10th slot, to Wurmslayer to find the first warrior useable weapon (not counting the Fanfaire weapon) and up 17 slots to the first warrior only weapon (which happens to be our Epic) and not counting our epic we go up 33 slots to find the first, non epic warrior only 1hs. In 1hb I only have to go up 20 to find the first warrior only weapon there and its cursed. Only 18 slots in 2hb to find our first warrior only weapon and its dropped by a god. Now in 2hs our best weapon, that is warrior only, is 3rd on the list but our epic...we can go up 11 before we find our first non-epic warrior 2hs. In piercing we go 23 up the list before we find the best warrior only weapon. This is long and I apologize so I'll be brief in my point. Either we really don't have the best weapons or they havn't been found yet. It appears, based off the data got off the web that warriors are meant to be 2hs wielders even though the vast majority feel the need to dual wield to effectivly..relegating us to 1 handed weapons...this implies, to me anyway, that we need someone to look at our equipment or our taunt...after all, we can't really have the best weapons if everyone can use them too...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a question.  I started an Iksar Warrior and gave it up around level 25ish when it started too look like it was going to end up a spell-less ranger ( no plate y'know ).  If the proposed changes do go through for hybrids will there be even the slightest reason to play an iksar warrior?  How bad is the AC diff between a non-iksar warrior in plate and an iksar in the best they can "realistically" wear with there inbred ac bonus?  By realistically I mean something that can be camped by a pick up group of 4-6 strangers or sells for less then say 5K a piece?  Now, assuming the hybrids get the proposed defense increases where will that place them as compared to iksar warriors?  If Rangers now end up better ( ac or hp wise ) then Iksar Warriors will we get the "Plate comparable iksar warrior armor" I seem to recall verant talking about us poor lizzies finding in RoK when we expresed our concerns oh so long ago.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me say something here folks.  I myself am a 35 warrior, i know, pathetic level, but have noticed some things.  Paladins are useless even at my level, they don't have nearly as good melee as me or tanking.  I hear at post 50 they are even worse.<P>I have always thot they were a good class, and was thinking of being one until i found how bad they suck at high levels.  I think they need to be improved, but making the def is not the answer.<P>I have no suggestions, but i know they are not balanced, they need to be better, but raising def same as warrior is not solution...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Are paladins considered tanks? If so when would a group want one over a warrior?  What does a paladin do as good as or better than a warrior? Well, we taunt better, but only when we have mana.  Other than that we deal 1/2 the damage, have less hps, less ac, less defense, lower dodge/riposte/disarm/bash, no dual wield, 90% of our spells are useless when grouped with a cleric, and our disciplines are useless.  Verant throws us a bone by increasing defense and warriors start complaining that they are being nerfed.  <BR>     If paladins are tanks then they should be considered equal to a warrior when being considered for a group.  Same with Sk's and Rangers.  As of now Warriors are the number one choice by far and if no warriors are to be found a group will "settle" for a hybrid.  This is not balance.  Hybrids only ask for balance, not to be superior.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi all-<P>A level 60 paladin with ONLY 120 wis has around 1500+ mana to play with.  That's about enough for 6 superiour heals (600pts each).  Add that to all the buff spells available (Naltron, Shield of Words, resolution, divine strength) and you have a party with THOUSANDS (6K+) of effective "added" hit points, and several HUNDRED extra AC.<P>And a warrior is supposed to have a hp and AC advantage in a group?!?<P>Similar, but slightly less staggering comparisons also exist for rangers and SKs, weighted more toward DD (tho with significant healing ability) for rangers and SKs.  Bottom line, hybrids are VERY viable for "regular" gaming, far moreso than a same-level warrior.  It's only for ubermobs there seems to be an issue.<P>Here's a thought; instead of warriors being considered the baseline class, why aren't we considered the PARENT class for hybrids?  I.e. we should represent the hypothetical "best" tank, the other classes are (necessarily watered down in effectiveness) derivations.  We give up almost ALL versatility and depth for that, isn't that enough?<P>Warriors have TWO main attributes: offensive capability (damage output, 3rd/4th best) and defensive capability (ac, hp).  How can anyone seriously suggest that classes with significant and very useful spell casting ability should also be EQUAL to warriors in one or the other of those?  What exactly would the tradeoff be for playing a hybrid then?<P>Rdt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just gotta respond to this...<P>Okay guys here is the Real Deal.  I totally do not understand why Warriors are more upset with Paladin/Shadow Knight upgrades than they are with the Ranger changes.<P>Even if the Knights are upgraded to same cap as Warriors on Defense we will still have:<P>Less AC <BR>Less HP<BR>Less Parry<BR>Less Dodge<BR>Less Riposte<P>Not to mention less Offense and Damage outputs.<P><BR>Reply to the uninformed:<P>Pets are used ONLY in specific situations.  You cannot use pets more than 30% of the time due to its aggro/control/pathing problems.  Bottom line is when pets are used they are fun but in no way make up for things like lack of Duel Wield/Offense/Weapon Skills.<P>Shadow Knight spells take an average of 4 seconds to cast if not interupted.  At level 55 typically the only spells I use routinely are the High Taunt ones.  Not for the damage they do but typically for the taunt factor.<P>Harm Touch is once every game day around 72 Minutes.  Compare this to Riposte and how many times a Warrior can use per game day and there is no comparison. Riposte is much better discipline yet HT is supposed to be a class defining skill.<P>Spells on Armor.  This in fact makes Warriors Hybrids.  When ROK came out this completely unbalanced Hybrids since the spells we got on armor for the most part we already had.  Warriors got very useful utility spells they never had.<P>Bottom line on this is:<P>Warriors still have twice the offense as the Knights and are still better at Tanking than the Knights.  So whats the Big Deal if Defense cap is the same???  Warriors will still be taken over Hybrids in most situations because overall they are the ultimate all around Tank/Damage Dealer.<P>Kaitan (Nightmare Clan)<BR>55 Shadow Knight <BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"How can anyone seriously suggest that classes with significant and very useful spell casting ability should also be EQUAL to warriors in one or the other of those? What exactly would the tradeoff be for playing a hybrid then?"<P>Ok, let's talk about "useful" spells.  Let's talk about this in the sense of a regular group.  As a level 55 Ranger I primarily use 2 spells in a regular xp group...  Ensnare and Jolt.  Strength of Nature more recently.  So, there's three spells for you.  Occasionally I'll pop out another one or two, but the sheer bulk of my abilities.<P>Paladins...  I typically see them use their healing spells on occasion, more often their stuns.  Again, relatively few spells.<P>SKs?  I see them use Darkness usually only to annoy me with breaking Ensnare.  FD is the other big one for them.<P>So you've got around 3 spells that make it into common usefulness for these character classes.  Some other spells will see use, yes, and it is worth some tradeoff but those are the big ones.<P>Now, for all of this look at what we have to give up.<P>Rangers: Give up any defensive upgrades post level *35* other than Dodge and Parry which they finally gave upgrades to some months back.  Still ranked 4th in damage dealing ability, very low Armor Class, very low hitpoints.<P>Paladins: No dual wield, low offensive capability, very poor damage output, Armor with substantially less AC than Warrior armor<P>Shadow Knights: No dual wield, low offensive capability, very poor damage output, armor with substantially less AC than Warriors.<P>Now, please, tell me how the spells that we have (which don't see use on raids) are balanced by these deficiencies.<P>Yes, the spells are there for utility, sure they do OK in a grouping situation.  Ultimately, however, the bulk of them go completely unused in raid situations while every ability that a Warrior has is used to its fullest.<P>Bearing these weaknesses in mind, I see no reason why a hybrid should not match warriors in one way or the other.  A Paladin or SK is still going to have pathetic damage output, a Ranger is still not going to be able to last long with a mob's attention turned to him.  So only a warrior can do that.  Warriors will still have the best AC, higher defensive skill caps, and excellent weapons.<P>Honestly, try to look at all sides of this before going off on another jealous rant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Good VS faction is also required if you want to complete the Worker Sledgemallet quest, or even for safety if you want to use the mallet for its self-only overthere outpost teleport procc effect.<P>Its a crazy situation where Verant puts the best shadowknight armour and weaponry in a dungeon that destroys the very faction we need for Kunark...and then makes the armour so rare that by the time you have looted a piece, you are most likely KoS in the evil outpost!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I strongly believe that Varant is confused as to what the hybrids should do. I believe the hybrid class has taken on a life of its own, beyond what they were designed for (poorly I might add) in the game. <BR>I agree as an SK the issue is not Defense Cap, it is a symptom. I do not think the Sk should have an equal defense cap to warriors, Paladiins should. Offense, fine if they want, then Rangers should. Bards are bards and should be treated with more respect, oh well. <BR>The SK should hands down, be the most powerful Hybrid period. But not primarily through skills, through spells.<BR>Verant is doing alot of good things for the Pali class, rangers I dont know, Bard oh well. The Sk changes are looking very good, for in line play, Except Damage spells (like DOTS). SKs should do more spell damage.<BR>I still see a confused Verant. Why nerf or think of nerfing the pet speed buff, it is a 20ish spell and the effect is not drastic, especially if you think that a necro has a tough pet plus the buff.<P>Anyhow, AC, Attack, Offense, Defense all these skill based, character based variables should primarily be added to the SK through SPELLS.<BR>Whether you like it or not an SK is power not grace. <BR>Rak<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054905&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054905&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
