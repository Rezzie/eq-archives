</FONT><HR>Hmm, I go home from work and I miss some interesting comments. Pardon my delay.<P>--<P>"Vladimirr, all those things you mention actually<BR>ADD something to either the game, or to your characters actual abilities.<BR>staring at the spell book adds nothing."<P>Hmm? No, maybe you don't understand. Think of having to look at the spell book as the Lack-of-reward, and hitting level 35 as the reward. <P>You're saying that NOT having spells at levels 1-8 adds to the game? You're saying NOT having track until level 20 adds to the game? That's what you just said, unless I misunderstood.<P>--<P>"Casters dont gain any ability when the book goes away, it just goes away."<P>Yes, they do, or this thread wouldn't exist. Casters gain the ability to see the world around them while they meditate.  Another example would be dual wielding weapons - You could say the warrior has BOTH hands, but can only use one hand for a weapon until a certain level, which is stupid. After all, he does have 2 hands!<P>--<P>"None of these are things that the player HAS to do; the interface does not enforce any of this. If you want to let auto-attack do the fighting, you can look around. If the character needs food, you can ignore it. Same with taking damage."<P>Do you *HAVE* to look at the spellbook? No. You can sit and regain mana. Now, I agree that not doing so would be pretty stupid - but then again so is taking unnecessary damage, and not buying food.<P>--<P>"i'll buy in to that post that said you are starting, you are increasing magic skill, etc. from a RPG viewpoint, but geez man 35 is too much torture for anyone,it's just too far down the road."<P>How is it that we have casters, then, that are above level 35?<P>--<P>"The spellbook is just a bad legacy left over from the early days. Classes have been 'balanced' without this silly inconvenience taken into account."<P>Actually, classes have been balanced WITH the spellbook taken into account. It's been in the game since release.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Its verant way of punsishjing you with downtime.<P>Get used to it.<P>Warriors and melees are punished with "travel Time" and lack of binding areas to increase said travel time. (shut it about equip, we are talking class abilities)<P>Casters get to bind close, and many get travel spells to reduce down time and binding close to reduce down time and travel time when they die.<P>It is all part of the Vision.<P>If any caster on here feels binding is a dead issue and not related to this, they are wrong.<P>It is all down time, and ways to make feel it.<P>I play a shaman and a warrior.  Ill take staring at the book anyday as compared to having to run naked through multi zones due some damn bind bug..and thats what it is, a dang bug in the game mechanics, or a bug in the minds of the makers...but its all the same.<P>Good luck with it, but I bet the book will be removed as quickly as we get new melee bind spots.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The character should have to stare at the spellbook during meditation.  The player should not.  Should the player have to play the game with one hand, just because the character cannot duel wield?  Should the player have to go to the grocery store, just because the character needs food?

</FONT><HR>Malaia,<P>Your analogy about sitting through half the movie with dark glasses on is flawed... Though I can understand where your frustrations come from.<P>You are assuming that level 35 is "halfway" thru something that has no finite length.<P>A movie begins and ends and you can pick the halfway point... when you get to level 35, the whole world begins to open up and believe me, two things will happen... (1) you will realize that if there is a "halfway" you are far far FAR from it... and (2) You will be so enthralled with where you can go, what you can see, and what you need to do to get there, that in a few more levels past 35... looking at the spellbook while medding will be nothing more than a distant, inconsequential memory.<P>It is incredibly irritating I understand that... I am a Ranger and though I am not a pure caster I too had to deal with "booknose" till 35.<P>But I saw it as paying my dues... It is not unfair because all casters have to deal with it... and when it was over, I felt like I had endured and was ready to enjoy something new and excellent!  *losing the sense of helplessness while medding*<P>If you really want to talk about the sense of paying your money and missing half the game then 1-35 is only a small portion of that enjoyment... actually a very small portion...  Think about 35-60...  Medding with your nose in the book will be the least of your considerations... and in time will even be a point almost of Pride that you were able to live thru it.<P>I am certain that Verant put it in to irritate people and give them something to move past... The fact that you are irritated only means that it is working and you are DRIVEN to get past it, and it is not even debilitating as would be a serious bug or other programming flaw...<P>They could start you off without having to look at the book while medding, at all... and they could also start of warriors with Combine longswords instead of rusty no drops...<P>In the end it is only a small thing to overcome... a better analogy of being blinded and tied down because of the book in your face while medding, when you really just want to have fun would be.... College...<P>*smile*  It's all good...<P>Faenor, 45th Ranger of Surefall Glade<P>"You can't see anything right now? Oh Yes! Damn! I forgot all about that!"<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nope my analogy stands.. its like sitting through half a movie wearing dark glasses.<P>level 60 is max you can reach 35 is more than half of it I'll give you the other 5 levels as time spent raiding at higher levels.<P>But staring at this book adds NOTHING to the game.. in fact it detracts from making all the classes I want to play . IE most of the classes are casters only three pure melee classes.. so out of sooo may different classes if I want to enjoy the game at lower levels I have to pick a pure melee cause I do NOT enjoy staring at that  book for 2 mos.. either that or get power leveled to 35 /shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I played to level 50 without the spell book "enhancement" so what about that?  35 is really not that hard to achieve if you want to, and if not then you are a roleplayer (not a bad thing) and it probably makes sense.  Having the chat window does not make it totally "blind" anyways.  And when you're meditating in real life you CAN hear what's going on around you, though you may ignore it.<P>And 35 is no where NEAR half way, I'd say more like 55.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"what did your remark about the hybrid patch have to do with staring at the spell book?"<P>See the two highest level characters I have listed.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>--<P>"in other words.. enchanters are asking for mez to overwrite.. well I played an enchanter to 54 well I had to do it that way so do you.."<P>Nay. This is more like saying that the spell "Clarity" is moved to level 1 for enchanters. Would you not be a bit miffed, since you had played levels 1-29 without clarity? It just cheapens what you've accomplished.<P>Anyhow, the spellbook is a core function of the game interface; asking for its removal or relocation to a lower level is similar to asking for more spell slots - it WOULD alter the gameplay of any casters now above the level to have to view it.<P>How would it alter the game, you ask? What does the spellbook add to the game? Danger. Risk. Your groupmates have to tell you when danger approaches, or else you're going to get whacked. If you're soloing, you have to break meditation every so often and keep on the lookout for oncoming beasts. After level 35, this danger aspect is removed.<P>This is a core game mechanic. Asking for its removal (in my opinion, anyhow), is like asking for the removal of the mana bar. Why is it there? It's boring to watch it recharge. I find no fun in sitting and waiting for 3 minutes after a fight in order to be ready for the next one. Why can't we cast unlimited spells?

I do not agree that very much useful info is gained by being able to look at a battle in which you are not participating.

My highest level character is level 30.  I have played a long time, but I like to wander around and help people.  In fact, I played a cleric because I want to help people.  Why should I be punished for that?  I can accept the fact that I have to sit a lot and that others do all the fun fighting stuff.  Fine.  I signed up for that.  <P>But to be an effective cleric I have to med during battles.  So I never even get to watch the fights.  I watch a static book page.  And it is boring.<P>Boring boring boring boring boring boring boring<P>No fun.

</FONT><HR>"35 then, is 5 more than halfway through it."<P>Hehe, I'd agree more with the guy who said 55. Let's say 50.<P>Meditation *is* supposed to have a "negative" impact on the game, if you choose to call it that. It presents a challenge. Seeing while meditating is an ability that your character is not supposed to have.<P>--<P>"Um please dont compare getting clarity at level 1 to reducing the spell book option..

You're asking for the game to get easier for the lower levels. IMO, the game is already getting too easy at the lower levels.<P>--<P>"it isn't an added ability, no one asked to be able to med standing, etc, they just want to be able to SEE for petes sake."<P>It is an added ability; it's one you don't have now and you want added.<P>--<P>As I've said before, I think lower level characters get handed wayyyy too many things as opposed to those of us who started the game at or near release. Yes, it does make me mad, and yes it DOES affect me each time I see a new low-level spell added or a new ability given to newbies. Removing the spellbook, or moving it down in levels, would just be another kick in the pants.<P>What if you had a job (which you most likely do, most people here seem to post from work  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ), and you worked your arse off. I mean it. You pull 60 hour weeks for 3 months in a row, you put together incredible presentations and harvest new clients for your company.

In return, here's a $5000 bonus, as a reward for all your efforts. Merry Christmas."<P>The very next day you come into the office, and your boss calls you into his office again. "We really think you did a good job. Really, we still do. However, we are going to give everyone around the office a $5000 bonus. After all, it's Christmas. Awwww, c'mon now. Don't feel bad - at least you can have the sense of accomplishment for working those extra hours.

</FONT><HR>I think a better solution would be to replace the "penalty" of looking at the book while medding with an alternative penalty that captures the spirit of being diconnected to concentrate.<P>I think people object to the spellbook because you are missing the action.  By blinding out casters for 35 levels they have cut many players out of the compelling visuals and created a chatroom.  Games should be fun.  Looking at that book instead of the evolving combat is not fun...I am sure that reason alone has discouraged people from playing casting classes.  <P>Perhaps when a player meds they could be forced into a high 3rd person perspective so that they could watch from a distant and elevated perspective.  You could add an fade in and fade out effect to add to the feeling of meditating without cutting the player completely out of the graphics engine.  I am not sure what the tech limitations to these suggestions are but there has to be a middle ground on this.  <P>One thing is for sure looking at the book is not fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Vlad, I really think there is a big difference between all the other things you list and the thing we are talking about.  You are listing changes that would make the game easier to play.  We are talking about something that would make the game FUNNER to play.  For those who have not done it, it is hard to imagine how boring it is to play a cleric.  You must med during the parts of the game that are most fun to watch.  Its pure tedium.  And what makes it so galling is that it is so unnecessary to the game balance.<P>*sigh*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"i play a melee class, and running to / from battle sights or doing Cr's doesn't bother me.. well, it does, but not like "the book" does."<P>So it's a "not fun" thing?  That's what I would take that to mean.  You see?  This "not fun" arguement can be brought up in just about any thread.  VI has to place limitations on various things in the game.  Spellbook while medding til 35 is one of them.<P>"Having to sit immobile while medding seems to me to appear to be penalty enough. Warrior classes, to regain lost HP, must sit in order to regain lost HP in the quickest manner"<P>Then you know how much longer the warrior must sit to get back to full hitpoints than a caster to full mana.  It's a much longer time to get 4 and a half bubs of health for a lvl 25 warrior than it is for a lvl 25 caster to get 4 and a half bubs of mana.  Another "not fun" thing for the tank.<P>"they do not like even having to sit, even WITH <BR>vision ,to the point that early on in the game,WAAAAYYYY before 35, they start shouting "Neeed a Heal" over their shoulder, while continuing to fight."<P>Some won't, they will bandage back to half and sit back to full.  Normally, if I'm running around and come across someone "NOT" begging for heals while fighting, I'll toss in one.  It doesn't take long for me to regen the mana needed for GHeal at 51.<P>"But, a lot of casters will gladly heal anyway, <BR>knowing what they have in store in return. shaman, also, being masters of buffs, are frequently asked for buffs / heals to the point of having no mana left for themselves, for attack <BR>spells nor to cast buffs on themselves, and they do not melee well."<P>I don't get the idea where people think that casters must sit all the time during a battle.  It's really not that much of a benefit until you reach the mid 30's anyway.  You don't lose much by standing up and watching the battle.  People just get so tied up with stand/cast/med now that they have forgotten that until the latter parts of the game, there is really not that much of a benefit to it at the lower levels.<P>so, IMO, Melee classes should consider this when making "bind" ability requests, etc. for their class and, "forced" downtime by other classes is also an angle to consider, when deciding to enforce "the book" all the way to level 35."<P>As casters should also consider the downtime of the melee not getting that bind.  That could very well be one long run if they can't get a bind and die.<P>"Valid? it's all opinion. but "fun" it is not."<P>Yep, all opinion.  But as I said, that arguement can be used with a lot of issues.  Ones that VI has already answered, such as this one.<P>Let everyone learn all the skills at level 1, give all spells at level 1, give all the best equipment at lvl 1.  Who's it going to hurt?

If you look up at my list of characters (if you care to, anyway), you'll notice that I have quite a few that fall under the "have to watch the book" category. I know.  If my druid didn't have to get up every few minutes to make sure there aren't any approaching lions/sarnaks/whatever, the game would be easier.

</FONT><HR>Vlad, you play a druid and a necro.  Two outside solo classes.  Perhaps it makes a (tiny) bit of difference in the gameplay for them to have to get up and look once in a while to see if something has wandered by.  Maybe.  But I still doubt that it makes enough of a difference in the difficulty of playing the game that it warrants making the game boring as hell to play.  <P>Anyhow, as i said, I am a cleric.  I must group to get any exp.  I do not med during downtime only.  I med during battles to help my group with that last extra heal that might make a difference.  So I never get to watch the actual fighting.  I don't need to, becuase I can monitor health bars anyway.  But I want to!  I want to enjoy the look of the game, not look at my playing as a kind of a chore done only for the benefit of others.  There is no way that the minor extra strategy/gameplay value of book blindness makes enough diffence to warrant boring the crap out of your customer base.<P>Stirek, you said "Let everyone learn all the skills at level 1, give all spells at level 1, give all the best equipment at lvl 1. Who's it going to hurt? It just goes round and round."<P>As I said, that is not the same type of change that we are discussing here.  Surely you recognize the difference.  <P>I just want to watch my friends womp on things.  It really is not so much to ask.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Then you know how much longer the warrior must sit to get back to full hitpoints than a caster to full mana."<P>When a warrior is sitting to heal, the player can use external view to see what is going on.  When a warrior is in combat, the player can use external view to see the whole battle.  When a caster is staring at the spellbook, the player is also staring at the spellbook--why is it that I cannot even cast a simple fire bolt on my boss after staring at my character's book for hours?  Because it makes no sense for me to stare at the spellbook for hours, so it shouldn't be there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058535&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058535&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
