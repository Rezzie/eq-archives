Empty since Meldrath's departure, I have stocked the dusty shelves with tomes I have collected: the Wizard Compilation of Graffë M'yrddin, the Necrognomicon of Morty Undercrypt and the latest edition of the Tinkering Compendium as edited by Kredal Cookiegnomie and Kritta Didymus. All of these books have been enlightening, and helped make me the gnome I am today, it seemed to me that it was time to pass on what I have learned on my travels through Norrath, Luclin and even the Planes of Power.<P>(Note: Those of you who come to read my advice and take it in the spirit in which it is offered may skip the next paragraph, which is something of a regrettable necessity, as we live in a world -- well, worlds -- where blowhards would challenge the credentials of any who would dare give advice to help others.)<P>I am Whizbang Dustyboots, gnomish sorcerer of the third rank, Baron of the Dragonscale Hills and wielder of the Staff of the Four. I am the scourge of the Teir'Dal, death incarnate to the Kromzek and Kromriff, and I have brought low the dragons of Kunark. I carry the Flaming Sword of Xuzl at my hip, wear the Robe of Icicles upon my back and bear trophies wrested from the Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule itself, whose name is dreadful to all who hear it. I have passed through the Halls of Testing and my footsteps have echoed in the corridors of the gods themselves. I have been bestowed some of the highest honors, both religious and military, by the Coldain dwarves and have been given a title of nobility by the humans of Qeynos. None can deny that I am one of the greatest linguists and explorers this age has seen. In my presence, the wise take heed and fools perish.<P>Whew. I sure hope you all skipped that. It makes me feel a little icky to have to do that, but I don't really want to argue credentials when it comes to this advice again. So, here follows my advice for young wizards. This is intended to simply be a primer to the craft, and not a complete guide -- Graffe's Wizard Compilation is the far superior resource for that. My only intent is to help young wizards get off on the right foot with the following advice and hints about their possible futures:<P>1.	A WIZARD IS BORN<P>a.	Race - When Solusek Ro, the god of wizardry, gave four staffs to his greatest wizardly worshippers in a recent age, two of them were humans (Arantir Karondor and Demunir Scry), one was Koad'Dal (Sylen Tyrn), and the last was gnomish (Gabstik Firepot). In our present age, the most famous (or more accurately, notorious) wizard is the Erudite Al'Kabor. Before her ascension to the ranks of the demigods, Lanys the Teir'Dal was a wizardess feared throughout Norrath. In short, while gnomes are clearly the greatest of all races on Norrath, any of the wizardly races can rise to greatness, although they each have their advantages, some of which will especially help younger wizards, but all of which balance out well before the time they earn the title of sorcerer. Choose whichever race you like.<P>b.	Religion<P>i.	Roughly a third of wizards worship no deity. Our power draws upon the primal energies of the universe, not from the gods (although a few have inspired spells) and thus there is no overwhelming need to be anything other than agnostic. Agnosticism will allow you to avoid some of the religious strife that mars Norrath, but otherwise offers no real advantages.<P>ii.	About another third of wizards follow the aforementioned Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince. His faith places an importance on power, particularly the unrestrained use thereof. Not only did he previously destroy the elvish homelands on Tunaria (now Antonica), reports from explorers of the Planes of Power say that he is even now working on a creature with which he intends to destroy Norrath utterly. Some of you may find this oddly charming for some reason. Worshippers of Solusek Ro can memorize and cast the oddly rare Imbue Fire Opal spell and wear jewelry using imbued fire opals as well as carry idols and golden idols decorated with them. These items greatly add to the intelligence and fire resistance of their users, although not beyond that which other wizards can obtain with other items.<P>iii.	A final third of wizards worship deities others of their race follow, including Brell Serilis, Tunare, Innoruuk, Karana and others. Most of these gods and goddesses have no real effect on the wizarding lives of those wizards who worship them, although Innoruuk has imbued sapphire items that compare favorably to Solusek Ro's, with Bertoxxulous lagging behind in third place with his imbued black sapphire items. Tunare also has a quest for devout evokers who visit the Plane of Growth.<P>c.	Starting Stats - The most common choice when allocating starting points is to dump as many as possible into Intelligence. While not required, this gives a young wizard as much innate mana as possible, and also helps spell-casting skills go up more quickly. After that, the remaining points can be placed anywhere, but the biggest advantages can be found in Strength, Stamina, Agility and Charisma. Dexterity is close to useless (well, there are rumors it makes us get critical hits with your innate crit skill, but this hasn't been definitively proven by any means) and Wisdom has no effect whatsoever, and points simply should not be placed there. Note that whatever your starting statistics, it is fairly easy to get any "bad" statistics up later on, especially Intelligence, which is one of the easiest statistics to raise in the game. No matter how badly someone may tell you that you "screwed up" your points allocation at the beginning, it really isn't that big of a deal.<P>d.	Server Choice - It's unfortunate but true that this makes a difference for a young wizard. If you have no particular ties to a server, strongly consider making your new wizard on the youngest server possible. Fewer high end melee weapons will have trickled down into the hands of newbie melee types, and you won't have the humbling (to put it mildly) experience of having a warrior hit as hard as you do, without spending any mana. Things get better no matter what later on, but you'll likely want to group at least part of the time for most of your career, and being in a more balanced environment helps. While I don't play PVP, I'm told that wizards are also quite fearsome on the Zek servers, although know what you're getting into there.<P>2.	THE WIZARDING LIFE<P>a.	Newbie Quests - At the time of this writing, all of the wizarding races but Erudites have newbie armor quests available in their home towns. While it is certainly possible to be twinked with better items, it's a rare young wizard who has better gear in all the available slots. At the very least, look into the quests for the slots where your gear is lacking. And gnomish and dark elf wizards should think twice before turning down their initiate spellbooks, both of which are exceptionally nice items for the level, and which young wizards will likely carry well into their journeyman years. Erudites (and Qeynos native humans) should consider doing the Servant's Staff and Gloves of the Gatecaller quests in Erudin, although neither results in a spectacular item.<P>b.	Melee - You're not a melee combatant, and if you forget that, you won't be any sort of combatant for long. Having said that, everyone runs out of mana sometime, and this is especially true of younger wizards. At those times, it's better to be able to hit your foe with SOMETHING than with nothing. Wizards have three main combat skills in which they can train: one handed blunt, two handed blunt and piercing. I strongly advice against the two handed route: Given the small amount of combat practice most young wizards receive, you'll likely only be really skilled with one form of combat (to the extent that wizards are ever skilled in combat). If you learn two handed blunt as your primary weapon skill, the time will come when you WILL want to equip two separate somethings in your primary and secondary hands. That will mean your primary hand then is holding a weapon that's NOT two handed blunt and you've just put yourself at a disadvantage. (And before you ask, no, there really aren't any two handed staffs that are better than having two separate items in each of your hands. Strange but true.) So, really, it's a question in my mind of whether you want to specialize in one handed blunt weapons or piercing weapons. Personally, I prefer a staff (all of the great staffs I'll outline below are one handed staffs) to a dagger, but it's really just a matter of preference.<P>c.	Spellcasting Skills<P>i.	The vast majority of your skills, and all of your basic spellcasting skills have a cap of (level x 5) + 5. Thus, at first level, your Evocation skill caps at 10. While it is somewhat tedious to practice your skills, especially at first, it is always worth maxing them out at each level, as soon as possible. (I myself used to fish while doing this, in order to make it less boring.) Your spells will fizzle less, and in combat, that can mean the difference between life and death. You probably want to do this all the way through your career, but it to 100 at a minimum is probably sufficient for most skills.<P>ii.	Do NOT ignore Conjuration. It's true, for 28 levels, this skill is nearly useless. But at level 29, you gain the ability to cast Minor Familiar, and it, like all its later cousins, is a giant mana hog and difficult to cast. Many wizards who neglected their Conjuration skill until they could cast the level 49 familiar (the first that helps the wizard regenerate mana faster) found themselves fizzling away whole bars of mana before being able to conjure up their familiar. While the level 29 familiar is only of minimal use, you will, without question, want the level 49, 54 and 60 familiars to be available. So put in that time with Eye of Zomm (or Eye of Tallon or Flaming Sword of Xuzl) and get this skill up!<P><BR>iii.	Specialize in Evocation, period. And remember to put a point in all of your Specialization skills and then cast Evocation spells until Specialize: Evocation goes over 51. The amount of mana you save in the long run will be huge.<P>d.	The Fine Art of Nuking<P>i.	The craft of wizardry comes down to balancing two factors: mana usage and agro. Learn to do as much damage as you can without using too much mana or gaining too much agro, and you'll be on the way to becoming a great wizard.<P>ii.	When soloing, it's quite simple: You get all the agro, so use as much mana as you need to live through it.<P>iii.	When grouping -- and wizards make excellent group members, especially once they get Lesser Evacuate -- your goal is to (normally) let the tanks have agro, while you wait for your foe to be sufficiently distracted by them, and then cut loose. Done right, you can do a substantial amount of damage, and save the healers a great deal of mana.<P>iv.	A simple rule of thumb is not to nuke in groups until 50 percent of the damage has been done to the target. Like most rules of thumb, this is a guideline to help you learn your craft. In time, you'll learn to be able to nuke much, much earlier (I often begin when the target is at 90 percent health), but 50 percent is a good place to start learning.<P>v.	You will screw up on the point above. That's OK, you'll learn. Later on, you'll be able to quest the Concussion spell, which removes roughly the amount of agro you'd get for doing 300 points of damage with a nuke. In the meantime, if you screw up, DON'T take off running. You're an easier target to hit while running (seriously -- that big dress-wearing back is pretty easy to smack) and your tanks will have to work a lot harder to smack whatever's trying to kill you. Learn the discipline of standing there and taking your lumps for a moment before the tanks re-acquire agro.<P>vi.	Make it a point to group as much as possible. It's easy to solo as a wizard, but you will absolutely not have the skills needed to be good in a group without grouping, especially the ability to know what other classes are capable of. You'll also find it harder to get a group when you want it if you don't have people around who've enjoyed grouping with you in the past.<P>vii.	Don't go for the kill shot. This may seem counter-intuitive because, hey, who doesn't like seeing their name displayed as the great slayer of the monster? However, when a melee hits something with a sword, they're almost always ready to hit something with that sword again moments later, and if they do far more damage than is needed for the killing blow, it doesn't make a difference. For wizards, every bit of damage you do costs mana, and a kill shot almost invariably means some mana was spent on damage that more than killed your foe -- and was thus wasted and is unavailable for you to use on the next target. Just nuke until the foe is running (if you're in an environment where they do), and then sit down and meditate.<P>viii.	Raiding for a wizard is very similar to their grouping role and we're one of the few caster classes who can say that. We're also one of the few where we have a greater effect in greater numbers, as opposed to classes that buff or debuff, where one or two can handle the entire load of an average raid just fine. You will be able to do tremendous amounts of damage on raids, where the targets typically have many more hit points than in experience groups, and once a main tank has acquired agro they (hopefully) will be very hard to taunt a foe off of. Situational spells like Hsagra's Wrath (Giant Bane) and Porlos' Fury (Dragon Bane) can be used in raids, and our 51+ Tears spells are fantastic in them as well (I cannot rave highly enough about how well Tears of Druzzil works in the Kael Drakkel arena, for instance). Even on the least wizard-friendly servers, raiding guilds are always looking for wizards. Excel in this field, and you'll see as much of the game as you care to.<P>e.	Dungeons - A class with the ability to root, snare, kill stuff FAST when there's an emergency, evacuate everyone to the safe spot when things go very wrong, and at worse bring back someone to rez the group after a wipe-out is tailor made for dungeons. Spend as much time in them as possible. The rewards, in terms of skills, experience and loot, are unbeatable.<P>f.	Quad-Kiting - It's not one of my specialties (I prefer to single kite, honestly), but Bicrius has posted what is the premier guide for this style of soloing over at Graffe's Wizard Compilation. (http://www.Graffe.com/ and click on Forums and then Library.) Many wizards have used quadding as their way to lots of good soloing experience and a decent bit of change as well. Just remember that you're not playing a solo game and show other players the same courtesy you'd like themselves if you were in their shoes.<P>g.	AoE Groups - They became wildly successful during the Luclin era, and the art of grouping one or two wizards, one or two enchanters, a healer and others together to lay waste to enemies in vast numbers became quite controversial at the same time. The basics: AoE grouping is possible (although more difficult) at a fairly low level (the second floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadows is a good place to learn) using the Point Blank AoE spells that radiate out of the casting wizard's body, hitting all available targets. Enchanters keep the foes locked down (hopefully) with an AoE stun, and everyone cycles their spells until their foes are dead. This becomes a practicality when a wizard is in their mid-50s and gets their second Jyll's AoE spell and is able to cycle these two spells back to back cheaply and quickly. As a rule, you want a hunting area that has as many similar targets as possible so they all die at once, although this isn't a strict necessity. Note that jerks have managed to give these groups a black eye with much of the public, including GMs. If you get into a conflict over what areas to pull, I strongly advise you to figure out a way to work it out before GMs show up, as you will almost certainly lose at that point, rightly or wrongly. Play nicely, and you can rake in lots of XP (although not nearly as much as the urban legends like to say) and what's more important, it's a LOT of fun. AoE tactics also work in some raids -- you haven't lived until you've burned down the Chardok's Prince's retinue this way, for instance.<P>3.	PHAT LEWT<P>a.	Three Staffs of Power<P>i.	The Staff of the Wheel - Seek out Sulgar in the Everfrost Peaks to begin this 10 part quest, which will take you all over the old world to complete and get your swimming skill up quite a bit. No combat is required for this quest, although some of the portions of Tarton's wheel are in quite dangerous environments. Nevertheless, this quest can be completed as early as level 20 by brave (and lucky) wizards and I myself completed this staff at level 31. This one handed staff has 10 intelligence among other characteristics, and many wizards bear it until they complete their epic quest for the Staff of the Four. Completing this quest is a rite of passage, and it signifies to many wizards that you are a serious member of their community -- most will be happy to give you advice along the way, in fact.<P>ii.	The Staff of Temperate Flux - Seek out Gardern in the Temple of Solusek Ro to begin this quest. It's difficult to explain what's so great about this staff, considered by many wizards to be their most prize possession, so take this on faith: While having an instant click effect (that works from inventory) that debuffs a foe by 6 points in fire and cold resistance doesn't seem like much, you will use this staff every day of your wizarding career once you have it. It's a range finder, a means to pull, and more. The quest is more difficult than the Staff of the Wheel quest, but much shorter. Many wizards manage to solo much of it outside the Solusek's Eye portion, although the quest is also a suitable challenge for a wizard's group in their 30s.<P>iii.	The Staff of the Four - Seek out Solomen in the Temple of Solusek Ro to begin this most important of quests. Wizards are blessed with an epic that retains its usefulness for all but the most elite of wizards (although the new level 63 spell Force Shield may end up diminishing its value somewhat). The quest is deceptively simple: Of the four great wizards blessed by Solusek Ro I mentioned earlier, only Arantir still lives. The other three wizards are dead, and their staffs are scattered. If you can recover them, and give them to Arantir, he will bundle them all together for delivery to Solomen, a historian of magic in the Temple of Solusek Ro, who will gift you with this amazing staff. Of course, none of the three staffs are ones you'll be able to retrieve solo, and while one is a guaranteed drop, the other two can sometimes frustrate and confound wizards trying to get them to drop. It's worth it, though: Not only does the staff have fantastic stats, its effect is a free 800 point rune (damage absorber) that also causes the wizard to regenerate mana 3 points more per tic (6 seconds) than otherwise.<P>b.	Intelligence and Mana Items - You have no power that is not derived from your mana, and it's thus your most precious resource. There are lots of good mana calculators out there, but here are some simple rules: Below level 30, you probably want +mana items, not +INT items. After level 30, try to get to 200 Intelligence. After level 50, try to get to 255 Intelligence. After level 61, try to keep your Intelligence maxed out at whatever your level's cap is.<P>c.	Focus Items - A relatively recent addition to the game, it's impossible to overstate the value of focus items to casters. For wizards, that especially means Improved Damage, Spell Casting Haste and Mana Preservation items. Load up on these as soon as you can, and try and stay current on them as you outgrow your older items (something that becomes difficult aftr you outgrow the level II foci). There are a series of relatively simple quests in the Plane of Knowledge for level II foci that I cannot recommend highly enough to young wizards, especially as most of the items required are droppable items from the old world, making them fairly easy to trade and obtain. After level 60, Improved Damage is harder to find, and for the most part is split into three Anger effects, one covering magic, fire and ice damage. In return for this inconvenience, they have a bigger modifier than Improved Damage items, so it balances out on the whole.<P>d.	Crucible of Escape - Created by high level potters, and useable after level 20, this item (which can be used from inventory) has the same casting time and effect as Lesser Evacuate -- whisk your group to the "safe spot" in the zone and wipe all agro. This will save your life many, many times and even make travel easier when going certain places. Well worth the investment.<P>e.	Journeyman's Boots - For a kiting wizard especially (and sooner or later, almost every wizard kites some), these boots are fantastic. They provide an instant click buff to make the user run 35 percent faster than normal (the same increase as a level 9 shaman's Spirit of Wolf buff), which is more than sufficient for most kiting, especially when using the level 29 or 51 Area of Effect snare spells as well. The Ancient Cyclops in the Southern Desert of Ro can be soloed by a wizard in their late 30s, although young wizards are advised to not bother scribing their fire spells for use on him, as he's totally immune. And prepare for a long, long, long wait on this camp. A slightly inferior (1.5 second casting time) alternative can be purchased from the gnomes of the Solusek Mining Company in Solusek's Eye, as well.<P>f.	Right Click Nukes - For whatever reason, these are extremely rare in EverQuest. The most popular and best-known is Solist's Icy Wand. It's an exceptionally rare drop in Kurn's Tower, and often goes for truly ridiculous prices. It lets a wizard chain cast their level 8 nuke (useable at level 12) free of mana. This stops being very useful in the early 30s, but until then, it's pretty nice. Other right click nukes are the Vermillion Orb and Robe of Torrefecation, dropped by Velketor the Sorcerer in Velious. Both are no drop items you'll need a high level raid to get, but both can help considerably in cutting the amount of mana used by a wizard, as these can supplement bigger cast spells. There are a handful of other such items in the game, but they are either of very limited (or no) use, are insanely rare, or no longer drop.<P>g.	A Horse - Expensive, yes. A luxury, yes. An immense help, yes, yes, yes! Horses allow you to cast spells without effectively standing up, meaning that you're meditating the whole time (yes, even during casting) and that when you're done casting, your don't sit back down, meaning you don't attract any extra agro. Unless you only quad-kite (as some wizards do), at some point you'll group or raid outdoors, where horses can be used (this includes the Planes of Power). The ability to meditate without sitting down is a huge advantage, and it's difficult to imagine hunting successfully in, say, the Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule. Once you start fighting in these environments after level 51 or so, seriously consider purchasing a horse, even if it's the slowest old nag in the Bazaar's stable.<P>h.	Flowing Thought Items - These items let you regenerate more mana per tic than usual, up to a total of +15 mana from worn items. Very few of these items are droppable, and most come from extremely high level zones. Nevertheless, they're very useful to have, and most wizards collect as many as they can.<P>4.	ALTERNATE ADVANCEMENT ABILITIES	<P>a.	Improved Natural Run Speed 3 - This effectively replaces jboots (33 percent improvement in run speed) and will save your life countless times. It's also a requirement to get into many AoE groups. I recommend doing this before level 55.<P>b.	Harvest of Druzzil - In your 30s, you get the Harvest spell, that lets you draw mana out of the air every 10 minutes, and leaves you stunned for a brief period. This AA skill, which you can unlock without having purchased any other AAs, works off its own hotkey button, draws in even more mana, and doesn't stun the wizard at all. This is quite simply a must-have if you're of the appropriate level.<P>c.	Archetype Abilities - Those who have them love Spell Casting Mastery 3, Spell Casting Fury 3 and Spell Casting Subtlety 3. All are excellent paths on the road to obtaining the title of Master.<P>d.	Class Abilities - While Strong Root is a big dud, Exodus, Improved Familiar and Nexus Gate are all quite popular. Exodus and Nexus Gate are instant casting, which will save your group (in the case of Exodus) or just you (in the case of Nexus Gate) many a time. Improved Familiar requires no mana to summon a familiar (a green drake) that has even more benefits than the already astoundingly good Greater Familiar.<P>e.	Manaburn - First off, take all the stories about how this was abused with a grain of salt. When it was "fixed," the servers weren't flooded with new bard, warrior and paladin epics, which says it all, really. But while this was once a useful tool (in addition to being ripe for abuse), it's now more or less useless. Average damage from a full tank of mana is about 7,000 points of damage, unresistable, for 1 point of agro. And that sounds pretty good until you realize that it's about the same as three and a half Sunstrikes or four Ice Spears. Granted, it's unresistable, but on the other hand, it's also all of your mana. You also get very bad return on spending 12 AA points to get to Mental Clarity 3, where you can see much more help for your mana pool spending those points on, say, Spell Casting Mastery 3 instead. This is a niche ability now, and one unlikely to be very popular.<P>f.	Call of Xuzl - Quite simply, this Planes of Power AA is a toy, but it's a GREAT toy. You can summon 2 (or 3 or 4) swords into existence for 45 seconds for no mana. You'll need line of sight (the ability will mysteriously fail otherwise with no message as to why), but otherwise, it's more or less free damage. Having said that, it's not MUCH damage, so don't buy this ability for that reason. On the other hand, it gets cheaper as you level up (the levels cost 3, 2 and 1 point respectively), so if you're inclined to play with toys, this is one that's hard to pass up.<P>There is it, that's this edition of my primer for young wizards. For more detailed advice, visit <A HREF="http://www.Graffe.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.Graffe.com/</A> and ask the wizards on the forum there for more detailed advice -- that's how I got my start, after all. Also feel free to contact me with questions in game, and I may well end up updating this document to cover areas that I missed. But experience is always the best teacher, so go out there and learn.

I keep getting "anti-spam" messages.  This seems odd to me because I have no problems replying to existing messages.<P>--------------------------------------<P>Inspired by Whizbang's post I produced the following...<P>Verant keeps telling us that we, the players, make the history of Norrath, so I figure this won't hurt one bit.<P>GNOMISH CULTURE FROM THE VIEW OF A NON-GNOME<P>The following is a study conducted with years of observation in the insanity-inducing, racket-filled city known as Ak'Anon.  I can only say I have a high degree of respect for any race that can block out that incessant ticking noise.<P>I've studied gnomes for a while now and I have some interesting observations.  First and foremost, gnomes are sado-masochists.  <P>Gnomes love to invent things and they also love to be around other people that invent things.  While this attitude is not exclusive to gnomes, it is clearly most abundant in gnomish culture.  It is demonstrated by the mere existence of the civil service organization known as "Inventors Blueprint Library Encompassing Widget Interdependence for Transitional Projects"  (a.k.a. "IBLEWITUP", or IBL for short).  This organization in gnomish culture makes up roughly 48% of the gnomish economy and just about every gnome aspires to obtain employment within its ranks.  It is by far the largest governmental organization (based on number of employees) within any society on the face of Norrath.  The inventors within its walls have produced the vast majority of tinkered items seen by outside cultures.  These same outside cultures responded by making usage of such tinkered inventions highly illegal for reasons of public safety.<P>The IBL has caused much of gnome culture to fall into a very odd standard behavior.  If a gnome's invention doesn't blow up, or make some wretchedly horrible noise, a gnome will fidget with it until it does so under the premise that, "it can't possibly be working right."  It seems to be something of a ritual that every new invention is heralded as soon as possible.  Gnomes from every workbench within earshot come running upon hearing the word "Eureka" (a gnomish word that roughly translates to "It's not broken anymore").  The assembled audience then waits for the odd contraption to produce an explosion and a cloud of smoke, or an ear-piercing shriek.  If they are rewarded, they respond with shouts, handclapping and backslapping the proud inventor.  If the invention produces noticeably breathable air, or a less-than pain-inducing volume of racket, the audience will skulk away highly disappointed and the inventor is left feeling quite ashamed.  <P>The worst possible outcome, of course, is to have absolutely nothing happen (i.e. no 'boom', no smoke, no noise, not even an acrid stench).  Fellow gnomes will look on in horror at the misfortune of their compatriot in much the same way that humans look upon a child who announces they wish to become a politician.  Such a travesty is often punishable by relocating the gnome to a noticeably smaller workbench in a very out-of-the-way location where no one will hear them yell, "Eureka" ever again.  The remaining subordinate gnomes are then all given promotions to backfill the new job vacancy.  Lucky for most gnomes, this type of event is rather common and, in all likelihood, the originally offending gnome will be back to his former status by the end of the week.<P>The Gnomish Language<BR>It was the IBL that became the source of gnomish words often used in other languages.  Words such as 'thingamajig,' which translates to, "It doesn't work" and 'thingamabob' ("It still doesn't work") have crossed over into human, dwarven, and barbarian languages.  Other words like 'doodad' ("It never has worked") and 'doohickey' ("It never will work") have managed to insinuate themselves into erudite and elven languages.  However, when asking various gnomes to independently translate the word, "whatchamacallit," non-gnomes are perplexed how they all arrive at, "I'm not sure what to call that noise-maker, so I'll just wave my hand at it and hope that people understand what I'm talking about."  This translation becomes even more confusing when compared to a phonetically similar word, "whatchamajigger," which gnomes indicate means, "Bob's mistake."<P>Onomatopoeia usage (words that when spoken, sound like the word they describe) is highly common within the gnomish language.  What other races perceive as equal connotation among such words, gnomes have evolved into quite distinct levels of 'weightiness.'  For example, "Kerplunk" and "kerpow" appear to represent the lesser-volume sounds that an invention can produce.  "Kerpluie" and "kerpowie" represent the mid-range, and "kaboom" represents the more impressive, maybe-you-should-seek-shelter type of volume.  Other races have been completely unable to fathom the proper ranking of the words; "zap", "zapzing", "zitang", "crackzow", "crackzowie", "pongdoodle", "plink", "plunk", "plinkplunk", and "oucheroonies".  With certainty, "Badabing-badaboom" is not gnomish.  Indeed, hearing it will often send gnomes into fits of laughter for some strange reason that they refuse to elaborate on.<P>Invention Naming Practices<BR>Most perplexing to persons outside gnomish culture are the excessively long names that inventors assign to their contraptions.  It is not uncommon to hear names such as, "Electromagnetic Encephalographic Predicament Instigator" or "Partially Charged, Fully Integrated Gravitic Down-finder."  The practice did at one point get completely out of hand when a truly proud gnome provided a name for his invention that took over 45 minutes to utter and thoroughly described every cog and sprocket that went into its making.  While introducing his contraption at the annual inventor's convention, it is said that the Chief Master Mechanic of Gizmo Integration and Repair himself fell asleep and snored so loudly he drowned out the inventor's voice.  Members of the IBL Invention Review Board responded with the creation of a committee whose sole purpose is to provide a set of guidelines to curb the naming practices to more reasonable levels.  They also assigned their top inventors to create an "anti-snoring" device.<P>All of the following suggestions were derived from the IBL "Committee On Nomenclature Practices For Prospective New Inventions Under Domestic Review."  Strangely, even gnomes do not like the acronym, "CONPFPNIUDR," so they instead refer to it as just "The Name-calling Committee."  The document that came out of the Committee contained the following statements:<P>·	Using the word 'Gnomish' in the name is considered very amateurish among top inventors.  After all, isn't it obvious which race invented it?  If you do see the word applied to an invention, rest assured it was not a gnome that did so.  The standard rule, as mentioned in the Policies and Procedures manual on page 13742, section "Kerpluie", subsection 12b1, is to apply blame to Burplefronz.<BR>·	Check with the IBL Invention Registry Board For Historical Analysis of Nomenclature Usage to be sure you dont select a name that has already been used.  We're still sending daily repair teams over to the "Anti-snoring device" production lines after that last foul-up.  Thanks a lot, Shluzzeldinken!<BR>·	Don't use kaboom to describe what everyone knows is just a kerplunk!  This applies to you too, Fluzzlezot!<BR>·	Frobblenitz is a zapdoodling crabbernacker.  Don't give him any credit for helping you with your invention.<BR>·	Oh yeah?  Well Ginklezhotz is a zonker-plinking frankenflotz!  Keep him away from your workbench!<BR>·	The name should not exceed 23.64 words in length.<P>No one is quite sure if the last suggestion applies to inventions, or to how committee members should refer to each other.<P>The Gnomish Military<BR>Because of the common malfunctioning that tinkered items are known to exhibit, it is often the mistake of aggressive forces to assume that gnomes are incapable of functioning as a cohesive military entity.  They are shocked to discover that nothing is farther from the truth.  The military minds behind the Gemchoppers are quite astute and highly organized.  Their attention to detail and discipline have been the reason they frequently turn aside forces with far superior numbers.<P>They are organized into "sprockets" of six gnomes each, one of which serves as "Chief Master Sprocket."  These Chief Master Sprockets report to the "High Gizmo Injector" who provides directions and tactical information.  The military hierarchy utilized by other races tends to be much deeper, sometimes 7 or 8 layers as in the case of humans and high elves, but gnomes prefer a much shorter path between the top and bottom ranks.  <P>Additionally, should it ever become necessary, all gnomes are aware that a militia can be called into action at the order of the King.  Civilians will then report to duty and become one of "The Regulators," providing support to the Gemchoppers.  While on active duty, the Regulators take on the same hierarchy as their professional counterparts with each member given equal status and consideration to the full-time military.  However, there is only one High Gizmo Injector and, by order of the King, this may only be filled by a full-time member of the Gemchoppers.<P>May the Force Module be with you...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
