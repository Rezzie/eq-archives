</FONT><HR>I like the "Light vs Dark" option with disabled cross-team bufing/healing.  VZ is already alot like GvE with many 3-team light guilds out there.  There would be no reason to continue allowing cross-team buffing and it would not in any way destroy the balance or feasability of doing high-level stuff with absence of certain classes.  Many guilds have proven a single team can do planes/gods(Xanit, MoD, Iggles, others I can't remember) without bards, druids(haha), rangers(hahahahaha), or monks.<P>-Smackz<BR>53 SK of XK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>GvsE or no change! Ok just please do me a favor and think, think about the new exploits! The stuff about not being able to heal/buff a person on another team will cause more exploits then the invulnerable healers. On Tallon Zek everyone but a few losers play it GvsE its the most fun to have the dark team fighting the light team. if you implied this rule it would basicly revise this server, not fair to those fo us who love GvsE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would have to check out PvP teams, if it was switched to GvE for sure!  Especially if it's true GvE, ie: based on deities and perhaps race for agnostics.  This would be too cool!  The only problem I could see is no Druid or Bard support for evil teams- but they also get Iksar i presuem, which have a nice relatively light free environment to grow in! (damn lizards keep breeding overthere- let's go wipe them out! stop the infestation!)<P>GvsE if you can work the details out would be amazing!  I think your PvE crossteaming fix would be fine...Good should not be Grouping with Evil!<P>One GvE setup issue:  where to good race rogues fit in?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The argument that this would somehow ruin single-team guilds is bogus.  You can still have an all-gnome guild (or an all shadowknight guild or an all wood elf bard guild), etc.<P>Not that anyone really does that anyway.  The only single team guilds that stick around past level 20 are dark race guilds.<P>At least on VZ, I only know of one (1) guild that will be negatively impacted.  That's about 40 people out of 4000, and most of them have posted here.  I'm sure Verant knows better than to count posts here as a majority vote though, so it's all good.<P>Even that guild won't be terribly impacted -- they will simply have to subdivide into light and dark races when they make groups.  A small price to pay for eliminating crossteam exploits, I'm sure we all agree.<P>Go #4.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I for one would like to see the 4th option done with the Evil Races and evil god worshiping on one team and the lights on the other. Then you can't heal anyone on the other team.  As Clerics then can be either way.

</FONT><HR>I play on Vallon.  I feel that GvE teams is the way to go, however please consider the roleplaying aspect of disallowing cross team buffing.  A human SK should be able to team with Darkies if he/she so chooses.  I vote for whatever is best for roleplaying, and right now that is changing the server to GvE.

</FONT><HR>Problem with the solution of not allowing the human to be healed or buffed by his group mates is one of duration. It is like corpse camping - if that goes on for a long time it is considered harrassment. This solution just opens the door for harrassment of a different nature. How long could the human be kept from being healed and a part of the group he has chosen to adventure with? Forever if the opposing team member chose to keep hitting him as the timer expired to allow him to be a full part of the group again. It allows someone who wants to disrupt someone else's game to do so. If this is going to be the solution is there going to be rules about when it changes from a fix on the invulnerable healer problem to harrassment?<P>You have stated that EQ will always be a PvE game with PvP added on, well for the PvE portion of the game, forming an alliance with members of an opposing team for a session is often the best way to deal with the PvE portion of the game. Allowing someone else to disrupt this opens the door to a lot of harrassment potential.How do you deal with that when it occurs? It might work if you added it to the things that the guides could get involved with or even issue warnings for when taken to extremes (though how do you define extreme since the group member who is stopped from being a full part of his group will probably feel it is extreme the first time it happens). Otherwise I think it opens the door to things worse than the invulnerable healer problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I apologize in advance if this has already been meantion, but I got sick of reading the flames. <BR>I have proposed solution for this issue.  To me it seems kinda simple if it is possible.  Leave the crossteaming in and reduce the ability of being able to heal/buff anyone on the other team, to a 4 lvl difference.  Yeah I can see where there would be some problems with this.  If anyone is actually intending on GROUPING with anyone this won't be a big deal.  Twinking and the "invulnerable" healer would be elliminated.  I can already feel the infernos firing up.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I agree PvP definately needs changing.  I'd like to point out the aspect of culture that has developed on the servers (at least Vallon).  At lower levels, PKing is a part of growing up.  For my youth, gnomes and some dwarves always came to Greater Faydark to PK the young ones.  It still happens now.  Very rarely, I find a PK issue with a darkie, except when I'm off my little home of Greater Faydark.  I think G vs E would greatly change the way people "grow up" in the safer islands of the world.  Anyone on Fadwere, or Odus would be safe as could be at low levels.  While some would say this might be good, I think I learned a lot about PvP and had a LOT more fun when I was younger.<P>As you get older in level, the cross teaming seems to start.  At least, the G v E.<P>I like last idea about the no-buffing the other teams, or making some invincable.  I know that I have ubber-buffed the elven newbies as they would be attacked by PKs.  I'm sure it made a few gnomes mad at me, but I think that's just part of being in the wrong territory =).  The servers really shouldn't be strictly G v E.  It would change the WHOLE culture of the servers, and make life MUCH different.<P>I read one post about the level differences, and there are some good points about making it 8 levels.  I think it needs to be 8 levels at the lower ones, and when you get to be a higher level it would change to a small percentage allowing higher level groups the ability of helping eachother.<P>The example of someone attacking a group member to simply make it impossible to interact with your group members in a dungeon or the like, would make GREAT problems.  For instance, in Mistmore there several people who x-team for XP.  Well, maybe Group A occuppies one area, and Group B wants it.  So, they start attacking eachother during battle so that someone dies because they couldn't healing from the cleric.  That would be XP loss issues.  Or someone is jeleous that they can't be in that group, so they do the same thing.  And there's nothing they can do about it, but sit and be pissed.  By allowing it, it would turn into yet ANOTHER person whining that the GMs couldn't help them in their situation.  (BTW I have been helped on 2 seperate ocassions by the CS staff with great response on both, and feel they do a good job.)<P>So to sum it up, *I think that the servers should switch as intended to encourage more PKing, since the server went coin-only, and no one cares to PK anymore.  G v E simply will change the way the whole PvP game operates, and IMHO I think it's a poor idea.<P>currently, the servers operate like blue servers *yawn.<P>G v E - huge change, but still *yawn<P>Proposed changes - WOOT! It's what I came to PvP for! Higher risk of death!<P>Disclamer:  I know, I can't spell so deal with it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I change my vote sort of... there should be three teams Good Evil and Neutral and it should be decided by what god you pick, all "good" god's should turn out good players and of course people who pick "evil" gods should be evil and neutral would be Agnostic and more neutral type gods.<P>Good should be able to attack neutral and evil. neutral can attack good and evil and neutral. Evil should be able to attack either everyone (they are evil after all heh) or just good and neutral.<P>This set up as far as I have thought about it would not allow any cross teaming and would have a very high "fun factor" in my humble opinion.<P>So good would be Tunare, Mithaniel and Erolessi Marr, Quellious, Rodcet Nife and The Tribunal<P>nuetral is Brell Serilis, Bristlebane Fizzlethorp Prexus, Rallos Zex and Agnostic also The Tribunal perhaps also Karana could go here also<P>Evil would be Cazic-Thule, Innoruuk, Solusek Ro and Veeshan<P>This is totally just a rough draft of what gods could go where, i dunno exactly what the class and race breakdown would be if it was split like this, and I am 99.9% sure what i have suggested as far as the god to team breakdown would need to be modified before prop to servers, but basically I just wanted to say Good vs Evil vs nuetral just seems to make more sense to me.<P>Plus if it's G vs E vs N the true kill em all pk's can be N where as the more rp/not wanting to be killed by everyone types can be Good or even Evil if the server was made such that evil can't attack evil.<P>This as far as I saw hasn't been mentioned yet, but if you are going to make a G vs E server, make a whole new server and allow people from any of the three pvp servers to make the switch, or convert one of the pvp servers and allow the players on that server to move to one of the other pvp servers.  And then let the people of the non G vs E servers an option to move to G vs E.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I play my primary character on Tallon Zek, so these issues are very close to me.  I apologize that I could not read all 4 pages, but based on Gordon't original post, here is what I think.<P>I play a warrior and feel at a total disadvantage when it comes to helping others on my team.  I see a young teammate being killed and can do nothing because my level is too high to attack the offenders.  Any healer, on the other hand, would be able to help.  I would suggest to implement a change so that the +/- 8 rule does not apply to a player who is attacking a pc.  So a level 50 would not be able to attack a level 15 unless that level 15 is attacking another player from the same team as the level 50 character.  The only reason the 8 level limit was put in place was to prevent a very high level character from going around laying waste to entire newbie zones.  But he still won't be able to do that as he could only attack someone who is already fighting another PC.<P>So you see, all the non-healers suffer from a serious disadvantage on teams servers and it has nothing to do with cross-teaming.  A high level healer can influence a fight between two low level pc's whereas any non-healer cannot.  This is very unbalancing and needs to be looked into.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"The final and best idea that we were able to come up with allows things to continue as they are now in regards to PvE, and only places restrictions on the basis of PvP. In this idea, any player who has taken damage from another player would not be able to be healed/buffed/receive any beneficial spells from anyone who wasn't on their own team or in the +/- 8 level range for a given amount of time (a few minutes), or until they zoned. "<P>Speaking as a player I think this would be a fine solution if the server was made GvE.<P>Vallon Zek has evolved more as a GvE server than anything else, if this idea were applied and the teams not changed to GvE, however, imagine the following scenario:<P>Team of 6 "good" players deep in any dungeon:<BR>Barbarian Warrior<BR>Dwarven Cleric<BR>Highelven Enchanter<BR>Gnome Wizard<BR>Halfling Rogue<BR>Barbarian Shaman<P>Band of "evil" team members come to area to kill them and take over the spawn.  Attack starts, timer goes off and one of the following happens:<P>Evil group kills the cleric and the Wizard and evacs out.  Rest of party dies to mobs unable to escape (this can happen already but more likely if the Dwarven cleric cannot heal the tank and the wizard during the ensuing PvP battle, the attackers aim for the evaccer first).<P>Even if the wizard is able to get off an evac spell, only the Human team members will go with him and the rest die.<P>Even without a PvP encounter being started there is still the possibility of a player casting an AoE spell or proccing an AoE weapon (silly I know) and dooming the party to its destrutcion.<P><BR>Merely replace the Barbarian tank with an Ogre (for the crossteaming version of this even if the server goes GvE) and the possibilities for exploiting this to cause exp loss and long corpse recovery are endless.  Mix and match teams/players as you see fit.<P><BR>Vallon Zek as a server has evolved as a GvE server.  GM events and GM action have reinforced this to a high degree.  The server population is probably close to evenly split "evil" versus "good".<P>The lack of written policies for PvP (what is warnable, what is bannable etc) has done more to damage the community on VZ than anything else.  Rules that we are told one day are changed the next to suit the whim of the guide/GM on the scene at the time.  I, myself, have a warning on my account from trying to enforce "loot and scoot" against a player.<P><BR>One other point that I would like to make while I have the floor.  Whomever is posting about "a certain guild exploiting game mechanics to gain an advantage" is making an argument that has merit but in practice rarely comes into play.  The guild in question has been of high level for 10 months (long before anyone else was even close) and has only taken the fight TO players.  To my knowledge the only time the "invulnerable healer scenario" comes into play is when they have been attacked inside dungeons where experience and hours of gameplay are at risk and the healer of the group happens to be on the evil team.  They knew the healer was evil and they couldn't hit him yet they proceeded to attack the crossteamers anyway.  Any complaint of exploitation is groundless and rooted more in hatred of "that certain guild" than any actual exploitation.<P>In closing, implementing either 1 or 2 without making the server GvE would basically destroy the community formed for the last year on Vallon Zek.  Even if GvE is implemented, the crossteaming guild would still exist.  The only difference is that now the possibility of the other teams exploiting game mechanics against them would open them up to severe risk of exp and corpse loss (Howling Stones, Sebillis, Planes... think of the consequences if something like this happened in Veeshan's Peak in a month or two).<P>Thank you for your time and attention in this matter and I am glad to see issues being addressed.  I believe this is not the correct path however.<P><BR>Faandar<BR>Son of Erud, killer of all things short, fat, blue, or pointy eared.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The idea of making it good vs evil sounds great.  As it is now, it's very difficult to go with it because on TZ there are guilds that have only one purpose: to pk specific races, and both of them are "good races".  I think we all know which guilds I am referring to.  But if the server is officially made into 2 teams, that would stop.  Most players want it to be GvE anyway, it's just not always possible the way it is now.<P>Also, someone suggested the following and I really like the idea.  Make it so that a pc cannot be attacked by anyone until a certain level.  Make it level 4 or 5.  This way, no one can just go around and kill naked newbies over and over.  I see this done a lot.  A level 5 attacking a level 1 or 2 and no one can help because they're too high.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Idea #4 is the best there Gordon.  Honestly, Invulnerable healing has not too big of an issue, until recently on Tallon Zek, when a few people started making guild consistent of all shorts, for instance, that go around killing other light races.  That in itself was not a problem, but what was, is that the server has been around for a year, and it evolved into a Good vs. Evil server, because the majority of the players play that way.  <P>I know the majority is not always right, but Tallon Zek has been a fun server for quite some time, and a big part of that was because the server was played Good vs. Evil (races).  My vote is to go for #4, as it would acknowledge G v E, at least on Tallon Zek to start with, as it would encourage people to go back to having fun, rather than have a few rogue guilds, that buck the system on messageboards, and in game, just trying to keep everyone else from having fun.<P>Good vs. Evil, in most fantasy type books, is what most fights are about.  It easier on the majority of us, than having a Dwarf paladin, going around and slaughtering Elven Druids and Paladins.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is obviously written by someone that does not play on team PvP.<P>The balance of power on TZ would turn so quickly to that of the evil team, which it practically is anyway.<P>The problem is not cross-teaming, the problem is the teams were not set up correctly in the first place.  It should have been good vs evil, not race based.  Fortunately, the people that play on the server were smart enough to figure that out even though Verant was not.<P>Basically no one runs around healing lights if they are a dark, or vice-versa. That is because there are probably about as many evil as there are good characters.  Maybe having a neutral 3rd team would have worked, but this 4-way race based stuff was just plain stupid.<P>This is a silly change that will just make it much less fun to play the game.<P>Plus it makes no sense from an RP perspective.  Why would human NPC druids look amiably upon a wood elf druid if elves and humans did not get along?  Why would a gnome necromancer be liked by a dwarf cleric if their gods hated each other? Why would a high-elf paladin not heal a dying erudite paladin just because he was erudite? It makes no sense.<P>Stupid Verant, just trying to take a bad decision and in spite of the players adjusting to correct their lack of foresight, make it an even stupider one.<P>It is so obvious this is a suggestion from someone that does not play day-to-day on TZ.<P>Leaff Beltain<BR>Level 38 Wood elf Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE LISTEN ABASHI!!!<BR>On TALLON ZEK PvP Teams server, Good Vs. Evil is very common for levels 25 and up.  Unfortunately there is a small but VERY vocal minority that believes that it should be team only.  DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.  I will guarantee you that over 90% of the server population wants it to be light vs dark.  If you are to make ANY change please do this! You cannot do the 8+/- because if you do then you can't group with ANYONE thats not in  your 8 level range for Planes Raids etc.  This would be very , very bad.  What would happen if you were in a group with a 60 druid 56 mage 47 ranger 50 bard and 52 druid on a Lguk raid to get items?  Well, you would probably say that would never happen.  My guild did that LAST WEEK.  Know what would happen with that new rule? the 50 bard and 47 ranger couldnt group with the 60 druid and the 47 ranger couldnt even group with the 56 mage.  That would totally ruin guild runs of any kind which are VERY essential on pvp teams servers to get items in dungeons of the opposite team.  I myself would reccomend not changing it at all.  Invul healers really isn't that huge a problem on Tallon Zek and any of the changes you mention would lead to MAJOR PROBLEMS.  Please either leave it as is or just think of other ways to do it and suggest it to us.  Yet again.  I beg you to NOT listen to people that want race only non buffing healing.  I can think of only 3 guilds on Tallon Zek that is like that for light races: Tiny Terror (all low level besides 2 members) Human Retribution (all low) and Elven Intervention (again all low level).  Please don't get me wrong being low doesn't make them less important but most of the members in them are just DARK TEAM TWINKS that got bored and want to make poor newbies lose faction.  Go read TZtimes sometimes, one of the signatures of a member is "making lighties lose faction one death at a time".  To reiterate please leave it as is or think of other solutions.  Thank you.<P>                      -Aaredor Mistwalker<BR>                       52 Wanderer of Peacekeepers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>By all means the best thing that could happen to the pvp team servers is to eliminate x-team guilding/grouping/buffing and healing. When players signed up for the pvp teams servers that is what they were buying into - pvp teams. In the current climate high level pve x-team guilds dominate the server and completely demolish the entire feel a race-war server should have.<P>I am 100% all for the removal of all x-team guilding/grouping/benificial spellcasting. I think this would improve the nature of these servers 10 fold. I think this would revive the original concept for the servers and force a fresh restructuring among the guilds. I do not care if this is a GvE or 4-team change. Either way I 100% support it.<P>I would kiss the ground of Norrath the day that x-teaming was put to bed for good. It is the choice of powerlevelers with little vested interest in the server or the players on it. It is the choice for PvE players that come the the PvP servers for lower population. It must go and anything that facilitates that has my complete support.<P>The SANDMAN<BR>Barbarian Rogue of VZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Since I play on VZ here's my perspective:<P>1)Don't change it so that hi-level chars can't buff low level chars.  It's really great when an enchanter is standing in the newbie zone and casting clarity on the youngsters, or a druid or shaman is giving away shield and strength buffs. I think that the game would really lose a lot of community spirit if the elders were restricted to only buffing and healing within the 8 level range and if you disallow cross-team buffing/healing it will really hurt the multi-team guilds especially while fighting mobs.<P><BR>2)Don't change it to GvE. I'm thinking especially of the elves and gnomes here.  It's hard for me to describe but again I think the game would lose to much fun if the gnomes and elves weren't able to raid each other.  They're too far away from the teams that make up the Evil side. I wouldn't want to have to make a boat trip every time I wanted to do some PvP.<P>I don't have a problem with 4 team guilds, but I can see how it would really become frustrating to almost win a fight and someone from your team whom you can't hit heals your opponent. If there's anyway to fix that, then try to do so, otherwise let the players within the game deal with traitors.  I believe there's already a trend toward this now.<P>(If it hasn't already started, this is where i may get flamed) I want everybody to be happy with the game, but obviously that's not gonna happen.  I honestly think VZ is a pretty damn good server as it is now, so despite the shrill squeals of of some of the people that post here and on other boards, maybe it's best to leave things as they are.  Let the players sort out how to deal with traitors, and let Verant work on pathing, bugs, tuning, new zones, new Quests, tradeskills and all the other things that would improve the game.<P>Gordon, I know your time is limited between our server and all the other stuff Verant is trying to accomplish - why, I just bet you have a personal life squeezed in there somewhere! But if once in awhile if you get the time, go to http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5034<BR>and scan a day or three's worth of posts. I think this board has more of the upper level players posting on it than any of the others around. I haven't read all the posts that concern this issue (cross-teaming) but it seems that its as much a philosophical role-playing issue as anything else.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think the Light vs. Dark option would be great.  As a long time member of the VZ community, I have seen first-hand how destructive 4-teaming is to the server (Hell, you changed it to coin only loot because of it.  People were doing /movelogs to get away from a notorious 4-Team guild, NOT because they wanted a change in the loot policy.)  I would take ANY of those possible solutions, just to put an end to 4-Teaming.  The TZ and VZ communities have both proven that having EVERY class available to them is not necessary.  Dark Team only groups have successfully killed the 2 dragons, done planes raids, etc. etc.  So I dont see how your limiting the PvE aspect of the game by putting one of your options into effect.<P>Just make it LightVSDark (prefered), or remove the ability to help another team altogether.....at this point Ill take anything.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Any of the options listed are an improvement.  The conditions of Vallon Zek server are race war teams not good vs. evil at present, so options making crossteaming less viable are desired and consistent with the racewar conditions. Make a good vs evil server somewhere else, we've already made 4 team our home so don't change it like was done when it was made coin only.  Since there is an 8 level limit for pvp on race war, then the crossteaming (which undermines the roleplay of the server and the spirit of 4 team pvp) would be hampered by using options 1 and 2.  <P>I've immortal healed same team folks I encounter as I refuse to watch same team folks die.  Personally, I have no problems with same team folks with immortal healers.  Sure, it can be rough on the losing side to be dominated, so, that means your team needs to get stronger to counter this.  Same team support under any conditions should be AOK in racewar period.  <P>Divolg Thex<BR>Xanit K'Ven<BR>Level 51 Vicar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon:<P>    It occurs to me you already have most of the code in place to provide an elegant solution to this problem: the factions code.<BR>    Each team has a related faction.  Killing a member of another team raises my faction with my team.  Killing a member of my team lowers my faction with my team.  Healing/buffing somebody who kills a member of my team lowers my faction with my team.<BR>    Now if six people from Team A find five from Team B and one Team A healer, they can kill them secure in the knowledge that their team faction is okay because they gain a net 4 faction increases (5 increases and one decrease).  However that healer can watch his team faction circle the drain when he gets six negative faction hits should his team be victorious.<BR>    Associate a proper penalty with not maintaining team faction (such as being KoS in your own team territory) and you've created a negative feedback mechanism for cross-teaming, at least when doing PvP killing.<P>    Now, when suggestions of this sort float over the transom normally you (Verant) pleads it "can't be done."  Probably more accurately, it costs more man hours than you want to spend.  However if you plan to use the faction system any more in EQ2 than you do now, what better time to start expanding it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>#4, code it to GvE based on race/religion, factor in class for agnostics if necessary.  As annoying as it is, it's well within people's rights to immortal heal/buff and even xteam heal/buff.  A GvE setup levels the playing field and makes xteaming pretty much unnecessary.<P>Support for #4 is overwhelming on both VZ and TZ.  Hope to see it implemented soon.

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Thanks for starting to pay attention to PvP  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Regrding possible changes:<BR>I like #2 and #4, though I think #2 should be modified to apply only in PvP, and only when the opponents are out of range of the healer.<P>#1 is a very bad idea, and your alternative suggestion, as it stands, would also be a big problem on Tallon Zek.<P>TZ is pretty much Good vs Evil, and light-dark xteaming is ruthlessly supressed. Same-team healing has not been an issue until the recent appearance of 3 very small single race PK guilds.<P>It is totally impractical to have 4-team PvP on TZ: the dark team is as large as the other 3 teams together, and for a long time was larger; and geography and quest setup mandates lights to cooperate.<P>The fix you are suggesting is far worse than the problem - it would seriously unbalance the server, cripple the light team and virutlaly every light guild on TZ, and infuriate the majority of light players - in order to please an extremely samll minority of players who want to PK other lights.<P>I agree that same-team invbulnerable healers SHOULD be prevented by code - but ONLY if it can be done without in any way compromising the ability of the lights to heal and buff other lights, irrespective of team. <P>The only case I would support would be one which prevents healing only of damage caused by a member of the same team - ie if a group of humans and elves are fighting a group of DEs, and a gnome runs up and attacks the humans, the elves should still be able to heal humans of damage caused by the DEs.<P>Aster<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm all for a GvE server (though not for both of the current teams servers, and giving people the option to shuffle from one to the other). <P>I play my primary character (a high elf wizard) as a "good guy."  If he sees someone being attacked, unprovoked, he'll jump to that victim's aid -- whether the victim is an elf, a human, a gnome, or whatever (though it's currently limited to maybe throwing a damage shield on the victim, or casting Invisibilty -- unlike a healer, there's not much a damage-dealer like a wizard or warrior can do in situations like this).  I know it annoys the "race war" people to no end, but we're the good guys, right?  I know I'm far from the only person that does this.  Off the top of my head, I can think of a couple fellow elves who've been killed ganging up on a hapless dwarf or gnome at Crushbone, because so many people were turned off by their "kill all non-elf" outlook that the shorty would get buffed and healed until his attackers had to either run or die.  While this sort of play doesn't really mesh with a "racewar" server, it would make complete sense on a GvE server -- if there was one. <P>I'd be able to roleplay a lot more freely, and realistically, on a GvE server, and would welcome the chance to move to one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Here goes again... I hope Gordon is still reading this.<P>Create a new 'PvP-Teams' server but label it 'PvP-GvE' instead. Allow people to execute /movelogs to the new server (Hell even let Rallos people join in the movelog to that place). If you dont have the will to put up a new server for PvP then try turning Vallon into PvP-GvE and leave Tallon alone allowing both the one time chance to /movelog to the other server.<P>This would make one server PvP-Teams and the other PvP-GvE. If you decide to do this then please do one thing to say...<P>***HONOR THESE MOVELOGS EVEN IF ONE WILL END UP WITH ONLY 200 PEOPLE AND THE OTHER WITH 1000 PEOPLE. VZ/TZ PEOPLE WERE SCREWED OVER WITH THE LAST MOVELOG AND DONT WANT A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED***<P>Consider it the penalty for wanting one thing over another. Personally I want PvP-Teams that has its own unofficial version of GvE than one where I am now FORCED to trust all lower level Gnomes.<P>Please if at all possible dont do 1, 2, or 3 and leave 4 to the unofficial status it has been at all this time. The way the server is set up now is so that newbies/lowbies get to practice their PvP skills as they grow up against light vs light threats(Gnomes-Elfs in particular)... This experience is what makes them decide if they want to stay in PvP while they are still low or if they want to drop it for a blue server.<P>All that is needed is an official rule regarding immortal healers, if there is something the guides can enforce then it will stop. I even have the wording done for you if you want it...<P>The blatant use of immortal healers in offensive PvP maneuvers is illegal. Those considered 'Immortal Healers' are people of signifigant level difference from the one they are healing (IE. level 50 with a level 20, However a level 30 with a level 20 would not be breaking this). 'Immortal Healers' are not only limited to heals but could take the shape of Enchanter Rune line, Dmg shields, Mana giving spells, ect...<P>There, now the guides have a way to give people who participate in the immortal healer thing some crap. This is enough to stop 99.9% of everything. Restructuring the world to a 2-teams GvE or making it so you cant buff/heal people out of your range would seriously affect the PvE aspect of the game (especially after 20+ where group ranges of 10-12 levels arent uncommon).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004396&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004396&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
