&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>I posted this in another thread but it seems to warrant its own.<P>The biggest difficulty in regards to PvP in EverQuest is that EverQuest is, and will remain, a primarily PvE (Player versus Environment) game.  The addition of PvP to the game should not change the basic fundemental mechanics of EverQuest.  PvP in EverQuest has to result in "EverQuest with PvP" rather than "PvP EverQuest", if you get my point. <P>One of the largest issues on the PvP Teams servers is the subject of cross-teaming.  Players of different teams get together for battles.  Due to the PvE focus of the game, this has to be allowed for sake of game balance.  Though some have suggested that cross-teaming, either in groups or guilds, not be allowed, it's something that will need to remain for the PvE game.<P>The problem comes in when cross-teaming is applied to PvP.  Cross-teaming creates a situation that is often referred to as the "invulnarable healer" scenario.  Basically, one group of PCs (Team A) attack a group of people on Team B, while supported by a healer from Team B.  In this fashion, you have a situation where a member of one team is taking an active role in the deaths of members of their own team.<P>There is another "invulnarable healer" scenario that is more common and often just as bad as the cross-teaming scenario.  This one revolves around a group of players from Team A attacking a group from Team B, while supported by a healer/buffer who is far superior in level to anyone from Team A or Team B.  For example, a group of level ~20 trolls go on a killing spree in Greater Faydark, while supported by a level 50 healer/buffer.  The problem in this case is that someone out-of-range is directly contributing to the deaths of players below their range.<P>On Friday, I spoke with one of the programmers about possible solutions for the PvP Teams servers, assuming that people in general believe these issues to be a problem.  Suffice it to say that there is no easy solution.  Each one has its disadvantages and "loopholes".  For an example of some of the solutions:<P>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<BR>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<BR>3. Combination of 1 & 2.<BR>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1 on that basis, rather than on cross-teaming.<P>The problem with all of these solutions is that they have an undeniable impact upon the PvE aspect of the game.  <P>The final and best idea that we were able to come up with allows things to continue as they are now in regards to PvE, and only places restrictions on the basis of PvP.  In this idea, any player who has taken damage from another player would not be able to be healed/buffed/receive any beneficial spells from anyone who wasn't on their own team or in the +/- 8 level range for a given amount of time (a few minutes), or until they zoned.  <P>In the cross-teaming "invulnarable healer" scenario, the person from Team B would be able to support people from Team A for PvE engagements, however once a member of Team A took damage from another team, they would not be able to receive support from anyone on Team B for a few minutes.  In a real game scenario, the maurading band of trolls in Greater Faydark couldn't be healed/buffed by a high-elf assuming that they were taking damage in their attacks.  <P>In the out-of-level scenario, that same band of level ~20 trolls wouldn't be able to receive support from a 50th level cleric.  <P>There are some disadvantages to this, such as in the following:<P>4 Trolls are grouped with a high-elf fighting PvE encoutners in a dungeon.  Humans come in and "slap" the trolls every so often thus keeping the high-elf from assisting them.  Perhaps this should just be a disadvantage for cross-teaming in general.  Perhaps this is just a risk that people take from grouping with the enemy.<P>What are your thoughts on these ideas? What other issues do you see causing problems in regard to this idea?  Do the benefits (e.g. reaffirming the servers as PvP Teams) outweigh the potential disadvantages?  <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, sorry. I was just curious about faction penalties as another possible discouragement to a cross team healer assisting.<P>One other example of a problem that may come up in PvE encounters that I can imagine is similar to your troll example. What if a group (or groups) of one team are fighting some dificult mob, and they have more then a 8 level split between the lowest and the highest. I can see a situation here where some other team player (or eaven a whole group) can lurk about invis and observe this battle. Then in the critical moments when the higher level clerics may be just about to do their thing to keep the group alive, the other team can slap a couple of low level area effects on the team fighting the mob. this prevents the cleric from helping whoever may be out of the 8 level range, and basically the whole attack could collapse. People die and/or flee, and the other team can step in and vulch the kill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about making the lvl difference for getting buffed like the lvl difference that is tolerable in order to get xp while grouped with the same person?<BR>Because suggestion number 2 would mean that a lvl 40 char couldnt get heals from his lvl 49 groupmate - at high lvls grouping with a significant lvl difference is quite common, sometimes there is just no lvl 49 enchanter around, so you take the lvl 40 enchanter available, lvl 40 clarity is still better than no clarity at all hehe.<BR>The same goes for cross team buffing/healing and making a G vs E world would be a very drastic change, so i agree that the first 4 ideas are hardly workable.<BR>Your last idea sounds very nice though - why not add a little risk for grouping with the enemy? that sounds pretty neat.<BR>Or, like i said, make the difference not +/-8 lvls but the same difference as it is required in order to recieve xp while grouping with that person. (i think its somewhere close to  currentLVL +/- LVL/2,  so at lvl 10 you can only receive buffs from lvls 5 to 15, and at lvl 40 from lvls 20 to 60).<BR>Hmm, maybe thats not enough of a restriction though. it would still allow a lvl 45cleric to heal his lvl 30 PK friend who is engaged in PvP activity.<BR>I guess i like the idea of making it impossible to recieve crossteam buffs/heals after pvp damage best. Hmm, you might want to exclude group damage though. PPl shouldnt be punished like that if their troll warrior buddie in the group accidentally hits them once.<P><BR>P.S.: It is nice to see you looking into the PVP issue, maybe you could also give Rallos another thought? I have the very strong feeling that the vast majority of players there (I dont mean the 100 newbie quake-style pks fighting at the front gates of every city, i mean the more seasoned high lvl RZ veterans) are not happy at all about the current itemloot. Especially lvls 40+ PvP becomes so unbalanced that maintaining itemloot there doesnt seem like a good idea - please make a poll or something, as you could already see in the Vallon-Tallon episode, the vast majority of players favour coinloot.<P>I think an fbss or other Kunark uberloot is worth more than one quick nuke.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The server has evolved that way anyway.<P>BUT!<P>If that happens, I want to see people with "evil" classes or worshipping evil gods be on the Evil team regardless of race. Human SKs worshipping Bertox should be on the evil team, not the good team.  Erudite heretics should be on the evil team. Gnome heretics should be on the evil team. That sort of evens out the "9 races against 4" problem.<P>I think it would SO rock. You'd have gnomes fighting over Ak'Anon, Odus would REALLY be the warzone it's supposed to be between the Erudite factions, same with Qeynos and Freeport... it would SO rock.

</FONT><HR>The race war servers have developed into Light vs Dark.  Whether we like it or not this is the way it is.  I like the option to change to to L v D and end cross team healing and buffing. The Human, Elf and Peck teams will still have full support for PvE and the blatant exploitations that come along with cross teaming healers and buffer will stop.<P>No matter what solution is reached there will be those who are unhappy.  If the objective to offend the smallest number while still addressing the problem (and I pray that is the objective) then L v D w/out crossteam buff is the only way to go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>#4 would own.<P>We've hashed that idea over many times on the VZ/TZ message boards.  Virtually everyone likes it.  Make the teams officially "good vs evil" (or more approriately named "light races vs dark races") and then implement no cross-team debuffing.  For at least 80% of the server population, this change would not negatively affect them in any way.<P>Doing the "level difference" change would be okay as well.  Would be interesting to try anyway... it would certainly eliminate twinking, and hardly anyone groups PvE with people 9 levels over them.  Pretty much the only reasons to cast spells on people out of your range is to twink them or be an "immortal healer" in battle.<P>(This wouldn't ELIMINATE immortal healing -- a level 20 fighting a level 28 could be healed by an "immortal" level 18.  But it would significantly reduce the occurances, since 99% of the time, the problem is from a level 20 fighting a level 20 who's being healed by a level 50.)<P>The whole idea of Team PvP, IMO, was to promote more roleplaying.  No random PK'ing as in Rallos Zek, and no "carebear" world as in the non-PvP servers.  However, as time has gone by, we've degraded into about 10% roleplayers, 20% crossteam exploiters and 70% people who are now afraid to PvP because they've gotten burned too many times by crossteam exploiters.<P>That makes about 80% of the population that would be very happy to see this change go through.  I also think it would promote a lot more new users on the team PvP servers.  You put up a poll and ask people why they don't like PvP on VZ/TZ and they'll probably say "random attacks" (ie, infighting within the light races) or "crossteaming" (ie, 3 trolls fighting a high elf that's being healed by a dark elf).<P><BR>Or in the immortal words of Nike,<P>Just Do It.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> I like the idea of implementing officialy the good vs evil. However, the possibility to group, buff and heal with all needed classes and players should stay available for dragons events and other things. <P> Playing on a PvP server must not become harder than any other in PvE. So final word would be :<P> Good VS Evil and then your solution for immortal healing. I think with this 2 things we are fine, i doubt someone would just come "slap" another player at a dragon raid or something like that. PvE must not be hurt by any change, the blue aspect(crossteaming)of PvP servers must remain for PvE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is a really really bad idea. I admit that the Invulherable Healer Syndrome is a problem but its not very common (I have only ran into it once where a level 25-30 DE was supported by a level 50 Druid).<P>Also things where this will seriously affect the PvE game. Cleric Elf/Short Warrior/Short Warrior... Very low level DE comes along (8 levels below them all) and thwaps the shorties while they're fighting, cleric blows all his mana before he even knows that the shorties cant be healed, sits and meds then the DE beats the hell outta him. By the time the fight is over both shorties are low on health and the nearly full strength DE makes mincemeat of them. This is a situation where if this wasnt in place the above mentioned group would smash this guy into next tuesday.<P>Also it would only be the good teams that would be affected by this because as you well know TZ is more of a Light vs Dark server... If you do this darkies would take advantage of this loophole and cause more death while all their clerics/healers with them wouldnt be similarly disadvantaged.<P>As for #4 I'd rather it be kept the way it is even with all its flaws. It allows much more RP than a 9vs4 teams server would allow. As it is it allows as much as its lothed by lower levels Gnomes to attack Elfs... There was one time we had PvP for a spawn spot which we would never have had without the 4 team setup.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It makes questing better as<BR>faction hits from 'lights' is no longer a problem<BR>after you defend yourself in PvP; as you could no longer kill other lighties, and have no need to defend yourself from them.<P>the out of lvl immortal healer is also roleplay based.  if a group is trying VOX and realize they <BR>can't take him, they still try and take out as many minions as they can; after that they run.  Same thing with PvP, the immortal healer does not take away the run option for the folks who are out gunned.<P>and from any old standard of roleplay, a 'good' human killing a gnome or high elf or dwarf or half elf is kinda silly.  Most old standards of roleplay are GvE based.<P>Next, it helps game balance.  It would cure the Elf continual complaint of not having a safe homeland from the gnomes and dwarves.  Might see more elf characters instead of people getting discouraged and going to an over populated blue server. <P>Lastly, it has the least impact on the economy as it is established.  Players pay for sow, bind, clarity, and at times regen, spirit sight and infravision.  And i am sure more than i have mentioned.  It would be hard to code that i could cast bind on someone lower that 8 lvls, but not sow, and surely not regen.  So from a balanced standpoint this is the easiest for code.<P>Oh, and change the con method to just three player choices.  green for to low, white for within 8 lvls and red if unable to hit.  Add the uncertainty that you are not just PK'ing a 'green'.<P>Truely, the people that will go against this are just rampant PK'ers.  They are not questers.  They are not soloists.  They are not role players. They are not concerned more with the player vs environment as much as they are wanting to find an easy green with a few gold and perhaps a plat to fatten their bank account with and buy the items they want instead of 'everquesting" for them.<P>As to cross grouping, do not let them group if it is easy to implement in the code.  No reason a human should get exp if grouped with a troll.  <P>As to beneficial spells...i guess you have to turn those off also for the immortal healer problem.  I have healed 'darks' while questing to help get the item i needed, but only against the environment not against other players.  But i can trade in either plat (i would be kinda dumb to carry it to Najena) or in Greater Lightstones (as i have already done in the past.)  so that is not a problem that cannot be worked for the quester.<P>And in closing (yes sorry this was so long, hope it appears thought out) the single thing Verant needs to remember is that the name of the game is Everquest.  Simplify the rest of the game, just make it light v dark, and focus on what you do well.  PvP attracts a certain amount of people and therefor revenue, but the current system is overly complicated and manipulated by a very VERY few folks who are not in the game to play it as it was designed, but to kill a few greens and make a few plat.<P>Thanks for the time, sorry for the length<P>Chief, <BR>Bonestomper lvl 26 shaman barbarian Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>PvP should be fixed with as simple of a solution as possible:<P>1) Make it where you can only cast buffs and heals on your own team, and within the level +/-8 level range, too.<P>2) DECREASE the number of teams from 4 to 2 (if you notice, most people play lightie vs darkie on the PvP servers anyways). This move to 2 teams will increased the "pool" of characters who can heal and buff you, thus minimizing any negative effects of my first suggestion.<P>3) ELIMINATE the options for guilds to house more than one team. This way, you actually create roleplay on PvP servers. I have no idea why a 4 team server allows a guild to house all 4 teams in it. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of roleplay?<P>4) Allow all players who don't like these changes to move to Rallos Zek where there are no teams.<P><BR>That's it.

</FONT><HR>Although my primary character is on The Tribunal, my guild decided to form an offshoot chapter on Vallon Zek, so I have a DE Shadow Knight on VZ now. <P>The general environment of Vallon seems to allow more of a Roleplay for me, and I've taken advantage of that. I enjoy it immensely, and have only played my primary twice since starting my SK a week ago.<P>I'm totally in favor of option #4.<P>What I would like to see on Vallon is more of a "Good vs. Evil" setup. From a roleplaying aspect it seems to make more sense. As a DE, I may not particularly like Humans or Erudites, but their Evil bretheren could be useful in my quest to spread hatred across Norrath, and to do the will of my Father.<P>I would define the "Good" and "Evil" teams based on deity. I'm not sure what to do about Agnostics.<P>A Human SK or Necro, or even a Cleric that worships Bertoxx or Innoruuk has no business being considered "Light". They're Evil. And they should be considered Evil, because in the PvE setup, they are. Same goes for a Gnomish Necromancer or an Erudite heretic.<P>I think there would be more genuine roleplaying with this kind of setup. It would be awesome, and would most closely mirror the ingame factions of the NPC's.<P>I'm so in favor of this. It would be amazing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about creating pc faction !<BR>When you heal a player of Another team, you lose faction with your own team... when you lose enough faction you can get killed by other pcs of the same team, which you could fight back if they attacked you...  You can only fight back if they initiated combat.<P>You're a player from team A. You buff/Heal a player from team B, you then lose faction with team A (this faction is not npc faction, pc faction only).  Then, team A can kill you if they want to, you could defend yourself too, but only if they started combat against you.<P>To see if you can kill a pc of your team, you could con them and there would be a message saying "traitor" for example.. you could attack him then.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Leave the code how it is. Make it in the PnP that the Immortal Healer is considered an exploit but only if the persons arent grouped for hunting purposes when attacked (IE. You go attack treant camp and people there are 20-35, all of them could heal their friends and such since your expected to have a 20-35 group to initiate PvP there).<P>Remember the Immortal Healer is only immortal as long as A) You dont call in reinforcements or B) They dont call in reinforcements. For those of you lamers who pray on low-health people and gank them for money this is a problem. If your playing PvP in a group then this is not as much of a problem unless someone MAJOR MAJORLY out of your level comes and heals them (IE. level 50 healing the level 20 type scenario). Basically I dont mind the Immortal Healer thing as long as its not a blatantly obvious they're using their immortality to kill your group (IE if our group is a bunch of 20-22's and we attack some 20-30's and a 32 sits arround healing them thats not what I get pissed off at its when we see the level 40-50 person healing them thats when I get pissed off).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004396&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004396&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
