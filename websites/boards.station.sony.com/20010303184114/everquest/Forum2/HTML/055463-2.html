</FONT><HR>FOLLOWUP ON MY SKILL SUGGESTION FOR RANGER DEFENSE<P>I suggested several posts earlier that we train an ability named deftness or avoidance at lvl 39-45.  I figure that one way you can make this work is that have it roll first on any attack by a mob - if the roll is successful, place a multiplyer on the following skills Dodge then parry then riposte.  <P>By doing this, you would be able to slowly lift the deftness skill to a reasonable level - rather than having to nerf it down.  <P>here is a possible scenario<P>Attack by mob<P>1. AC roll check (unsuccessfull)<BR>2. Deftness check (unsuccessfull)<BR>3. Dodge check (unsuccessful)<BR>4. Parry Check (unsuccessful)<BR>5. Riposte check (unsuccessful)<BR>Mob hits you for 110 damage<P>Attack by mob<P>1. AC roll check (unsuccessfull)<BR>2. Deftness check (successfull) (all defense skills checked at 252 skill this attack)<BR>3. Dodge check (successful)<BR>Mob MISSES<P><BR>Using something like this woould avoid too much riposting (if that is VI's concern since both Dodge and PArry would be checkd first at 252 skill)<P>Advantages:<P>1. A relatively low skill in deftness might make all the difference in the world, ie lvl + 2(or 3)times lvl.  Also the current defense caps could be maintained.  Testing would quickly see what skill of Deftness/avoidance  would be balancing.<P>2.  Would not change the low lvl balance that I feel exists<P>3.  Riposting damage would only occur less than 1/6 of the time since parry and dodge would be the more likely outcome of a successfull deft/avoid roll<P>4. Finally for the roll to occur, ranger would have to be below a weight cap for the skill such as 130 stones ( lower or higher maybe appropriate, since I don't have the hi end armor I can't speak to a "good " weight at which to specify).<P><BR>Dyarrig Lawne<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have heard many people say that in the normal spell progression, Rangers should pick up SOW earlier in life.  This is based upon the differences in levels that Druids and Rangers get their spells.  <P>Getting SOW earlier in life, or even a Ranger unique inferior version of SOW, would help to balance Rangers against the other hybrids, Shadow Knights and Paladins.<P>Paladins and Shadow Knights both get, in addition to their Spells, abilities that are unique to their class.  Paladins get Lay on Hands, and, conversely, Shadow Knights get Harm Touch.  Rangers of course get Tracking, but we must share that ability with Druids and Bards at higher levels.  Rangers can also Dual Wield, which goes toward balance.<P>I think Rangers getting SOW as early as 22 or 30 could help even this out.  We are supposed to be "masters of the outdoors" and this would help to cement that image.  Even an inferior ability could help this.<P>Also, the damage that a Ranger does with a Bow and Arrow needs not only to be modified for higher level characters, but also for lower level ones.  Rangers are supposed to be Masters of the Bow and Arrow, and, apart from quested bows and bows that are Ranger only, many of which aren’t available until very high levels, Rangers really do only as much damage as anyone else with a bow.  The Trueshot discipline was meant to address this, I believe, but it is not available to younger Rangers, for obvious reasons.<P>I think that many of the people that post on these discussions will have gripes about higher level Rangers, and I am sure that many of those gripes have real merit.  My contention is that there also perhaps need to be changes made at lower levels.  Certainly the changes on test, if implemented, will help this, but, of course, I want to be able to SOW.<P>I do not have the “fuzzy math” (can’t believe I got that phrase from George Dubya), and am also a fairly young Ranger, but I just wanted to express my feelings along with everyone else.<P>If as early as level 23 Rangers are excluded from groups looking for tanks simply for reason of being Rangers, as has happened to me, I believe some changes need to be made.<P>Thanks.<P>Manyen Fancypantz<BR>Ranger of 24 Seasons<BR>Master Fletcher (202)<BR>Druzzil Ro  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a druid not a ranger but many friends are rangers and I have to heal quite a few rangers during combat.<BR>The vision is not quite right for rangers, they are more a special forces fighter not just pure offense. The SK is pure offense. The Pally is pure defense.<BR>A lot of this would be moot if agility meant anything in real game perfomance as it is now it takes an unholy amount of agility to make a difference.<BR>The suggestion of a tumble skill above is right on, similar to evade but outdoor only.<BR>Imho defense doesnt need raised but dodge and parry should be very high with riposte not quite as high(I'll leave specific numbers to others)<BR>Spell selection ill leave to the rangers.<BR>They are right about archery though it should be worth using in combat not just for pulling and looting spent arrows off the mob would be great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ranger mid level quest zone- Lesser Faydark.<P>When you patched in the epic weapons, you added some very tiny, very aggro, difficult to see roaming death brownies to this zone. They are way beyond the Rangers that quest here, yet path through quest areas..<P>The spawn point for the Shadow Leader in Lesser Faydark is now patrolled them. The quest mob is a static 22 minute spawn with a Cleric for a place holder. It is rare, for mine(which I got way before the epic weapon patch) it took 18 hours without rest. <P>Please change the mob pathing so that the newer uber brownies (that mid level players have no chance against) do not path by this spawn, or the pixie tower spawn for the Brownie Outcasts (Ivy Leggings Quest), or the paths for Thistle (Ivy Tunic Quest). <P>Lesser Faydark is a pretty big mid level Ranger quest zone. I am glad I finished these quests before this, but please re-consider the pathing or aggro for future Rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ahhh Ranger Talk tim  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Well there are a few major problems with the that I can see.<P>Prior to kunark rangers tanking ability with equipment and skill caps was on par with that or a rogue.  This makes sense, we are the chain tank classes so to speak.  Rangers have the most damage output of the hybrids and they are chain wearing making them more accurately described as hybrids of rogues and druids although our best weapons were 1hs...okay but we are still one of the two chain wearing tanks.....maybe we are rogue/warrior/druid....<P>Moving on to post kunark rangers started to get pummeled.  In regards to this we recieved the spell Jolt, but not until level 55...much too late for most rangers, so the beatings continued.  Verrant recognized this by issuing a statement for ranger improvements, though the exact quot escapes me it was something like:<BR>Rangers will be getting improvements in dodge and parry allowing them to avoid taking damage, we feel this is in line with a "light" chain wearing tanks ability to avoid damage.  <P>Well now lets look at things from my perspective (Level 59 ranger)<P>-Most rangers won't get to level 55 to use jolt, it should be a level 52 spell...make people earn it, level 51 is hell enough for right of passage<P>-The dodge and parry caps though appreciated are insignificant per level.  Not to mention on test you're now giving Paladins and SKs matching dodge and parry and riposte!?! to warriors.....I thought rangers were the light tanks avoiding damage<P>-We are obviously part rogue, otherwise we'd be a plate class, give us defensive skills on par with rogues, no I don't want evade, no I don't want to hide/sneak, but I do want to be able to tank almost as good as a class that is NEVER suppose to get hit when I am suppose to get hit<P>-Spell stacking....currently Augment(2) and Speed of the Shissar won't stack with Call of the Earth until we kill Call of the Earth, get Swift Like the Wind or Anynanas(sp) Quickening, then recasting call of earth on ourselves, then get Speed of the Shissar.  Please just make these stack without the hassle, this is somewhat like the bards songs stacking only worse...<P>*Other Misc Stuff*<P>-Trueshot was useless when it was first introduced, so you fixed it.  It was no longer useless, it actually did COUGH more damage then just straight up melee attacking.  You decided it was broken and fixed it, it is now useless again.<BR>   a)  Every other melee type, even Paladins and SKs get a discipline that IMPROVES their regular damage output.  Rangers, the masters of damage output for the hybrids no longer do....why?<P>-Something that probably won't happen but probably should....Safefall.  Rangers grow up in the tops of trees, we are woodsman, master of the outdoors, we  *should* be able to move swiftly and safely across all terrain.  No I don't want to hear but you have levitate, we're rangers, we're accustomed to having our feet on the ground and feeling safe with our feet on the ground....<P>-Previously all we got was endure heat kinds of spells and virtually all our dd spells are fire based, with the introduction of some endure cold types of spells would it be considered to get some sort of cold based DD spell?<P>-Our "Epic" Quest, I didn't want to include this but every other class has seemed to mention it.  These quests were stated as "Not meant to be completeable by every person"  and I whole heartedly agree, however......I can't agree with WEEK LONG spawn times on ANY quest mob.  I have killed venril sathir several times but don't have my stone off him!!!!  Why is this?  I am obviously able to get this far and complete this part of the quest yet I have not...why?  Because he spawns only once a week.  I have killed Innorruuk on MULTIPLE occasions, yet don't have this peice for my epic!!!!  I can obviously complete this part of the quest yet I havn't.<P>Okay, so basically I want to be able to defend myself a little better, not as much as a warrior, sk, or paladin, but perhaps as well as a rogue or maybe even the cloth wearing monk.<P>No, I don't want to be able to gate, bind, or TP...I don't know where anyone got the idea that rangers should get gate or bind but SKs and Paladins would have just as much right, as for TPs....well I don't see Paladins getting Complete Heal or SKs getting a 450 point Lifetap.....I would recoment that Rangers do get Sow at level 29, this would give them the spell at the same level they get druid spells of that same rotation...only makes sense.<P>That covers just about all my concerns with my class<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Through the two plus years I have played a ranger I have often wondered whythey do not receive safe fall in out door zones or safe fall preiod.<BR>Rangers by definition are the physical masters of the outdoor while druids are the mental. Being a physical master of the outdoor I would think that<BR>rangers should/would be able to traverse rocky and hilly landscape unscathed very quickly and without harm or use of spells (levitate). It never really made since to me why a bard would receive this skill but a master of the outdoors would not.<P>Rangers are supposed to be masters of the outdoor domain, where many high drops and ledges are persistant. A ranger, being highly skilled at hunting all manner of outdoor creatures, should be abel to traverse any area in which his prey lurks unscathed after having practiced his trade for many years (levels).<P>Lets put this into perspective. Forest rangers are very adept at climbing and descending hills at a high rate of pace. So are first responders, firefighters that fight in national parks, mountainclimbers (with the use of gear obviously...and I wouldn't be opposed to having to use a piece of gear...perhaps equipped in your hand slot for the travel in areas - dunno), and all sorts of outdoor thrill seekers. tell me where are ranger, by role playing values and stories, would not fit into any one of these real life scenarios. The fact is that that is what they match most and these people are able to do these things all the time.<P>People of the hunting background are also able to scale mountains and steep terrain with great effectiveness.<P>I think most of you are thinking along the lines of safe fall being like a jedi trick from Episode One. I urge you to open your thought process on this for just a second and see the bigger picture.<P>Though rangers would obviously not use the skill in the same way as a rogue would it still fits what they are made to do. Be the masters of their domain, the outdoors. I mean come on don't any of you find it silly that a person that spends his whole life in the wilderness would not be able to climb down a mountain at a higher pace then a wizard without injury to himself?<P>Safefall is the answer to this. Though it would not be used in the roleplay sense that a rogue uses it it still fits quite well. I am sure if you take the time to think about it you'll see what I mean.<P>Some people argue that it does not make since that a ranger would practice this art....but I think that he would.  Frontier Mountains (in the game) making a perfect example.  Without the use of levitate I would think that a ranger would/should be able to traverse this rocky terrain without injury to his/herself.  Often times I fall for damage going down mountains (essentially from a roleplaying perspective scaling down it) and think what is that all about.<P>Another point:  I don't know what cold based spells the person above was speaking of but on a defensive level I would have to agree.  I think that rangers should get resist cold at the minimum...maybe at level 49, 50 or 51.  Again being a master of the outdoors I think that a natural affinity to cold occurs there.  We get that 5 point buff for being a ranger but I don't think that that is quite enough.  I do not think that we should get cold based attack though.  That is pushing the envelope quite a bit.<P>Ranger of the 50th level<BR>Rodcet</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Before I was level 39 I felt that Rangers should not be getting the spell at 30 (and now folks want it at 22 !).  SoW means you never die outdoors unless you want to.  It is remarkably powerful.  SoW and snare means you can kite anything.  <P>Rangers already ROCK in our 30s: at those levels we are very well balanced and the spell changes on Test will only make us better than we were.  That is not where we need our help.  For that matter, fear animal at 22 might be too powerful - think hard before you make that spell public.<P>A Ranger is most effective in a group when she is number 2 or 3 on the hate list - low enough that the tanks can do their job, but high enough that we can taunt things off the casters when we have to.  Any changes made to the class should make it easier for us to stay high on the hate list but not at the top of the hate list.<P>Heck, a skill based check that would bring us to number 3 on the hate-list would be a wonderful solution.  When we don't want to tank we could pass the mob off, when we want to taunt something off the casters we can use the skill and then taunt/flame lick, etc.<P>I am firmly in the camp that holds that Rangers do not need defence, we need a way to manage the hate list.  Any changes to our defence, defensive skills, or hit points should be designed to help us stay high on the hate list but NOT at the very top unless we want to be there.<P>As for gates, binds, and the rest of the wish list - give me more functional tracking and fully functional archery and I will be VERY happy with my new class-defining skills.  (although a charm animal would be playful ! )<P>Willaena on E'ci<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the idea above mine with avoidence and deftness or whatever was really good.MOst of my fellow rangers have already stated in great detail everything i could ask for so i wil just do a quick list.<P>1. Comparitivly to SK and PAL their offense=our defense our offense=their defense. However i was thinking. If even with us chain casting monks androuges and warriors outdamage us and still have higher defense seems ludicruss. I beleave that if rouges and monks out damage us we should be able to take hits better. Otherwise they are by the numbers superior damage dealers<P>2.Once per day ability maybe bind or a combat skill like pal/sks have. It's only fair<P>3. Pals get rez, Sks get pet summon corpse necro dots. They gfet the main thinsg of their classes. Well what can a druid do? He can evac and port. I think if rangers had a group evac we would be much more sought after for groups<P>4.Higher offense. Warriors own us in hp/ac plus they get plate armor duel weild double attack and they outdamage us. If a warrior is so much better then us defense wise then i think we should have 10 more points in offense and also our duel weild and double attack should be up there. Maybe not as high as a monk but highedr then they are now. You want us to be agile damage dealers/ Well then make us damage dealers<P>5.Fix archery<P>6. Give us evade at a low level. It fits your vision of us and like monks and rouges we need an agro control tactic lower down in the levels. We already get hide at 25 anyway<P>7.our high armor drops may be alittle to rare.

</FONT><HR>My fellow Rangers do make some very good points.....<P>I would like to through my 2cp into the mix as well:<P>When you look into the Fantasy Realm, how are Rangers depicted… with a bow and arrows – with light weight weapons - as trackers – sometimes as hunters and other times as protectors of animals - some view Rangers as light casters –their armor is typically light – Rangers are agile and nimble.<P>1)	Our Parents, Druids, are just that “MASTER” of travel. Sure Pally (cleric) get Rez at higher levels and SK (necros) get Summon Corpse.. I DO NOT agree with that but it is already in the game. After saying that… in all fairness then Rangers should get Gate spells (at later levels) if the melee class of Clerics and Necros have traits of their parents. This some logic would also apply to Fear Animal, since SK have Fear also.<P>2)	The Bow – The Bow is the universal sign and symbol of a Ranger. Rangers should have the HIGHEST Bow skill in the game with out a question. When our Archery skills get to a certain point our arrows should hit almost every time. I would like to see Rangers have the ability to fletch arrows that can have DD tips or Snaring tips or even Stun tips. (with the help of Enchanters) <P>3)	Armor – As everyone knows, Rangers AC / HP is one of the lowest for melee class. Things can be done to improve this.. Adding high AC items with HP (just an idea) only makes sense because attack/defense (as on the Test Server) skill equals that of a warrior. Basically, a Ranger is a Warrior stripped down with NO armor on. I do not know many Warriors that would go into a fight without their armor on.<P>4)	Pets - I can see why a SK would have a pet because there “Parent Class (necros)” are able to cast pets. Druids on the other hand cannot cast a pet (up until Velious came out, but that is only at level 55) Charm Pet I can better understand the idea behind it but do not accept it.<P>5)	Weapons – By far, Rangers can out damage any Warrior with the right weapons. I have out damage several Warriors that were a few levels higher then I was.<P>6)	Offensive skill – “Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors” All this means is that Rangers are going to get the crap beat out of us even more now. Why not make Rangers dodge, riposte and parry HIGHER then a warriors. Rangers have more AGI then warriors so it only makes sense that dodge is higher then Warriors.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Don't have much time, but I'd just like to show support for the propositons of better defense, and overall survivabilty of the class.<P>I'd also like to see a class defining spell in the end. Something rangers could bring to the table on a raid. <P>Gate is definetly not the answer, but how about an evac? If you think about this is not so overpowering as it may seem. It in itself is hard to cast, harder to cast while getting beat on, and depending which evacs you give us, they are not much more useful than just that, an evac.(ie: some evacs take you to remote locations, where also part of your group may be kos). Or maybe some more of the charm animal lines, which have their own disadvantages.<P>Like I said not much time here, but I do like the idea of having better dodge, riposte and defense, for all the proposed reasons above. Archery IS screwy, and I do beleave rangers are looking for a reason to stick a bow in the range slot in the end game (I'll find out when i get there). And the tracking changes, we want them soooo badly you can't begin to imagine. <P>Nice changes on the test, some were needed others just nice.<P>Debanus<BR>46th Ranger<BR>Rage Veeshan<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm a level 51 ranger with over 100 days played. My ranger was the first class I played and is still my primary character. I love playing a ranger. I think we are pretty much balanced with the exception to one thing:<P>Defense skill.<P>I've read almost half the posts and almost all of them mention that our defense should equal to the offense of knights. It just makes sense. Our defense capped at 200 is the only inbalance of our class.<P>Raise the defense skill and finish tracking then we are pretty much complete. here is a list of other changes I support <P>I also support:<BR>Our new buffs should stack with augmentation and the pally spells<P>Lowering Jolt to level 49.<P>Improving the Trueshot discipline<P>Adding cold base DD and dots only if druids have a cold based DD or DOT(sorry I dont play a druid so don't know if druids have cold-based defensive damage or dots)<P>Addition of more ranger-only armor pieces that give us teleporting abilities. The armor will be only obtainable in the 55+ zones. <P><BR>What I do NOT support<P>Fear animal will cause problems with the player base. We can already solo efficiently so I dont think fear animal is a good idea.<P>Lowering the level we get SOW<P>Teleportation SPELLS (however I support items that give us teleport procs like the Tolan's breastplate)<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The most important change to the high level ranger is making jolt unresistable.  If we can't evade we can't fulfill the vision of our class as dealing a lot of damage.  If we can't deal a lot of damage, we're useless.  We need evade to survive on runs and prevent ranger crunchies (tm).  Think of why you gave rogues evade.  This is the same issue.  Tying in with that is better defense/HP, a better DoT post 50, and some port spells to balance out with the paladin xp rez and the awesome post 50 SK spells.<P>Talinia, Level 60 Warder<BR>&lt;Course of Empire&gt;<BR>Test Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here's my take, I'll try not to make it too long.<P>*EDIT* Okay, it got long, here's a summery. Details below. Ones with &gt;&gt;&gt; in front are my main concerns.<P>Pre-cap:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Defence needs upgrade to 215-230 at the least. Same HP as a caster for the most part, worse AC than a shaman or cleric... sometimes druid. <BR>-Thorny Vine armor has the worse save bonuses of all planer armor.(I think?) Why?<BR>-Offence doesn't really need upgrade, but 'mastery' of dual wield would be nice. Equal off hand damage or always swing after a given leve.<BR>-Remember, ranger's can't break spell casting. It's a balance factor of the class.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;PLEASE remove the 30% mana tax on hybrids. Revert the mana pool to where it was. It causes more downtime and makes us less desierable.<BR>-Jolt: Lower resist, increase effect. Perhaps move Jolt to 49 and add Jolt2 at 55.<BR>-Call of Earth and Str of Nature have stacking issues.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Earthcall(epic proc) would be GREAT if it saved on something non-magic.(poison?) Highly resisted, doesn't stack with shaman or enchanter slows, added unwanted agro.<BR>-Panic Animal: No thank you.<BR>-Tracking: Need SEE invis to TRACK invis. Bards and druids both get a form of see invis. Ranger's don't. Add it to Eyes of the Cat?<BR>-One group evacuate spell? Poor location, but gets group out of trouble?<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Trueshot and Weaponshield. Lower reuse to 15 min. While under Trueshot, please make arrows NOT be blocked by players and pets.<P>=============================================<P><BR>The issue of defence:<BR>Rangers are hit with a triple penelty here. Lower hit points, lower defence, and lower armor ac than any other melee class. In fact, clerics, shamen, and druids can and do exceed a ranger in terms of hp and ac. A buffed ranger has roughly the same hp as a buffed caster... something wrong there.<BR>I would like to see ranger's defence skill raise to at the very least 215. 230 would make the most sence since that's a knight's offence cap.<BR>Some additional hp might be nice.<BR>As a slight footnote to armor's ac, please review the saves on Thorny Vine armor compaired to all other classes planer armor. Total saves on ranger's armor is +7. Most classes get +10vs all. Why?<P>When you're looking at "balance" issues for rangers, please also keep in mind ranger's are the only taunt class that can NOT break casting. Kick doesn't do it. I'm not asking to GAIN this ability, but when you're saying, "There needs to be some drawback" this is one of them.<P>Offence gains:<BR>Honestly, I don't see a need for ranger's offence to be raised. I _would_ like to see rangers as the "masters of duel wield" as Brad himself has said was the intent long ago. Perhaps rather than up the skill caps, grant equal damage modifier to off hand swings? Perhaps at a given level the off hand will ALWAYS swing when its due rather than checking?<P>Casting:<BR>Please, remove the 30% mana tax from hybrid spell. At the same time, remove the "extra" part of the mana pool that was added. Hybrids are LESS desierable in groups due to their added downtime(medding.) Even without the mana tax, pure classes would STILL cast the same spell for less mana (specialization) and even still, hybrid spells are VERY far behind their parent class anyway. In group situations, this mana tax only hurts the class unique spells for the most part(only ones usually cast), spells that SHOULDN'T be punished. Please, remove this unfair penelty. We already pay for our casting by having reduced skill, less effective spells(and a lot useless in group situations,) and much smaller mana pools... why punish us further?<P>Spells:<BR>Jolt is far to resisted. Perhaps it could be changed to a lure type spell or moved to a non-magic save such as poison. Due to all the 'balance issues' that get built into the game on magic saves, putting ranger's survial spell on the same save is a bit of a slap in the face.<BR>Other idea for Jolt would be move the existing one to 50th and at 55th give Jolt2 which saves on another element and offers greater agro reduction. Same casting time, same cost.<P>Call of earth and Str. of Nature have stacking issues. Please look into it.<P>Earthcall (epic) doesn't do a lot for your typical ranger other than create unwanted agro. First, its resisted a lot due to its magical save. Second, resisted debuffs like that generate a TON of agro. Third, even when not resisted it never takes hold because there's a shaman or enchanter slowing. In fact, the effect wouldn't even stick over Tepid Deeds when my enchanter friend and I were testing it... happens to be the proc on a warrior weapon too. Swarmcaller's proc is higher level than tepid, so I'd expect even THAT not to stack. <BR>Imagine this:<BR>Ranger1 says, 'Wow! you got the epics!'<BR>Ranger2 says, 'Ya, I love them'<BR>Mob1 attacks group.<BR>Ranger1 swings his Swarmcaller<BR>Mob1 yawns.<BR>Ranger2 starts swinging his epics.<BR>Your spell did not take hold.<BR>Your spell did not take hold.<BR>Your spell did not take hold.<BR>Ranger2 sighs.<P>Anything that can be done here? Even if nothing can be done about the effect not stacking, I'd VERY much like to see the save moved to poison. This will GIVE rangers(with epics anyway) a roll in Velious as they'd have a unique ability to slow many of those magic immune mobs. The only other change (that I would NOT like) would be to make it a right click effect. I like the proc for the unreliable element, I hate the resists and I dislike the 'doesn't take hold.'<P>Panic Animal: I'd be agaisnt it. I don't see a ranger as a class that goes around fearing animals. Befriend animal would make sence in my mind, but I do NOT want a charm spell.<P>Tracking:<BR>Yay Rowyl!<BR>Only one note here: There's still going to be some slim times when ranger will be out tracked by druids and bards. When? Invisible mobs. You need to SEE invis to TRACK invis, and rangers have no see invis spells. Druids have a spell, and see invis is built into bard's invis song. My suggestion would be to grant Eyes of the Cat a see invis component since the spell is already useless for any non-human ranger.<P>Just for the record, I'd like to see rangers with perhaps ONE group evacuate spell. Not 12 locations to choose from, not something to make money from gating, not even something to help get from point a to point b quicker. Just something to pull your group out of a bad situation. As we all know, there's a lot of times in the late levels when "Clerics camp!" is far more common than "EVAC!" I'd only ask for a "Succor: Rathe" dropping off at the Rathe Mtn druids, or some other out of the way location. <P>Disiplines:<BR>Big issue here is recycle time. I'd really like to see the 55th and 60th disciplines recycle on 15min timers. The ONLY time I use my bow is Trueshot. Archery is a ranger "thing" so it would be nice to see us encouraged to use it. I don't have access to Weaponshield yet, however, as it seems to be our "Defencive" discipline, why not recycle on a similar timer?<BR>Footnote on Trueshot: I've read posts before saying how arrows being blocked by player was part of "The Vision(tm)"... do you think "The Vision(tm)" can look the other way for those 2 minutes of Trueshot though? On average, 60% of my shots neither hit or miss when I try to use this disc in 'big' encounters becuase they struck a player or pet. Really anoying. Might as well get in there and hack and slash.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have read many replies to this thread, but the problem is many people are really missing the whole point of what BALANCE means.  This is not about wishlisting, this is about putting the ranger, and the other 2 hybrids on EQUAL FOOTING with the warrior/rogue/monk.<P>As it stands now the warrior/rogue/monk make a far superior combo over ANY hybrid comination.  I dare say that the most powerful classes in the game now are cleric/warrior/rogue/enchanter, in that order.<P>This is insane.  These 3 classes CONTROL the high end game, especially the cleric.  It was NEVER like this pre ROK.  Classes' abilities were not that far apart where substitutions couldn't be made.  As it stands now, no cleric no group.  PERIOD.  And that cleric is going to want a WARRIOR as his tank.  PERIOD.  And the group will want a rogue for damage output.  PERIOD. And the group will want an enchanter for CLARITY and mesing. PERIOD. THAT is the truth, THAT is the reality.  There is no longer such a thing as class balance.<P>The spell proposals are nice, but so what.  This will not, let me repeat, WILL NOT make the ranger ANYMORE desireable at the high end level.<P>Until you put the ranger, and the other 2 hybrids on EQUAL footing with the warrior, this is all an exercise in futility.<P>Pre 50 is not the problem. The classes then are close enough in skills and abilities that a wide variety of group combinations can be made.<P>Post 50 is the problem, and it is here that the hybrids are left in the dust. This is not to say that they aren't PLAYABLE, they are, they just aren't DESIREABLE.<P>Verant really dropped the ball in the post 50 world.  If you are serious about fixing it, and I believe you are, then FIX it.  Don't just do bandaid, wishlisting changes since this WILL NOT change the situation.<P>Brad finally saw a little bit of what I and others have been saying when he decided to nerf the donal's BP.  He saw the power of the cleric (through chealing) and a high HP'd AC'd warrior.  The proposed changes to hybrids and the bp nerf WILL NOT change this.<P>If you do not improve ranger defense, hps and give them a group desireable high end ability, the ranger plot will NOT change. They will still be on the outside looking in.<P>Archery will NEVER work.  LOS (Line of Sight)makes it useless.  Of course you could make it so LOS no longer applies by, namely, simply targeting, but I doubt this change would ever be made.<P>The spells are just TOO weak to be of any real value at the high end.  Make them too powerful and the parent class becomes useless.<P>That leaves melee. Which means we must go toe to toe with the critters.  But if the critters are constantly double attacking for 250+, a ranger just ain't surviving without mana dumping heals.  That means increased AC and Hps.<P>As for a desireable high end ability, the only thing I can think of is a GROUP EVAC spell.  Please, for those asking for self ports, that I don't buy.  That is a selfish wishlist request which does NOT benefit the GROUP. Group evac is truly something a group DOES want, and giving rangers this spell line (which is line with it's parent class) WILL help rangers getting into groups.  People will now say "hey forget that second warrior, let's get that ranger".<P>A ranger is 75% warrior 25% druid they say. That does not mean it adds up to 100%. It doesn't.  ALL it means is they are at best 75% and at worse 25%.  Now who would you want in your group? Someone who is at best 75% or someone who is at best 100% (i.e., warrior/rogue/monk)?<P>Verant, I implore you, since this is probably my last chance in doing so.  Make the changes I proposed here and in the posts I made in the prior threads.<P>Maxxius Insanius<BR>Level 57 ranger The Nameless server<BR>Level 52 ranger Tholuxe Paells server<BR>Level 50 ranger cazic Thule server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>RANGER ONLY SKILL SUGGESTION FOR THE DEFENSIVE CONCERNS [SUMMARY]<P>I got carried away and after each message I posted, I got more ideas.  But this will be my final - A recap as it may be.<P>I agree that since we can only wear chain based armor we should have the ability to Dodge parry and riposte (DPR) better.<P>Possible Solution<BR>Ranger Only Deftness Skill - Level attaned between 39 and 45 - Must be trained <P>Skill effect:  Checked on every attack against the ranger  - if successfull the rangers Defensive skills are raised for the meee contact <BR>(raise would either be a maxe skill of warrior - 252 or a multiplyer based on skill attained)<BR>Skill checked against the ranger's Agility and skill Deft(XX)<P>Penalty:  Ranger MUST be below a certain weight for skill effect (110-130 stones - as stated above, i think this level would need consideration)<P>here is a possible scenario<P>Attack by mob<P>1. AC roll check (unsuccessfull)<BR>2. Deftness check (agility 130 actuall roll requires 137 agilty)(unsuccessfull) <BR>3. Dodge check (unsuccessful)<BR>4. Parry Check (unsuccessful)<BR>5. Riposte check (unsuccessful)<BR>Mob hits you for 110 damage<P>Attack by mob<P>1. AC roll check (unsuccessfull)<BR>2. Deftness check  (agility 130 - roll requires 110 agility)(successfull)(all defense skills checked at 252 skill this attack or skills multiplied by a factor))<BR>3. Dodge check (successful)<BR>YOu DEFTLY DODGE the MOB <P><BR>Using something like this woould avoid too much riposting (if that is VI's concern since both Dodge and PArry would be checkd first at 252 skill)<P>Advantages:<P>1. A relatively low skill in deftness might make all the difference in the world, ie lvl + 2(or 3)times lvl. Also the current defense caps could be maintained. Testing would quickly see what skill of Deftness/avoidance would be balancing.<P>2. Would not change the low lvl balance that I feel exists<P>3. Riposting damage would only occur less than 1/6 of the time since parry and dodge would be the more likely outcome of a successfull deft/avoid roll<P>4. Finally for the roll to occur, ranger would have to be below a weight cap for the skill.<P>Dyarrig Lawne<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail all<BR>There are just afew things I need to be straightened out for the ranger class. First is damage; if we're to be classed as an offense class post 50 with monks and rogues shouldn't we be outdamaging warriors (who most would agree are THE most defensive class)? I think our offensive skill and weapon skills should at least be equal to a warrior, like on test.<BR>Now archery; this is pretty useless as it stands for Rangers, afew warriors may use it for pulling but we can deal much more damage on a pull with our DD's and I dunno about on other servers but on the PvP servers past about level 20 most rangers I know replace their bow with a Runed Bone Fork or somthing else for resists. Couldn't somthing be done with archery? specially as the warrior cap is above ours...<P>Now on defense; I think our deffense is about what it should be but many of the posts here are asking for it to be raised. This is just trivial really but would it be possable to raise dodge, parry and riposte instead of defense as it fits the ranger class better in my oppinion.<P>Now just a bug I'll mention at the end, Snare is breaking when DD's are cast on it light root does. Its been doing this since root and snare stacked. I'm guessing its a bug as it was not announced. Please could you look into it?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, I just posted and knew I missed somthing I meant to comment and, bind.<P>I know now that the vision I had of a ranger when I first started playing EQ is not exactly in line the the Vision but I gathered the class are meant to be at home in the outdoors? So why is it if we are going anywhere we have to go into a town and get a bind? I dont think giving rangers bind would be overpowering as initially you said you wouldn't gives tanks bind so they couldn't easily storm dungeons, but rangers cant tank now at high levels so just give us it at a high level. .....it just seems silly I've gotta rely on newbie casters to travel anywhere, especially as a ranger is meant to be free, independant and at home in the outdoors.<P>Just a thought</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Rangers need work...these are my suggestions-they are all ranger only-and they would fix the class and make it alot more fun-and practical to play.<P>1. Make rangers the only hybrid class with a bind ability. I am not saying a spell or gate is in order, but as rangers are supposed to be wanderers and all, it only makes sense that they could do it more safely and effectively than other melee classes. find I am afraid ot go anywhere cool becuase if I die, I have to run from Kelethin or whereever to get my corpse. Make it a self only bind ability with a reuse rate similar to SK's harmtouch. We could travel freely without worrying about getting a bind zones away. <P>2. Give rangers-and only rangers-the ability to charm pets. This would also not be a spell, it would be an ability like tracking, it would start at say 9th level, only work on animals of course, possibly on white cons and below-or even just on blues. It would be a skill, with skill caps and increases, you could fail. It would have a reuse similar to a paladin's lay on hands. I think it would fix alot of the ranger's solo isuses, a pet could tank while the ranger empited his quiver at the beast. Hell, shadowknights and shammies get a pet, that wasn't considered overpowered. Ask them how useful the pet is, yet it does not make them overly scary, it is simply an addition that makes sense. Rangers should be able to befriend animals, either make it a permanent charm while in the zone, or make it wear off like a standard charm, either way, it would do alot to improve the effectiveness of the class.<P>3. Give rangers(and possibly druids)the ability to scrounge for arrow parts. Look, they could be whatever quality-even crappy all wood-that's fine. But I should not have to spend 2 plat everytime I try to bow kite a mob. Most of the arrow parts are wood, they can be found in nature, I am not saying we should be fletching class 6 metal arrows, but is it crazy to think a utility class, who is known for their archery, could make their own arrows? The only time I go into cities anymore is to bank and buy arrows. It makes perfect sense to think that rangers could find the materials they need for basic fletching out in the wild. Either make it an ability, or a skill, or just add arrow components to the list of possible foraged items. It would add an entirely new dimention to ranger usefulness and make them alot more cost effective to play.<P>4. The tracking filter, we keep dreaming about the idea of cycling through the entire zone looking for that elusive mob, the tracking filter would allow us to use the ability, which may of us see as near useless at higher levels. I look at it this way-and this goes for the charm pet and bind ability suggestions too- as a hybrid class, we are competing with the shadowknight's harm touch and the pally's lay on hands...two very combat effective abilities. What do we have? tracking, sneak, hide and forage. These so called "utility abilities" are not all they are cracked up to be. Tracking has serious limits, forage is shared by iksars and druids-and is not that big an advantage, sneak caps at 50-please...try using that in any zone-you will be spotted and die, and hide....hide don't get me started on hide. Long and short of it is, not only do we not get a combat useful hybrid ability, we also don't get a useful utility ability. If anyone can tell me an ability rangers have which mirrors harm touch or lay on hands, please tell me.<P>5. This is a fairly standard idea...we need more damage on archery. It is nice and all that we get crits with bows, but a class which is famous for archery should be able to use it effectively. Right now, it is good for pulling, and that's it. If archery were tweaked as to make it more damage effective across the board, it would reawaken the dying fletching trade, make bows more than just a sick joke on rangers and finally make the archer/ranger image we all grew up with a possibility.<P>6.  Honestly, the defensive cap would be lovely, but it is not the answer.  People keep comparing us to rogues, warriors and monks...when in reality we are hybrids.  Compare us to other hybrids...where is our class specific ability?  Where is our harm touch/lay on hands?  If Vertant can justify why we do not have a combat viable ranger only ability I will shut up about not having one, but I have not seen anything along those lines.<P>7.  The offesive cap is an interesting idea, but it only aggrivates the problem, without higher ac or better dodge/parry/riposte it will only succeed in getting rangers dead faster.  Given our lack of heavy armor, it makes sense that we should receive a bonus for not weighing as much as a pally or SK.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In light of all the changes being made to the class to make Rangers more of an "extra-damage" (eg. rogue, monk) class than a "tank" (eg. warrior, paladin, shadow knight) class, the ranger class should NOT posess the TAUNT ability.  <P>Please determine which of these types of classes we are and act accordingly.

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of Rangers having a weight limitation similar to Monks. It shouldn't be as restrictive (2/3rds current max wieght?) or as powerful though (don't know what the bonus is.)<P>I would also think the ability to sneak and hide at the same time with movement, like Rogues, should be implemented for outdoor use only. Higher caps on these skills would help, as well as, once again, outdoors being told that sneak and/or hide was successful.<P>As far as tracking and how lame it is that other classes have it as well (or better!), I say remove their /con color. Another balancing factor would be to somehow not show them rare MOBs, so only Rangers could find them!<P>Schuthrax Bloodthorn<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We are folks of nature, surly we can find some wood to make into shafts, a few bird feathers to be made into fletches. Maybe the ablilty to turn bones into bone shafts in a Ranger only fletching kit?<P>Finally I would like to see the quest for the Cloak of Jaggedpine expanded. When I compleated this quest, they hinted that they may be able to further enchant this cloak. It would be nice if we can turn this cloak into something truly wonderful for all rangers and druids.<P>Sanderbar Stongoak<BR>41st season Ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Venture, I have noticed that the best rangers tend to rely on honing their skills and smarts rather than trying to, as you say, "get sow[/clarity/etc] every 35 minutes."  I've met a few Rangers who are using banded in their low 30s and offered to help them do their Ivy quest only to find out the've gotten all/most of their Ivy but are keeping it in the bank.  /boggle  Their answer has  been along the lines of:  I'm not a tank, don't want to think like a tank, and since I'm doing a fair job of tanking when I have to as it is, Ivy would make it too easy and I'd get careless.  <P>/boggle  <BR>/boggle  <P>Rangers seem happiest when they can just squeak by with a big ol' "yeah I got my butt whooped but we lived, didn't we?" grin.  They take a lot of pride in squeezing every last drop out of something they can, keeping their playing skills razor sharp.  I swear if Rangers were mechanics, they'd make a car drive across the country on three drops of oil, a quart of gas, no spark plugs.  And they'd have detailed it too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055463&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055463&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
