</FONT><HR>Hope your still reading.. But here goes.. I want to stay on topic so I will stick with just brainstorm Ideas for Summoned Items only (and will stay away from pets as well because I think that is outside of the scope of this topic).<P>First let me state my two cents on an ideal that Verant subscribes too that I think is “over”-emphasized. That ideal being that summoned items should not take the place of real world items in terms of desirability. While there are obvious reasons why this is true (and I doubt anyone especially mage’s would disagree in principal), the enforcement of this principal has for the most part gone to far and as a result yielded a basically useless summoned weapons line. The counter to this principal is that summoned items should not be so underpowered, least they be reduced to underutilized, page 50 in the spell book items. However that is exactly what has happened for a good percentage of our summoned items. The reasons ”I” think have to do with the “NO RENT” not being properly calculated in terms of inconvenience to player for balance concerns.  Now this is where the principle becomes a little hazy.. “NO RENT” for the player who can produce said NO RENT item this inconvenience is completely mitigated. In terms of Inconvenience (which has an impact of item “Value”) NO RENT to Magicians is very small. But to other classes the Inconvenience is much, much greater and should be considered when balancing item Value. In other words what I am trying to get at here is that I don’t think it is unreasonable to have summoned items that are on par with items that one would find at a that particular level range. The fact that they are summoned does offset their power in a lot of cases. Just my two cents on this discussion, which I am sure that, will be addressed with the tuning team on this topic… Now (sorry for that long comment) for ideas for summoned items, I will try to list a summoned concept and then a particular concrete example of that concept:<P>Summoned Armors with very specific purposes. It would have a large mana expenditure for a bag of armor (all no rent of course) that has a very specific usage. Resistance gear can probably be that best example I can provide (I know others have mentioned it). For example summoning a suit of Fire Armor that (along with cool textures  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )  provides close to +100 Fire resistance when all pieces are equipped (by tank classes only) but with less than stellar AC and significant weight costs for balance.<P>Summoned pet only weapons are a great idea but I have a feeling that there is a coding problem here (I would bet that there is no Pet identifier for the item table). Maybe a small code change could make the weapon appear in the pet’s hand (would mean that we couldn’t give other pets these summoned weapons and might alleviate some balance concerns).  An interesting concept here would be to make incredibly mana expensive summoned pet weapons that increased damage output of the pet by 10-15% possibly. Or maybe a 2H version that increased Damage output by 30-35% (no duel wield).<P>Summoned weapons that have a very specific in usage.  A little less than decent stat wise weapons that we would hand out to party members that have Very specific circumstances for usage.  Vs undead weapons, Vs plant weapons, Fire/Cold based procs, with very high proc damage (set to proc at appropriate levels to avoid twinking).  A weapon that isn’t at all great in all situations but stellar in one or two particular circumstances. Again balance with “NO RENT” in mind. It would be nice if the summoned Items could “scale” with magician level but I imagine there are code concerns related to that.<P>Summoned items that enhance other class abilities. Personally inter-class enhancement is one area that I wish VI would have placed more emphasis on (you did a decent job don’t get me wrong). For instance items that reduce another classes mana cost/casting times for certain spells. I am sure there are coding issues with that, however a nice alternative would be items that could be handed to a specific class that cost us lets say double the mana cost (of the spell) but had one charge of a spell that that class uses very often with a greatly reduced casting time cost. For instance summoned healing rod that has one charge of CH which cost us 800mana (400 mana for Ch right?) that is cleric only and Lore that has a 20-50% reduction in casting time. Problems I see being that there might not be code that allows that effect to only be utilized by players of a given level (10th level clerics shouldn’t be allowed to CH just because they know a level 54 mage). I used an extreme (probably unbalancing) example but you get the picture.<P>How about an upgrade to Cornucopia and Everfont that summons food and water that is Not NO RENT.<P>I’d love to see a summoned item that has a few charges of the upgrade to eye of zorm. That way we can give that item to a tank that can us it an not have to worry about having a pet. In fact I’d love to see those spells changed to summoned items instead of their current almost useless form.<P>Possibly a summoned item that will proc a reverse taunt effect (or cast one). Items that manipulate hate lists can be unbalancing I know but I think an Item like this could be balanced.<P>Finally a summoned item that with one charge of a spell that only works on the casters pets. This spell would freeze the pet for about 5-10 seconds and continually wipe its hate list (or at the end of the freeze period wipes pets hate list).  It would work even it the pet is feared. It would basically allow the pet or caster to get beaten upon without retaliation for a few seconds. Would make enchanters hate us much, much less. Maybe let us have the use of our pets on raids again.<P>Long but I hope it helps….<P>Ves<P> <P><BR> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about the ability to summon monsters away. They would get a full heal and it would clear aggro. This would be a very valuable summon.<P>Also the ability to summon a group member from another zone at like 60. It should not be a combat spell so it should take like 3 minutes ti cast but after death its a heck of alot better than waiting 1000000 minutes for him to get back.<P>Super bandages only usable by 45 plus is a good idea. 10 shot low damage items that might do like 100 damage per shot any clas would be another fun thing (with like a 15 second recast).<P>A 'pet harness' which is an item that acts as a focus item for pet classes. You click it on a pet and it basically gives your pet a level.<P>For Enchanters I would let mages summon a brain. They click on the item and the enchanter pet will attack or back off depending on what its doing.<P>For hybrids maybe mages could summon a item that lets them get back 1 more mana a tic that goes in their ammo slot.<P>The idea is situational slightly helpfull items like the ones above would be cool. <P>For Uber runs I would let mages summon a no drop Boom stick for like 2000 mana. With like 6 charges that does like 600 damage a pop unresitiable with a 20 second cast.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some great ideas---some sorta goofy. Overall, we've given the LT a lot to think about. Generally, I think (and I haven't read every single post in the two threads) we want:<P>1hb weapons that proc a good DD spell from our own lists.<P>Swords (1h and 2h) that proc elemental spells or are effective against elemental creatures.<P>Bows that compliment the arrows we summon.<P>Armor/Robes with good stats for CR's, etc<P>Stones with a variety of different spells<P>Pet Heal somewhere in lvl 30 range<P>We want AE spells either fixed or replaced.<P>The above are the ones I saw most often mentioned. If anyone can do a better summary, please give it a go. Just trying to condense the list for Absor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now, for my idea about the Walls/Barriers. Only a couple of us came up with this idea. I'd like to explore the notion further. The greatest problem I see with trying to construct barrier spells is the particle effect. I'm not a programmer, btw, so I can't accurately describe the drawbacks---but I can make some guesses.<P>Ok, what I envision is a series of spells based on the elements that would conjure a barrier. IF  cast in a dungeon with typical corridors, a panel of elemental force forms touching both walls, floor and ceiling in front of the mage. The barrier has hit points which an attacker must beat through before it can reach the caster. In addition, it would also have a damage shield effect so the attacker would take appropriate damage from each hit. The barrier would also have a duration.<P>If cast outdoors or in a large chamber inside, the barrier should form a circle around the mage with the same effects noted above. Anyone standing near the mage should be inside the circle. In either case, the barrier would also have a reasonable duration.<P>Pros: this spell is for emergency protection for the mage and the group. It can provide enough time for the mage or group to med, heal, or to prepare other magicks necessary for escape. It's unique, uses existing particle effects and effects already coded: ie, various spells used by Necros and Wizards that provide similar protection but for themselves only.<P>Balances: it takes time to call up a barrier--probably longer than a damage shield in casting; the duration should probably be similar to a damage shield; it works both ways: anyone attempting to pass through it from either side encounters the damage and hit points; it can be dispelled; it is unmoveable and cannot be seen through; it should probably take a reagent/gemstone of some kind to cast it; exceptionally large creatures might be able to physically attack over the barrier.<P>Cons: possible drawbacks associated with a continous particle effect in the case of fire, water or air walls (although I have a solution for this); would require additional coding to include the new graphics everywhere; would require extensive testing for balance; could be abused--used against fellow players outside the intent and purpose of the spell; could be used as an exploit if not carefully balanced between risk and benefit; could cause some serious class envy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>A note on the particle effects. At first, I envisioned logical effects associated with the elemental barrier: fire would be a continuous erupting of flames from ground to ceiling, etc. But how about this: the texture used for our pets could instead be applied to the elemental barrier of the appropriate kind. In addition, in order to ensure the proper use of this spell, what if the mage must sacrifice his pet in order to erect the barrier? That is, the pet is transformed into the barrier. While the barrier lasts, the Mage can have no pet conjured---it, in effect, becomes the barrier.<P>Anyway, this is the best I can do for an explanation of what I meant by Elemental Barrier spells.<P>Please feel free to critique my idea. Point out my oversights. Tell me what you think about this idea.<P>thanks<BR>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How does this sound? It would be for straight roleplaying and have no real use besides inflating your ego but,<P>Summon: Dopelganger<BR>Level 55, 400 Mana<P>Summons a pet that has the Attack/AC/HP of a level 44 fire pet but without any of the spells, making it worthless at level 55 in combat. The catch is that it looks like whatever you have targeted when you cast it (although it would have the same faction as a normal pet), if you have nothing targeted then it would look just like you.<P>This is quite possible seeing as how whatever creature it looks like already has it's model in the zone. <P>Imagine, your walking around North Ro with a Sand Giant following you, scaring newbies. Or your in Everfrost with a Barbarian Guard saying "Guarding with my life, Master." Or your in Wakening Lands freaking people out because Wuoshi is attacking giants for you.

</FONT><HR>One thing that always worried me about Mages, is that most other casters have some kind of spell that helps them escape if needed. i.e. snare, root, mez, stun... Basically a low mana, fast casting spell that gives the caster a few seconds to get away or get off another spell. <P>How about Summon Doppleganger. It summons a temporary phantom elemental with a super taunt, that does no damage and distracts the mob for a few seconds. Giving the soloer a chance to get a head start to the zone, cast another spell, or the group to evac. The mob has to be targeted so it will only effect one mob and the mob re-agros if attacked.  <P>It would even allow us to help out the other guy in trouble without stealing the kill. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>oh boy, i dont know where to begin.  Ok just gonna start typing and let the brain juices flow.  First a little bit about me, ive been playing since public release of EQ, Spring of 99, I remember the days befor the waterstone, befor the modulateing rods, befor pets wielded weapons. This is my view on the Magician class.  We need spells that allow us to group.  In the old days befor Kunark, most of us were happy to solo and go on occasional raids.  Now, grouping is a vital part of the game and leveling experience.  The kunark spells and later the velious spells only aleviated part of the problem.  Many of our spells most people dont want.  Call of the Hero is the only spell that has made us a vital member of raids, not necessarly grouping.  <P>First lets look at Grouping. What do us Magicians have that will make us wanted in a GROUP?       <P><BR>Nuff Said. Now lets look at the other classes.<P>Necros- Summon Corpse, ability to transfer their Health and mana to others<P>Enchanters- Clarity, Speed Buffs, Slow Debuffs, Mez<P>Wizards- Group Teleports, Lure series of spells, ability to Group gate to planes.<P>Clerics- Healing, Healing, Buffs, Healing, Reserect, Healing<P>Druids- Evacs, Healing, some decent nukes, Tracking<P>Shamans- Buffs, Speed Buffs, Healing, More Buffs, and decent debuffs<P>Rangers- Decent Tank, can dish out decent dmg, cant take it however (that is a different thread i belive) Tracking good when hunting for named outdoors mobs like Quillmane.<P>Paladins- Decent Tank, back up healer<BR>Shadowknight- Decent Tank, good spells to back up the dmg<BR>Monk- Feign Death Pulling, Great at High Levels<BR>Rogue- Needed at high levels cause of the locked doors, VI put something in the game where groups need rogues, rogues are decent for corpse recovery in planes or other areas with sneak and hide<P><BR>What can we add to magicians that will make us wanted in groups?  I like alot of the ideas for the summoned items folks have been comeing up with.<P>Summoned Items with Charges are nice.  There is already loot versions of some items, Blazeing wand (5 charges of Blaze), ? Wand with 5 charges of Lava Shield.  <P>Upgrades to current spells we have, Pet healing spells is one example.<P>Lower the Level of some spells we have, Gift of Xev, Bristlebanes Bundle, Quiver of Marr, Pouch of Quillous.<P>Love the idea of summon pet and summon a mob(i can see many situations where summon mob would be unbalanceing however)<P>Fix drop rates of current spells.<P>More summoned weapons with various procs.<P>Wayshaper Mysticweaver<BR>56 Magician of Rodcetnife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Popular themes I am seeing (and liking);<P>Summon Pet; Why the heck didn't I think of this one?  I don't know how many times I have wondered where the heck my pet was and then realized I had to camp or Gate when I started getting <BR>'Taunting Attacker' messages...<P>Higher level Food / Water (and perhaps Bandage) Summons that creates the equivalent of Foraged Food and Drink that can be used, is permanent (not No Rent) and cannot be sold to a vendor.<P>Summon; the ability used by 50+ mobs on us.  It would be SO nice for a 51st level Mage to cast a spell and all around him hear; "Magikus says "You will not evade me A_Cleric_of_Innoruuk_003!!" as the fleeing mob warps back into melee range.<P>Some other item summons, such as Summon Lockpicks, Summon Instrument or Summon Shuriken.<P>Reposting some stuff that vanished from the first thread;<P>16th level; Summon Burning Blade - summons a rapier with acceptable stats (a tad better than the common drop FS or purchasable Combine weapons available at those levels, nothing special) and the right-click effect Burst of Flame.  As a clickable effect, a pet could not use the attack as it would a proc, and the weakness of the effect makes it mainly for pulling.  The normal classes that can use the rapier would be listed (SK, warrior, rogue, bard, etc) but also *Magician* would be listed on this rapier, and since it is Piercing, he would even have skill with it.<P>20th level; Summon Blazing Blade - this Short Sword has stats equal or superior to a Combine or FS Short Sword and is usable by the normal assortment of classes and also by Magicians (who will have no 1HSlash skill, so they will suck with it).  It has a Proc of Fire Flux, making it insanely dangerous to use around Enchanters...  It is primarily of use as a pet weapon in situations where the AoE will not get one trained and killed.<P>24th level; Summon Fiery Lance - conjures a spear that is just a point better than than the common FS / Combine Short Spear variants, but is Lore.  The reason it is Lore is that it has 1 chg of Flame Bolt and can be equipped by Magicians as above.  The Mage can give one to an ally and then summon another for himself, but he cannot have a back-pack full of free manaless Flame Bolts for later.  The spear will release the Bolt as a right click effect, just as the Burst of Flame above, but recall that this Flame Bolt is the 8th level spell and might do 47 pts, this spell is not that devastating to the sort of mobs one faces at 20th+ level.  (This item could be level-limited.  A person below 16th may find her 'will insufficient to activate this weapon.')  It would also be Expendable, so that upon discharging its Bolt, the Spear would be destroyed.  In either case no more than one Bolt would be allowed thanks to the Expendable and Lore tags and the mana cost to summon the spear would be the same as to cast a Bolt in the first place, this would not be a slow and cheap alternative for kiting.  <P>Chillstone - gives +15 Fire Resistance when equipped in the ammo slot<P>Warmstone - as above but +15 Cold Resistance, <P>Spellstone - as above but +25 Mana<P>Wind Wand - a 0.0 wt 1H Blunt usable by All / All that strikes with a delay of 15 and damage 3 (50% slower than a Moss-Covered Twig, but still pretty nifty)<P>Various 0.0 wt Summoned Weapons; no procs or ability mods, just decent damages (comparable to Combine or slightly better), Magical, No Rent and Weightless.  Perhaps some of them could be All / All and person could gather a few and equip himself with wildly innapropriate weapons for screenshots (a Rogue or Wizard with a Two-Handed Sword for instance!  They might have no skill with it, but would draw comment regardless.  Alternately, the weapons might not be All / All, but Magician would still be added to the user list, allowing a Mage to walk around with a conjured Two-Handed Sword or Longbow if she chooses.<P>In the case of weapons with special procs (which I really don't get that excited about, as items with magical properties seems more like Enchanter property to me), I would prefer weapons with Elemental properties, such as a Black Crystal Morning Star that procs Obsidian Shards or a Whip of the Winds with a Stunning proc or the above fire-themed weapons.  If we are going to be stomping all over Enchanters by conjuring the magical weapons and / or items that they still cannot Enchant, we should at least stay in-theme for the most part...<P>Spike Sphere - Expendable item that when clicked unleashes a 30 pt Magic-based AoE DD around the target.  Alternately, the Spike Sphere is a Throwing item and releases the effect only if it hits.  Lore.<P>Fire Oil; Expendable, Lore item as above, unleashes a 30 pt Fire-based AoE DD when it is activated (or thrown).<P>Summoned Lightsources; act as normal or Greater light sources<P>Nightstone; actually negates light like the Blackened Sapphire from Najena.  Perhaps contains a charge of Remove / Cure Blindness?<P>Songstone; that comes with some sort of related music (just not cheesy Rivervale music).<P>Conjured Hide Armor (stats equivalent to Rawhide, equippable by All / All, weightless and No Rent, <P>Conjured Mail (Chain) or even Conjured Plate (if available as spells, Conjured Plate would be 50+ since it would remain All / All and be weightless, creating some small demand for it with higher level casters and monks...).<P>Alternately, have the Chain and Plate wearable only by normal Chain and Plate wearing classes, but also include Magician in the list.  The Armor summons spells should only be a single spell / suit of armor, summoning an 8-slot 'Armorer's Bag' holding a Breastplate / Tunic, 2 Bracers / Wristbands, Helmet / Coif / Cap, Vambraces / Leggings, Vambraces / Sleeves, Sollerets / Boots  and Gauntlets / Gloves.<P>Even if making the Summoned armors All / All is deemed too much (although I would be willing to wait to level 49 to be able to Summon weightless All / All Plate Mail, and I bet Monks would be pushing over each other to group with me...), all summoned gear / weapons / armor should DEFINITELY be Mage-usable, no matter how 'out-of-theme.' <P>At the higher levels, where jewelry and other non-visible items raise Int to 200, I find that looks are VERY important.  If my Mage could be wearing NO RENT Summoned Plate on her visible slots, she would still be near 200 Int and would look DAMN fine (and have a nicer Armor Class I imagine).  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Already, a few of the casting classes can change their appearance drastically with various form spells, this would allow the Magician to also change his appearance significantly.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My favorite ideas:<P>1. As suggested elsewhere, a stone that makes the items in any bag it is in weight nothing. If this is not possible for coding reasons, instead make a non-Lore stone that weighs -10,  i.e. it reduces your total encumberance by 10 per stone.<P>2. CoH type spell for pets, but much lower level. This could help compensate for the bad pathing in some zones.<P>3. A leash spell for pets. Either it prevents the pet from getting too far from the caster, or kills the pet when it does.<P>4. Make monsters summoned with Monster Summoning have neutral faction so they can be used in planes battles. If they run off chasing a mob, no other mobs will join in.<P>5. More DD proc'ing weapons of various types. Please no slow, haste or healing type procs. That steps on too many other toes and there would no doubt be stacking issues. Just fire, frost, and magic based DDs. Simple. Oh yeah, the weapons should look impressive. If you cannot change the look of our pets, let them at least wield cool weapons. Let us equip the pets with 2 different weapons too, and make the weapons scale in damage to the pet's level so they don't become obsolete when we get the next different proc'ing weapon.<P>6. Mages need a higher level pet heal, but since this thread is about summoning spells, how about a summons that gives us a new mage only itemr with charges of renew elements on it? If it had X charges, it would take more mana then is needed to cast Renew Elements X times, but it can be summoned ahead of time. Maybe the charges on it could increase will level. This item would of course be NO DROP.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me start this by saying that I have a lvl 51 elementalist on Prexus.<P>First off I think the mod rods should be different. For the person who summons the mod rod he should be able to activate it Without using hp. Why you ask? I have already paid mana to make it so why not make it so that for the original caster it is just a little extra mana shot? kinda like a harvest only I gave up the mana to begin with. For everyone else it should function the same.<P>As far as new summons go, I agree with a lot of people who have said that we should summon ARMOR. if not armor then how bout we take the phantom series and actually let it give us an illusion of being cloaked in a full set of the appropriate armor type as the spell gives...phantom chain cloaks us in what LOOKS like a full set of chain but all other effects remain the same..same ac boost etc...<P>Another new summon idea. <BR>Orb of change (just a generic name idea)<BR>1 charge<BR>expendable<BR>effect:cast illusion of whatever elemental on caster<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Admittedly Im not yet to the post 50 lvl so I cant really say what does or does not need to be addressed for mages at that point.  Most players who run mages are well under that point nad Id like to address the issues that I feel are important to the lower levels.<P>Most of our summoned items are nice.  I have to admit I like the idea of not having ot wait for poor planers to run back to town to fetch food.  While I never minded summoning supplies for other players, the pain of doing it pre-cornu/everfont is a huge pain in the butt.  In fact for a long while I bought food and only summoned it at dire need.<P>Why not change the summon food and water spells to act as the bandage spell does, to summon half the casters lvl in number, but cap at 10.  It would then actually be quicker and useful till Cornu/everfont at 29.<P>Summoned weapons.  Currently we have NO useful 1 handed weapons for our pets.  I have not cast SoR in weeks.  Id rather give my pets the velium weapons I pick up off mobs.  How about a stun proc weapon at around 20 or so?  Or a weapon that causes an uber taunt effect - basically giving us a root if you will?<P>My only other issue for our summoned gear is the lvl that certain spells are available.  Over 50 for party supplies and ration kits?  Are you mad?  I have harnessed the powers of the universe to summon lethal shards of horrible destruction below lvl 20 and I cant make a party cake/beer pack?  Ummmm...what the heck school did I attend anyway?  These spells should be 40ish at best.<P>One last thing, I clipped this from another poster.  Tis the best and really only truly needed summoning pre 50 in my opinion:<P>Master Summoning: Summons a Dagger of symbols, a coldstone, a stack of bandages, food, and water. All in a 8 pocket dim pouch<BR>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<BR>ABSODAMMLUTELY.  Heck make it lore or no-drop for all I care, make it cost slightly more manna than summoning all of these things seperately, make it lvl 50 or higher to replace the current ration kit, but make this spell happen!   /rant mode off<P>Thanks for listening A-man,<P>Ridcully<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of a lower level summoned 1hb weapon, and I *really* like the suggestion of a recall pet spell to teleport your wayward pet to your side at a cost of 50% of its current hp.  I suggest we combine these and have recall pet be a right clickable effect on a summoned 1hb.<P>Summon Cadecus (sorry if the spelling is wrong): Rather than summoning better bandages, how about summoning an item that when equiped increases the users ability to bandage? Possibly making the bandages heal more per bandage, or even better allowing the character who is binding the wounds to bind to a higher percentage of hp?<P>Having summoned bags transform into very heavy no drop items if the person carrying them goes link dead would be great! No one should loose things due simply to a poor connection.  If heavy enough, they would be destroyed as soon as the player got back on line and moved stuff out of them anyway.<P>My favorite idea for improving the magician class isn't a new summoning spell, and isn't an idea of my own.  I've previosly seen suggested the spell "Merge with Pet."  The magician would become the elemental pet he had summoned, and would count as his own pet.  He couldn't summon a new pet while this spell was in effect, and wouldn't get the full combat abilities of his pet, but instead a few modest buffs based on the element type he had become.  He could cast spells on himself that are otherwise castable only on his pet.  A merged mage should be far less powerful than a mage and pet combo, so it shouldn't upset the game balance.  It would, however, be 1) Fun! and 2) Allow the mage to be somewhat more usefull in situations where pets are forbidden by your teammates, as I understand happens on raids.  Not sure who originally suggested this idea, but I haven't seen it on this forum yet, and it would be very cool.<P>I like playing a Mage, and have no complaints about our general power level.  More fun spells would be nice, and I think such spells are more important than spells which would add to our combat power.  Thanks for reading my post!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea from before where you have a Sphere of Defense for the party.  From a game mechanics stand point it could act like the enchanter sentinel spell and process every 3 or 4 secs radiating from the caster and giving a 40-50 point damage absorption shield. So on average every few hits are reduced by 40-50 points of damamge.<P>At the highest levels damage dealing is not where it's at, efficeincy is all about damage prevention.  You cannot possibly just battle monsters down and expect to come out the winner from the down time perspective.  You need slows, mez, root, stun, and in some cases Fear or PBAE damage to lower damage on your party to managable amounts.  Parties who are effecient have this capability those that aren't don't have this ability.<P>Which is one of the reasons you don't take the magician when you can take another class that can slow, mez, root, or stun.  And from a damage absorption standpoint pets are great to hold off one monster for a short period of time.  And quickly become the worst enemy you can have in any given situation if there are more than 1 monster to keep locked up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>An interesting thread.  I'm responding to the summoning part and adding in my two cents on the mage class in general.<P>Summoned Items:<P>Mages don't need some summon armor spell, or even new weapon spells(though the current ones do suck).  What Mages are really in desperate need of is a purpose.  We need a role in groups that makes us more desired.  Currently the main reason someone groups with a Mage is because we(Mages) are capable of decent damage output(as long as you understand the class and how to use a pet properly).  Mages need something to fit in other than damage output!  <P>My idea on how to make Mages fit in is this...Add summoned items that make us backup utility in groups.  Some items that were mentioned - bind stones, one shot no drop lore improved invis ring, high lvl mod rod are going in the right direction, but we'd need a whole suite of these to accomplish Mage integration.  I don't want to take anything away from a already established class...I want to improve the Mage class so I don't have to be a group leader to get a seb group together(Or be 55 with CoH).  <P>Iproved Summoning spells-<P>First thing first, we need a zone pet summon spell.  When our pet runs away and is about to aggro 500 MOBs...Some 5 sec cast Summon wayward pet spell would rock.  I know this is a inherent risk of the class, but sometimes its just because pathing in some areas is so darn wacky.<P>Mages should have some CR spell...That would just be a huge improvement to our grouping abilities.  Someone mentioned a banish soul.  Which ports a person to their corpse.  This is a good idea, but just a way to avoid the obvious.  Mages should have a version of Summon corpse.  Its a summon spell and the thats what we Gatecallers do(erudite inside joke).  I know that this could offend some necros, but I was very surprised when SKs got this and not Mages.  Its a summons, ergo the class that summons as a specialty should have it.  Just my 2 cents.<P>Fire pet improvement, as if the xp at 52 wasn't punishment enough the fire pet really sucks.  The only time I have used this spell(other than testing it and finding out it really was sub par) was in CoM when I needed a pet immune to fire(and I can't tell u how happy I was to have it there).  <P>Misc. Spells-<P>If nothing else, you should consider a charmed summoned spell or two.  The reality is we'll never use them.  Mage's don't have the cha and if we are charming that means we don't have a pet...Which generally means one of three things...We just logged on, we're on a major raid where Pets aren't allowed, or we're about to zone/die(or in middle of chain casting).<P>Pet heals...What happened to this line?  Did you realize that we would rather chain summon than cast a heal spell on a pet?  The thing is, this could be a really handy thing to cast once on a pet so u could squeeze the most out of a buffed pet, rather than resummon a new unbuffed pet.  <P><BR>Anyway, thats my thoughts just off the top of my head.  I appreaciate Absor's interest in the Mage class.  I hope this leads to some improvement that makes our class desriable for some reason other than damage output.  Thanks.<P>Utari<BR>Battle Mage of Morell Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We all want weapon summons of various types for our pets, with different sorts of useful procs.<BR>I'd like to see a variety of weapon types.  Currently  we have a sword, a dagger, a spear and some staves.  I'd like to see 1h blunts, axes, 2h slashers that have a fairly significant impact on damage, there are lots of different ways you could go with this.<P>I would like to see some of the utility summons actually be utilized.  No one, including myself really, wants a bag that poofs on linkdeath.  Its too risky to put anything of value in them to even use.<P>I would like to see the illusory armor line (leather, chain, plate, etc) have a reagent change at plate...it is a royal pain to carry around massive stacks of cats eye.  I'd like to see this spell series become more expensive to cast, but castable on others...this solves the want to summon armor for other classes without worrying about textures and other things.  Or have the spell line with 2 versions, one for self, one for others, ie self leather at 12, others leather at 16, self chain at 29, others chain at 34, self plate at 39, others plate at 44, self armor at 52, others armor at 56.<P>I think a summoned stone you could put into a slot of a regular bag to reduce its weight is a sweet idea.  Solves many of the "bag" problems while retaining the desirable effect.<P>I'd like to see Gift of Xev food/water/bandages be permanent, instead of no rent at 4x the mana cost.<P>I'd like to see a spell similar to Call of Hero that works across zones, but requires something like a star ruby or similar gem that costs at least 50pp each.  I'd also like to see the current Call of Hero be a 53rd spell.  It is the single most desirable mage ability post 50, and having more mages with this ability would greatly assist our group friendliness.  I think it should be, as a class defining type spell, available through a quest instead of a random mob drop.<P>I would like to see more quests for spells.  Many of our current quests (many, not all) are for items that are inferior to what mobs drop as loot at those levels.  The only ones that have been worthwhile are the earthen boots and the focus items.<P>I would like to see the focus items obtained in the ro temple have an additional quest to upgrade them to where they work on the 50+ pets - not as good as a mastery stave, but still helps in the summon, and improves  the stats to a desirable level.<P>I also think that mages are shortchanged in 2 areas, when you look at other classes:<BR> mages should be able to charm summoned beings<BR> mages should be able to assume the form of an  elemental<P>I would also like to see our conjuration line of DD spells be harder to resist, similar to wizards resist reduction.  They are the specialists of evocation, and high level wizards casting evocation should be hard to resist.  similarly, mages are the specialists of conjuration, and their conjuration spells should be hard to resist.<BR>This would also make up somewhat in our lack of variety in attack spells, having to choose from magic or fire based only.<P>Boy, am I way off on a rant.  Heh...and the topic was what? oh summoned items-<BR>pet only weapons that "beat ass"<BR>instead of a summoned bag, a summoned object that reduces the weight of existing bags by an increasing percentage as you go higher in levels.<BR>This is a great idea if the code will allow it.<P>More items to give to pets that have effects, like the muzzle of mardu:<BR>damage shields, hastes, taunts, + to resists, etc.<BR>on items to give to pets.<P>Higher quality items to give to other players, without useless effects like flare:<BR>weight reduction<BR>damage shield (summon lavastone?)<BR>arrows with more damage and better range before quiver of marr<BR>a 55+ summon : gatestone that has 1 charge of gate, is uninterruptable, and uses something like a fire emerald as a component.<P>Essentially mages make something from nothing when they summon now.  Personally, I would rather create something from something else, and have it be both usefull and desirable to other players.  And I'm willing to fork over the plat to do it.  The other thing is having to get our class defining spells as random drops off of mobs I believe is somewhat unfair.  It forces the mage to hunt certain creatures in certain zones in order to obtain the spells he needs to operate AS a magician...not that he couldn't still function, but he has to camp for certain spells from certain mobs in order to maintain his abilities at the same level as his peers, and thats not right.<BR>But, I'm ranting again.  I'll stop now.<P>Akherat<BR>Elementalist on The Tribunal<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So, you're finally going to tackle the Magician issues..thanks for not forgetting us! Not that we'd let you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>There are a lot of good ideas here. Hm..let's see if I can remember some of mine.<P><BR>Upgrade to coldstone: allows ultravision and see invis.<P>Summon Magic Carpet: levitate that lasts until dispelled or you zone.<P>Summon Armor line: Summons a piece of armor. Magic, ac equivalent to leather. Higher versions of the spell summon better pieces. Your first version would summon gloves, next upgrade summons sleeves, then boots, then leggings, then breastplate for the final upgrade.<P>Wand of XXX: Wands with one or two charges of low to mid level mage offensive spells.<P>Line of pet only weapon summons: Weapon types can vary. Proc effects could range from DD spells, self buffs(fleeting fury, yaulp, str, AC, etc), attack debuffs, haste, stun, AE spells, life or mana drain, renew elements, target specific items(similar to ward summoned but against fire, ice, or magic).<P>New pet summons: <BR>Ice Elemental: medium level AC and hps, strong melee, weak defense. Ideas for it's spell ability would be a stun type spell or an ice based DD.<BR>Slime Elemental: low to medium level AC/hps, weak melee, casts snare/slow<BR>Lava Elemental: Basically an upgrade to the fire elemental(49th) but more hitpoints and better AC.<BR>Dust Devil: Sand based elemental. Similar to air elemental in abilties. Spell affect could be a DD spell or an attack debuff type spell.<BR>Poison Elemental: Similar stats to Air elemental. Spell is a poison DoT.<BR>Summon Efreet:60th level summons. Stats similar to a water ele of the same level. Good regen and damage. Spell abilities alternate between DD and stun.<P>Add to the line of ice based offensive spells. Icebolt, Rain of Ice, Shock of Cold, Icespike, etc. Maybe an ice-based damage shield too. I'd also like to see some air and earth based spells. Those are harder to do without infringing upon Druid spells while still coming up with something that isn't a repeat of previous spells. I really like the idea of a wind based damage absorption shield. Maybe have some AC self-buff spells based around the earth theme.<P>Voice graft: please?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Summon Snowball: Ranged item...no damage. Thrown at other players for fun.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Other ideas I liked...<BR>"4) Summon Lamp : Temporary storage for your pet when you zone or have to move around in dungeons.<BR> 7) Summon Fishing Pole + Bait<P>1) Change rain spells to 3 waves single target only.<P>-Ring of invis<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gawd that "summon zone" spell is such a great idea. Here is the reasoning.. We are not wizards. We dont have the arcane control over time and space manipulation that wizards do. What we ARE, are masters of elemental control. We have the power of the elements that we manifest and use. (Why we dont get ice spells I will never know) So why cant we ride a whirlwind or a firebolt to another zone? Not having the power of the wizards, we will never be able to teleport others around, we simply cant. But, similar to how some of the velious "zone gates" work, you would have to do a quest in a zone, for EACH zone with a portal, or maybe just city zones, upon completion of the zone, you would receive a soulbound "key" or "marker". Later, you would have to purchase the spell, which would summon you BACK to that marker. This is not unbalancing for the wizards and druids because we dont get evacs and we cant port others... all we would be doing is yanking ourselves back to an item we placed on the ground, in, say, the Mage guild in Felwithe or Neriak. And its not like we need to have one in every city, myabe just having one or two on each continent would suffice, like on in Qeynos and on is Freeport. Or, I dunno, we could just borrow the wizzy portals, I mean, we are lesser wizard types, right? Its kinda like using someone else's airport runway. Look at it this way: with more classes now able to cast most of our summons which for so long were a unique marker of the magician class, why can't we learn the discliples and abilities of other classes as well? Im not asking to be upgraded to wizards... hell no  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I love my magician.. Im just asking that we be empowered a bit, in one of the areas where we hurt the most. I think the summons mentioned here are all fabulous. We can count on maybe 2  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I think that we should be left out of the planes. We dont want to go to the planes, that the wizard's job. And its not a pleasant job... I for one dont want it. I think the idea of Summon : North Karana or Summon : Faydark is what would get my vote. The ability to Regroup is also very imaginitive. It is a unique ability and would allow the group to get back together after the wizard had sent them all to hell  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Please forgive the run on nature of this post. <P>Nightshade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ROFL Kinderblood, you hit the nail right on the nose, and spoken like one who has suffered through all the nerfs, broken spells, and non-existant drops "working as intended".  The sad thing is that I feel a strong sense of forboding concerning this thread, as it really makes me wonder if the more serious and existing mage problems will be addressed, namely:<P>1)broken post 50 fire pet<BR>2) broken Dyzil proc doing the reverse of what its supposed to<BR>3) useless mage dots<BR>4) broken 54 water pet drop<BR>5) pets not included in grp dmg shield<BR>6) Lack of epic encounter usefulness. Pet gets feared asap and nukes resisted. Pathing forbids pets in many places.<P>We were asked for our input on these items in a previous thread by Absor, told he'd get back to us, and we have not heard an update since.  This was almost two months ago, and not even an update.  Now we have this thread asking what summons we might want, with no "promises" attached.  This is fine, but who else feels that we might end up with a few new summons like 8/32 1hs with a few +'s, or other semi useless item? Something "additive" yet ads little or no value to the class?<P>I dunno, and again I may be a bit too cynical-- but with EQ, RoK, and Velious Verant has shown over and over again that they do not want our summons to ever be useful, at least not on a level that would benefit other players (mod rod being the exception).  I mean, look at Shard of the Core the new velious summon, a rock that has +15poison and cold resists--NO DROP.  IMHO, mildly useful on a personal level at best, so why bother with the NODROP?  Whatever Verants rationale, they have shown that our summons shouldnt be benificial.  Too bad considering EQ being out so long, worlds are filled with 50+ and lvl 10 warrior twinks in full crafted wielding lamentations, usually being powerlevelled by a 50+ druid.  Anyways, I think you get my point.<P>Oh yeah,<P>/auction WTB lvl 54 water pet<BR>Soandso says out of character "me too"<BR>Soandso_01 says out of character "I'll Pay more!"<P>Absor do you realize that this pet drop was promised to be fixed 4 months ago??

You yourself said you'd look into it... 85% of 54-60 mages dont have this pet it drops so rarely, which leaves us with 2 pets to choose from, earth and air.  Fire is broken, and water doesnt drop.

</FONT><HR>I realize that we wont be getting anything like a summoned rod of summon corpse or staff of the ice comet, but how about making our current summons more useful. Like turning summoned bags into no-drop normal weight bages when you go LD. <P>You could change the summon food and drink spells to summon one item that does both. Something like gruel or whatever. I'm sure you can think of something better to call it. That way it would only take up one inventory slot and monks would like it to because it would weight less to just carry one item. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played a mage for about a year and a half.<P>Here are my reasonable suggestions:<P>Weapon that procs stun<BR>Weapon that procs undead DD<BR>Weapon that procs regular DD (low low level).  Even those velium weapons are nice, to be able to summon something like that would be nice.<BR>Fix the bag poofing.  Yes, your bags stay if you go LD zoning, for infinite time.  Yet in regular LD they poof.  Something needs to be done, I dont care what, so they stay.<BR>A better mana regen summon.  Like mod rod with no HP loss.  Or something that lets you gain even +2 to mana regen constant.  We currently are the ONLY int caster class without mana regen ability.<BR>More charge levi rings<BR>Single charge invis ring<BR>Armor<BR>Voice graft<BR>Make shard of the core droppable.<P>Not so reasonable:<P>Bind stones<BR>Gate stones<BR>Port stones<BR>Large DD proc weapon (put a level restriction on it, or no drop, so its pet only)<BR>More no drop pet effect items (anything)<P>I probally have more, but thats all I can think of right now.<P>Fix spell drops (except 54 water), fix the fire pets, fix the drop or change the drop on the earth elemental mastery staff, give us our pet procing back (I almost never see them proc now).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sheesh this is deep in this thread.. but *shrug*<P>I've been playing a Magician for nearly 2 years now and I have a few off the wall requests, not necessarily focussed on new summons, but I'll throw them out there for you to peruse.<P>Number 1:  One of the biggest annoyances my Party members claim when grouped with me is it's so difficult for them to target my pet for buffing/healing, etc..  With the UI, I can tap F1 twice to target my pet.  It would be EXTREMELY helpfull if my party members could do something similar (ie, if I'm the 2nd group member, my groupmate could tap f2 twice to target my pet)<P>Number 2: Advances in the Healing line for our pets.<P>Number 3: A lot of people have requested that we recieve upper level versions of our existing utility spells like Ring of Flight and waterstone. Not sure if this is possible in the game engine, but what about the idea of making the number of charges in an item go up depending on the level of the caster ?  (ie a lvl 60 mage would summon a Ring of Flight with 6 charges of lev)<P>Number 4: A charm summoned spell.  Druids can charm animals, necros charm undead, chanters can charm well.. anything..  with the advent of a LOT of new summoned mobs in the game, this spell would be quite usefull under specific circumstances.<P>Number 5: I really like the Call of the mob idea, but I can see some major abuse issues with it.  Perhaps if we made it a short range cast (same as DD range), and had it aggro surrounding mobs just as if we had cast an offensive spell.<P>*shrug*<P>--<BR>Taji Shokuma &lt;Dominium&gt;<BR>49th Mage of Innoruuk<BR>E'ci Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I saw this in one of the posts up there: "Mages don't need some summon armor spell" I have one thing to say about it: what are you thinking!?!?!? that's the best idea we've got here!!!<BR>Common, say it with me; ar-mor! ar-mor! ar-mor! ar-mor! ar-mor! ok, I'm done....<P>The other thing that just came to me-<BR>Well, all of us have been going on about our 2hb charged summons, and how much other stuff we want to be put on them.  Well how about this- Staff of specialization (conj, evo, ect.).  Adds maybe 25-50 in specialization of specified type...  Not as thouroughly unblancing as Ice-Comet popcicles in 14 different fun-fruity flavors for each class, but at the same time not as totally useless as 20stone logs with one charge of eye-tickler (not saying staff of symbols isn't good, it's just not hugely in demand)  The other thing is that it would be something no other class could do, like clarity, summon corpse or Cheal... and lemme tell you, bumping my spec evo up to 75 in velious would be very welcome- we're talkin big mana cost here, pet-sized so it's something that players would have to offer the mage something in exchange (like a nice spot in a group, oh hope, oh hope)and of course all that magical, norent, lore stuff... make it so you have to wield to get the effect, and if your worried about level 1's with specialization, slap a negative hp component on there on the order of 150 or so, so that you'd be suicidal to try it before you were about the right level for specialization anyway, although that's one to think twice about now, I'm seeing fields upon fields of highly specialized level 1 corpses....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about a summon root stone (or whatever) spell?  Item is no drop, no rent, lore, has 1 or 2 charges of a form of root.  The root could be a lower level root spell.  The casting time for summoning this item could be fairly long so that the effectiveness of the spell is reduced during battle.  I'd really like to have some kind of spells that would help mages a little in case pet dies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050224-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050224.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050224-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050224-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050224-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050224-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050224&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050224&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
