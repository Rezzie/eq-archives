You see, the nice things about monks was that before weapons, monks were reasonably untwinkable and kept the Doods, trolls, and kiddiez out of the class.<P>Anyway.****<P>If you were a low level and a KD, fungi tunic, fbss and a SoS were easily available to you, would you get them?<P>I think we were given weapons because of skill cap limits? So if we want to continue to dish out damage with warriors and rogues, we need them.<P>I wouldn't create a monk if I HAD to start over. I'd create a rogue so I could do the most amount of damage in a group setting. Which is what I thought I would be getting when I chose a monk. What class would you create if you could start over?<P>Don't know doodz, trolls, and kiddiez man, lets all get along, we're all in this together.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fantastic post from Hydar on page 3. It is shocking to see the relative degradation of a Monk's offensive and defensive power in the post-50 levels.<P>His argument for another defensive skill (similar to Block/Dodge) and another offensive skill (Triple Attack as a skill at 51?) is persuasive.<P>But of course, this is not the only problem. Norrath has become flooded with cheap, extremely good, weapons and armour which have trickled down from the higher to the lower-level populace. Unfortunately good Monk equipment is relatively rare compared with other class items, and the prices still prohibitive.<P>I'm level 41 and there is no way that I could afford a Wu's Trance Stick. I bet that I could buy a nice Warrior weapon though, or a full set of Ry`Gorr armor though. Are good Monk drops just a little too rare?<P>Make us formidible martial artists again, please. Don't necessarily give this to us for free. I personally like the idea of level-limited quests for improved hand-to-hand damage.<P>Isketh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Isketh,<P>   Honestly your being a little unfair.  Wu sticks arent impossible to save up and buy for.  I started my iksar 2nd day of kunark and before that had only a level 20 warrior with only one piece of bronze on him (the rest was banded if i was lucky).  I worked my butt off saving for items to buy, or id go camp them.  I saved up and bought some wu sticks after much work, and im not a powergamer.<P>Granted, though most weapons are extream in price range considering that most monks typically dont have more then 20pp on them at any time.<P>Azith</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Havn't seen a post from Absor since early in Part Three....<P>Absor, please re-look over the monk posts....yeah I know you're busy with the other class threads but you've missed the whole point of the monk threads. <P>You've added items to your list like 'throwing masters' which most monks think is rediculous. You've also said that you don't believe monks should outdamage warriors....then what is our role? If we can't outdamage warriors and our hps are around half that of warriors, our defence skills are almost identicle (only advantage in dodge) and our offense is so close its negligble, then what the hell is our roll?<P>Verant has said time and time again that their vision for the monk was 'the best melee damage class in the game', then after the update to the rogue they changed that to 'the best toe-to-toe damage class in the game'. Now with our best equipment (CF or TS) we're being matched so closely by warriors and rogues in toe-to-toe damage we now have no advantage in any area. Warriors have great offense/exception staying power, Rogues have exceptional offense/good staying power (espeacially with evade), Monks have great offense, good staying power.<P>Now we're at least matched by both classes in both areas and drop well behind in the other classes specialty area. Theres been two posts in this thread alone showing the skill levels in offense and defence (one even showing the relative skill increase pre/post kunark). Look at them, then come back to us monks and try to tell us something isn't wrong. I still remember when the monks complained when they say the level of increase and Verant stated then it was due to a hardcap on the 8bit values used to store the skill levels that they couldn't increase the monk skills anymore. Problem was, they didn't give us anything to compensate us back then and just left us to fume...<P>This is a balance issue between the purely melee classes, warriors are the kings of tanking, rogues the kings of damage dealing....problem is, monks aren't even inbetween these 2 classes in both areas...so how the hell is that balanced?? And before you say monks have other skills to make up for this, so do warriors and rogues....warriors get critical/crippling hits, bash, taunt etc (i.e. tanking skills) and triple attack, rogues get pick lock, pick pockets, find/remove traps, evade (i.e. rogueish skills) and double backstab etc...monks get feign death, mend and bind wounds 70%. People may say they'd swap their skill line for the monks anyday, but remember they choose a warrior and rogue for their type of class, a warrior for tanking, a rogue for being a thief/assasin type.<P>Monks have missed out on relative skill advances since Kunark, had our advantage in damage dealing replaced by rogues and matched by warriors, given weight reduction as a payoff for warriors getting triple attack and rogues double backstab....what do we have to expect in the future?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Monks need a damage increase relative to that warriors and rogues got between 50 and 60, which they have not yet received.  That, and feign death needs to work something like evade even if the mob doesn't "buy" it.<P>  Ways to increase damage:  Offhand damage bonus, say, half of the onhand one.  So by 60, 6 points would be added to the offhand, making the ambidextrous (dual wield at level 1) monk decent with both hands, and not completely dependant on his onhand for damage.<P>  Way 2: (less favourable) string together specials, at least one hand/one foot special, allowing a bit of extra damage.  And around 50, start introducing decent effects added to some or all the specials, ie stun, knockback, critical hit, etc.<P>  Vage Duskbringer<BR>44 monk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, i think what you are doing is great, but we could really use some feedback from you, like how these ideas sound to u, and what Verants idea of the monk should be, otherwise we are just running in circles . . .<P>To the people worried about twinks . . .<BR>First of all, a monk cant use the epic unless he is lvl 45, so there.  Now what i really wanted to say about twinking is this, if someone has the power to twink, they should be able to do so.  I realize that many people say "hey i had to work hard for that, its not fair!"  well, lifes not fair.  Just pretend they come from a wealthy family.  Its an RPG anyway.  =P And if anything, I feel some of the spawn times should be reduced.  I camped befallen, of all the godforsaken places for 8 straight hours, and didnt see the priest to get ONE of the items necessary for the red sash, an item that is a POS anyway.  And raster is even worse!  I personally dont pay money to sit around and wait, and i cant do some of the fun stuff unless i get that out of the way.<P>Ok, sorry, i know this isnt a twinking msg board, but i felt that needed to be said since so many others seem to be flooding this board with twinking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a request in terms of monk armor choices.<P>A few Velious items would be ideal for monks, but as it stands they are not monk usable and the stats arent desirable for the classes that can wear the item.<P>Boots from Lodizal the turtle...they are 14ac and .1 weight...usable by all melee type classes EXCEPT monks.  Considering the level of the encounter and the items said melee classes currently own, it essentially religates this item to the realm of twinking (Since they all have boots available to them at higher ac and they dont have weight issues).  I think it to be only fair to allow monks to use this item, especially considering it is extremely hard to find a good pair of high level shoes that weigh less than 2 pounds.<P>Ice shackle quest: The resulting item is a low weight 10 ac bracer that is not monk usable.  Considering Iksar monks wear shackles, it makes no sense why this is not monk usable.  Once again, the classes who can use this item dont since they all have superior ac bracers available to them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love playing my monk, he's mid lvl and I'm a high lvl enchanter primarily.  I chose monk because I thought warrior would be a test in banging my head against the wall.<P>Personally I have nearly mastered 3 completely different styles of martial arts: Jujutsu, Aikido, Ishin Ryu and Ju Ko Ryu Karate in real life.  I have casually studied Chinese and Japanese history and martial art history as well as the myths, legends and fantasies of martial artists.  So my post will be from a classical or fantastical stand point.<P>Historically monks were the holy, healing, knowledgable men who honed their body and MIND to perfection.  Harmonizing with both.  In the fantasy world the monk is capable of doing things with his body that others could only gape at.<P>Mind - a monk has a plethora of knowledge of herbs, cooking, baking, wine making, chyropractasy, pressure points, accupuncture and a slew of psychic abilities.  This is completely lost in this game.<P>Skill - monks, likes ninjas, were able to use anything as a weapon.  And unlike the ninja, the monk was allegedgly better with anything in his hand than the specialist practicioner.  NOT, because he had better skill in the particular item, but because his skill was almost as good AND he had such an utter complete comprehension of movement and combat that would daunt and specialist.  This is not even considered in this game.<P>Body - the monk was able to take damage while in combat that would drop another man.  the monk was able to avoid all manner of attack while in combat with little or no effort.  the monk was able to take combat injury and store it for succumbing to it after combat, not so unlike berzerkers (mind over matter realy).  Corpus and skills were honed to utter precision coupled with mind to make a formidable foe.  Realize this, in China, it was the monks that rebelled against the Japanese invasion and were somewhat successful. The population at large was daunted by the imperial might of the Japanese.  It took the entire Japanese occupation troops to destroy the monk uprising.  Monks - vs - Warriors.  Feign death has always been a monk guru skill, along with poison resistance and toxin resistance in general.<P>EQ weaknesses - low AC, low HP, weight penalty, before the patch I guess also the x.p. penalty, No spell ability, limited equipment use in general, limited weapon use in general. My god that is a lot of weaknesses to say that the class has very little in the way of specialty or distinction.  It is not enough to say monks can fight with their hands, as well as weapons, there has to be some compensation for the tremendous weaknesses you have imposed on the class.  There is no comparison between a monk and a warrior: the ac, hp, equipment, weight allowance, and weaponry.  Monks should so outstripp the other melee classes in sheer martial ability it should be readily apparent.  You (Verant) must ask yourselves what would attrack a player to this class.  Yeah I like the class because of the oriental connection it has, but that only goes so far.  You not only need to balance the class versus other classes but you have to balance the class versus the heavy penalties you have imposed on it.  My goodness I can't imagine the tuning team thought the level of skills were an adequate recompense for the penalties.  <P>There should be no reason monks should be able to stun, knock off certain attack skills, trip, be the masters of martial combat in general and have resistances to boot.  I know you have team members who play every class but as an every day player the lack of magic is a HEFTY penalty all by itself.  It seems Warrior and rogue have been quite adequately compensated just on this factor alone, they don't even come close to the other limitations inherent in the monk class.<P>These are general things you should think about when applying Bodi's (i think that's his name) suggestions and mine.<P>TTFN</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I really recommend that you consider Bodi's post very carefully, from what I've seen it is directly on target. I personally haven't broken 50 with my Monk yet, so I can't offer insight into the high end problems, so I'd like to offer you a suggestion that will not make much of a balance change but it WILL make Monks a great deal more fun to play  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Our multitude of special attacks are currently all linked together. When one is used, the others cannot be used until the timer expires. I felt a little cheated when levelling because each skill I'd worked so hard to master was once again useless and I had to start over with the new skill from scratch.<P>These attacks don't do that much damage. I don't have any hard numbers for you but the average in this list is what I remember. I haven't used any but Flying Kick since 30th, the majority of my career.<P>Kick, Level 1, Cap 250, Avg Damage 10<BR>Round Kick, Level 5, Cap 225 Avg Damage 15<BR>Tiger Claw, Level 10, Cap 225 Avg Damage 25<BR>Eagle Strike, Level 20, Cap 225, Avg Damage 35<BR>Dragon Punch, Level 25, Cap 225, Avg Damage 45<BR>Flying Kick, Level 30, Cap 225, Avg Damage 50<P>All of these have a delay that is 30-50. Tiger Claw is a tad faster, I think Flying Kick is the slowest. Iksar get Tail Rake in place of Tiger Claw but I think it is the same ability just with a different name.<P>My suggestion is that you unlink the attacks and let use them individually. This means that I have 6 buttons to click for each fighting round, or one to script them with, but even so just having the use of those skills that nobody uses anymore would be a lot of fun and I wouldn't feel like 5 of my class skills were wasted and useless.<P>Someone suggested linking up combo hits but that sounds like a coding nightmare. I suspect it would be far easier to just unlink them. Instill Doubt is somehow tangled up in them as well in a way that I think nobody really understands.<P>This also gives the lower level Monks a bit more resources to draw on since they cannot get the Uber-Gear that Verant has used to fix our balance issues in the past. It will give us a little more damage output, probably about the same increase we would get if you put a minimum cap on flying kick, but now we would attain it gradually and it would be tied into skils that we'd have to work to master.<P>This will also get more buy-in to the notion of "masters of unarmed combat" since all of these skills are innate and have nothing to do with weapons. It will make those of us who roleplay Monks much happier.<P>Honestly, what good are the skills if we never use them again? Some of our fighting disciplines are tied into them but from the previous posts I get the impression that most of them are poorly implemented since the others are complaining about their lack of damage. There is no incentive to raise them up. Mine are still exactly where they were when I got the next highest one on the chain and I have no intentions of ever raising them up again, sicne there is no benefit whatsoever in doing so.<P>Please consider fixing the way Feign Death works as well, I think every Monk that exists can attest to how mangled and unreliable it became after the nerf. If you make it work perfectly but only if a Monk's health is below 20% it will be useful again, and your fix to Feign Pulling will still be viable since no Monk in his right mind goes out to pull with 20% of his hit points.<P>Thanks very much for having these talks. Please really look at the class before you decide what to do. Statements like "masters of throwing" get me worried since no Monk would ever think that... throwing is only good for pulling from a few feet away. Nobody uses it for damage. I've never once hit for more than 10hp damage with my throwing.<P>By the way, Monks are easily the Most fun class to play  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I've tried most of them to 20th level.<P>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>Servant of the Tranquil<BR>45 Monk, Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a 32 monk and hey I guess I'm not high enough to see or worry about the dmg ideas, but the group FD crap is annoying. Only real thing I want to say is why is the RotLC so hard to get? It is meant for monks level 35 right? (or so I've heard) But monks in my guild at level 46 and 52 haven't gotten it. There are almost no chest pieces monks would use at level 32. Theres LJ Vest, Foremans Tunic, Crystal covered shroud, Cresent Gi(lets be realistic, the magority won't have fungi tunic or black panterskin). 4 choices...I play only a few hours a week. The RotLC quest is impossible for many in my position. The quest requires huge huge camps of Raster of Guk in Lguk (as all of you know it takes 100 or so hours average) who can't be killed at level 32 w/out a group. Most would laugh at that thought, a level 32 monk getting a group in a crap room. The room is usually held by some 50 monk. Almost same with Targin the Rock. According to a lot of friends and "reports" it takes average of level 48 to hold the room, barely at that. It also takes a whole hord of time. Have you ever tried to convince a group to head to that crap location so you can get one item. Hah. I'm stuck with CSS or stupid LJ Vest for the AC. I've even tried to get the guild to kill Bro Qwinn (hehe, can you figure what they replied? [it was no, lol]) The Crafted Quest (all combined, takes 1/10 of the RolTC quest, and can be sold for money!) is easier to do and warriors get much much more viaration in armor. Is there anyway the quest can be changed or some other quest can come out. (that Sytrakk Hide Vest(sp?) can be a quest???) Please consider this idea. (If this idea was posted I am truly sorry I just don't have much time to read posts, besides Bodi's extremely popular post) =/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On an old MUD I use to play back in the day, they had an interesting system that I liked, not sure how well it could be implemented in EQ though. <P>Basically, by doing long and involved quests, you could learn new skills called Fighting Stances. In short, you would set which stance you would use, and whenever you attacked, you'd always be in that stance 'till you switched over to a different one. Every stance would have a different quest, and they would have different effects on your fighting style. There was a Tiger Stance, which would double your damage output, but it would also cause you to take twice as much damage. There was a Crane Stance, which caused you  to dodge almost every attack, but when you did get hit, it hurt. There were a bunch of other stances, but you probably already have the basic idea. Once you learned all the stances, Dragon Stance became available to you on the MUD, that would probably be a bit too powerful on EQ though, basically gave you all the benefiets of the other stances with no penalty.<P>Seems like this could work the same way that disciplines do. Fighting Stances do seem somewhat monkly. Would have to make obtaining 'em a bit easier than they were on the MUD I played though, otherwise very few people would ever get 'em. Just a thought I had, haven't bothered to think it over for...negative effects.

</FONT><HR>Well if I can figure out how to do this...I left a post outside of here. Basicly, I said that I agree with Bodi. I do have another concern. Why do Agility and Dexterity not work like they are defined? Going by the definition, and applying it to an RPG, one would think Agility makes you harder to hit and Dexterity would allow you to connect more (hand to eye coordination). As far as all the I want this I want that, I really dont care. I will play my Monk no matter what, but I would like to see some of the basic things change as per Bodi's post.<P>Thank you again.<P>Gethan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think much has been said about increasing the damage for monks in some way, but I would like to say something about the Monk epic quest.<P>First you have to have the robe of the Whistiling fist, a nice uber robe for high level monks, which takes Huge amounts of time to get.  This is surrendered just after the quest begins.  <P>So in order to basically start the quest, you have to aquire a red Sash, and a purple headband, each which takes around 40-50 hours to get, and you have to camp several different spawns with HUGE spawn timers.  Also the spawns are very difficult to kill, without a group, and not many groups would want to camp for their entire weekend just to help get this monk his robe of the whistling fist.  And if you want to have a robe of the whistling fist after you complete the epic quest, you have to go through this ordeal all over again.  So you have to get the red sash and purple headband 3 times if you want to have those as well after the second robe of the whistling fist you obtain.  So just obtaining your sashes and headbands you are looking at up to 300 hours of camping.  Plus the time to get the robe itself twice, and this is just what you need to start the epic quest, and to get another robe, and replace your headbands.  <P>Also if you compare this quest to epic quests of other classes, you will notice the abiguity of the instructions you are given.  First to start it you need to find the book of immortals only dropped in skyfire, and give that to an erudite in erudin's library.  the only clue you get is, tomekeeper dahl telling you that he will pay you for a rare find.  Then after you hand this in he gives you a letter of recomendation for lheao, who lives near an ocean somewhere. Somewhere? there are 3 different 'oceans' All are HUGE!!! plus he says NEAR an ocean.  not exactly on it.  So that could be 1-2 zone away from an ocean, which is about 1/3 of norrath.  And he is in Timmerous deep WAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay out in the middle of no where, behind a wall of rock that must be swam under.  Plus when you get to him, and give him your letter of recomendation he says Well, I can't give you this book unless you give me proof that you are a master.  Well here is where the robe of the whistling fist comes in.  Kiss it goodbye, and curse yourself to another week of work getting a new one... then he gives you the book you need, and all he says about it is "don't let it fall into the wrong hands"  Well? where are you suppose to go now? what the hell are you suppose to do!?!? not only have your hints been very Flakey before this, but now, no guidence, no nothing.  Just here you go.  use it well, ect.  I really have to take a moment and Commend the Pioneers of the monk Epic.  The ones that really went through the toil and trouble, and sacrificed their robes of the whistling fist just to try.  That takes alot of guts.  Well, the quest doesn't get any easier to follow, I suggest all monks looking to do the epic quest, get a VERY detailed walkthrough before hand.<P>There are Many monk quests similar to this.  No guidence and HUGE spawn times.  If you look at other epic quests, for instance the wizard, and mage epics, they are far eaisier to follow. In fact in comparison I'd say that they could be likened to a complete walkthrough with NPC loc's and statistics.  <P>My sugestion is if you are looking for balance in the classes then look to all aspects, not just the hack and slash.  A Little more guidence from NPC's would be desireable, like maybe a mention about WHICH book Dahl wants, or WHICH ocean you should even start looking for, and some indication that your robe is required to get the book you need.  And further guidence throughout the quest, and all monk quests.  Also Lower spawn times.  Things that spawn once a real life day and have something you need dropped as a rare dropped is not fair when in 8 hours of playing you see quillmane(mage epic item drop), in South Karana, 3-4 times in an 8 hour period.  Plus If you look at the other classes epics, you don't see them giving up some of their best items just to start their epic quests.<P>My 2 cents.  Hack and slash isn't what EQ is about, at least not in my book.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the notion that Monks need to see an increase in skill/damage to maintain their role in the world.  I also like the idea that a Monk's fists should be his/her ultimate weapon.  The question is, how do we boost fists without going overboard on monks with weapons?<P>Triple attack would be nice, however weapons would still out damage fists, so we would still use them.<P>Unlinking the "strikes" from the "kicks" in our special attacks would be nice (being able to Flying Kick follwed by a Dragon Punch).  Again, this doesn't change the weapon to fist debate.<P>A raw increase in the dam/delay of fists may be required.  Non-monks would complain that we wouldn't need to worry about acquiring weapons like warrior, but isn't that part of the reason we give up on AC/HP?<P>One idea that I like would be fist enhancing weapons, for example Brass Knuckles.  These "weapons" would use the h2h skil for dam/delay but would add the ability to proc an effect.  For example, the "Knuckles of Frost" would proc a cold based DD spell.<P>There could be a few lines of these weapons that are questable, much like the sashes/headbands.  Place a Master of Frost up in Perma and have him give out quests of varying skill.  The first quest yields knuckles that have a 20 point cold based DD that starts at level 25 (or whatever).  The second quest results in knuckles that do a 40 point DD, etc...  By creating a fire, cold, and stun based line of knuckles, Monks would gain in strength based on the H2H table, but could choose a proc based on situation.  Against a caster? take out the "Knuckles of Dazing" (stun proc).  Going against fire-weak creatures? take out the "Ton Po's Flaming Knuckles".<P>And since the knuckles only add in a proc at a certain level and do nothing for base damage, they are worthless as a twink item (although I would still make them No Drop)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heya Folks, lots of good ideas floating around here for sling some of our issues.  But I'd like to toss out a sugestion...<P>As many have pointed out (and I will not reiterate the reasons why) our damage in the post 50 world is no longer of the same comparative rank as it was previously.<P>To deal with that we have seen a lot of suggestions for increasing our damage output.  But here's a different though on the "how".<P>Instead of changing our hand to hand damage delays (and again, the monks realy want hand to hand, ot staves, as was also pointed out too many times to mention) use gloves and boots.<P>The epic wepons shows that coding does exist to tie a change in hand to hand stats to a pair of worn gloves.  This is our godsend.<P>Take a look at the various monk gloves that exist in game from wu's gauntlets to crescent, to shiverback to the many flavors of Velious armor.  Each of these could have a similar effect on our stats.  <P>Picture a world where monks work to increase their powers in hand to hand combat by attaining bigger better gloves.  It would keep monks with a focus on going to dungeons and doing things and yet not bind us to StaffQuest. <P>A similar effect could also be reached for boots.  The boots could enable our kicks to increae in damage and abilities so that the top notch ones yielded faster kicks, stronger kicks and with stun.<P>ALong with these quipment changes, please also look at the issue of our armor not having effects.  It's a slight to us that of teh melee classes, we alone have entire sets of armor that simply have no effects (even small ones) where othesr get robust, entertaining and helpful effects.  Would giving monks summon water, food, shirukens and bandages on our high level armor actually unbalance anything?  Think about it.   Is our going to town half as often a detriment?<P>Thanks for listening.  Good luck everyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-Higer H2H damage at 60.  16/24 i hear.<BR>-Give us the parry skill<BR>-Give us triple attack skill at 35 and make it TRAINABLE. Give to rangers too<BR>-move riposte down to 30<BR>-Apply damage bonus to offhand<BR>-Make FD work like its supposed to. A complete aggro wipe on anything under lvl 50 when it works (not level 35). Its stupid to get up and feign multiple times just to get the mob to leave you alone. Take a look at it from the Mobs perspective. Hey he got up! lets get him! oh he died. Hey he got up again! lets get him! oh he died. Hey he got up again! Lets get him! oh he died again.<P>-Give us a haste discipline at 30.<P>That is all for now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And also do the same for warriors and Rogues?<P>This would make it much easier to convince Verant that something really has to be done here.<P>How much damage ye guys doing at 50,55,60? 30-40-60 dam/sec? I know rogues do 80ish comfortably.

</FONT><HR>The only problem with your suggestion Greyson is that the epic is a glove.  This means that either A) That is the best we could ever get (which doesn't stack up against Warrior weapons) or B) we get a new set of gloves in which case our epic is worthless.  Neither alternative is pretty.<P>That's why I suggested the fist enhancing weapons, the knuckles.  They would "stack" with our epic weapon, so it keeps its place as our best pair of gloves, but it increases our range of power.<P>One thing I forgot was that the knuckles would count as a 2 handed weapon in terms of using both slots, so you couldn't use a "Knuckle of Dazing" on the right and "Ton Po's Flaming Knuckle" on the left.<P>I do like the idea of creating boots that increase the power of kicks.  I don't know if speed would be mutable (since flying kick has a set duration), but increase the damage and/or adding a proc would be great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055101&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055101&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
