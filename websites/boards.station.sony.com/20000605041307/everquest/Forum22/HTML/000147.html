</FONT><HR>Just wanted to share my view about Povar...<P>I've been playing Povar for about a week now. I'm here mainly because a good friend of mine invited me to play this server (I was a bit frustrated with AC because of lag).<P>Anyway, in my week's time, I've achieved the level of 17. In my travels, I've met several very nice people that helped me out all over the place, this includes:<P>Direstraits (he deserves an award, actually spends hours helping out newbies)<BR>Nost<BR>Yosefix<BR>Telelial<BR>Traviesa<BR>Zurp<P>And many others that I can't quite recall...<P>There has also been bad experiences. Here's a short story on what I believe to be the worst encounter I've ever had in any MMORPG...<P>This happened a couple days ago, in Oasis. I see a high elf walking backwards from a Ghoul. Thinking he was in need of assistance, I proceed to run after them and attack the ghoul with my pet. A few seconds later, a halfling rogue named Traviesa assists me with the ghoul as well. Then the high elf sez "he's mine" and kills the ghoul with one spell.<P>Now I'm a bit confused. He stands there, and before I could say a thing, challenges me to a duel.<P>It turns out this high elf, by the name of Liquidslow, was some high leveler in the 2nd most powerful guild named Harmonium. He was "twinking" some wizard type named Milven in the Oasis. <P>I of course reject his duel. He then gets his friend Milven to harass me as well (lots of name calling, you *****, you wimp, etc etc). <P>If this wasn't enough, seconds later, Liquidslow tries to train me with a Spectre. Thankfully I had a sow from someone earlier and proceeded to run around the pillar near the docks. Three laps around the pillar later, Liquidslow gives up and leads the Spectre to nro zone.<P>All that over a friggin Ghoul and a misunderstanding?!? Someone please tell me what I did wrong here! Am I supposed to bow down and kiss his butt because he's in Harmonium?!? Am I on the wrong side of the street?!? What?!?<P>Anyway, that about sums up my experiences on Povar thus far. There are a lot of nice people here, but its the black sheeps such as Liquidslow that's giving this server a bad name...<P>I can't wait until they split the server...<P>-Kenoshi the Wanderer<BR>Messenger of Death<P>"Death has no prejudices.

</FONT><HR>Hail Kenoshi!<BR>Unfortunately, this kind of thing Does happen.  Not too Often, but it does happen.  Usually before assisting people, I ask em if they need help, Unless I obviously see that they are losing the fight.  In which case I attempt to pull the mob off of em, or Heal the person in question.  What you did was not wrong.  How they responded was.  Misunderstandings happen all the time, and a person should be given a chance to explain, not accosted.<BR>Speak to the guilds Leader and explain what happened.  What Liquidslow did was very dishonorable, and if the guild does not promote that kind of behavior, then something will be done about it.  <BR>I had a similar Experience in Gfay.  <P>My friends and I had all created new characters and we were leveling them together.  We decided to hunt the Bandits in Gfay.  We get to the Camp, and we see a 20th wizzie and 14 paly there. (forget Names).  We ask to make sure that they arent hunting the Bandits, they reply... go for it. So we start killing Bandits.  Then after a bandit pops the wizzie kills it one Shot.  Then the Next Bandit Pops and the Paly kills it in 2 or 3 swings.  Leaves us one bandit...  Understand we are grouped at about 5th level, Crushbone Was overcamped, and these spawns were free.  <BR>We asked them if they were even getting Experience froim em (of course not, they went green to my Paly at 12th level).  they didnt even reply.  When they Repeated this behavior, We asked them if it might be possible for them to please let us have the spawns as they are obviously not gettting Exp from em, and we could use the Exp.  The Paladin then turns and does a Slap Emote on my Friends character and Challenges him to a duel...  an 14th Paly Challenges a 5th level Wizzie to a duel.  My Friend Declines of Course, and Asks why she did that.  She then begins to insult him Repeatedly, trying to Provoke him into a duel, or to convince us to leave.  She keeps this up until we finally threatened to petition a GM. Then they left.  I forget the Characters name, and their Guild.  but it was definately one of the Worst experiences I had.  <BR>However I have had so many Positive Experiences, that I dont worry about it.  There are any number of Good People on Povar, and Several bad ones, but I believe this exists on all servers..<P>Don't Waorry you arent alone out there.  <BR>Team up with me sometime, and we'll go smite Stuff!<BR>hehe<BR>Kaledin Stoneforge <BR>22nd Paly of Brell<BR>Vigil Knights<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is typical of, what I would guess any server. I too have seen some ppl in trouble and asked repetedly if they need help. If it looks like there in it bad I send the pet in, and sometimes I get Bit**ed out. Then somtimes I see someone I trouble ask them three or four times get no reply only to see there corpse minutes later. Sometimes I get ******* about this. It often times is a lose lose situation. And as to Harmonium you will find that there are 5 big guilds on Povar. Harm is one of these guilds, maybe the second biggest and while I have only heard stories of Liquid I know a few other Harm ppl. some are friends some through getting ks'd and other bad experiences. All guilds will have a rotten apple or two, some guilds more then others. Don't judge a whole guild on what one person does.<P>Overseer<BR>Lvl 48 mage-Povar<BR>Soldier of T'or Drakkon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
