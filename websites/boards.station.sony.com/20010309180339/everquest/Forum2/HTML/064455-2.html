</FONT><HR>I am just going to point out a few facts to you guys...<P>First of all all petitions have a time limit.  That's right, after a certain amount of time your petition gets wiped automatically.  Guides don't do it, it's programmed in.  So if your petition was long enough in the que to get wiped it won't get answered and they will never know it's there. <P>Second, as much as you all think that the guides are gods and should be there every second of the day to help you, please remember that they are VOLUNTEERS.  They are on at times convenient to them, and if you just happen to have a problem when no guides are on...well sheesh petition later when one is on.<P>and on the topic of guides being anon...that is the only defense they have against people sending tells instead of petitioning.  People think they have a right to skip all the petitions already in que to get help for THEIR problem RIGHT NOW.  <P>Guides do not have the power to check logs, they do not have the power to repop npcs, they do not have the power to do most of the things you are blaming them for.  So get the facts straight.  Guides are level 50 volunteers with limited powers, GM's are paid workers, that are level 60.<P>And last but not least, if a guide says that he will escalate a petition, you don't get a brand new petition, your old petition is sent to a gm to look at.  One petition, so to the original poster...You had one petition that was answered, it was not deleted, a GM obviously was not able to look at it.  Next time try petitioning at the times a GM is scheduled.  Half of what you posted was not true or viable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not only was our lead server GM on but two GM admins as well. my first petition was wiped in less than an hour after placing it. repetitioned and was answered shortly there after. The petition that was escalated was in for FOUR hours (at this time i had been online 41 hours straight) when it was wiped. repetitioned and was finally able to talk to a GM admin about the situation. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Vidan-You are obviously a Guide, as are many of my friends.  If not, you have friends that are.<P>Petitions having a time limit-obvious flaw in customer service.  So when my customers here at work tell me they have a problem with paying $1,000,000 for a semicondctor equipment tool they bought from me, if i cant reply in 2 hours, i dont have to?  <P>What you said about guides not having the power to do said things goes back to the fact that Verant Customer service is deplorable.  It's substandard.  They can post their polls at signin all they want, if the people that offer us to help cant help, dont offer them.  Just lemme know when NeverWinter Nights comes out.  Thx buhbye.<P>As for petitioning when a GM is scheduled.  I'll remember to make sure I play monday and tuesday night only.  Cause that's the only time Therdar is scheduled.  And how the HELL am I supposed to know when a GM is scheduled?  WHY SHOULD THAT MATTER?  So if i should petition when a guide is scheduled, that means i wont have problems when one isnt?  Sorry, that is another sign of substandard customer service.<P>As for half of what we posted was not true or viable, please state that this is in your opinion.  Remember, verant is all of a sudden saying they're customer service oriented.  We're simplying showing that they arent.  We're pointing out flaws in their substandard customer service.  We're explaining why we, people who *PAY* to use this game, are unhappy.  <P>Wanna break this down to why Verant needs to look at this thread and make changes to it.<BR>70 people left the Plane of Growth to help this one person on one instance.<BR>Those 70 people equal $700.00 in revenue for one month.  They've been playing on average 1 year.  That's $8,400 annual revenue for Sony and Verant.  Lets say that their final observation is that sony and verant DONT care about customers, and a new game comes out, and as a team (and they obviously are, as they ALL went to help one person).  Decide to quit.  There goes $8,400.  No big deal, right?  Well, there are 30 servers.  Lets say this happens on all 30.  there goes $252,000 in revenue.  No big deal, right?  Well, This was just 1 person.  What about the 20 or 30 other people who have similar issues, like the fact that someone died on a boat and the answer "Travel at your own risk".  Ok, so we decide as a group to go Play NWN when it's released.  Or Anarchy Online.  We're a small guild, only 30 of us.  But that's Still $3,600 from our server annuall.y.  If it happens on all 30 servers, there's another $108,000 gone.<P>These arent isolated instances.  These are just 2 instances that people decided to SPEAK UP ABOUT!<P>If the guides cant help, hire people who can.<P>Gonna bump this till they lock it, or till they answer.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I wish to reiterate my post from EQ Vault http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=9635300&replies=19&page=2<P>***********************************<P>Hail and well met. <P>I don't have any eloquent words. I just want to reiterate how sorry I am that you have been wronged once again. Its remarkable that something so atrocious can happen twice to someone that many would count amongst the nicest people that they have met in Everquest. <P>If this is being read by anyone at Verant / Sony, I'd like to pose a thought or two. While I don't purport to understand the checks and balances you have instituted for our world, it seems that statics rules seem to work best in a static environment. I do not view our world to be static. The events that unfold daily shape it anew. With the technology you have at your disposal, would it be so hard to have reviewed the verifiable facts? <P>I'm not certain if you contested the idea that the creature had indeed spawned. Tracking logs of those involved might indicate that. My death certainly reinforced the idea to me that Faydedar indeed made his presence known. This was not a contested spawn. There were no competing persons vying for the items he could have dropped. Many people answered the call to arms. The influx of these people (many well into their 50's) could have been established during a considerable period of time. <P>I can appreciate that Verant / Sony personel are subjected to false claims daily. I can also appreciate that technology fails. But I firmly believe that certain events must be elevated and that a human review of the facts and circumstances must take place. This is such an event. Is this dragon a rare spawn? Yes. Did Faldile spend a great deal of her time in search of this creature. Yes. Did the creature spawn? Yes. Did she have the intent and the ability to defeat the creature? Yes. Was this intent active and completed in a timely fashion? Yes. Was there a mass technology failure that prevented the completion of the task? Yes. Barring the ability from the Company's side to monitor the situation, where there sufficient people to speak to about the matter? Yes. Where there highly respected memebers of E'ci there that, at the very least, could speak regarding the integrity of the people involved? Yes. <P>Significant time was invested by many people in hopes of accomplishing this task. Twice this has occurred. I emplore you not to make it thrice. Use sound judgement. What is to be lost in awarding Faldile the item she sought? An item that most feel she could have obtained but for this mass technology failure? What is to be gained by making Faldile invest more time? Will she be a better person for it? Will I be a better person if I assist her once again? <P>Marwick Westwind<P>**********************<P>Like many people here, I would like to see some type of response to this issue.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064455-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064455.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064455&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064455&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
