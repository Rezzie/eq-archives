&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello again.<P>This will be the thread for discussion about the rogue class.  The idea is to look at the things that need to be changed to make the class 'balanced'.  With that as the primary goal, I am still interested in hearing about bugs and other such things.  But, primarily, I want to talk about balance.<P>My take on the rogue is pretty similar to that of the warrior.  They are pretty well balanced.  Obviously with EverQuest as a primarily player vs. environment game, some of the things that thieves traditionally do are not really part of the package.  That's why, in EverQuest, they are titled rogues.<P>Again, I have had little time (actually, no time at all) to do research on rogue concerns before starting this thread.  So please be as detailed as you need to be to get your point across.  But, at the same time, please remember that this thread will get long.  So being concise and readable is important too.<P>I do want to report one thing that we have already discovered internally about rogues that is broken and will be fixed when we make these changes.  Yes, it is a nerf, but not in the true sense of the word.<P>In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at).  In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list.  Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically.  This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs.  But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list.  Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone.  The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity.  Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function.<P>I wanted to let you know that at the outset.  Please don't make it the focus of this thread.  It’s certainly something we should talk about.  But there are certainly other things that are worth discussion as well.<P>So let's hear what you think.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just want to see hide actually do something if I am on the "hate list". I strongly think hiding should either remove a rogue from the list, or it should put you at the bottom of the list. Perhaps make the hide skill more difficult to use successfully if you are on a "hate list", but if you are successful, then you are removed from the list.<P>Other than that I think rogues are great!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hehe I was waiting for this thread.  <P>Rogues are the most balanced, probably overpowered at high levels class.<P>They pay a huge penalty early since without twinking, rogues are tough to level solo or in small groups.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I will try to analyse rogue class in view of balancing its power with<BR>regard to other existing class, particularly pure and hybrid melee.<BR>Melee basis is the warrior class with following abilities: tanking, high<BR>melee damage, critical melee damage, high skill in every weapon, vast<BR>choice of weapon  and combat oriented skills. Monks trade tanking<BR>ability, combat skills, weapon choice  for secondary abilities like<BR>healing (mend), scouting (sneak, safe fall, traps, locks) and spell like<BR>effects (feign death, instill doubt). Rogues trade tanking ability,<BR>combat skills, weapon choice and critical hits  for  secondary abilities<BR>like scouting (sneak, hide, safe fall, traps, locks, pickpocket), spell<BR>effects (fear, poison), extra damage from behind and critical damage<BR>with throwing weapons. I will try to be "honest" in my analysis,<BR>stressing abilities that should be ameliorated along with those that<BR>need nerf (that mean I will search balance in class rather than mere<BR>additionnal power).  My experience of playing rogue come from Felyndira<BR>a 35 lvl Teir'Dal Redemned Agnostic rogue member of the Amazonian<BR>Sisterhood on Bertox, I do not get experience on high level rogue<BR>issues. Also... forgive my english, as it is not my mother tongue.<P>Scouting:<BR>Scouting is with melee damage the most important ability of the rogue<BR>class. Rogue got the ability to sneak and hide for invisibility effect<BR>against both living and undeads with two counterparts: be obliged to<BR>move very slowly and  being limited to mobs that do not see invisible.<BR>Issues on this topic are to avoid un-hiding after zoning (similarly to<BR>invisibility spells). A new skill for the rogue could also be<BR>implemented to help the rogue by-pass situation with mobs that see<BR>invisible: ID could be splitted into 2 skills: ID during fight for a<BR>fear effect, and intimidation in non combat situation for effect faction<BR>improvement or aggro. This would put the rogue on an even state with the<BR>enchanter with regard to scouting capacity (enchanter got illusions,<BR>invisibility and cooperation). Another issue concerning Hide and<BR>looting. Please make an option to have a YES/NO box with the message<BR>"are you sure you want to loot this corpse and break your hide?" (this<BR>will avoid me behing killed while scouting when I unvoluntary clic on a<BR>corpse), but never ever allow  that looting dont break hide (that would<BR>be cautionning ninja-looting).<P>Ability to deal melee damage:<BR>This ability is shared by pure and semi melee class (warrior, rogue,<BR>monk, ranger, paladin, SK):  make damage on close combat range. Weapon<BR>choice, Special attacks (crits, backstab, flying kick), Offense, Melee<BR>weapons skills, Dual wield, Double Strike, Spells, Spell-like abilities<BR>(poison, harm touch) influence this ability. In a group situation, rogue<BR>is the undisputed best melee damage dealer.  With regard to backstab,<BR>what about allowing backstab with 1HB weapon, for NO damage but a<BR>push/stun effect in relation with the base damage of the weapon. That<BR>would give the rogue a definitive chance of interupting casting, to the<BR>expand of damage. That would also favorise the use of 1HB (every rogue I<BR>know use piercing, a majority also use 1HS but most didnt bother to<BR>raise Hand to Hand and 1HB skills). Also regarding backstab, give a<BR>message when backstab fire (like warrior critical), I am frustrated when<BR>groupmates congratulate warrior for his nice 95 crit when I just<BR>backstabbed for 115 (not a major issue but it could help some players<BR>reconsidering usefulness of a rogue in a group, ... it would also be<BR>sweet for my ego). I also have an interrogation on high end weapons:<BR>ragebringer got a ratio of 0.75 with a base damage of 15. Willsaper, the<BR>second best rogue weapon is 0.65, damage 13. There is a huge gap betwen<BR>these weapons, both in term of ratio and base damage. Was this done on<BR>purpose to make a significant difference between weapons and THE epic<BR>weapon or could the choice of weapon for a rogue be increased  by<BR>introducing weapons with a base damage of 14.<P>Ability to tank:<BR>This is the ability to take/avoid damage during a melee fight. It depend<BR>on several parameters like HP, AC (available armors), Defense, Dodge,<BR>Parry, Riposte, Disciplines (post 50). Rogue got an "average" capacity<BR>to tank, worst than warrior, paladin, shadow knight, about even with<BR>bard, monk, and rangers and better than healers and casters. From my<BR>experience, tanking ability of the rogue is at it should be.<P>Ability to evade:<BR>I remember when I played Felyndira before evade skill was implemented<BR>... Evade is central for both rogue defense and attack, please do not<BR>nerf it.<P>Ranged weapons:<BR>Ranged weapon choice, Critical hits, Ranged weapon skill influence this<BR>ablitity. Rogue got a poor capacity to inflict damage from distance,<BR>even considering critical and crippling blow on throwing weapons. For<BR>pure melee, ranged weapons are merely used to pull, not to make damage,<BR>therefore, range rather than damage is the important thing to consider<BR>(at least from my point of view). I would like to see a  new line of<BR>ranged weapon made on the model of bow/arrow to be implemented for<BR>throwing weapons. This could be Sling/bullets (using existing tailoring<BR>skill for making sling and pottery and/or smithing for making stackable<BR>bullets) or Propulsor/javelin (implementing a new skill similar to<BR>fletchery). Throwing weapon with better range and damage need to be<BR>implemented. Other ideas of "exotic" throwing weapon are a boomerang<BR>that would return in ranged slot after use (negate the need to buy<BR>throwing weapons), tailored net (a short range, heavy, unstackable<BR>weapon that deal no damage but root the opponent), bolas (weapon with a<BR>chance to proceed snare).<P>Ability to heal self:<BR>Monk get the best pure melee self healing capacity (bandage and mend),<BR>followed by warrior (bandage), and rogue (bandage capped low). Monks<BR>get this ability balanced by having reduced scouting capacity compared<BR>with the rogue (lacking hide, traps/locks skills capped low). Increasing<BR>this ability would favorise soloing, which I guess is not something<BR>wanted.<P>Ability to feign death (FD):<BR>Rogue dont have an "escape way" (like a gate spell or Feign death). On<BR>the other hand, rogue are master scouts, and therefore have the<BR>potential to avoid situation where an escape way is needed (Felyndira<BR>always hide while waiting a pull and never engage a fight if she<BR>consider the group cannot handle the situation. Just make it clear to<BR>your groupmates before fight to avoid later flaming when everybody but<BR>you died ... also they will be happy that you survived for corpse<BR>recovery). Moreover, the Feign death  ability of the monk is balanced<BR>with the ability to make/apply poison of the rogue, therefore giving FD<BR>to the rogue would unbalance relative power of rogue with monk. Monk FD<BR>is a skill resulting in a single spell effect (fear) and not restricted<BR>in its use (fast re-use delay, no mana use, no component). Rogue<BR>make/poison skill, on the other hand, require long/expensive preparation<BR>(very restricted use) but offer more versatility in effects (16<BR>different spells effects). For this reason, I dont think giving to the<BR>rogue unrestricted use of FD under the form of a skill (evade out of<BR>line of sight, FD skill) would be a good idea.  Alternatively,  FD<BR>potion (all/all) made using make poison skill  (rogue) and/or alchemy<BR>skill (shaman) could be introduced. With regard to FD potion, similar<BR>effect (escape way) already exist with "gate potions" (from merchant,<BR>drop or shamans), with the drawback of being moved to bind point.<P>Stackable poisons:<BR>Rogue is a spell caster with serious limitations. Poison is a spell. As<BR>it stand, the limitations are SO serious that most rogues dont use<BR>poison at all, or only use it to a small extand. Also a tiny number of<BR>twinks overuse/abuse poison use because the limitation on poison use do<BR>not apply to them (due to "artificial" unlimited cash). I want to be<BR>clear, I dont wish a rogue could use poison every single fight he is<BR>involved in. Poison is for "special occasions" only and this is fair. I<BR>only wish rogue have a fair chance to use any poison, at a given moment<BR>where/when he need it.<P>16 different type of poisons are available to the rogue. Range of effect<BR>is interesting, including DD, Dot, STR debuff, trade off debuff, trade<BR>off dot, stun, manadrain, blind, snare, slow, root. Only remark concerns<BR>damage poisons, which are fairly weak (at high level)  when compared<BR>with true damage spells (my guess is that high level rogue (post 50)<BR>dont use damage poison anymore but favor debuff poisons). Every type of<BR>poison should be interesting from level 20 to 60.<P>A rogue must "search" every single spell he use (collecting/buying<BR>ingredients, preparing poison). This is THE limitation against rogues<BR>having piles of poison ... if a rogue gets tons of poison... he invested<BR>a lot of time/money in  them and merit them. Some poison ingredients can<BR>only be bough, I would like that every poison component drop, some could<BR>still be bough but at least a broke rogue would have a chance to use<BR>make these poisons. I would also like to be able to produce suspension<BR>using a trade skill (brewery for instance). Overall give the possibility<BR>to have cheaper poisons if more time is invested in collecting/preparing<BR>poison. Do not sweeten the difficulty to prepare poison as this is<BR>central for balancing the skill, reduce ingredient drop rate, increase<BR>price on sold ingredients (or even remove all sold poison ingredients<BR>and make them drop) if necessary. I think that poison preparation is<BR>already long/expensive enough to limit the use of poison (and therefore<BR>balance the skill).<P>A rogue must memorize a given spell every time he cast it (apply<BR>poison), to the difference of a caster who must only memorize it once.<BR>This is THE limitation against chain casting, nerf it if you consider<BR>that necessary (increase delay). Taking into consideration the<BR>difficulty to obtain poison (provided you are not a twink with unlimited<BR>cash), I dont consider chain casting poison to be unbalancing: during<BR>two minuts you are going to rock, but this did require hours of<BR>preparations...do not only consider the use of poison alone, always have<BR>in mind the preparation process attached.<P>A rogue can only have one spell memorized at a time (only primary slot<BR>can be poisoned). By comparison, a caster can memorize 8 different spell<BR>at any time. I would like the rogue to be able to "memorize" 3 spell at<BR>a  time, which is still well behind a caster, by giving the possibility<BR>to poison off hand slot and ranged slot. (keep the limitation to<BR>piercing/throwing weapons).<P>A rogue do not have a spell book, he must cast every spell directly from<BR>the "scroll", that also mean he need a "scroll" (poison) for every cast.<BR>Keep this as it stand: do not allow a single apply to last for any more<BR>than one cast... that would be equivalent to give caster several cast<BR>for one time the mana cost and would remove the preparation burden on<BR>poison use.<P>Rogue "scroll" do not stack. Change this, the only limitation this<BR>imply, concern  the array of spell a rogue can carry with him. Let me<BR>devellop the point: In  practice  rogues dont carry already prepared<BR>poisons of each type and run in bank to refill  poison bags every time a<BR>poison spell is used. Every poisoner rogue I know carry stacks of<BR>ingredients and combine them on the field. Making poison on the field<BR>require you to carry mortar and pestle (only 6 slot container, vs a<BR>potentially 10 slot container), vials (generally 1 or 2 different type),<BR>suspensions (also generally 1 or 2 type) and ingredients (generally 2<BR>per poison type). This means a rogue who want to use poison to full<BR>potency (be able to apply any poison type at a given instant on the<BR>field), need about 36 inventory slots to be filled with poison stuffs<BR>(and lose 4 slot due to 6 slot container). When you think that 80<BR>inventory slots are available at maximum that mean a rogue must<BR>sacrifice 50% of his inventory slot to be able to use efficiently<BR>poison: No sensible player would do that. Due to this most rogue only<BR>carry with them ingredients for a very limited number of poison type<BR>(personnaly I carry 5 at max). Of course this situation is acceptable if<BR>you plan to raid a place where you know which mob/situation you will<BR>encounter. But in the case of a travelling rogue (what I mostly play),<BR>you can be pretty sure that when the ultra rare mob spawn, you will not<BR>have with you the specific poison that would be usefull against that mob<BR>on you (Murphy law). Make poison stackable, that way a rogue could carry<BR>every type of poison (that would still consume 16 inventory slot... but<BR>it would be manageable) and would not need to run to bank every time he<BR>cast a spell. Alternatively if stackable poison is still considered<BR>unbalancing (and I think it is not), only poisons which require dropped<BR>ingredients could be stacked (this would give a supplementary<BR>restriction on stacked poisons... you MUST spent time to collect them),<BR>restricting twink rogue with huge amount of money to have access to<BR>unlimited supply of poison (buying all required ingredients).<P>Also I am very surprised that past the initial 20 points, unlike others<BR>trade skills, make poison and apply poison can still be raised with<BR>practice points with a guild master. Nerf this as it is fairly<BR>easy/cheap to raise skill that way when compared to raising skill<BR>making/applying poisons.<P>With this topic, I would like to stress the point that every rogue is<BR>not a twink and that nerfing the skill to limit the possibility of a<BR>twink to abuse it MAY be equivalent todenie the access to the skill to<BR>any non twinked character. In my opinion, the key to balance this skill<BR>and reduce/remove twink abuse is to make poison preparation hard enough<BR>to limit the use of poison, along with limited restrictions on use. As<BR>it stand poison making require more dedication in time/money than  any<BR>other skill (jewelry, alchemy and smithing are time consuming but all<BR>ingredients can be bought) and therefore very effectively limit poison<BR>use.  As it stand, raising making/apply poison skill is too easy (using<BR>practice points with guild master). At it stand, poison use, is<BR>over-restricted: restriction in poison availablity, necessity to<BR>reapply, unstackable poison, primary hand poisoning only. Whereas<BR>restrictions on poison supply and re-apply should be maintained (maybe<BR>even be reinforced), restrictions on unstackable poison and primary slot<BR>poisoning only should be dropped.<P>Apply poison: I have read some post proposing to give apply/poison skill<BR>to necro and SK, arguing that this would help making poison making<BR>profitable. Both already are casters or semi caster and do not need it.<BR>Make/Poison skill is an expensive skill on purpose,  to balance the<BR>spell casting ability given to a pure melee class. Moreover you can<BR>already make cash out of it selling poisons to impatient lvl 18-19<BR>rogues (tiny market) and making dyes for tainting fine plate (small<BR>market).<P>Instill doubt: both monks and rogues share this ability. Whereas this<BR>skill use should always be unreliable, the chance to proceed/resist<BR>could be modified to have this skill work sometime on things other than<BR>green con. Also, why cannot we backstab after a successful ID? this make<BR>no sense and remove a big part of the usefullness of the skill.<P>Disarm: this skill need to be modified. Give a better chance to disarm,<BR>allow to disarm off-hand weapon and allow to disarm magical weapons,<BR>along with  nerfing the skill so that disarmed weapon is returned to<BR>target inventory. This will completely negate the ability to use this<BR>skill for "ninja-looting" and will improve the usefulness and<BR>effectiveness of disarm.<P>Pickpocket: this skill need to be modified because it make rogues<BR>un-welcomed in groups even when you do not use it. Pickpocket is a<BR>roguish skill I would not like to see dropped. What about having a<BR>separate pocket for pickpocket? (that would not be detrimental to other<BR>players, but another rogue). Or what about sharing pickpocketed cash<BR>with group members, and sending message to groupmates when items are<BR>stolen (similarly to regular looting).<P>Safe fall: good skill, but I would like that mobs also suffer falling<BR>damage, that would give a tactical/offensive use to this skill. Also I<BR>am of the opinion that falling damage should stun. Also  nothing to do<BR>with rogue balance but please fix the bug in Crystal Cavern that make<BR>you receive 10000 damage if you fall in the hole from tunel near<BR>entrance, and only 200-500 if you fall in the same hole from the stone<BR>bridge.<P>Tracking: I would like to see this skill implemented on the rogue as it<BR>would nicely complete the array of skill a rogue already possess while<BR>fitting the "spirit" of the class. After all, a rogue is supposed to<BR>have access to informations, spies who can help him find someone,<BR>specially in cities and dungeons. In order to limit infringement on<BR>ranger/druid domain, I would give  a restricted use (city/dungeons only)<BR>and possibly a lower cap in skill. Also I am not sure of this but if<BR>bard got tracking, I see no reason why rogues should not have it.<P>Find/Remove traps: Thank for implementing (in the end) a use for these<BR>skills with SoV. Didnt had the opportunity to use them yet.<P>Picklocks: Nothing of note on this skill. SoV and Kunark  introduced<BR>many doors to use this skill.<P>Trade skills:  This subjet concern every class. As a general rule, trade<BR>skills are difficult/long/expensive to raise, depending on the<BR>usefulness of the skill. At low level, trade skill can be a good way for<BR>a "newbie" to honestly make some money (making/selling patchwork armor,<BR>metal studs...), and I am really in favor of this use of trade skills.<BR>Under normal game condition a trade skill will increase regularly as the<BR>character gain levels and got access to sufficient amount of cash to buy<BR>the needed ingredients and practice. A problem arise with "twinks" who<BR>master trade skills at level 1. I am in favor of capping every trade<BR>skills with level after the initial training by Guild master (Lvl+1) x5<BR>. Trivial skill should also be modified to suit the skill progression<BR>(having silver jewelry become trivial at level when "enchant gold" spell<BR>become available to enchanters, having a reasonable chance of making<BR>poison vials with a skill of  105 in pottery (obtainable at level 20)<BR>when make poison skill become available to a rogue.<P>Grouping: Hybrids were carrying the burden of being "experience eater"<BR>and had difficulties grouping because of this, it has been modified so<BR>they dont suffer this disandvantage anymore. Rogues have difficulty to<BR>group because he possess several player-unfriendly skills (disarm,<BR>pickpocket) with the potential to reduce loot amount for groupmate<BR>and/or ninja-looting. Modify these skill so that they are not anymore<BR>damaging to other players, or rogue will keep having difficulties to<BR>find a group  due to game mechanic, which is completely unfair<BR>(specially when we consider the capacity of the rogue to solo). I am<BR>concious that nerfing playing unfriendly skills is completely<BR>anti-roleplaying and that stealing from silly groupmates/players is<BR>probably the most enjoyeable part of playing a rogue, but it must be<BR>done as it does not fit the "spirit" of the game as Verant design it<BR>(play nice policy, play in group, interdependancy of players).<BR>Roleplaying an evil rogue (Btw  following the character presentation of<BR>a Teir'Dal rogue worshipping Innoruuk or Bristlebane to the letter) will<BR>get you banned. Everquest is not a roleplaying game specially if you<BR>play an evil character, live with that or quit playing.<P>Overall the rogue class dont need tremendous changes in order to get<BR>balanced, as most of the job was already done (I remember when I started<BR>playing Felyndira in dec 1999). Should the suggestions I made be<BR>implemented, I would be completely satisfied with the balance of the<BR>rogue class.<P>PS: Most important, I wish that rogue get enhanced backstab damage (x10<BR>instead of x5) and that backsatb work from the front also with off hand,<BR>that double strike also apply to backstab (for duoble backstab), that<BR>you introduce piercing weapons for rogue with base damage of 20 or more,<BR>that rogues got HP equivalent to warrior, armor with equivalent AC to<BR>warriors (with reduced weight), that evade completely clear aggro, that<BR>poison once applied last till you zone and proceed for each strike.<P>PSS: PS was a joke. /e smile.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have NEVER had that thing with evade you just talked about happen to me, so pifff go right ahead and change it =P  Matter of fact, I've had times I've used evade and it seems it did absolutely nothing even though I've gotten the message that I've evaded successfully.  If it's suppose to lower me on the aggro list, wouldnt it have turned to one of the tanks in the group taunting it rather than just stay on me.  I dunno, was just an observation I've noticed every now and then.  Other than that, I'd like to see something done with poison, but thats more of a wish than a balancing issue, since as a class rogues obviously dont rely on poison to be balanced.  I do think a more diverse selection of effective rogue weapons should be available.  As it is now, there are so few of them that rogue weapons tend to be VERY expensive compared to many of the weapons other classes.  But maybe thats only on my server I dunno.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well making evade only reduce hate list will only work if it reduces it by alot. Speaking as a ranger and rogue I can say that Jolt reduces hate by 500 and it normally does not take off enough hate. Since rogues do a ton more damage then rangers please keep that in mind when you determine the hate it will reduce in the future.

</FONT><HR>I agree that Rogues are very well balanced.<P>The only 'would-be-nice' I can think of would be the following:  <P>Given that rogues are solely group dependant and have low survivablitity outside groups it would be nice to have some type of speed bonus.  It would be either level based or agility based and would slowly go from run speed to SoW speed at level 50.  This would assist Rogues in traveling from place to place as we're looking for groups.<P>This would also give Rogues an escape skill that is missing from the class.  Other than Evade which really doesn't work too well when you're the last one stading (ie... Warriors - high hp, SK and monk - FD, Rangers - Sow, Snare, Root, Bard - Selos, Pally - LoH, Stun, do they have Divine Aura?).<P>All-in-all though I think rogues are fun to play and sufficient as-is but the speed bonus sure would be nice and sorta/kinda fits the class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Stackable poison: please make it so that poisons of the same type stack together, it is rather annoying carrying around multiple backpacks full of poison. Failing to do that, could poisons be made to add the effect to a weapon and not just you weapon slot, that way one could carry multiple poisoned blades.<BR> 2. If I can get far enough away from a monster can I please hide from it rather than just evading it. Getting away is a difficult enough task to warrant this adjustment I think.<BR> 3.I know it is a little late in the life of the game to change it but you might want to remember, chests full of loot can be fun. :)<P>Keep up the good work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok...one of the points I was saving for our thread was the fact that when making an Evade attempt often times you will see the 'successful' message and see absolutely no apparent effect from the mob.  I guess I am now confused about how you can feel that evade is too effective when apperently a successful evade attempt does not necessairly stop a mob from beating the crap out of you.  Furthermore, I do not understand how when fighting in groups with 2-3 other tanks beating on a mob and my Rogue evading constantly how you can claim that when successful evade moves you to the bottom of the hate list...because it clearly does not.<P>Secondly, what exactly does "more in line with its original function" mean?  I can only imagine, as it seems you do to, endless posts speculating on what you actually plan to do with evade.  My thoughts would be to actually make Evade a completely seperate skill (perhaps replacing the utterly uselss Disarm skill).  Give evade the functionality you feel it deserves and then take a hard look at the Hide skill.<P>In my opinion, the Hide skill should actually completely remove all the current aggro that a mob may have for you.  This skill would of course have a success/fail rate against the level of the mob vs. the level of the skill...which might actually make improving your hide skill important.  This of course would mean that you could still fail to hide vs a given mob that has aggroed on you, but so what....the idea that a rogue can disengage from combat is certainly plausable.  Oops....I think I may have just sealed this ideas doom by giving rogues a monk ability....hmm.  I guess...personally I find it rediculous that a mob can see a rogue who has successfully used hide/sneak and is invisible to all other mobs except the one aggroed on him/her who would have otherwise not given u a second look had you not been on its haste list.  Maybe the problem is that evade seems like it should work like feign death.....maybe not.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, your comment on evade skill has me really concerned.  You emit you don't know much about rogue history.  Well here is one fact about rogue history I will tell you about.<P>NO OTHER CLASS IN THIS ENTIRE GAME GOT THE SHAFT MORE THAN THE ROGUE CLASS PRE-KURNAK.  I MEAN YOU ALMOST HAD CLASS GENOCIDE.  <P>You were not here, but rogues were treated worse than dirt.  If today we rogues have a few nice skills like evade, well more power to the rogues.  But I'm not kidding Verant almost had Class Genocide with the rogue class as bad they treated us.<P>Now if you want to make us more versatile.  Allow us to pick pocket better, and please for heavens sake lower the prices of poison costs.  I mean I would love to use poison.  I just don't want to go broke doing it!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pick Pocket -  Please for the love of god please do not ever limit the level upon which a mob can be picked.  Is it really your intention that now that I have successfully attained a somewhat high level that I should remove my pickpocket skill from my hotkeys because it no longer has any affect?  It seems to me the problem is in how you calculate difficulty vs. success for higher level creatures.  It's certainly a fun skill and I would really like to use it again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Poison Stacking is a big one, its technically possible now and would really help.<P>Poison costs are bad, the skill line has a huge list of drawbacks (apply skill, resistances, must farm or buy the ingredients, suspensions, have to make or buy the bottles, skill check to make the poison) and so little payoff that it is unbalanced in my opinion.  Lowering the cost of suspensions and bottles (and the sketches for bottles) would really go a long ways to help that skill out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I also think Rogues are very well balanced. I do have an issue with the nerf to evade however. I don't know who else has had this trouble but I often find that evade is interrupted in high lag zones. I have seen this happen to me several times. If evade is nerfed would it be possible to get a faster refresh rate on evade since it fails due to the lag?<BR>     Also, no stackable poisons? i spend 1/4 of my time running around looking for components that are hard to find to begin with and cost an arm and a leg. I would think stackable poisons would be something that would be easy to implement since you can have sow potions. How could this be a coding issue? (as per Ducati's safehouse post 2/5) I don't talk code but I need someone to explain that to me.

</FONT><HR>Hi!<P>1) Please make poisons stackable. This will help make the skill more user-friendly to us lugging around the 10-slot backpacks.<P>2) Throwing- Please consider a "base" range inherent to the class itself, say 50 range. This range would be applied much as a bow when deciding total distance able to chuck a dagger/star. Generally this skill has a tendency to be ignored by most rogues due to the rather short range given by throwing, turning us to bows if we were trying to fufill the role of "puller". <P>3) Not class balanced per se, but please consider changing the yellow tint/look of the assassin's chain. I am tired of being called the "Dwarven Daisy" <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>4) Please consider adding in a greater variety of non piercing alternatives for off hand consumption such as blunt, slashing. This will allow a greater sense of freedom in expressing which weapons a rogue might wish to equip rather than being molded into the idea of "rogues must pierce".<P>5) Please fix the bug with Assassinate, where if I use the discipline Duelist on a creature that can in fact be assassinated, I will see the "Has assassinated his victim" msg, but the creature will not recieve the damage.<P>6) Assassinate the skill - Please consider increasing <BR>   A) The level of the mobs able to be assassinated to lvl 46-47 (versus lvl 45, the currently believed Cap)- This leaves all planar mobs clear from the threat, and still limits the amount of creatures that can be affected to a rather minimum and allows us to "show off" this skill. Usually this skill is most effective when cutting thru the greens to get to a real fight, so I do not sense a unbalance.<BR>   B) Please consider expanding the list of mobs that can be affected to "living". Undead cannot be affected, nor can any golems/golem like and plants. That I completely understand, but some mobs most notably Drovlargs cannot be affected, despite falling within the level limit. This is a skill that seemed to be put in for flavor and fun - So let me have some fun in Karnors on my way to kick Veneril Sathir's ass <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Thankyou for considering my thread, I feel what I asked helps flesh out the rogue class rather than add anything specific, thus giving the class as a whole more flavorable time-sinks that we can choose to spend time on if we so choose.<P>Crover<BR>Assassin<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please make using the poision line of skill affordable/reasonable.  Do you actually expect rogues to start using poisions at the low 20's?  I mean w/o a serious cash infusion from a second higher level character or guild mates, you can kiss any poision ambitions goodbye.  <P>I've been luck enough to have a few higher level rogues give me a couple poisions to apply to try out..they were soo cool and fun and still even at lvl 42 I feel like I cant possibly begin to afford the incredible costs associated with using this skill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
