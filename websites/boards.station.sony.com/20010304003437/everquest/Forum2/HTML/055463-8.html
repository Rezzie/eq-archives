</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Swifton here, how dare you skip half of our posts! That's absolutely absurd, and insulting! It's obvious from your post Absor that you've skipped about half of the really good ideas that would fix the ranger class. It's obvious that there's some sort of bias against the ranger class, for some unknown reason. &lt;sigh&gt; Guess it's time to delete this character I've been working on for 4 months and start a warrior. Better yet, guess it's time to stop giving you people money and go play Ascheron's Call. If you're not going to listen to us (and it's obvious you're not, both by your own admission and by the fact that you're offering us only minor tweaks), then either give us the chance to turn our characters into a warrior/druid of the same level, or refund our money.<P>It's absolutely amazing that you wouldn't give our thread the same attention as the threads for the other classes. You know, the only reason why EQ is so successful is because of the people playing it. You keep this crap up, and what do you think will happen when we all quite? By pissing off the very people that give you money, we will no longer be giving you money, and thus you'll be out of a job.<P>I strongly, strongly suggest that you go back and read EVERY SINGLE POST here. A lot of people have been giving some great ideas, NONE of which you even came close to mentioning in your feedback. Yes, there are a lot of repeats of the same request. Why do you think that is? BECAUSE RANGERS SUCK! We need some major enhancements. Gee, what do you think would happen if you gave us rangers all of those requests that we keep repeating? Maybe we'd be a respectable class. Maybe we'd be wanted in groups for the high-level raids. Got a test for you to do. Perform a /who all ranger 50 60, and see how many you get. Now, do a /who all &lt;any other class&gt; 50 60. Hmmm, seems like there's twice as many of any other class than rangers, huh? Why do you think that is? I'll tell you, as it's obvious you don't know. It's because rangers are the weakest of all the hybrids. We can't take damage like other hybrids, we can't deal the damage like rogues/monks, we have no useful buffs (compared to druids/shamans of the same level), we can't deal magical damage of wizards/mages at the same level, and we have no special abilities to offer (paladins: lay of hands, ressurection; shadowknights: pets, harm touch; rogues: INCREDIBLE melee damage; monks: too many to list). <P>Oh, I here you say, but rangers have tracking.  Heh, tracking is a totally useless skill to rangers. Case in point: A level 35 rangers stands next to a level 35 bard/druid, and they bring up tracking. The druid/bard can see the griffen right in front of them. The ranger can see some stupid merchant halfway across the zone, but nope, no griffen. I don't know how many times I've been pulling in an outdoor zone, and brought up tracking to find something. I go after it, and after running halfway across the zone to pull a low blue for my group, the druid says 'Hey, there's this yellow right over here.' Very embarrasing. I haven't used tracking since level 20 because it's so useless.  It's pretty bad when a party with a bard and ranger uses the bard to track and pull.  Yes, tracking is BROKEN. Putting a scrollbar on the window is not an 'enhancement,' it is indeed a bug fix, and every single ranger on every server knows this, so don't try and fool us. It's making some lazy programmer somewhere do the job they should've done in the first place.<P>Really, why don't you just come out and say the VI made a mistake by making the ranger class, and just delete all of our accounts and make us start over. It would be easier than trying to beg you people for something that we know you're never going to give us anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also, Absor, I think if you look at how fast the Ranger thread has grown (without a lot of flamage, and some very eloquantly expressed arguments), you can see that Rangers feel very passionately that they are the least balanced of all the classes.<P>We were truly neglected when Kunark came out.  Verant did some horrible things by omission to the Ranger class at that time.  We're only starting to see the balance return.  I think the reason some people are upset you didn't read more Ranger posts is because of this fact.<P>We feel we have very real issues and we're still upset with the way the Ranger class was treated with Kunark, and the year after when it took many months to even get Verant to engage in dialogue with us.<P>So, respectfully please, take some time to get to know our issues and make us feel like Verant actually cares.  Thanks for giving us this forum to present our issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a low level ranger (14) and have no idea what is in store for the upper levels, but I do like the idea that we don't port and don't SoW., but I agree with an earlier post. If we can't port or SoW till late we run everywhere.. shouldn't we be faster or get faster just for conditioning? (increase of quarter to 1/2 speed, run skill at the expense of stamina at a lower level?) just a thought, don't know anything about programing, but seems it would balance.  If I use the skill I could be exhausted by the time I stop and get slaughtered.. my choice/ chance.<BR>btw- great game, just kills way too much of my "spare" time. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dunno if anyone has covered this already, but here's a suggestion I made elsewhere:<P>Dunno how this would be taken, but it sounds like a neat idea in my head. Give Rangers ONLY an additional shot every, say 15 lvls -- At lvl 15, they fire their bow and shoot TWO arrows instead of one, THREE at 30, FOUR at 45, and finally FIVE at 60. Ranger can back off out of combat and still be making a reasonable contribution, yes? True, this would chew through his arrows like a fiend at higher levels, but it's a decent payoff. It would give Rangers their "traditional" proficiency -- being deadly with a bow. At the moment, I don't THINK it would be unbalancing.<P>And/or, how about upping their damage tables for archery? It's been said over and over and over that archery is useless for anything other than pulling -- "Bow kiting" isn't exactly the optimal combat method --, even for Rangers... Ranger-only bows with GOOD procs? I understand arrows can't be given procs (shame). Stuns with arrows for Rangers (Well placed shot, and darn right the big brute's gonna be reeling for a second)?<P>I agree with what someone else said on these boards -- Rangers aren't where they should be until you start hearing the group leader say "Monk, you pull, Enchanter mez, and Cleric, keep us healed while the Ranger turns the mob into a pincushion"...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I understand why Undue repition.My original post is as follows .<P>Hide(sneak)-<P>PROBLEM : Hide ONLY functions if immobile , with no way of knowing if successful(unlike Rogues) and if you sneak while hidden and start to move hide breaks .<BR>Now bards have this same problem . The reason I feel this is wrong is simply . Druids and Bards get an UNdiluted version of Track . yet the hide we get is obsolete before we get (Camo at 15 , HIDE at 25). and Superior camo later on . Looking at it from a balance issue giving us a skill that is effective Negated by other givin abilities removes some balance .<P>Solution : Allow our Hide to work just like rogue (and give our sneak the fail/succes message) BUT make them only usable out doors (eing an Outdoorsy class) that way you remove our hide/sneak ability indoors but increase tyem outdoors and maintain balance .<P><BR>Armor-<P>Problem : I've noticed a LARGE Disrcepency in the many magical armors givin out in Game .(I'll be using Chest armor in all referances for simplicity due to the large number of differant armor parts) I Pulled up ALL the Cheast pieces USABLE by the following classes WARRIOR.PALLADIN,SHADOWKNIGHT,BARD,SHAMAN,DRUID,RANGER .I found no less than 9 usable by WAR,PAL,SHD,BRD but were unusable by Rangers . ( you say well they can use palte RAngers can't) THEN I found 8 more that are also Usable by ROGUES, and or SHAMANS both of whom CANNOT wear plate yet while Rangers are left out of these pieces. all OF THESE are attainable on Norrath Not the plains . ALl are higher AC than and BEtter Stats adjustmants than ANY open to the RAnger . C'mon Guys SHAMANs being givin Better armor than us the guys in the thick . I even out of Curiosity Went thru all the Shaman and Druid specific Armors only to DIscover Nope RAngers can't wear ANY . Yet any Armor For RAngers (except Tolans , Ivy or Thurgadin RAnger , all types that other classes have counter parts to) ANYone else could wear. This SEVERELY limits and hinders us as a MElee Class .<P>Solution : Either a) change a few Items so we can wear as well . or else Maybe make some items drop that we can wear with other classes like SHM.DRU . <P><BR>I'll be happy to clarify or send all my research materials if you could use them .<P>Thank you for time .<P>Dubh Stormwarden<P>Ronin Ranger -Povar-<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will keep it short and sweet.<BR>Firstly, 1/2 of you are crazy, this is not a wishlist, this is not a rant board. You eliminate both the point of the topic (which is to BALANCE rangers) and the chances that actual posts containing good suggestions will be read with your posts of non-sense. You are entilted to your opinion but be realistic for the good of our class as a whole.<BR>I think 3 things would make this class much more balanced and survivable without being overpowered.<BR> <BR>1: we are grossly lacking in hp, I think maybe a boost of 10 hp per level starting at 30 (where rangers start to go down hill) ending with 300 more hp at level 60. Not a large ammount, but enough to put us on a more stable footing untill we can get Jolt cast off.<P>2: Defense, my friend the rogue who I have by 4 levels and much better equipment tanks better then I do cause of his Defense. We are 3/4s warrior yet our Defense caps at the level of Shaman, druids and clerics. I think bringing our defense up to the level of SK/Pali Offense would be in order but even a 20 point increase would be a large step. I have lived through the increases in Dodge and Parry, they do hardly anything, our problem isn't going to be solved by 50 more points of Parry and Dodge.<P>3: Jolt- been beaten to death but I do agree lower level rangers need the spell, even if it's a slightly weaker version then the one we have at 55.<P>That's it, sorry for the harsh comments, but I feel the bickering, wishlisting and the "I agree with so and so" posts are spamming this board and making it harder for VI to find the valid points to actually make a list to make us alittle more balanced. I love my class and everyone brave enough to stick with it, I want to see it improved I just think the spam is very counter-productive.<P>Gambiitt Ravenknight<BR>Warder of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*** ABSOR - SOMETHING YOU POSTED CONSERNS ME GREATLY ***<P>You seem open minded to our request to raise defense skills to be in line with Pally/SK weapon skills.  This is my single biggest balance issue - defense.  However after the patch, Pally/SK defense will be raised to 252 and the Ranger offense will be raised to 252.  The Pally/SK offence will be at 230, but the post you responded to request an increase to 215.  That is not sufficient.  Our defense should equal their offense.  The person who's post you copied from had inaccurate numbers.  Please let us know that you have seen this if you will bring to the dev team properly as O230/D252 for Pally/SK should warrant O252/D230 for Rangers.

</FONT><HR>Rangers dont NEED Sow at the lower levels. But, they do need a speed increase. WHen you picture rangers, you picture them being woodsmen, running thru the woods, scouting ahead, and generally being quicker than other people. I dont know if it has been suggested before, but, this will help both grouping and soloing. Yes, I know this game isnt meant to solo, but, you do have to do it from time to time. And this will help them in kiting, or when they often pair with druids for kiting, helps with pulling, CR's, evading trains, etc etc.<P>Give them (about level 15 or so) a small, like 10-15% SELF only speed increase. A trimmed down minor Sow, if you will. Not as fast, and, you cant cast it on others, but, its something. Plus, it gives the rangers what they want, without throwing the game out of balance and taking away a lot of power that us druids and shaman have at lower levels.<P>Good idea? Or bad?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IMO, there is nothing wrong with rangers, offense, defense, spells, whatever.  They fit the mold.  Would more offense be good?  Yeah, they should equal a rogue and monk for damage output while there spells equate to the monk and rogue skills and disciplines<P>But, the problem is: Rangers are PERCEIVED as being broken by other players.  Most of this was brought on by the rangers themselves when their role changed from a light tank to a pure offensive meleer.  No amount of tweaking or tuning or balancing is going to fix this class.  EVER.  Unless people's opinions change, it will remain a broken class.<P>Sorry Verant, but you can't patch popular opinion, whether that popular opinion is wrong or not.<P>Llerian Moonbow<BR>51 Unbroken-I-work-just-fine-Pathfinder<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
