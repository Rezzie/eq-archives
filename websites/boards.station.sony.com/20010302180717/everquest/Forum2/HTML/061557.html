</FONT><HR>Mr. Abashi,<P>Since we are on the topic of balancing, I was wondering if you would be interested in starting a thread on balancing the tradeskills, or maybe a thread for each tradeskill?<P>There has been tons of wonderful content added to several tradeskills of late, and I seems a shame that it is out of the reach of the majority of players due to the difficulity.  I believe that in the past Mr. Yakatizma stated (in reference to Blacksmithing) that to avoid the inevitable screams of 'n--f', he purposely made things very hard, instead of easy, so that they can get easier instead of harder. (I hope that sentance makes sense  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>Well, I think the time has come to loosen the restraints a bit, and do some balancing/tuning.  For example, in blacksmithing, to enchant an item, one race uses a gem that can be purched off a vender, while other races use "blue diamonds" which are rare drops off high level mobs.  Also in blacksmithing, the evil venders are lacking in several ingredents that are used in skilling up, that several 'good' venders have.<P>These are just a few examples off the top of my head from my personal experience.  What I would really like to know is who are the tradeskills aimed at? race, class, level, and do they hit their intended target?<P>Perhaps you are still too busy with the class balancing, to delve into Tradeskills at this time.  If so, I would like to know if there is a plan to look at this in the future? or are they to be left as is?<P>Thank you for your time,<P>Quyrean<BR>43 cleric<P>PS. Do you read the tradeskills boards?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can answer the PS question; NO!(and it has to be with caps and '!' because of how true it is)<P>~BUMP~<P>Tradeskills need to be balanced, looked at, and tuned. The tradeskills nowadays can make some rather powerful items, ofcource the balance is out of whack, you dont need much to tailor AWSOME items with tailoring but you need realy high skill that has a gaint gap to it from 115(where normal tailoring stops). <P>The Oposite is smithing, Ill just give an example of one realy hard to make item to show what i mean<P>Enchanted Platinum Full Plate Breastplate(supposidly the best smithable item in the game, supposidly)<P>Ingredients<P>3 Enchanted Folded Sheets of High Quality Ore ###<P>--- make one enchanted folded sheet you need 3 large bricks of high quality ore(which drops off mobs) and they are enchanted by a high lvl enchanter(regent for this spells is A JACINTH, and you can only enchant one brick at a time, i know that sounds wierd but the trades people know what i mean) then you combine the 3 enchanted large bricks in a forge with water to make a block(trivial at 70+) you can fail, then take that block and combine in forge with smithy hammer and water(120 trivial also can fail) ok you got 1 enchanted folded shiet of high quality ore, now do it 2 more times  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1 Enchanted Platinum bar(self explanitory) ###<P>1 Enchanted Chain Jointing  ###<P>---combine 1 enchanted large brick of HQ ore+ file+water in forge, then results+water+file+smithy hammer again, can fail at either steps<P>1 Royal Temper ###<P>(rain Water[off gnolls]+2 Essence of Sunlight[Rare of SGs]+ Griffine Blood[very rare of griffines] combine in still, trivial of 135)<P>1 Leather Padding ###<P>(LQ cat,wolf,bear skin + spiderling silk in tailoring kit)<P>1 Smithy Hammer(bought off merchant) ###<P>OK, then combine and hope you dont fail, because everyone is very sure its trivial is somewhere above 250.<P>Lets see, the stuff you actualy need to get off mobs; 10 Jacinths, 10 Large Bricks of High Quality Ore, 1 LQ animal skin,2 Spiderling silks, 2 Essence of Sunlight, 1 Rainwater, 1 Griffine Blood.<P>Stats of finished BP; 22 Ac and no one knows the rest because no one has ever even dared try the Enchanted version, only regular versions have been made(same ingredients just stuff doesnt need to be enchanted)<P>Lets look at tailoring just to compair;<P>Reinforced Haze Panther Tunic(rogue only)<P>1 Haze Panther Skin<P>(Haze Panthers in WL, rare mob, not too rare)<P>1 Yew Leaf Tannin<P>(brewed from Yew Leaves[Ground Spawn in WL] and water flask, trivial around 70)<P>1 Tunic Pattern(merchant)<P>4 Velium Boning <P>(Small Brick of Velium + file + Velium temper[30pp, merchant] combine in any forge, repeat 3 times)<P>Combine All this in tailoring kit and you get;<BR>14 Ac 14 Str 10 Dex 10 Sta 20 Agi + 5 all saves<P>trivial is above 200 but like i said before there is no gap to fill the 115-200 exept of your a wood elf or halfling<P><BR>Smithing needs to be made up to par to tailoring, in other words easier, with better results(costs for smithing rival that of JC)<P>Thats it for me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Gonodil Thecorpse<BR>42 Human Magician Smithy<BR>Tunare<BR>180 Smithing<BR>105 Tailoring<BR>134 Brewing<BR>ETC<BR>ETC<BR>ETC</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the above posters but would add one caveat.  Smithing can be raised through effort and expense.  Tailoring takes pure unadulterated time (and some expense *and* good smithing).  While the major tailoring hump is really a bear, the raising of tailoring in general is annoying.<P>Take the cured silk route, which is roughly as annoying as having to raise your smithing to make studded and then hunt pelts and make studs/boning.  I roll out to do spiders in EK for silks.  Six hours later I have 8 stacks of swatches (representing 160 silks).  Now I need to brew up 80 heady koalas, a true pain and a minor expense.  I buy 80 mask patterns and sit down to tailor.  I then get 7 skill increases at 199 wisdom, moving from 70 to 78.  Yeech.  I sell the masks for a huge loss on the product involved and move on.  This is all just making masks for skill, no player salable items are really created.<P>Ugh, so what now?  I guess I'll have to raise my smithing some to do the bits, studs, boning thing eventually anyways.  Still, tailoring is no joke either to raise to even reasonable levels.  Yeah, I know smithing to high levels makes you laugh at 9 hours for a few increases but I am sure I can get up to 130 a heck of a lot quicker in smithing.<P>I almost gagged doing baking and pottery.  I mastered (140 and 110) both in about four hours total.  Neither needed any hunted components (save the high-end baking) and skill raises were quick and easy!  Brewing took much longer but at least I have the booze to show for it. ;)<P>Faeril Tujim - Brewer of the Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The smithing trade is definitely out of whack. This morning I spent 7 hours making non-trivial armor and I got an astonishing 3 POINTS of smithing. The results of smithed items are sub-par also, with trade skills like jewel crafting totally blowing smithing outta the water. Get it together Verant please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>An excellent idea, jen_starling and a great example -Gonodil-.  The 3 top crafting skills are very unbalanced in three dimensions -- internally, between other tradeskills and between mob drops.<P>1) Internal inconsistencies.  There are inconsistencies in all crafts.  Jewelry makes noting sellable in electrum -- the cost differences between electrum and gold make it unwise to purchase electrum items.  Smithing makes nothing usable until you get over 100 skill.  Tailoring has the 115 gap, where if you aren't a wood elf/halfling, you have no way to progress.<P>Solution -- fill in the skills for these with items that are sellable.  Lower difficulty of weapons and make better non-magical weapons under 100.  Change the Electrum jewelry forms to make these different from the Gold and Silver versions.  Then some of these items could sell.  (e.g., change Electrum Jasper from 2 Wis earrings to 2 Wis bracers).  Add robes (from Puma, Mist Wolf, other unused skins), ruksacks (8 slot, 50% weight reduction), curiboli armor (plate look, but tan) and duffel bags (10 slot, 60%) crafting for all races.<P>2) Between other tradeskills.  Using the example provided by -Gonodil-, level the component costs among all three crafts to be roughly equivilent at the same skill level.  If an Electrum Jasper trivials at 92 and costs about 3.5 pp per attempt, give smithing and tailoring equivilent costs for items that trivial at 92.<P>3) Between Mob Drops.  The really unfortunate thing about tradeskills is that they make items that are generally inferior to those dropped from mobs.  The only craft that even has a chance is jewelry, and then only in specialized or very high ticket items.  Even the specialized cultural armor is not good enough to be desirable.<P>Solution?  Reduce the frequency of usable items dropped by mobs and increase the frequency of components dropped by mobs.  Would it really hurt the game if no more Ghoulbanes dropped?  Or Axes of the Iron back?<P>Just some random ideas.<P><BR>Mendel<BR>Rodcet Nife<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good points made...<P>The most frustrating thing that's been eating at me is how the components for Velious recipes, either weren't in the game when it was shipped (even though the recipes were) and had to be added later or still haven't been added even though it's been brought up numerous times.<P>Even though there were a few patches after the Velious release to fix *bugs* like faction, spawn/drops that were being abused, *tuning* of Siren's Grotto...adding components that should have been there in the first place still failed to make the cut.<P>I guess most of the people who do, report bugs, and spend a good amount of time on trade skills are normally too polite to get noticed on these boards.  By looking at the Bugs forum there have been at least 4 posts questioning if cod had been added this patch, with no response.  No one demanding or whining, just would like a simple yes or no answer.<P>It reminds me of the wisdom diety, and the change that was supposed to be made to make it range slot accessable.  Patch after patch went by, and all we heard was it didn't make it on this patch, it's done but just didn't get added to the live servers...ect.  Then Lum went to Verant and during his interview/tour questioned it.  While I don't have the direct quote's handy, the people at Verant seemed lost...  The next patch it was in the game.<P>I can understand that there are alot of issues, with tuning going on now and working on the Warrens...but I guess it would just be nice if we question something, point out a bug or missing item if we could get a straight answer in a timely fashion.  To sum it up the overall lack of communication between the tradeskill people and Verant is a major problem.  At least from this tradepersons point of view.<P>As far as balancing goes, I'll compare jewel-crafting (The epitome of craft skills in relation to time invested vs. player demand) and tailoring.<P>My tailoring skill is at 118, so I'm forced to work on cultural armor in order to improve my skill.  Without going into to much detail, the cost of what I need for materials per attempt is basically equal to what a jeweler needs to raise their skill.  (I need a emerald for mithirl imbued studded armor, and jewlers can make electrum emerald braclets which trivials at 118.)<P>Now all the jewler has to do is sit at a jewel vendor, buy/combine/sell...and repeat.  Over the last week I've spent hours and hours sitting in, or running around zones foraging or looking for ground spawns.  To sum it up if a jeweler spends an hour making jewelry just for skill increases, I have to spend upwards of 10 to 15 times as much time at the same cost in material expenses.<P>I could go on, but I hope my point has been made in a straight forward manner.  I hope at the least someone with a blue name looks at and acknowledges this post.<P>Thanks for you time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree<P>I hate the fact that the tradeskills are just money sinks.  Some people (like me) ENJOY doing tradeskills...  just because!  I did jewelry once.  I will NOT ever skill another character up in jewelry.  It is WAY too expensive and the time it takes...   Smithing is turning out to be the same way.  <P>Tradeskills are not for everyone.  Many of the people I know think they are a waste of time (you don't get any experience by spending four hours in front of a forge).  <P>Please tune tradeskills to be fun for those who enjoy them!<P>thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yea, I wish they would put some serious work (and serious work force) into trade skills, instead of all the minor tuning on spells and the constant issue of class balance (that obviously never WILL be balanced). It's OK to feel achievement when you kill a particularly tough mob, get an invaluable item or raise in level, but these are all focused around combat. It is a special feeling to be able to "create" something yourself, even if the game mechanics used for this are quite simple. To be a "master" of an art does for some heigthen their self etseem more than killing any dragon. Trade skills in EQ does in many ways discourage people from trying them, due to their uselessness. Trade skills should be just as balanced as classes, weapons and spells are. All the latter are working nicely now, trade skills mostly don't, and seem to get little attention from "high up" (Why else are 30% of new trade skill material not working when introduced in a new patch?)<P>If you read on the trade skill boards here and other places on the net, you will get a good idea of what is unbalanced, useless, and how many bugs there actually are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think more people would do trade skills if you could by the basic components for the lower level items at a vendor, instead of spending days smashing green snakes for EGGS!  What, no chickens on Norrath?  If you could do the basics of ANY trade skill just by buying the materials at a vendor, you would see a rise in their use, as well as a greater demand for the skills to be balanced and tuned.  I find it crazy that you have to spend weeks of RL time gathering components for simple recipies...totally illogical.  You can buy mountains of bread and muffins from vendors--but I don't see them farming eggs from snakes--how many kills would it take for them to get all the eggs for the backpack full of muffins I just bought--it too me WEEKS....bahhh!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree all  I left EQ for a small 6-month period, and I came back because I heard about the cultural armors.  When I heard about the types, I thought they were so great that they made me install EQ on my new computer and try it out.  Little did I know what the chances REALLY were of making that Enchanted Elven Chain I wanted to make myself.  I later found out that Blue Diamonds were 250pp a piece on my server, and that few people will sell them, due to the fact they they make awesome jewelery, as opposed to the level-inappropriate(for when you can get them, anyway) stats on Enchanted Elven Chain.  And I can't believe anyone has the patience to make FS plate, much less dye it(Kudos to you if you're one of those people who make it regularly.  My pointy hat is off to you).  And Ornate Chain is a joke(the fact that it has pretty good AC and is light is completely overshadowed by the high cost and difficulty that goes into making it).  And that's just smithing.  <BR>I'm not saying I'm gonna cancel my account or anything(I never will.  I'm still addicted.  swear, there should be some kind of federal regulations on this game. Or at least a warning label "Players who abuse EverQuest may become dependant" or something.  Seriously), I'm just saying that I think the 180 plat that went into this career may have been better invested in a Stein of Moggok.  Just needed to vent.  I really hope this happens.

</FONT><HR>I agree totally with this.<P>On another note, the reason people don't gain skill even at a reasonable rate with tailoring is because it's a pain in the neck to do.  The process goes something like this:<P>- Go kill hundreds of spiders in east karana<BR>- For each 2 spider silks, combine them to get a silk swatch<BR>- Go create a hundred heady kiolas somewhere (oh yeah, need brewing to do this)<BR>- Take 1 swatch, 1 mask pattern, 1 kiola, combine in a sewing kit and hope you get a skill increase.  Delete the mask (or sell for 6 gold.)<P>This process is to get to 81 skill.  Tailoring is the only trade skill (now - with the addition of almost all meats to one of the vendors in Thurgadin) that does not have vendor-sold items to get to 100 skill.  The only exceptions are class-specific skills such as poison and (I think) tinkering.<P>A tailor with 115 skill is considered a tailoring god.  Unfortunately, the stuff that tailor with that level of skill is miniscule compared to what they can loot from mobs.  There are a few exceptions (the panther stuff and a couple pieces of the tigeraptor stuff are kinda nice.)<P>Lewick Goodheart<BR>Level 57 Outrider<BR>Knights of Eternal Good<BR>The Rathe Server<BR>Master Fletcher, Smith, Baker, Potter, and Brewer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to say that there are so many good ideas and examples here.  Just go by the whine board and you can see there is a higher level of intelligence over here...lol...j/k<P>Anyway I have to agree that something needs to be done to make the tradeskills more worth while.  But I want to be clear...I am not suggesting that the items produced by the traders be raised to dropped item stats.  What I am saying is it needs to be made where the items are easier to make.  I know I am going to get grief from people like Herrick but I am not saying I want to become a master in under 200pp.<P>I have a Dark Elf Smith.  I started him solely to make their cultural armor when I heard it about the armor being added.  Well now that I know it needs a blue Diamond I want to delete the character.  There is absolutely no way I can compete with a Jewelry maker for these gems.<P>How are players who invest alot if not most of their time in trade skills suppost to compete with items that are dropped.  Answer is you cant.  Why spend hunders of plat fer Plate Mail when you can get Bronze fer dirt cheep.  Only people I see buy Plate are high levels who are starting new characters that they want all decked out in the colored armor.  And you will never see a retun for your investment on these items.  Banded armor is worth so little now you can in no way make a profit.  And forget if you have a bad luck streak and have some fails when making an order of plate, you are now eating more money then you made in the last month.<P>They need to make items that can either be sold fer a profit, Lower the trivials or drop the fail rate on trivial items to next to nothing or make a special trainer fer skills.  Have him near the market in town or make indiviual ones for each skill.  There has to be a way to lower the cost of learning the skill if these are the only items we will ever be able to make.  If you dont improve the items makes the items we make now easier to make.<P>Well just my little view of it all.  I really hope you guys look at this and give us a response.  Ohhh if its just going to be the classic "We will look into it" or "We currently see no problems with the skill and dont see anything changing" lines then dont post it we know those lines by heart right now.<P>Dakibus/Zakibus/Heimdalle/Zarrith/Seirnak</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just another quick question about the tailoring and Jewlrey Craft. I am curious why Jewel Craft was expanded when Tailoring is still left with so many holes for most races?<P>At one point in time I thought there were promises that the forgotten Tradeskills would be fully implemented.<P>I don't want this to be a rant, but it is very difficult to be cordial when certain skills (jewelcraft) get upgrades when there are skills out there (tailoring) with such huge gaps in the Trivial levels.<P>I would love to see an Oficial response on this. It would help to pacify us if there was a good reason for this. <P>Peredur</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There have been new jewelry additions, blue diamond jewelry and imbued gem jewelry. The blue diamond stuff is great, yet 90% of the imbued jewelry looks like it was made by someone who has never played the game.<P><BR>There are major effort/reward issues with fine plate, ornate chain and especially cultural smithing. Cultural smithing not only needs it's items reviewd but the whole rotten system. <P>Why would trolls get their armor from ogres? They're uneasy allies at best. Same with erudites getting theirs from humans. Why did you have to punish half elf crafters and not let them make anything, set their culture (human or wood elf) by where they sratred. Being able to use alot is not a sufficient compensation for a person who likes to make things. <P>Imbues. Phhfft. same deal. Some people use 1p stones bought from stores, others use 1kp gems dropped from 50+ mobs. How can this ever be balanced? Either you get screwed out of low end or high end equip. <P>Why not just allow clerics to imbue different kinds of gems, a sorta inexpensive one like emerald one for low end equip, a more expensive one like ruby for mid level and then a diamond or soemsuch for the high end stuff?<P>Tailoring is just too tedious for words. Hours and hours farming greens for components, auction after auction trying to buy stuff from lower levels. but they're all twinks that let stuff rot on the corpse.<P>Someone whack Yak on the head to knock out his damn obsession with foraged and ground spawn components. We're not all damn druids and rangers.<P>The major problem with ALL trades is TOO MUCH DAMN CLICKING. I'm typing this post after spending last week working up my smithing to 175 (made my twink some dyed fp), tailoring to 90 (wanted some 10 slot packs for the bank), brewing to 100 (used up all them spider legs to make gnomish spirits, hic) and THE TENDONS IN MY HAND AND WRIST ARE KILLING ME. <P>Thank god i'm using my chanter and not my bard or else i'd be crippled.<P>Some kind if menu with whatever recipes your characters are flagged as having known. (Read one of the smithing books, those recipes are flagged as know.) Then select that recipe and click 'make' and the components are auto loaded and combined. Turn multiple clicks into one. And /poke rowyl until he puts buying stacks as his top priority.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just couldn't resist a rant here.  I am a HIE and started smithing because of the promise of Elf only cultural armor.  Well, I got my skill level to 183 doing all the regular things up to and including Dyed Fine Plate.  At the same time I got my first taste of SoE trade skill attention,m when I found that my chosen God's imbued armor was no help for my class (+wis doesn't help a wizard).  <P>Then, aside from the fact that the temper items are almost impossible to get in any reasonable quantity, SoE (formerly Verant) has the bright idea to make blue diamonds into a jewelry item!  DOH!  This is the single most idiotic thing I have seen introduced into EQ since I began playing.  From 300 to 500pp per on my server the cost of blue diamonds has gone out of sight (though not as bad as on some other servers I am sorry to see).<P>So now we have a situation where only a small percentage of the imbued recipes work, the temper components are next to impossible for most smiths to get, the HIE cultural armor success rate is less (usually much less)than 20% for people below 210 skill (who knows what it is for higher) and it is next to impossible to raise the skill level because few on my server want Fine Plate any more (or are willing to pay a reasonable price for it) and it is too expensive to just sit and make fine plate to raise skills.  <P>The failure rates on supposedly trivial items always have been, and remain to be, a joke.  To top that all off the blue diamond fiasco has exploded in the face of HIE and DE smiths. I for one have quit smithing except for friends and guild mates (and even then only occasionally) and I don't have any expectation that SoE will do anything to adequately "fix" the problems -- ever. Thus, I expect that something that has given me great pleasure in the game up to now is gone and I do have an empty feeling I don't think SoE will ever fill.  My enjoyment of the game has suffered. <P>I hope the character balancing actually turns out to truly create some balance.  I also am pessissimistic there, but I will wait and see before I decide where I go from here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Of course,my idea of a dream would be the day where many weapon/armor drops were replaced by "A damaged bronze breastplate" or a "torn pair of leather boots".<BR> <BR>Want a useful weapon now that you beat the heck out of the mob wielding it? Ditto with armor? Get it to a smith/tailor to fix it! Or get me some of those ore drops so I can MAKE you some.<BR> <BR>Interaction is nil when the player can simply have an item drop off the mob,even the most common items-and more likely it's better than can be made for even a comparable amount.<BR> <BR>This a problem,time and time again. The lifecycle of gear doesn't exist. Thus,tradefolk are not needed at ANY point in the cycle. Items don't show up "broke",even ordinary ones. So nobody is needed to repair them.<BR> <BR>Smiths can make rusty weapons tarnished. Woot. Tarnished weapons can't be polished? There's a way to limit profits from this sort of cycle-the smith can only sharpen weapons he finds that way. <BR> <BR>But the best step towards balancing the tradeskills would be dedicating a coder to it. Yakatimza,namely.  If he had the free time to do this,as opposed to being the code monkey for every project along the way...tradeskills would get a great step forward.<BR> <BR>As it is,the man's getting abused on CoT when he isn't even being allowed to do the job most players think he's supposed to be doing.<BR> <BR>That's just wrong.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>YET MORE REASONS TO BALANCE TRADESKILLS<P>I think tradeskills need to be balanced and improved for a number of reasons.  When I say balanced and improved, I mean, make the hassle equal to the reward.  This has been partially achieved with tailoring.  The high end tailored items are great now.  And they should be!  Tailoring is a major, major headache to master, much less grandmaster.  I thank Tunare every day I log in that I have a WE druid, heaven forbid being a half elf!  Jewelry is horribly expensive to master.  The end products are nice; HOWEVER, they shouldn't be so nice when all that is required is platinum and a little luck for the really high end items...as opposed to smithing.  As high end gems for cultural armor can only be obtained through planes raids and deep level high end dungeon raids, the stats conferred upon the items they make should be much nicer and should create a similar demand from players as does high end jewel-crafted items. In addition, jewelers are able to profit earlier in their careers and can therefore blow 2-5K for high end gems. Smiths cannot afford this.  <BR>For those craftsfolk who must search high and low for components, a thought on stats and bonuses.<BR>Perhaps the mobs from which components drop should help determine the stats of an item.  For mithril cultural, essence of moonlight is required.  Most items from MM come with a plus 5 stat bonus - HBC, nightshade wreath, sac dagger, etc. Mithril also requires BDs.  These are dropped in places where armor has multiple stats, great AC, etc.. So, in order to be competitive, the stats should be increased.<BR>Let the hassle factor and risk and loss of time/money doing other things equal the reward.  This has been applied elsewhere, surely it can be applied here.<BR>NOW ...<BR>Having defined improved...reasons they should be improved.<BR>1.  Slow down farming.  Have you ever heard a reference to static spawns in a good sci-fi fantasy novel or other RPG?  Would you have read The Hobbit if he continually killed Golum (sp?) over and over and over for the ring?  The people who consistantly put out a product are trained and skilled in it; for this reason they can make it and sell it and the economy goes on.  You can't kill the same cow over and over to make meat.<BR>2. Slow the camping.  See number 1. and add...  I remember when EQ first went live.  It was much funner to walk into a dungeon just to see how far you could go in without you and your party getting ganked.  Now you don't "do" a dungeon, especially on a server like TM that's been around since day 1. You instead hear, "CAMP CHECK!" and hope there's a slot open somewhere.  In fact, LG is so camped, it's pretty much safe to walk around on a weekend, it's so camped.  To reiterate, the only place you should be able to consistantly buy a product is from a craftsman who has trained and practiced in that skill.  <BR>3. Curb the perfectly insane, INSANE, economy.  About a year ago, I bought gator legs for my druid for 500 PP.  A couple of days ago, I wanted to buy another pair.  2500 PP!!  The farming and camping are ruining the game for people just starting.  I wouldn't buy it on general principle even if I HAD the cash!  The economy right now is such that only high-levels twinks can buy decent gear.  They've pushed the demand up well beyond the supply  and can afford to pay whatever they desire.  Poor, poor noobs - really!  Meanwhile, the poor noob wanting to camp a pair can't get to it because of the farmers.  If player made items were improved to be commisurate with the level of difficulty and craftsfolk remained sensible about pricing, the economy might stabilize a bit, at least to the extent that newer players will continue to play.  <BR>4. Realism.  See 1 and 2.  (granted this is a completely fictional world, comprised of pixels..)<BR>5. Player satisfaction and enjoyment.  Some people like to hack n' slash.  Some people like to create things.  Some people like a little of both.  Some days you don't have time to hit Seb or Chardock or even Unrest.  It would be nice for these skills to be worthwhile on those kind of days.  If EQ is to be a hack and slash game, why put in trade skills at all?  Then people wouldn't have this love/hate relationship.  Put it at face value.  You hack and slash or you find another game, we just threw in some tradeskills as an afterthought so we could bulk up the manual.  Sorry, I'm ranting aren't I?  There have been improvements, I can't deny that.  Cheers to the folks bringing them about!<BR>Anyway, there's my 2 CP and my reasons for it.  Oh, and it would be nice for people to at least have these things acknowledged.

</FONT><HR>/agree!<P>I hear much on Blacksmithing and Tailoring, which I totally agree with.  Jewelery with Vellium is great, Blacksmithing with dies is neat, but the turnout is somewhat weak, and Tailoring gives GREAT items.<P>We've all seen that already.<P>I'm gonna hit on Baking, Brewing and Pottery, because they are hardly needed and I've mastered all three.<P>Baking would be excellent on these conditions:<P>1.) MINOR (and I mean minor) Statistic increases<BR>2.) LASTS LONGER!  This was the original idea, that some foods would last longer than others, but somehow over looked.  I think this should be changed.  One man spends 6cp on muffins their whole life, and another spends 2gold on another food and it lasts the same time.<BR>3.) REGENERATION (Stamina, Mana, HP) Small increases, nothing uber.  This would be nice and I can see it fit in easily with minor tweaking.  Nothing is better than something.<P>Brewing would be excellent under these conditions:<P>1.) Extremely Exotic brews stuff gained from quests, and other things, grants a slight str. increase like other brews do.<BR>2.) When your totally plastered you get a very nice STR increase. (wish this could happen to food)<BR>3.) A Few more fun drinks, maybe not alchoholc, but interesting names<BR>4.) Just a bigger variety of things!<BR>5.) Thats bout it, brewing is easy and fun.  It serves its purpose because you get drunk<P>Pottery would be excellent under these conditions:<P>1.) A MUCH bigger set of items!  The Wisdom diety is nice, but can't we get a few other items?<BR>2.) Maybe we could make a bride and groom for the top of the wedding cake?<BR>3.) Fun little things for FLUFF!<BR>4.) Utility items... though I don't know how potters are utility items.... BUT your Verant!! You can do ANYTHING!!!<P><BR>That seems to be it.  Please add if you have something!  I congratulate Verant on their ideas for balancing classes!  Maybe Mister Y. Will get our messages!  I appricate the Trade Skill additions, but more would just make me happy!!!<P>Thanks,<BR>Baralo Horehound<BR>200 Brewer<BR>179 Potter<BR>200 Baker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
