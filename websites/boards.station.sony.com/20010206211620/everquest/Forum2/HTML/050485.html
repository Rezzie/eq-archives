</FONT><HR>  SKs have a long hard road to level 30, driving most people away from SKs.  But Shadowknights are VERY cool post 50, great tanks, decent offense, not to mention the 44th necro pet at level 55 (I think its 55).  From a friend I have with a 57 sk...they become godly by 60. =)  And now they have summon corpse, too.  The exp penalty is gone and they are teh best taunters out there (darkness, dots, lifetaps, can't out-taunt that).<P>  So they are pretty sweet. But that doesnt change that there arent many of em and there's not that many to complain.  Probably the least played class would be SKs.<P>  Trilian Soulwind<BR>51 bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It has to do with the fact that there are very few high level SK's.<P>The lower levels are rough for SK's and they don't really come into their own until the 30's.  The best SK's are the TSK/OSK's... they've got lots of hp's making them the second best tanks in the game.  But under the old xp system, they were a massive drain on xp.<P>At high levels, they suffer the same offensive problems as paladins, pretty much.  However, unlike paladins, they don't share spells with the essential cleric, meaning the SK's spells are useful.  Groupwise, the SK's spells are very well rounded.  Vortex for taunting, FD for pulling, darkness for snare, invis to undead and regular invis.<P>Anyway, for the most part, those that stick with SK's through the hard years aren't the type to head to the boards and complain.  And if they do, like bards, there simply aren't enough of them to get noticed.<P>Basically, like every other class out there, the SK has it's good and bad points but overall, they've got no glaring problems/issues.  Middle of the road, I guess.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, SK's are far from 'godly'. We are versatile, not so much as a ranger or a bard, but good enough. Our versatility doesn't really become evident until 30.<P>Offensively, we are on par with a paladin (same skill caps as us), however, we do get a few spells that allow us to increase our ATK slightly.<P>Before 50 we are excellent at taunting and can be as good a puller as a monk. After 50, the other melee classes begin to do much more damage than us (rangers, monks, warriors, rogues and sometimes bards) making taunting much harder than it was.<P>Our quests are few and far between.<P>Shadow Knights are few and far between.<P>The one thing that would make most SK's happy is improvements with our abilities on large raids and perhaps a few additional spells. Other than this, most SK's are fairly content.<P>I for one would like to see hybrids, not just SK's, get the ability to specialize in a school of magic much like our parent classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I enjoy playing my SK, simply because I like the concept of being a warrior/necro.  It's not so one dimensional as the pure classes.<P>But from a objective standpoint, from a power/usefulness perspective, SK's fall a little behind the pure classes.<P>As a 55 SK, I can not even dream about going toe to toe with a warrior (As it should be), or a rogue.  We're pretty much an even fight with a Paladin.  <P>Our spells, to be truthful, aren't really that useful.  The Darkness line, is the one exception.  If no snaring class is available, then you'll definitely utilize your Darkness spells.  The rest of are spells are argubably, fluff or novelties, as they represent spells useful to FAR lower level characters and in most grups, the others classes will be overwriting your spells with much better ones of their own.  <P>In PvP, we used to be the "targets" of the caster class.  Easy Pickins.  Now that our HT has been upgraded, casters now have to be very careful with an SK, as one HT (once an hour discipline), we can severely hurt a caster class.  Which is great, as casters now have to be wary of the SK.  Whereas before, we were just big fat juicy easy targets.  <P>Thankyou Verant for making the SK viable in PvP again (even though I'm sure that wasn't your primary motivation).<P>Brega, 55 Troll Revenant, Vallon Zek  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>err...mehrdad..."well,a 56er sk can summon corpse at the same power like a 56er necro."<P>We now get Summon Corpse, true - but that's only the one Necros get at 39 (the one with the MASSIVE coffin requirements). Necros at 57 will get the far better Conjure Corpse spell, which we obviously won't see.<P>On the whole (especially now that exp penalties are fairer - just since the last patch) SKs have finally become a reasonable class. Now that I've finally got past 35, my Ogre SK is finally starting to rock - although all my spells are still very low for most of the mobs I attack at this sort of level.<P>The only problem with SKs is that we have an annoying habit of getting our spells resisted and missing our melee swipes. On the plus side, SKs are probably one of the only melee classes that can effectively solo if necessary. <P>Our pets are VERY weak at the level we receive them, although they're useful as a DOT and as a means of escape if things go wrong (useful tactic is to keep Shadow Step memmed - 900foot teleporter - then leave your weak pet to face the music while you get off a Feign Death or run to the zone).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Right now I have a 54 druid, 31 cleric and a 20 sk. The sk is a female troll (me so pretti!!! ; ) ) and is a freaking monster. It seemed like a good char but upon reaching 20 it is just devestating. <P>Of course, some of that may be due to some twinking but I only twink with junk I get here and there, nothing I buy for that purpose. My sk will probably never have really uber stuff, its in some rygorr now I looted and got lucky enough to trade some darkforge for. Upon reaching 20 she started doing up to 65 dam and the 30 dd proc with her Drakkel icegrinder 2 hand blunt. I was trying to get an FBSS but of course they are overpriced and I'm always broke or have nothing to trade. I settled on that 4 ac 16 percent haste belt which i traded some rygorr legs for. Note, I think I and a lot of players were VERY lucky for a time. It seems the single oracle which was great for easy xp and rygorr at the east wastes bridge was a MISSPAWN since after the most recent patch it is removed. In the meantime though a lot of people got a ton of rygorr since only the tunic did not drop there.<P>But back to her. Soloing she has less than zero downtime and the difference in xp for her since they patched is SO HUGE that I feel I'm exploiting every time I play her. She had just got 20 when the change went in.. and in 2 hours or so got 3/4 of level 20 done. So right now a troll shadowknight is the most rapidly advancing and fun to play of all my characters, ironic. There is just a huge difference between having had 60 percent xp penalty to just having a 20 percent one (racially, for being a troll.) People told me regen did not make a huge diff.. but for me it has up to level 20 and REALLY is at 20.<P>I don't regret choosing a troll for an sk at all now. In a bunch of odd stuff shes up to 198 str and good ac even with her 2 hand weapon equipped and really takes out the trash; I think str does help a lot that high cause she hits for the upper end max dam of her hammer A LOT. Later, when always grouped with healers, I'll probably wish I'd made and ogre who is even stronger with more hit points and can't be stunned from the front. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Positives:<BR>IMO the *coolest* class concept in the game.<BR>Almost as good a tank as a warrior, but with an excellent repetoire of utility and minor offensive spells/debuffs for a few extra 'toys'.<BR>Hardly any buffs, so you avoid the tedious 'rebuff, sit, med, gtg' every half hour or so.<BR>Good pullers - always on the go, hardly ever sitting and waiting.<BR>Harm Touch is excellent!<BR>Paladins are fairies!<BR>At level 1 with a rusty 2 hander you do 19 damage per swing ad infinitum, while the masters of magical damage do...erm....5 damage per cast, four times, then have to regen mana *blush*<P>Negatives:<BR>miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, ....Argh!<BR>Where did Jobaber go?....You have been slain by....Argh!<BR>Never enough time to make a coffee or roll a cigarette.<BR>A no brainer to play at lower levels in a group - most spells are so feeble as to be essentially worthless except as a taunt, so it's like being a second rate warrior with a light show.<BR>The lowest average damage output of any melee class except paladins (but they're fairies). Ok, maybe bards too - but they really are fairies!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes SK is the coolest class consept but as far as power goes we are vastly underpowered in my opnion.<P>I got a lvl 35 DE SK and guess what even with above avergae gear i still cant measure up to most other classes in a group, to tell the truth SK in a group is a under twinked warrior without all the nifty warrior skills like Critical Hits etc.<P>In a group the only spell that is of any use is FD and that is only when pullin other than that u are a warrior with less ac less damage output and less hp.  Even paladins and rangers are more usefull since they at least get healing and some buff spells that can be used when the healer is low on mana or in trouble and root or snare is also very usefull for groups.<P>What about solo u might ask?  Yes SK is one of the few melee classes who can solo, but very inefficently. Verant has made it clear that grouping is to be encouraged, and witht he recent group exp boost any sk will be crazy to solo. SK has one of the worst solo abilities in the game, so if u plan to get ahead in your lvls u dont solo.<P>So in conclusion if u wana play a "cool" class play a sk, if u wana playa powerfull class DONT play sk cause u are just in for a load of disapointment<P>Pav</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
