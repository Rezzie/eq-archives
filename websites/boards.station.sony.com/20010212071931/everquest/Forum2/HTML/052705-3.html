</FONT><HR>While it is true that the 40+ enchanter is going to have a better mana regen rate for me with clarity, I still want to be able to remove it if I can. I dont go hunting a 40+ enchanter just for clarity, I stick to what I have and deal with it. It is usually the level 29 enchanter passing out clarity like candy, because it is a new toy to them. But, like I said before, in order to get rid of it, I have to get someone else to debuff me, as my cancel magic is so low end, it wont get rid of it. That will also wipe out all the rest of my buffs.<P>It would be fairly simple to make the Lich line overwrite clarity of any kind. They dont have to stack, just be given the option for one or the other. that way the necro can take or leave it as they choose. <P>Talisson BoneDancer<BR>37th circle of Gnome Gnecromancy<BR>Dark Magi of the Shadow Striders<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;Quote&gt;<BR>Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells. As I noted earlier, I’m not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge).<BR>&lt;/Quote&gt;<P>Absor, please do not make the same mistake that everyone did regarding rogues, but in reverse.  Do not accept that an enchanter is a requirement because people say it is.  Look at the truth.  An Enchanter can take a mob out of combat, yes.  BUT, so can several other classes.  I have been in groups, as a high level enchanter, where never once did I cast a mez.  I felt downright useless.  In many cases, perhaps even most, it is a question of technique.  <P>Want to take a mob out of combat?<P>If it is a melee mob, root it.<BR>If it is an area where you can (like Plane of Fear), kite it around til the group is ready for it.<BR>If it isn't mezzable, Screaming Terror it (yes, ST mez's non-mezzable mobs and a single player - necro, can take a mob out of the action for an extended period of time.)<BR>Have a bard, druid, or necro charm it.<BR>Have a tank and cleric seperate it off and tank it.  <BR>Have a monk feign pull one of them ( I can't think of any mob that can't be solo-pulled by a good monk and pull team. )<BR>Have a druid harmony.<P>My point is this:  you assume that the only technique for seperating mobs or "mezing" is an Enchanter's mez.  It isn't.  You assume this because everyone out there believes that the only crowd control capabilties that exist belong to an enchanter - they do not.  Velious zone design is a clear indication that Verant believes this BS too.  In specific situations, enchanter's capabilities pale in comparison to a necros or bards or druids or monks or sk's.  <P>A lot of people out there still think rogues will steal from their groups, rangers suck, etc.  because it is a popular myth.  That enchanters have powerful crowd control capabilities I do not dispute.  They should, given the liabilties they incur from the limitations in their other spell lines.  What I do dispute is the idea that we are essential.  You can do without an enchanter, if you have a bard or a necro or a good monk or...  <P>I personally do not like to go into situations against casters without stuns or anywhere without snare.  Guess what?  That means I HAVE to have a druid, necro, sk, or wizard.  It also means my number ONE choice for tank is .... PALADIN.  Why, because the tactics I am comfortable with and the way I choose to play the game dictates this choice.  I do not have to take this approach.  I can play in just about any "configuration"  about the only thing that I regard as a requirement in a group is a Cleric or Torpor-enabled Shaman and some form of meat shield (non-int caster, non-healer).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You still missed the fact that we need more AC...as it is now we die too fast.  Perhaps raising our defensive caps post 50 might help some...or maybe another really good idea will be proposed.  Most post 50 Chanters will agree that they get killed faster than anyone else even when you are playing your class to the best of your ability.  In example...if I am in a 6 person group with no Shaman I have to Tash, Slow, and Mez.  This is an insane amount of aggro yet you have to cast it if you want the fight to go on well.  Even if you use mem blurs it doesn't help since they are broken.  So please help us out with some AC or more HP or something.  I'm not asking for a defensive cap of like 200...just at least something that will allow us to get hit for less.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that.<P>The answer to this lies in the cause.<P>The cause is downtime.  We all hate it.  And nothing drops downtime like an enchanter.  A bard comes a close second.  Both classes significantly increase mana regen rates.  And both are therefore highly wanted.  If enchanters didn't have clarity and wizards did, people would suddenly learn they don't 'need' us but you can bet there would be a wizard in every group.  And if every group had a wizard, then AE's would become more popular... and you'd end up with people complaining about how you had to have a wizard.<P>The reason enchanters are more wanted is simple.  It's bards.  They don't mez as well and they are limited in how many songs they can have up at once.  An enchanter can keep 4 mobs mez'd, have the party hasted, the casters claritied, and the mob currently being fought slowed, while having stuns available to stop gaters.  The bard can't match this.  They get a few bits of compensation.  Their mana regen song is faster and heals as well, for instance.  They can melee while singing.  But in the end, the enchanter is more effective.<P>This is compounded by the fact that bards are relatively rare.  The nature of their playstyle tends to make most people abandon their bards at an earlier level.  An additional factor is that the bards only recently got a bit of their mez problem fixed and most people are not aware of how well their new mez song works.<P>People look for enchanters because when they are 50 or so, the enchanter is the best for where you are going... you have to have him for his ability to control the big pulls, his stuns, and the complete enchanter package.  At that level, you need the power of the specialist.  Once people become fixated on this, they don't change.  They had to have an enchanter then, therefore they have to have one now.  They fail to accept that because they are now 3 or 4 levels higher, they can get by just as well without an enchanter now.<P>From my viewpoint, the best way to solve this is with two changes:<P>Nerf all forms of primary mana regen (clarity, bard song, lich, the new druid one).  Nerf them all to be less effective.  And then up both standing and sitting mana regen rates.  At 29, a person with clarity should be as effective medding after the nerf.  At 54, a person with c2 should be as effective medding as before.  Although some enchanters will complain about being nerfed, the end result will be a reduction of downtime for people in general.  The gap between a person with clarity and a person without is too great.  You want an enchanter because clarity makes the game more fun.  It makes you more active.  Active is fun.  Sitting around doing nothing isn't.<P>The second part of the fix is to make bards better mezzers.  There is nothing wrong with the idea of mez.  So fix up the bard mez'ing ability to bring it a bit closer to enchanters and they'll be a better option.  Bards are pretty close to where they need to be mez-wise, but I think they need just a bit more of an upgrade.  Improve the duration of screaming terror a bit too.<P>With SoV, Verant took the completely wrong approach.  Instead of thinking why enchanters are so wanted they tried to make us not wanted and figured we'd still be balanced because of our buffs.  The reality is that our buffs is what makes us wanted and by making us unable to do what we do, they've inflicted tedium upon us.  People will always want us because even if we can't mez... clarity, haste, and lack of bards.<P>&gt;&gt;Voice Graft: We should evaluate the idea of giving this spell to all pet classes, including enchanters.<P>Please don't.  We have illusions as our fun spells.  This should belong to necromancers and maybe mages.  Our pets are enchanted things, not intelligent.  They shouldn't be talking.  Call it a uniqueness thing.  Voice graft is cool, but it is less cool if everyone can do it.<P>&gt;&gt;Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells. As I noted earlier, I’m not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge).<P>This doesn't address the two counter points: <BR>#1: replace enchanter+cleric with warrior+cleric and you're doing the same thing, except against casting npc's.<BR>#2: this doesn't justify whole zones.  An encounter or two like this is fine.  But when whole zones deny the use of mez and most of our non-buff spells, something is wrong.<P>It isn't a matter of increasing the functionality.  It's a matter of restoring something that should never have been taken away in the first place.  We've always had the limitation on the 'encounter'.  Vox, Giants, Nagafen, Stone Spider.  But we've never ever been reduced to a buff monkey for an entire zone. <P>&gt;&gt;Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn’t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer.<P>Replace drybone with eye of zomm graphic and as long as it keeps the 25 sv fire.  Regular skeleton with a less impressive eye of zomm or some other look, and sure, take the look away from us.  Fine with that.  Sitting in skeleton mode is annoying anyway <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And give the skeleton look to the lute.  *grin*<P>&gt;&gt;Mask Faith:<P>I think the problem here lies in the lack of benefits of having a religion.  Enchanters will always be hurt more by having religion, which is fine.  But there should be some benefits of having the religion as well.  The problem lies not in the hardships the religion inflicts.  It lies within the lack of benefits.  Take it from a religious enchanter.<P>Tash Line:<BR>Pre-50, I used repeated casting of tash to get my pet involved in the fight.  It's got taunt.  I don't use it most of the time anymore.  Just mez and tash afterwards because of the taunt factor.  Not because it can't taunt well, but because I can't take the hits.<P>Anyway, keep up the good work and have fun in Baltimore.<P>Axterix En'Obelix<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ive said it once ..ill say it again<P>Greetings, i want to thank you for taking the time to do this to enchanters. we've needed this done for a while.<BR>ok i know this has nothing to do with anything but i just thought i'd being it up. in duels or competitions or pvp enchanters are kinda screwd due to Magic resistance. if anyone has semi-decent MR like say 50+ then our spells bounce off them and it no longer becomes a duel. its "hi will you beat me up?"<P>anyway on to the idea/fixes.<P>Whirl till you Hurl spins the mob on PC's but not Npcs.. one of the main reasons i bought this spell was to see mobs spin.<P>Gravity flux 2, Please bring it back <P>we need another Mana drain spell at higher levels. and our Mana seive should steal mana as well.<P><BR>Fear - All mobs receleive ultra super fantastic haste when Feared and not snared.<P>Pets. ok this i will have to explain. Enchanters do not receive pets, we get "animations" wich is why we cannot control them, however as a bonus for Not being able to control them, sence they dont have a soul or feel pain, they are essentually BERZERK, wich means they can go "Balls out" so to speak, as it is enchanter animations have INCREDIBLY low Hp making them almost non usable. any enchanter worth his or her salt solos without pets. so i would suggest drasticly incresing their average hit sence they Cannot feel pain and essentually are Spinning Dishes and daggers. i watched my 49 pet fight a Spiroc to half life. out of 100 attacks. 70+ of them were either Misses or 10 damage - 39 damage. only 30 or so of them were hitting for 52. sence it cannot feel pain and has no mind is why i suggest this. not to mention we cant controll it.<P>also as for 49+ pets, i think there needs to be More of them. necros get pets every couple levels. our 1 pet before 60 is pretty much the same with a Small ammount of hp differance... that needs to be fixxed.<P>also high level enchanters in RP, are not going to want to Protect themselfs with "Tiny daggerS" they would use Mithril Daggers or want to enchant a Spinning dual edeged axe or something, i think personally speaking of corse, when i started playing everquest. i looked forward to being able to pick up a weapon from the ground.. casting Enchant weapon. and have it float next to me this aside from illusions was the reason i started one. so we should beable to enchant weapons from our INV and use them 1 or 2 at a time. for balance issue they can have the Same delay as they would normally.almost any other online RPG has a class that enchantes weapons from inventory. most of us grew up playing MUDS and this is what people want. I.E. Weigted axe.. its what we do. and who we are  every class has an area of expertiese. necros dot like MAD, mages have insane pets with one katrilion HP and nice rain spells. we enchant things. its all in how you use it. so i suggest either enchanting weapons or new pet componants for better pets. our buyable Focus items if you will..<P>Effects - one thing this game needs is effect eye candy. its hard to get "lost" in everquest because there arent many more newbies left. part of bringing the Splendor back into everquest is turning BACK on my spell effects and watching the magic fly. <P>Bla bla is surrounded by a shield of words,<BR>Show the shield of words  if i was any level and i saw a guy run by me with a bunch of words id be SO happy i bought this game and my friends watching me play would probably want to give you their money as well<P>a lot of people dont say it but there are Certin things that turn people on to the game. Werewolf form, weapon Procs.. dragons etc.<P>Spell effects would be a Great investment in time <P>maby enchanters should be the first to experiment with these? for example to see what i mean. Cast Sentinal on yourself and hit F9 a few times. You are surrounded by a Sphere of Light. very very pleasing to MYSELf.. sad to say no one else can see it i learned. i was running around Felwithe in werewolf form with sentinal on and i thought id be a Comet. none of the newbies could see the light hheh<P>this is the kind of thing im talking about. sorry if im ranting but these things ive been wanting somone to see for a while.<P><BR>Illusions. DEFINANTLy more illusions after 44.<P>Sarnak, Frogs etc. Popular races are a must.<P>im all for Major illusion being any mob in the zone. weather its a coding problem or not. problems are esally solved once you apply yourself <P>the question is how much longer can you keep us happy? <P>Root - No matter what root we get its always the same. it breaks WAY too esally. serves absolutely no purpose after the spell "Root" itself. enchanters are using Mez in place of root. i've watched necros put 4000 damage worth of dots on a mob while it sits there and is rooted. i hit my mob with a 500+ DD and it comes after me.<BR>i suggest something at 49 maby like Feet of Stone wich is a FIXED duration root 1 minute or 2 minutes or whatever. by the time we cast Tashxxx we are ALLREADY on its "People to kill today" list.<P>Your spell effects: <P>Sometimes your spells get debuffed from people and you have no idea.like if you cast aug on a tank and a mage type dispells it. it would be Cool from a RP point of view AND an eye candy point of view if some parts of their body could Glow. maby their feet, muscles could look like they have glowing arm bands.<BR>sorry but for new ideas. this looks like the place. might as well get my moneys worth and toss em out <P>Charm:<P>ok this has bugged me for a Long time.<P>i have 200+ int and my mobs never stay charmmed for more than 5 minutes. 5 minutes is decent. but for 200 int ive had specters guard me for 10 minutes or so. a high level enchanter would have learned how to Keep mobs in Check. Random duation effects on spells is NOT the way to go all the time. this 48 seconds Fixed duration is emberassing. at high levels we need a Fixed duration of like 8 - 15 minutes our RANDOM charm with 200+ int is almost 99% of the time GUARENTEED to be more than 48 seconds. the mana cost for the assurance of 48 seconds is not worth it.<P>Summoning:<P>Mobs summoning me should have mana instead of "This mob has no mana to take" msg.<P>Memorize Location:<P>Enchanters are Mental masters. Psionists if you will<BR>we should beable to Commit a Location to memory and Beable to Gate back to that spot. it has a Spell effect duration like any other spell. Valor or clarity etc.. goes away in maby 10 minutes. so have that spell "Recall location" Ready to cast. i can see people abusing this but yet you wont have to look for for people abusing it.. is it really abuse? or people using their skills to the Utmost..dont hate me because im Gooooood.<P>Memorize Creature. this can be tossed around by anyone but ill throw it out there. <P>say your fighting the Ghoul Arch Magi. if you Memorize him he dissapears. you have a spell effect on you called Project mind or some such thing. lasts 5 - 10 minutes or something.<P>later you can project your mental Image of that mob in a Long duration charm. sence its your Mental image theres no chance of charm breaking.. its like an animation accept of corse it may or may not drop items. you should be able to memorize anything you can charm regularly. <BR>this would obviously be a high level spell. and no i dont mean 60. by 50 &lt;what used to be the top&gt; you've pretty much Established your mastery of your art unless of corse you got power leveld the entire way.. but it would be fun. to whoever reads this i thank you.<P>Banisher of Edgedhonor<P>-=The Rathe=-<P>in retrospect.<BR>Whirl till you hurl etc. does nothing. i can esally out taunt level 60 warriors no contest with tash. NOT an exaduration. take it to the servers and see. <P>think of the possiblity of taking our Swords..and making spinning ones around us. like a second or third pet. risk vs reward. our pets ..excuse me.animations have the LOWEST hp, train the hell out of people. super mega taunt, do the least damage. so...why not balance them by doing what enchanters are supposed to do.. why shouldnt i be able to enchant a weapon of my choice and have it float next to me. i cant think of a better reason to buy everquest &lt;if i hadnt allready owned it&gt; <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>&gt;Illusion, Wolf: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I’ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes. In fact, so much so that I don’t really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all.&lt;<P>Personally, I agree with you. However, IF we DO have a wolf illusion AND it doesn't grant a movement bonus (as is the case now), why shouldn't it work indoors?<P><BR>&gt;Illusion, Group Elemental (or race): A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race) to the group.&lt;<P>Please seriously consider these.<P><BR>&gt;Illusion, Change Size: Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller. This is something that I am against, assize change is really the area of the shaman.&lt;<P>True... although I have never understood why this works only in dungeons, especially considering the existing size bug whereby you see huge gnomes and tiny trolls running around all the time... it's just not possible to do it intentionally. Odd really.<P><BR>&gt;Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion): a spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature. Faction issues will most certainly disallow this, but it’s listed.&lt;<P>However, there have been several good suggestions on how the faction issues could be minimised or eliminated. Please don't let this get dismissed out of hand, as it would add some fun back into our class.<P><BR>&gt;Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn’t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer.&lt;<P>It's sure to make me hated among my fellow enchanters, but again I agree with you. While there is something cool about turning into undead, I'm not sure we should be able to do it. To be honest, if necros had no transformational abilities at all (they couldn't change into anything), then maybe it would make some sense for enchanters to have these spells (MAYBE), but since necros can, it just seems to me that it dilutes the class distinctions (something which seems to be happening with more alarming frequency of late, IMHO).<P>That said, however, PLEASE be sure to give us something back, if you take this away. We are already, as has been pointed out, shortchanged on our illusions as it is.<P><BR>&gt;Phantom armor: It would be awesome to create an illusion spell that allowed the enchanter to look like he is wearing plate. Perhaps a new spell similar to the magician phantom line (perhaps just like it) that has this illusionary effect (and we should also think of adding this to the magician spells...)&lt;<P>I liked your idea of making an illusionary visual component to our existing buffing spells. This would really add a lot of flavour to the class. I would like to see this taken even further, where possible, so that more of our existing spells are based on the "themes" of our class. I really liked the suggestion someone made of having a spell that creates a sort of phantom image of the caster that creatures could be misled to attack for a time.<P>Also, if you give a visual effect to magician armour (as you suggested above), please try to keep it along the lines of that class' themes. If mages just also get a spell that lets them appear to be wearing, for example, plate armour, this will even further dilute the distinctions of the classes.<P><BR>&gt;Enchanting Items: I will add this to the list as a reminder.&lt;<P>And more uses for the mana vials created by the thicken mana line of spells please. I think we all go to great risk to get those spells (I died many times, both getting them myself and trying to help other Enchanters) and I would like to see the rewards be more in line with that risk.<P><BR>&gt;Mask Faith: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. I think this is a bad idea. But I have a logical argument in favor of it, so I’m presenting it. I like the idea of characters having to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That's something that I don't like at all. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don’t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can’t get into if they have a religion), or making religion more valuable.&lt;<P>I restared my Enchanter long ago as Agnostic (after dying several times trying to buy Enchant Metals spells in Neriak), so anything you do to address this issue will pretty much mean that I wasted a lot of time and effort... but I really think for the good of the class and the game, something has to be done. Having 99% of all Enchanters be Agnostic is not a good thing (IMHO).<P>Unfortunately, I don't think simply moving spells, components and quests out of "dangerous" cities will fix the problem. There either needs to be some way to temporarily "mask" religion and/or there needs to be very real and definitive rewards to go along with the risks of choosing a deity (something which, I feel, the game needs anyway).<P><BR>&gt;Illusions and Link Death: Can we make it so that Illusions remain up during a link death (not during zoning, though).&lt;<P>I've seen posts both pro and con here on dropping illusions during zoning, and it just seems to me from a usability and personal responsibility standpoint, they should not drop when zoning.<P>Scenario #1 (as it is now) - If I am walking through a zone (especially one that has no visible zone entrance but where the zones change in the middle of wide open spaces) and I zone, my illusion drops and if there is a guard of some kind there, I'm immediately attacked before I can bring the illusion back up.<P>Scenario #2 (if illusions didn't drop) - I am in a zone under illusion, and I gate back to my home point, forgetting to drop my illusion first and am attacked by my own guards.<P>In the 1st scenario, the risk is almost entirely random, as is not tied to choices made by the character or to anything under the player's control. If the player zones, the illusion drops, and if anything happens to be there, then risk exists.<P>In the 2nd scenario, the risk is directly associated with the player's actions. If the player zones without choosing (remembering?) to drop their illusions, there is risk involved. The player has direct control over whether or not to take the risk. If they fail to drop their illusions, and die because of it, it is a result of their own actions (or inaction).<P><BR>Final thought: I've seen several posts here saying that people don't care about spells that don't directly affect combat, but I think EQ is about more than fighting things. Sure, that's a big part of it, but so are quests, social interaction, and FUN.<P>Spells and abilities should help us in combat, help us help others in combat, and help with quests... but, there should also be FUN spells too. Things that just add to the social aspect (like emotes); Things that add to the flavour of the class; and Things that are just fun (like voice graft, and mages being able to summon "party packs").<P>Obviously, these shouldn't take precidence over other issues, but I just don't want to see them overlooked in the run to turn every class into "lean, mean, combat machines". If that's all there was to the game, to be honest, I wouldn't be playing it.<P><BR>Thanks again for taking the time to start these threads, and spending the not inconsequential amount of time needed to read them all (I know, because I've read every post myself).<P>Cheers,<P>C.

It isn't just enchanters that are going agnostic.  Several other classes are being told go agnostic too.  There is no beneficial thing to being religious.  There are a few items in the game that are ok, but they only affect people who are forced to choose a religion (priest classes and hybrids namely).<P>Moving spells isn't going to solve anything.  Enchanters like being able to go into Oggok to bank when they are camping in Cazic Thule or going into Iksar for supplies while fighting in Lake of Ill Omen.  The fact here is that religions need to be made beneficial.  There needs to be something in the game that makes people say, 'Well, the faction is a bad thing, but I really want to be religious because of &lt;insert solution here&gt;'<P>I AM a religious enchanter and I face the results everyday.  My view is unbiased.  I experience the punishment for being religious and I can tell you that I would much rather get a treat for being religous than being forced to believe I have made the wrong decision as an enchanter.  As it is, the only religious objects in the game are focused on priest classes.  There are a few cities that give quests for clerics/shamen to get a religious symbol.  Any other religious tag is put on smithed or tailored items, neither of which are equipable by enchanters.<P>The only viable solution is to bring religon out of somthing being labeled 'a thing Verant added but soon forgot,' and not to make religion even more meaningless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Are enchanters too essential in Kunark?  <P>Perhaps, but it is because crowd control is as necessary as healing in Kunark dungeons.  Enchanters have a near monopoly on this skill...  <P>Before making mobs unmezzable in Kunark or any such "nerf" I would highly suggest enhancing the Bard's crowd control abilities.  <P>No, I don't play a bard, just a concerned enchanter.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Also, pets always stand nortwest of the enchanter.  Their positioning is only a problem when you happen to be hunting downwind of your favorite camp, at which point they will *ALWAYS* be in your way.  <P>Another way to make enchanters more useful in combat where they cannot mez is a mana heal.  For example, if Gift of Magic healed 50 mana as well as increasing mana capacity by 50 that would be a 3 to 1 ratio as the spell costs 150 mana.  Otherwise I don't see this spell as particularly useful.<P>~Inkantra<P>~Inkantra</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Seeing that the designers had a certain vision for their zones is totally understandable. I suppose that is the problem with enchanters and Velious. Its geared way to far for large raid type action (at lvl 60) so, our abilities as a crowd controller where subdued in order to have these large encounters take place.<P>Perhaps if there were more places like Howling Stones, Sebilis, Karnors Castle, Chardok, City of Mist (Notice i have named all of the higher lvl Kunark Dungeons) then i think we would be more happy, because we can have a very good time, in sometime some very hard situations. <P>But Velious doesnt not allow us to take a couple of friends and go try to see how far we can go in a high lvl dungeon. Without the 20+ people, its not possible to make the impossible possible with all the giant flagging and such.<P>Hence we are bored. Kunark is old now, Velious is new, we wanna spend time in Velious, but since we cannot preform our jobs, we just log out. No need for more than one enchanter on a smallish raid anymore because they cannot effect the mobs as they were once able to.<P>I don't have the time nor the patience to lvl a warrior (melee) or cleric to lvl 60 again, not gonna happen. SO what has happened, is my playing time now has been cut dramatically, and i ply more CStrike, and wait for the other games to come out.<P>BTW the enchanter has to be a good one in order to change the game as much as you say they can, because getting one that isnt as good, is a death call for the group. <P>Come to think about it, i suppose what i enjoyed the most about being an enchanter was the fact that we could give any group the guts to try something alot harder than they ever may have even of thought of doing. Thats what makes the game fun, new challenges, not throwing bodies, over and over, at a big mob. That is boring.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a level 30 Enchanter I have found it interesting that early on I could solo white cons and all blue cons, but around level 16 I began to have some difficulty. I would think that balancing would also refer to each class being able to use the spells given them to solo mobs that con blue or possibly white. An example is found in Oasis. Even as a lvl 23 Enchanter there I could not take out an A Orc which was 20th level and conned blue to me. However a magician friend was able to take them out at lvl 18 and 19. The group spells given to us are great, but I like to solo on occasion and unless I am finding low blue cons, I have a problem and run for the zone too often. This is disturbing to me. If I am fully medded and ready I would think that I should be able to take out any blue mob solo.<BR>So, Absor, please use this as a criteria that all things being equal, or balanced hopefully, any class should be able to solo blue cons and some whites. I know Verant is encouraging group play but lets use soloing blue cons as part of our measuring stick.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mmm I must admit i partly agree with Ralph post even if his opinion is a bit extreme. I've been seeing comming since Kunark came out the Chanter "nerf". It's not an official one, it's only a total and voluntary refusal to give to chanter any empowering spells, abilities or items past level 50. I've been making level 50 to 59 in Sebilis... Camping spawn like i used to do in LGuk with friends... I thought with levels i could look up to something new different or anything in fact. But nothing new has came from the expansions.<P>I play mostly for enjoyment (is it normal ?). The expansions are suppose to be new place to go for any one buying it but it's just no fun *shrug*. Raiding i don't say no once in a while but Vellious dungeons are all raiding places. Since i'm a slow runner i simply bind in sebilis and stay there since since there is no way to have any dungeon crawling fun in vellious. The kind of place you pop in and find some people aroud and decide to go explore. No. No way to go around invis, no way to mez around no single group camping ground. Oh there is an exception. Tower of frozen shadows is great. It's the only place i'm actually raiding with my guildmate (that are about 60 too). Most of them agree that it's possibly the best vellious dungeon (necropolis can be great too but quite a pain to get there when you are bound in Seb eheh).<P>All of this just to point out the major thing Absor is missing in his post, the players enjoyment. Chanter enjoyment is not chain death. It's grouping with a single group and go around.. And actually have the ability to bring his party nearly everywhere their allow them to (60 being the point you are suppose to manage nearly everywhere).<P>Vellious got no interesting spell, no xp (monitor dungeon occupation in Vellious it's very self explanatory). So i guess i will stiil be camping sebilis in 6 month *shrug* or most likely be gone eheh. Any way you make the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OMG not one mention of the serious PvP problems?<P>Absor please help me here. I can never use AE mez, AE Stun, G Flux etc. This is wrong.<P>I cannot kill PCs with over 100 MR even if they are 8 levels lower than me.<P>You have avoided the issue that many people have posted about altogether and entirely ignored the PvP issues relating to this class.<P>I play a light chanter on Tallon Zek which in general is played in a good versus evil manner, we suffer from a serious lack of chanters and clerics because they cannot PK except in groups (especially after all of the chanter PvP nerfs noone wants to play one). After being sick of never finding a chanter to group with I made one myself and I love the class. For PvE they may be very hard to play but they are highly rewarding. That is until there is an encounter against darkie group where I am useless for anything other than hasting and runing.<P>At least tell me that VI will look into the PvP servers after the class balancing is done but I consider player balancing an important part of PvP.<P>Not even considering PvP concerns me greatly because after the class balance issues have been fixed you will be making no changes to the class in general. This makes any PvP discussions moot.<P>Will someone at VI please acknowledge that there will be some work done on my class for PvP?<P>Will someone at VI please acknowledge that PvP needs work?<P>Dammit I don't think anyone at VI has acknowledged the existence of PvP servers since they changed the loot rules to coin only on the teams servers.<P>But I digress, this is an important issue to a reasonable percentage of the enchanter and EQ community that has been ignored for some time. Please at least tell us what (if anything) will ever happen to the PvP servers.<P>The time to address these issues should be before the class balancing posts close.

</FONT><HR>Actually, the only illusions I ever use are Troll form for the hp regen, and I actually do use WW form to practice my melee skills.  YES, I know I'll can't melee with diddly. YES, I know I'll never use them.  But I've so little left to practice post-40ish, I've nearly exhausted everything to learn.  My JC is maxxed, my specialization is maxxed, I know every language (Some I admit aren't excellent, but learning languages for me is used LESS than melee ;p), I maxxed dodge, offense, defense way back at level 20 or so.  So...Even though it's worthless, atleast it's something to do.<P>I don't WANT more illusions.  I never signed up to be an illusionist.  I wanted to be an enchanter, but I guess that's not what verant had in mind.  If the illusions are there to just be "fun", and have no advantage to the group, atleast give us some "fun" illusions to keep the group entertained during the downtime.  Say...Illusion: Stripper.

</FONT><HR>Isn't anyone worried about the current trend at verant in terms of the future of the enchanter?<P>Verant is basically telling us this:<P>1.An enchanter should cast clarity 2 on all group members with mana.<BR>2.Then an enchanter should cast quickness on all melee classes in the group.<P>After doing 1 and 2 above the enchanter should do NOTHING until those 2 buffs fade. You should not be casting mesmerize, it's too powerful. You should not be casting slow, it's too powerful. You should not be casting ANY SPELLS ON ANY MONSTERS, their too powerful. <P>Enchanters are a buff *****. Our job is to cast 2 spells every 20 minutes and nothing else.<P>That seems to be the future of an enchanter. Is this what you guys want? I don't understand how people can be requesting new post 44 illusions when verant is removing all in combat aspects from the enchanter. If you don't believe me take your level 50 to 59 enchanter to Icewell keep and tell me if you can get ANY SPELL (except tashania) to land on ANY monster in that zone. ANY SPELL that it's POSSIBLE to resist (tashania is impossible to resist).<P>Cast tashania on any monster in that zone. Then if you can land ANY spell on ANY monster there come back here and let me know.<P>I would very much like you to answer these questions absor. I have not seen ANY direct reply to you about resist rates in Velious. The only things I've seen out of your mouth is that mesmerize is too powerful. From your statements it's as if you don't think mesmerize should even be in the game at all.<P>Let me fill you in on a little history of the enchanter. Clarity was not in the game during release. CLARITY WAS NOT A ENCHANTER SPELL WHEN EQ FIRST CAME OUT. mesmerize was the centerstone around which the enchanter class was designed. The game was designed around the enchanter being able to crowd control with mesmerize. To remove this ability (which you HAVE DONE and seem to be implying will be done more thorougly retroactively) from the enchanter spell list will seriously unbalance the game as we know it.<P>A cleric is just as required as a enchanter. A melee is just as required as a cleric or enchanter. In fact there is only ONE class that is absolutely 100% required in some situations. I mean there is NO WAY to do this task without that class. NON. The rogue is REQUIRED to do several things. Not just beneficial, but required. You CANNOT even GET to some parts of zones without a rogue.<P>I really wish you would admit you are biased against enchanters and request another member of sony to collect opinions. Because your summary's have not addressed the cornerstone of enchanters complaints post 55. The fact that in ALOT of velious we can not cast ANY spell (except level 60 charm and tashania) on the mobs. NOTHING. We can't debuff with slow nor stat spells. We cannot mesmerize. We cannot cast DD spells on them. We cannot dot them. We can do NOTHING but cast 2 buffs every 20 minutes.<P>Can you please address this major concern. Right now level 55+ enchanters on raids are casting clarity2 and speed of the shissar (or wondrous rapidity) and then logging off and logging on a secondary character in order to partake in the fun. Is this how you viewed playing the game? Where a class is totally useless to this degree? Where even during normal dungeon diving we cast 2 buffs then do NOTHING but watch pseudo TV and not partake in game play in anyway shape or fashion?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1)  Our Spiritwolf illusion has no travel speed adjustment.  It DOES have +10 vs cold attached to it.  Please allow us to cast it indoors (I'm thinking primarily for battling Vox).  Regen on treeform would be nice too...<P>2)  Most classes have some sort of emergency get away mechanism.  Feign death, shadow step, spirit of the cheetah, bard speed song, evade...  Enchanters get memory blur.  The problem is that this line of spells is resisted, either wholly or in part, they have too high a cast time, and too high a recast time.  I suggest making the cast time for all of these (memory blur, mind wipe, blanket of forgetfulness, reoccuring amnesia, memory flux) 0.5 seconds  (or at least somewhere in that area, like spirit of the cheetah).  I would leave recast time (depending on how tests went once the change was made), mana cost, and resistability where they are now.  This will make getting away from certain death a little more probable, and yet still quite a challenge.  This would of course have no bearing whatsoever on PvP.<P>Thankfully you've already said you'll look into Reoccuring Amnesia not reoccuring.  Could I get you to also look at Blanket of Forgetfulness as well?  It is supposed to occur more than once as well, but the *blinks* message only shows the first time.. which makes me believe it is broken too.  Rain type spells have a message every time a wave goes off, I think these spells should give the caster effect messages as well.  It might also work well if there were some sort of visual around the affected characters (something that would show up just a little when particles are turned off) as a confirmation that the spell is trying to work.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>  Ok first off do not nerf kunark please!  Its the only place i can go to get exp, and at level 56 its even hard to get a group now in OS.  Did a who in OS today, 42 people, including me or 7 groups. Did a who enchanter got 10! That means me and 2 other chanters were not needed.  And sure our mez skills make things go easy, but all too often just 1 resisted mez while breaking into the chef's room means there's gonna be a corpse recovery trip for your corpse at least, if not whole groups if evac did not get off, or worse no evacer.<P>  What we do need are spells that once again make enchanters usefull to groups in SoV.  At level 55 I was in a group in lower Icewell.  We are fighting a cube when a Frost Spike wanders by. It conned blue.  Cast Dazzle, "that creature can not be affected by that spell".  Its all over me, druid casts heal, its all over the druid. Cast Glamour spell, same message. Frost spike back trying to kill me, cleric heals,(druid dead) frost spike all over cleric. Cast level 52 charm, "this creature can not be affected by this spell".  So tell me what good am i to a group??? (by the way we all died since i could not do what my class has been called upon to do for 55 levels)<P>  50% of an enchanters spells are crowd control, 25% of our spells are buffs, 20% of our spells are debuffs (most of which seem to have no effect on MoBs besides slow and mana sieve), and 5% of our spells are actualy offensive spells (dont get me started on how much they are resisted).  So with the introduction of SoV, you decided to take away 50% of an enchanters usefullness, and since we are rarely called on for our offensive of debuffing spells, that means enchanters are at best 25% as usefull as we used to be.<P>  In effect in SoV we are buff machines who have no other purpose in a group except to keep C2 AQ and GRM on group memebers.<P> Please please give us a spell that affects giant tagged creatures.  The idea of only being able to hold one creature with this spell is fine, but please give us something that allows us to control the crowds of SoV.<P>   I dont mind the low AC, sure enchanters die alot, but its not like we are not given enough stun and mem blurs to get mobs off us.  Its just with the huge MR of the SoV mobs, even our spells that can hit dont, that is another problem that has to be addressed.  If a kobold in VL can resist 3 mezes and 3 AE stuns even after being tashed, then you have made the magic resistance of the mobs too high.  (not sure if kobold would have resisted more, thats all the spells i could cast before i died)<BR>   I expect my spells to bounce off the spore king in OS, he is after all a boss mob so to speak.  But when common kobolds who are 5 levels lower than the spore king have the same resistance you are just going overboard.<P>  Every spell an enchanter casts at a MoB, let me repeat that because its important, every spell an enchanter casts at a MoB is magic based.  Any other caster class has a choise of different types of spells if 1 is resisted, ie cold fire poison, but enchanters have no other spell line.<BR>   Because of this we were given the tash line of spells, usefull sure, if not a bit of a hassle agro-wise.  But even tashed, the SoV mobs have a MR higher than our ability to overcome even with high CHA.  So in effect our spells dont work even on MoBs they have a chance to work on. Hence you can see our frustration.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When looking at high level mes overwriting lower level one -- remember we should be able to override bard mes, too.<P>If you give us more silly illusions, how about putting tabs on the spell book?  /book 10 is nice, and I can make hotkeys on an alternate hotkey page, but tabs every 10 pages would be so much nicer.<P>As for over-powered -- here's my spell lineup:<P>tash<BR>mes<BR>color stun<BR>color stun<BR>theft of thought<BR>reoccuring amnesia<BR>dd<BR>a buff slot<P>Three of those spell slots are used to keep me alive, all 3 required because one of them is an uber-taunt but is required before any of the rest will stick.  ToT perma-eats a slot because you can't swap it in and out.<P>EVERYTHING I do in battle is a taunt.  Now I have one slot left for buffs (2 if I get rid of my only offensive spell mem'd), and any mob in a 1-mile radius is on my case when I sit down to swap out that buff slot.<P>This is challenging and exciting.  And that's why we play enchanters.<P>But the fact that half my spell slots are used just to keep me alive for another 5 seconds should indicate WE AREN'T OVERPOWERED.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Vellious is land of giants, and giants cant me mezzed (for whatever reason). Combine that with high magic resists on many other mobs, and for the most part ( and I admit not all the time), I am reduced to clarity, garou, and celerity. Boring and frustrating to say the least.&lt;&lt;<P>Have you considered charm ? Works like ah, err, charm. I use it both on groups at the Orc camp (lasts FOREVER on centurions). I also use it solo-ing giants (medium blues). My record so far is 6 giants on one load of mana.<P>That said, it is a risky tactic. (Risk v reward). And on a couple of occassions I've had to zone with 3 giants on my tail, no hit points to spare, and having wasted an entire load of mana and not gotten a single kill. But hey, that's the fun of playing an enchanter :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor said:<P>"I like the idea of characters having to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That's something that I don't like at all."<P>I just wanted to point out the source of this problem:<P>"CONSIDER RELIGION (OR NOT) AT CREATION<P>If you wish to use your spells for secretive reasons, you should consider being agnostic. For example, even with the use of faction-improving spells, you could get into trouble with good city guards if you were the follower of an evil god, or vice versa."<P>-- page 88, EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark<P>I think I just saw someone backpedal into a dumpster.<P>Seriously. As someone else already mentioned, this is a problem that probably exists across the board. I’ve made agnostic bards, rogues, enchanters, mages (although I didn’t keep all of them).<P>Why? When it comes to playing evil races “it seems” like there’s nothing offsets the bad vibes you catch at good-aligned zones. After coming to terms with the fact that my bard would never get close to Nagy even though she worshiped Veeshan, or get to run errands for dragons, I deleted her. It’s a prevalent mindset from the writer/programmer point of view that evil gods don’t care for their subjects. While this is true at some level, any god worth his salt knows that he’d better keep an eye on things if s/he wishes to maintain his/her influence mortal affairs. This is true for both evil and good gods. It makes absolutely no sense for an evil cleric to get treated like a passerby on her god’s home plane.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
