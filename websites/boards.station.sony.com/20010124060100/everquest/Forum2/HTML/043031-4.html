</FONT><HR>Yes, bow damage was unintentionally capped recently.  We'll be changing it back when we patch next.<P>The reasoning behind it this mistake is pretty complicated.  Basically, there was a damage cap already in place, but it wasn't being used.  When we were setting up stuff for the new discipline we activated that cap (that's how it was intended to work when first designed, I guess).<P>Basically, we'll be putting it back as it was soon.

</FONT><HR>Absor, after rereading your reply I am curious about something you said.<P>You implied that the damage cap was meant for the discipline: does this mean that the *discipline* will have a damage cap such that if the cap is raised or removed from *normal* archery max damage of a normal double damage hit will not equal a quad damage hit with the discipline?<P>Let me explain a little bit more.<P>suppose that SkyDarkener max hits for 75 damage (and therefore 150 double damage) without the discipline. IF the discipline were used and a base hit of 75 occured, then since /trueshot is 4xbase damage if the original hit was double damage then the /true**** hit would be 300 damage. Are you intending to cap /trueshot damage irrespective of base damage?<P>In other words, If the cap is raised/removed on normal archery damage, will there be a separate cap placed on /trueshot, such that it will no longer be 4x base damage?<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I prided myself for being a part of the community.

</FONT><HR>Samin, you need to take a bit longer view on this. A whole lot of rangers, myself included, tryed every possible thing we could come up with to get decent and normal communication outta Verant, and much of the time did things in as decent a way as possible. It hasn't mattered one bit what the heck anyone says, or how they say it, we just get the cone of silence, and the occasional strangled admission that gee there might just be some little thing wrong, and that's about it. <P>Meanwhile data related to the class population suggests that yea, something is really hosed, and it's gotten to the point where it's totaly acceptable for other class players to treat rangers badly in the game, and openly /ooc insults they'd never consider saying about other classes in the game. It doesn't make for much fun, and I know for a fact you're aware of the the frustration a lot (but not all) rangers are having with the game. <P>Given that history and the present circumstances, should it be any great shock to you or anyone else when customer ire is directed at a service provider that's gone out of it's way to ignore & leave unaddressed problems that a substantial portion of the class population has had or is having? <P>Hordes of us lost the faith months and months ago, and have seen little reason to regain any to be polite about it. Given that we have yet to see a credible amount of the 3 C's, (communication, consideration, and change) and don't expect any anymore, ever, should it be any surprise that there's a paucity of goodwill? I don't think so.<P>Nobody likes to get dissed for what they play openly when they're playing on an ongoing and constant basis. Nobody likes to be excluded from groups on an ongoing and constant basis, but that's what we face every day. And people are still leaving the class quite regularly, not because they don't like the class, but because their playing experience isn't fun because of those things. <P>It's not fun to play a loser, and too many people, too much of the time hear that's what they're doing, true or not. And feeling like you're playing a class that isn't going to change, and has been "written off" is a bit much for a lot of people. It generates some bitterness towards those who have control of the situation & are able to make changes. <P>Personaly, I'm having a fair time with the game, it's merely ok, which due to a _lot_ of changes in what I was doing (including stopping reading and posting in this competative & ugly sewer of an experiment in customer service darwinisim, which reminds me *** am I doing here??!) I've been able to go from having a totaly unrewarding, NOT fun time to having something that's somewhat fun some small part of the time, which, coming from where I was, counts as a vast improvment. In any case, what I'm trying to say is that allthough I admittedly do have my own feelings on the matter, they're pretty majorly muted by a bit of minor satisfaction and a whole lot of detatchment. But that doesn't keep me from observing what I see coming from other people, and the previous stuff is what I've been seeing in terms of where some of this stuff you're refering to comes from. <P>Lest you think that's a load, keep in mind I reccomended people be as nice as possible and cough up real data on this one elsewhere.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mega.....he wasnt talking about this topic in general....he was pointing out the umpteen million times rangers have tried to have something looked at and have never gotten an answer. oh i said rangers when i should have said hybrids. i know on this board every class seems to think they are useless but the funny thing is that even those classes say that hybrids are useless and need work. yet no word from the boys in blue if anything can or will be done. just look over every page on this forum alon and see if you can count the number of hybrid threads of three pages or more, and see how many times a blue name has shown on any of them. that does lead up to alot of frustration on the part that hybrids feel that they are just ignored.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While you're fixing archery bugs please fix the way that critical hits (don't) stack with double damage hits.  <P>For example, a 'normal' hit is 1 - 23 damage with dam 2 arrows and Rain Caller, and the usual critical hit is 45... note this is an *odd* number.  When shooting against a stationary, non rooted target (which isn't blocked by tanks in melee against it) double damage hits are possible.  <P>Quite often (before the bug was introduced) the double damage hit was doing more damage than a 'critical' hit.  <P>What happens then on the 'once in a blue moon' occurence of a double damage critical then?  You might expect that the critical hit was determined and then the damage doubled... unfortunately it doesn't work like that.  The double damage is applied, and then the critical hit is applied, overwriting the damage calculated for the double damage hit... you can see this easily because although a message that "Your shot did double damage" is displayed, the damage scored *is still an odd number*... even my 5 year old nephew knows that if you double any number you always end up with an even number  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>This should be a relatively straight forward fix... just make the critical hit check before the double damage check, and then double the critical hit damage instead of overwriting the double damage hit with a 'single damage' critical hit.  Of course it's never quite that easy but I hope you can see what I'm getting at  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Guys, stop beating a dead horse.  They've done ALOT to fix us.  We have Jolt at a good casting time (though it would be really nice if it were irresistable for all those 100% MR mobs.  *hint* *hint*), we do a ton of damage, and the dodge and parry cap changes have helped us out greatly.  When the Tracking changes go through, we will NEVER EVER be out tracked by Druids or Bards again.  They admitted that they made a mistake on this issue (which is the issue that we were discussing) and it will be fixed (though hopefully not as Anax seems to suspect by unnaturally capping Trueshot damage).  Let's quit it with the "woe is me, I'm a Ranger, aren't I put upon" crap and get to work.  We're Rangers, we live, we die, we kill!  Let Verant work on the classes that really need it like Paladins.<P>Terrak Steeltalon<BR>Ranger Lord Outrider of Tunare<BR>Recruiting Officer of the Forsaken Conclave<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a question about archery. <BR>I have Discovered that I actually hit more often ,and for for more damage with my bow, when I'm running backwards, or kiting, than I do when the target is rooted, or snared, and I stand still to fire. Am I the only one who is experiencing this, or no? It just sorta seems opposite to how archery should work, where in the ability to take aim would increase you chance to hit. As a 48th ranger, I admit I am getting into my role as an archer late in my life, but Kiting has never really been to my liking...But with th addition of Velious, archery has become a major boon. The wide open area allows you to escape the certain death of soloing here, and actully allows you to kite abit, so you can actually often vanquish your foe. I have archery up to 98 now, and am wondering if maybe this is just a pre 100 problem<BR>Crenin Shadowbane<BR>48th Ranger<BR>Brell <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>And Illminded, not being pissed at your post about mine mind you, I was talking about the postings flaming Absor's post.<P>I understand how we have had a hard time getting responses and such. I understand how our complaints have fallen on deaf ears. I understand what problems we face in game. <P>I was merely saying that to flame Absor's post, was not only childish, but served no purpose what-so-ever.<P>Can you all imagine what Absor feels when he takes the time to post on one of our threads and immediately gets flames??? If you were him, not even starting to know what limitations he is placed under, would you come out and post on ranger post much if you knew you were gonna be flamed and told off right off the bat???<P>He said it was a mistake, and they would be fixing it via patch. What else did you expect from him? It was either good or bad, and it turned out to be good imo for us. So, what's the problem then??<P>The flame was uncalled for, simple. And to that I say, grow the **** up to all who flame him. This is a game, their game. If you have such a problem with it, then freakin quit and go play another game. Simple. But to stay in the game, and to b1tch and moan all the time, is an udder waste of time, and is also a sign of immaturity. Make your case, try to solve what you feel is a problem, then move on. If the problem gets fixed, great, if not, either deal or quit the game. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A quick question, and maybe a bit off topic:<P>I am a 35 Ranger, and about 5 levels ago I did my Trueshot.  When I first got it, someone told me that it does a minimum of 27dmg, or 37 dmg, or something like that, which I also noticed when I began using it regularly.  Maybe once out of every 10 shots it would do less than this minimum amount of damage.<P>I took a break from EQ, came back, and am now hunting in Velious, and it seems like all of my shots are doing only single digit damage.<P>Can anyone shed some light on this for me, and set me straight as to what is fact versus fiction, etc.?<P>Thanks in advance!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"suppose that SkyDarkener max hits for 75 damage (and therefore 150 double damage) without the discipline. IF the discipline were used and a base hit of 75 occured, then since /trueshot is 4xbase damage if the original hit was double damage then the /true**** hit would be 300 damage. Are you intending to cap /trueshot damage irrespective of base damage?"<P>I just wanted to ask.. how in god's name you got those numbers?<P>A bow's damage is the bow's damage.. and the highest damaging bow I know of is way less than 40.. with arrows... maybe 40.. I've more than mastered my Archery (Though its not at my level cap yet)<P>I just have to wonder where those numbers came from?
