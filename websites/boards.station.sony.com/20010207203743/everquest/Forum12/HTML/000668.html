</FONT><HR>Well guess what everyone? I sent verant an E-Mail about how all of us Wizards are sick and tired of not getting helped and some suggestions on how it can be fixed. The guy that received my email is going to pass it on to the Development team. The spells I suggested are listed below. There are 6 of them. If this does get changed I'm accepting thank you's(money) in the Karana server under the names Darba and Mendanbar. ROFLMFAO.        Spells: 1. Dragon Pet(Starts at about lvl 16) - Dragon pet that uses up a bloodstone or fire drake scale kind of thing. Can be ridden and turned into. The pets texture changes with the environment such as red in everfrost zones, green in lavastorm white in lavastorm zones, green in desert zones, and tanish in greenery zones.                                          2. Dragon Ride(Around 24) - A spell that makes you get on top of your pet. A combo of levitate and a small scale sow. You get off of the pet when you click the effect button. Pet must already be summoned. Cannot attack.             3. Dragon Form(Turns yourself into your pet) - Increased speed from dragon ride, levitate again, and a stronger meelee attack.                   4. Dragon's Breath(DD you can cast only in dragon form) - The only spell you can cast in dragon form. It can also only be cast in dragon form. Not very strong but should be about 50 dmg less than the spells at that level. Look changes with the environment such as in the dragon pet ideas. 5. Mana Buff(Lvl 16 like breeze.) - Pretty self explanitory except the amount of mana increased changes with the level.                         6. Mana Leech(Drains mana) - Its a dot except it takes away mana instead of hp each tick.     Thanks for reading this everyone. I hope us wizards get helped. If anyone from verant is to read this please think very hard about implementing this. Thank you very much. If anyone else has ideas please send it to burgess_bo@hotmail.com - Thanks again!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, makes sense. If I were the customer support person answering emails, I'd placate you in the same way. "Sure fella, we'll... uh, pass it on to the development team." &lt;crumple... toss&gt;<P>I'm not even going to talk about the fact that they can't add more models because of the memory requirements and a new pet means that model has to be loaded on each zone. (i.e. increasing the memory requirement). It's the same reason they're not giving enchanters any more illusionary forms: there's no more room in the original technical specifications which can't be changed for contractual reasons after release.<P>Anyway, it's a super wet dream.

</FONT><HR>Lazy Sunday afternoon and just getting around to reading all this. I don't like to compare classes since it seems pointless. I think the ideas you brought up a great ones, however slim the chances may be of actually seeing them live. Not only that, what are the chance of actually obtaining these spells? For example, obtaining the velious portal spells has been a joke. No need to mention why. Also translocate is a joke, on my server it is sold for 15k. hehe, I fail to see why this spell is even worth 15k? Someone in one of the posts in this forum brought up the point of how some of the wizard spells are hard to obtain and I agree some of them are. I hope someone at some point in time takes a look at our class and  realizes that we need some adjustments. In the meantime I think brainstorming as this fellow did is an important thing to keep doing. Someone will listen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehe the dragon pet is funn but yah never going to happen.  actualy i love my wizard i have a lot of fun playing her and with people on my server. i curently have gotten her to lvl 54. now if they realy want to ballance the wizard i think this can be done in several diferent ways. one would be to make the high lvl dd spell (34+) have better mana to damage ratios dont change the damage or cast times but reduce the amount of mana. two on roots LOEWer the amount of time its resisted. they use the reson I say this is as the wizard we TOTAL depend on our mana for our damage and we dont realy stand out in that respect.  as for my seconed part the resist on root is rediculas. now im going to use  an example of what happend to me. now rember i am a 54th lvl wizard.  ok i went to help some guild members kill the avator of fear lvl 34 or so. ok i know hes fast and in his room i cant realy bof him in order to stay away  so i decide to root him and use drought expecting it to break and have to re root. thats fine no problems right?  Wrong i root(imobilize) him resist root resist root resist meenwhile im being hit. so after 6 trys i figure heck ill just blast nooo  I am getting interupted every time on any spell over 2 sec so i try to root 4 more times resists on all. so I try and gate interuped 3 times now my mana skin is gone and im am out of health, see dead. What was the problem here was it that i dont have the magical skills. nope over 200 on alt so a root, to low lvl for mob ? lol I should have been able to hold him at least once!! now when i hit 34 i almost never rooted because the root gets resisted alot and doesnt hold in nukeing (wich is fine) bof gets resisted a lot less and at that lvl has a long enf time that you can cast your other fast dmg spells ie not ice comet. but bof or atols isnt real use full in dungeons were you cant run far or you agro other mobs. now I have noticed that root spell get resisted a lot on any mid to high lvl mobs or when they do stick on a  mid to high lvl mob they dont last long enf even without nuking to do anything. i have tried this with all of the root line spells that i have as a wiz root, imobilize, paralizing earth ect. well i have come to the conclustin that there resist and dureation not counting breakage is WAY messed up. <BR>am i going to stop playing my wizard because of those issues? NO! i have fun playing my wizardress but its not because im the MASTER of combat damage  even if i was the master of damage as the manueal states that wouldnt be why i would play my wizard its because of the friends i have in eq. however it would be nice to be a little mor balleced with the other casters and even the meele typs  (if you want a exp group get a few rougs and a monk they seem to out damage any caster group i have ever been in)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey I've got a COOL idea, we could give wizards pets at multiple levels. Now I know this sounds powerful so we would have to weaken the DD a little bit and then maybe drop a couple of the utility spells. But heres the idea We cast spells that use differnt elements like fire and cold so we should be able to use them as living entities for our pets!<P>ummm... or we could just play magicians....

</FONT><HR><BR>What this guy is suggesting is fine.  However, that is not the point of the game to have all the powers available to one class.  What he seems to want is just one caster class with all the powers.<BR>I plat a mage on MT he is high 40s and has a lot to ***** about, however verant does do a fairly good job at balancing.  Wizzies get root, fast dd, teleports, and Harvest.  If he wants pets, play a necro, chanter, or mage.  If I wanted root, tps and other wizzy stuff I would have made a Wizzy.

</FONT><HR>OMG i read the entire posts on what folks wish to see change for wizards and not one spot did i see Anything about changing our reliability. i am a 51 wizard and the biggest thing i find  in my adventures is that i can blow a whole bar of mana on a level 1 mob that resists every damn spell.<BR>Ok  let me get this straight. We are the Most powerful magic users in the game?<BR>Wait  i know i read that somewhere......hmmmm<BR>look. In every circumstance a wizards culmination of exp skill and level should be balanced. <BR>If my spell gets resisted I dont lose mana for it<BR>or at least not as much  as  lets say a Mage of the same level. hrmm wait mages havew malaise  which allows them to lower the mobs resistances..<BR>no it doesnt. i have used up a full bar of IC and did maybe 2000 points of damage to a Frog. whats wrong here?<BR>If i fizzle which i shouldnt. since my skill is maxed in evocation  I lose the entire spells amount of mana also.<BR>Hrmm  no wheres the reliability in that?<BR>Most clerics Dread having a wizzy in the group because they know  the root spell will agro the mob more than any warrior damage and end up haveing to use all his mana to heal the wizard.<BR>but wait  that root  you shouldnt be hit.<BR>umm  well thats what they call the spell<BR>doesnt seem to be the case  id call it  "piss off the mob"<BR>same goes for the Stun spells<BR>works great  for  making **** mad<BR>doesnt work though<BR>you every cast tishans clash on a rat?<BR>yes a level 1 rat<BR>yup  got resisted<BR>oh and when i do get it to take  it doesnt stun anything  <BR>now markers clash has a bit of stun to it<BR>now im rambling<BR>ok  the biggest thing is this<BR>any class can run, drink water , eat food , change out weapons, armor , chat , do what ever and swing a sword ,  but just have a caster try to take one step casting a spell.<BR>This is the biggest thing in all cases<BR>Wizards Are supposed to be Powerful<BR>how about allowing us to take a Little bit of a whack or a few steps and still cast a spell.<BR>This at least will make us some what usefull<BR>but until they decide to do us a favor and re evaluate our class i will happily play my warrior<BR>At leas twith him i can get a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Other classes have methods of dishing out damage even once mana is gone, either in form of a pet, charmed mob, or melee.  <P>The solution, have our mana regen faster than other casters, rather than adding a pet of any sort.

</FONT><HR>I quit and restarted EQ.  I played a wizard from release for about a year then quit for a year and then started up again a couple of months ago.  Anyway, The dragon idea is awesome, but you're not the first one.  Actually i beleived as my newbie self that wizards got their only pet at lvl 49 (back when 50 was the max) that was a summonable dragon!  This and the promise of extreme and superiour DD are what motivated me to be a wizard.  Saddly, i later learned that wizards never get pets and never will. I was completly dissappointed.  Anyway, now nearly 2 years later, I gave up DD for massive DoT and pets. (I'm a necro) and i'm happy.  Anyway, giving a wizard these abilities would eliminate mages.  Think.  Mages, second DD and master pets.  Who would play a mage if wizards summoned pet AND did more DD?  No one in their right mind.   Also, think of the revamps required to zones in order to do this 8P.  Last, the benifits that the spells you suggest provides tramples all over other classes. Druids, enc, necros, mages.  There is NO way verant will consider this.  The thing i would like to see is that stupid flaming sword pet be a drake instead.  No change on the actual effect of the spell, just the image change.  You are the almighty wizard! power of magic, cold and fire! You summon a mighty...flaming sword?  8P </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; well as to the memory prob,they did give mages<BR>&gt; monster summoning spell and that is a different<BR>&gt; mob in each zone.<P>The reason the monster is different in every zone is because the pet is pulled from the models that are already loaded FOR THAT ZONE. What this moron's suggesting is that they add another global model to every zone... which they can't do, and have said repeatedly that they won't do.<P>&gt; the dragon idea is far<BR>&gt; fetched,but hey atleast he is trying to be<BR>&gt; heard.i never bash someone who is trying.<P>So by your statement, you wouldn't stop a 9-year old from "fixing" your car. After all he's trying right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000668&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000668&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
