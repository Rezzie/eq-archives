</FONT><HR>I had an idea that I thought might be kind of fun for a player, and maybe bring them a little new outlook on the game, and a new avenue for roleplaying.<P>Upon reaching a preset level, of say 40 with your character, you get a BONUS character, a player MOB, which you can play whenever you want.<P>TRAITS and stats of this MOB:  You are confined to one zone, but all of the mobs of your race can communicate with each other.  (Think a smart orc camp)  Any players going into the SMOB zone (smart MOB) knows that they are facing players controlling mobs, and not a computer program.  These MOBS will not be UBER powerered, as it IS a players game after all, and the zone will have safe zones with guards and the like, places to shop, heal and join a group.<P>Thus players going into SMOB zones will know to look out for:<BR>Organzied attacks<BR>Ambushes<BR>TRAPS (woo hooo...look at me...solo lonely mob wandering about aimlessly...attack me and watch me run....RIGHT INTO MY FOUR other buddies waiting in the bushes!)<BR>AREA WIDE SMOB Communication.  Your Smob can talk to all other SMOBS.<BR>The only PLAYER chat a SMOB would hear is SHOUTS, and being a SMOB, not know what it says (not speaking the language), but hearing an area-wide shout would lead SMOB to shouter's location: Player_01 is shouting to the right and behind you, about  xxx parsecs away.  (that should cure useless shouts, eh?)<P>These SMOBS would only be able to group in groups of say FOUR, and be unable to engage others already in battle.  (Explantion) Not be able to jump in on an already in progress battle by another mob of four.<P>Spells such as LULL would still work.  SMOB_01 wants to help buddies, but feels too lazy to join in.  When the SMOB dies, it spawns down a long corridor, that it needs to go back down to get back into play.<P>AUTO ATTACK is ALWAYS on, and anything in your Agrro zone will be attacked by SMOB, and SMOB does attack while running.  This prevents SMOB players from just taking a dive to help friend players.<P>You would get 4 SMOB choices, depending on your current class.  A fighter, A Caster, A quickling, or an UBERSMOB.<P>The zone would be NORTH KARANA-sized, thus keeping higher and lower smobs in their areas.<P>SMOBS can zone, but at a magical Routing penalty, shall we say.  This means a MOB can venture out of its range zone, but takes a penalty hit, due to being away from home earth..the further it goes, the more damage it takes, and a zoned mob cannot be looted. (again that player friend thing).<P>SMOBS feed on grubs, and drink stream water (or player blood), can use ANY abandoned weapons they find dropped, and are given a random item when reborn.<P>Oh yea, all players look roughly the same to you (like all orcs look alike), and no names are revealed, just a HUMAN Paladin tag.  Thus preventing unkind SMOBS from targeting players they dislike.<P>So?  Do I just think too much here?  If you were given this chance, would you play the zone, would you be a SMOB?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why would a player rather play this MOB than their own character?  Most EQ players have real lives, and therefore limited time to play, so the only thing this would accomplish is to prevent your character from ever gaining levels. If you get bored hunting MOBs and want more PvP action, then start hanging around arenas or start a new character on a PvP server.  <P>Most players simply make a second character which is very different from their primary, giving a nice change of pace to their play style.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, it would be kinda cool to play a MoB for once. Not an ubermob like a dragon, but just an orc. How could you surprise them with new tactics. Sure, I wouldn't play an orc for hours and hours, but for a saturday evening for a break? Sure.... :-)<P>But as great as I personally belive it would be, as few are the chances that it will be implemented. Maybe in EverQuest 2 you will have more choices or races, but till then?<P>Anyway, I like the idea. :-))<P>Ellegon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Chance, it is kind of a cool idea...but it is very much not EQ.  I love the idea, you should probably put it over in wish list...I don't think the staffers hang out here much.<P>Essentially, this would be a player-run-GM-event zone.  My thinking would be that the whole thing would have to be like an arena, no exp, no exp loss, and no skill improvement.<P>There would also have to be firm limits on how many people could be there, both SMOBs and PCs.  Zoning in to find 20 orcs camping the zone would be no good.<P>"why would...have a life" - Well, my friend, get  a couple (or a bunch) of chars into the 50's, you will feel better about being able to play something radically different.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>RE: And you respawn to find someone camping the spawn point.<P>Got that covered.  Spawn point is a SMOB safe zone like the players have.  As an example too, players camp on area of ORC camp, and the ORC has many ways to bolt if they were smart.  I guess on the other hand, the SMOBS could spawn all over the place, thus preventing camping points.<P>I don't know, but I would get a kick out of being a new MOB, trying to at least make the battles challenging.  The downside is that maybe the SMOB cannot advance like a player can, and there would be no growth. Additionally, the SMOBS role would be to Die OVER and OVER again. <BR>I would however like to take a break once in a while from questing for greatness, just to have me and three other ugly smelling SMOBS lay a trap and ambush on someone.<P>Being a SMOB too would be funny for players, as the Smob could have special emotes, and actions.  We all know EXACTLY what the ORCS and Dervs will say on dying, but a SMOB?<P>SMOB_01 wimpers and begs for mercy at your feet, please don't kill i! i just want chance to have family, no kill i, no please oh mighty human.<P>SMOB_01 tips his rather ratty looking hat, totters, and falls, while planting a spit in your face.  May your kind be forever cursed to look like YOU, SMOB_01 insults<P>SMOB_01 does a happy dance at seeing your camp point.  /SHOUT C'mon puny humans...send us your puller, we are VERY hungry you sorry excuses for your race!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>RE:Essentially, this would be a player-run-GM-event zone. My thinking would be that the whole thing would have to be like an arena, no exp, no exp loss, and no skill improvement.<P>Very true!  Could be a nice change of pace at times, and I never thought up the SMOB camping zone idea before, though the look on a soloist's face would be priceless to see as they zoned and 200 SMOBS are standing there.  <BR>PLAYER_01 Soils themself...<P>I did think that the SMOBS should have a ranging zone, unless provoked.  That was the player safe zones could be left, then a little bit of unzoning travel to get to SMOB town.<P>SIDE NOTE, out of boredom yesterday, as I left West Commons, there was an ORC pawn.  I put on walk, and quickly set up a hot key.  I walked next to him, and did /says don't kill him, we are dating...and walked halfway through the zone side by side, me at 17 level never agrroing him.  He finally walked into a guard and got trashed.  I thought we made a cute couple.  hahaha</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=006212&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=006212&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
