</FONT><HR>Texture, do you really think that you are getting these auctions shut down? I honestly think that since they told ebay they no longer want items auctioned that they are looking to see whats posted. Believe it or not, people at Verant and Sony know how to do a search in ebay. Instead of wasting your time with this, why don't you login to EQ and play the game. Are you waiting for a pat on the back or something. "Thothren pats Texture on the head and sends him out to play with his play-doh". The people at Verant are probably tired of having to answer all your emails, no wonder no one can get a reply to real issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Shadowbane, Camelot, and etc will come out and they have all pledged to either support or not care about Ebayers and what they do. I hate to tell you guys this but EQ will most likely lose 50 to 70% of their players to this game. "<BR> <BR>Suuuuuure they will. Just like everybody was supposed to quit when Diablo II came out, right?<BR> <BR>Now let me tell YOU something. All these companies who say they will allow or ignore Ebay sales will have a HUGE freaking wake up call - when their total server populations are but a tiny fraction of what EQ is and those that DO play their games are the lowest common demoninator of gamer - the farmers and grief players.<BR> <BR>Some of these game will be PvP. If some 13 year old can make playstation II money from ganking every casual player who comes into the game - all that will happen is all the legitimate players will leave... and leave in DROVES. In-game profit is a bad idea to start with but when you inject PvP into it then it becomes an atomic bomb ready to go off. The companies will learn this, the hard way if neccessary.<P>The fact is this -<BR> <BR>--The majority of gamers do NOT want to play a game that has been turned into a business--<BR> <BR>People do not like the idea of in order to "move ahead" in a game you have to fork out real life cash for imaginary items. This concept doesn't fly. It would be like playing online chess and being able to buy an extra queen with your credit card. This takes the whole point out of playing the game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, I'll deal with thte copy right issue. "Verant owns the items". Big friggin' willy wank. Don't ask me what that last line meant, keeping this PC. Universal (last I checked) owned the copy right to every Universal movie I ever rented/bought or, and here's the kicker, sold. You can hold copy right to an idea, ie what's in a book, but not the book itself. If you want to transfer a copyrighted work, go for it. <BR>Second, if it's not illegal, why is Ebay taking down auctions? Because Verant whined to them. Bullied 'em a bit, and Ebay doesn't want the bad publicity. <BR>Third issue...I live in Nashville, Tn. Hi peeps that know me. As of right now, we don't have a lottery. However, you can buy this tacky thin cards with pictures of dogs and cats on 'em. Some have boats and cars, too. All of 'em come with free scratch off stickers. Put that on your mirror and sniff it. <BR>Fourth!!! Although I am not a member of Ebay, in about 40 levels I shall be selling my collection of Everquest action figures. I have a digital representation of them I made myself and retain copyright to using the EQ gaming engine. Screenshots will be available, aprox level of each shall be 60 with some nice items. Ok, this prolly isn't true, I'll get irritated and go to one of the cooler games coming out, but it's a nice example. I retain copy right to my characters, formed from my imagination. I don't care if anyone auctions it or not, I can't stand to see someone's right being taken away. On that note, I bid the adieu.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick post of my 2cp...<P>- I think banning the sale of items, if it were possible - would improve gameplay.<BR>- I don't think they can ever really stop it from happening, they will simply fragment it into smaller markets.<BR>- VI can put whatever they want in their EULA, and ban any account for any reason, so complaining about that seems rather pointless.<BR>- I am not a lawyer, but the thought has ocurred to me that PLAYERS CAN ONLY SELL THEIR TIME. What I mean by this is that the transfer of an item in game is not transfer of ownership or even really possession. VI still owns the data represented by  those accounts and items. You can't sell what you don't own or have. You have to make a pretty large leap to define character possession as personal possession, since by all reasonable terms you can't do anything else with a game item but use it in the game. Even intellectual property has other applications - these items have NONE. Thus, I would add the argument that it is possible only player time has ever been sold by players. If anything they are guilty of misrepresenting their product.<BR>- most are happy that verant is doing trying to stop this (I am one), but in reality the problem exists because of design flaws in both trading and the economics of the game. VI completely controls this experience. I don't think they anticipated this problem, or they would have designed certain things differently. So I just want to offer the perspective that VI has produced a product that is arguably psychoaddictive (ie. FUN to the point of personal neglect), and these people are merely operating within the system created by VI. Furthermore, VI still has the power to change drop types, drop freqencies, the way camping and the way trading is done in the game - remember that they completely control this experience. This 'external' solution is probably not going to work simply because the demand exists. You can't really stop economic laws folks. <P>So..just my 2cp. Not sure it contributed much to the discussion, but I hope so.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>To start off, I'd like to say that I have ALOT of money IRL.<P>I'm a pretty high level in EQ, but I dont farm FBSS's for money in the game.  Why? Because I dont need to, I can just buy stuff on ebay, so why use in game money?<P>Well, by forcing me to farm FBSS's in game to get the money to buy these items, you're shooting yourself in the foot.  Because that's exactly what I'm gonna do. <P>For example, I was about to buy a manastone for 400 bucks but now that I cant, I need to spend this week farming FBSS's to get the 60,000pp needed to get that manastone.<P>My point is, ending ebay auctions wont stop farming.  You see, the guys that dont like ebay are those who...<P>want to go into lower guk and camp the frenzied ghoul room for example.<P>When it's taken by just ONE guy, it pisses em off.  How do they vent this anger and "strike back"? they spend all of their time on ebay gettin rid of the ebayers...<P>Well, go ahead and get rid of em.  I dont think it matters to you that it wont end farming.  I think you just get a kick out of knockin the auctions down and "striking back".  <P>Well, it's kinda obvious that you get a kick out of it....<P>so dont try and defend yourself<P>  <P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guess I'm just not sure why EBay actions are bad.  I can honestly say that without EBay, Sony wouldn't be getting my $10 a month.  <P>I agree that it's never fun to see some lvl 60 farming something that's a legit kill for your level (blue to yellow).  But that seems to be the only problem as far as I can see.  And no, I have no idea other than make quests for alot of the dropped equipment.  Make the quests involved enough so that people have to "play" to finish them.  No impossible drops, just drops off of things that are found in places toons at their level should be.  Most players won't mind, if the quests were enough trouble, farmers would mind.<P>I switched servers a few months back.  We had a really fun guild on the server that I originally started on.  But as time(and life) went on, alot of those people left.  It was on RZ so some of those people did get tired of the broken pvp system and went to a blue server.  I didn't find that out till later.  Once I realized that I was basically the only one still playing on RZ I was about to quit the game.  I really only play to screw around with friends, or to make new ones.  The gameplay has to be fun, but the people in my guild are the real fun.<P>I figured that I'd just let my account lapse and quit playing for the better part of last summer.  I tried it a few times and it was just boring.  Then I ran into one of my old friends who was just checking RZ to see if "they had left anyone behind".  I was on The Rathe with a new toon that day.  But.....<P>I just couldn't do it.  Sorry, but after you've taken multiple toons to to lvl 30 it's tough to do it again.  I didn't feel like being powerleveled to 20 or 30 because i'd be a lvl 30 warrior in leather, or at best be encumbered heavily in bronze, using store bought weapons.  Why bother?  I figured that if I wanted to play on that server I'd need to get enough equipment to do nothing but level and not worry about buying stuff.  I bought some plat on EBay and bought everything I needed.  It wasn't worth my time to do it the "old-fashoned" way.  I paid someone else to take the time to acquire that plat so I didn't have to.  I don't see it as wrong to hire someone for this purpose.  May be "splitting hairs" but that's how I think of the transaction.  Would it be any different if I paid my 16 year old brother-in-law, by the hour, to level me?<P>Point is, Sony is still getting my money because I was able to use EBay.  Since then I've referred a dozen new players to EQ (which I wouldn't have done if I wasn't playing) and even got my wife to start an account and a toon.  Granted, this only adds up to somewhere in the neighborhood of $1500 in gross sales for Sony, but am I the only one?  <P>If you figure out how many people are still playing because they were able to have more fun in EQ by not having to worry about plat and equipment I think you'd be suprised.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On the off-chance that Verant is still looking at this thread, I have a suggestion for at least the gameplay issues involved in auctioning, and that would be to limit the number of times you can loot a particular item (the big non-NODROP ones anyway) to a set number of times per server per account, say three (on the chance that you would want to either sell two, preferably in-game, or twink guild/group mates or your own characters with the extras).  eBay camping would drop off significantly as each eBayer ran through all their shots on each server.  Yes, they could still purchase new accounts and repeat (as with the selling of characters, which is the part that *does* bother me for the reasons noted in the past), but they would have to do so by leveling up new characters to do it (forcing them to take precious time out of their eBay pursuits) or team up with other eBay camping friends who would be subject to the same limitations.  Even this could be prevented by perhaps limiting to six pick-ups on each *credit card number* so that families with multiple accounts that play could still each (unless there are more than six people in the same house playing, *wow*) get the item but the farmer would have to keep using a different credit card each time.<P>Don't get me wrong, I know that there are exploitable flaws to this, but it would seem to be a start since most of us are aware that stopping the majors won't stop people from going to the minors in terms of auction sites.  Perhaps this system could be implemented in EQ2 if the coding would be too difficult in EQ proper.  After all, most of us who enjoy the game will likely try our hand at that when it comes out.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Planting-  Did I do something to you, personally?  I wasn't getting into the issues of right/wrong or legal/illegal, I was just offering a potential way to slow/stop the problem at a more fundamental level than going after the end result.  Basically, this seems similar to trying to stop drug use.  After all, if you can't GET the drug in the first place, you can't be/remain an addict.  Of course, it is much harder to stop for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that money buys a lot of protection for those at the first production/distribution levels of the drug market and the production/distribution sites can change relatively easily.<P>The nice thing about EQ in this respect is that everyone is getting their "crack" from the same place, which is able to be modified and controlled by those who want to limit people's ability to get their "fix" and, indeed, what effect that "fix" will have.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, Cab.  After reading all of these posts it seems you've got your nose so far up the collective ass of Sony/Verant, you can probably see daylight.  Everyone's got to be good at something I guess.  The joys of being young and going through a nasty case of puberty, eh?  <P>The auctions are none of your business.  If a Sony representative wants a certain auction taken down, all thay have to do is notify EBay.  Ebay is very willing to do this.  Or did they personally ask you to do this service for them?  You're such a wonderful person, I'm sure they did.<P>EQ is a game of "stages".  It's almost like a couple of different games rolled into one.  No one who has ever played to lvl 50 will tell you that they do the same thing at lvl 1 that they do at lvl 20 or that they do at lvl 40.  It's a completely different game.  I didn't feel like playing the game before lvl 20.  Not because i'm lazy, or have to win at everything, but because i'd done it numerous times before.  It has lost it's appeal I guess.  It's just not fun for me anymore at those levels.  I got no enjoyment out of it as it was.  It was necessary to catch up with my friends.  Like I said in my earlier post, playing with friends is what's fun to me.<P>For your sake I'll follow the logic that most 15 year olds use.  You're always right.  I play the game wrong because it's not exactly how you play it.

</FONT><HR>Babbster:  One HUGE flaw in your plan... What if I have 8 characters and I want to be able to loot X item once with each character?  I can't get the item at all for up to 5 of my character (or someone else can't get it for more than 1 or 2 of theirs).  It is far more hassle than it is worth. <P>Ghoul:  My pool hall analogy was as follows... <BR>If there were a pool hall near my house that rented tables for $3 an hour and I went in and paid for 4 hours, I then proceed to let other people play 'quick games' for $1 each.  Assuming you can play 4-6 quick games of pool in an hour, I'm making $1-3 and hour.  Why should the pool hall be upset?  They aren't losing any money, I paid for the time that the table is in use.  <P>Any reasonable person realizes that this will get you thrown out of the pool hall (and probably banned from it as well).  If you persisted, then they would probably attempt to bring up legal charges against you.  <P>As for 'transferring the game' if I don't play for the full hour.  Sorry, it doesn't work like that.  Whether I use the full hour or not, when I am done, I am done (if I leave the pool hall).  They then rent the use of the table to someone else.  <P>In each case the pool hall would lose money from the deal.  real actual money.<P>If you look at it from Verant's point of view, someone buying an ebay account loses them the sale of the base game and any expansions.  It also loses them the subscription fee for however long it would take a person to camp an item (or the money in game to buy the item) or to get a character to whatever level the character is.  They have lost in two areas.  Your contention that the subscription fees on the account in question continue and that is all well and good really don't mesh with reality, Verant is making much less money.  Please don't bother bringing up the idea that some people wouldn't play at all if they hadn't bought an account.  If they have that little interest in the game, then they aren't putting much (if anything) at all in Verant's pocket.<P>About the analogies (when I said they were mostly bad), when I point out why they are bad most anyone can say "well, what if FOO" (where FOO is some highly improbable case).  In this instance, if you have hte money to have a personal body servant who prepares your meals, you wouldn't be going to an all you can eat buffet.  <P>The following has to be one of the silliest things I have read.  The quoted bits are your writing... I'm breaking up the paragraph for simplicity.<P>"About the EULA comment I made, you missed the point. Verant permits the transfer of items in-game."  <BR>-True, you trade in game items for in game items, similar to trading monopoly money for 'owning' boardwalk. <P>"They do not tell me who I must give my items to."<BR>-Also true.  If that were the case, they'd be see as entirely too draconian and would have no players at all.<P>"If I like a person in the game, I am more likely to give my items to him or her."<BR>-True as well, I give stuff to my in game friends (or guildmates) a lot.  However, when I am selling items in game, 90+% of the time it is to complete strangers.  Liking or not liking someone is irrelevant.  I am selling something, not giving it away.  So, this point is completely moot.<P>"If one of those people is my real-life friend who may have given me a present or done a favor for me, then I may want to help him or her out in the game."<BR>-You must really not like your friends much, if you only do favors for favors.  I have a couple of college friends that recently started.  They have never given me presents or done me favors that are worth noting(we play DnD together).  When I found out that they were playing, I told them to start characters on the server I am usually on (they were both under 5 on the server they started with).  I handed them each a full set of banded, some money and a fine steel weapon.  As I picked up random small items in my travels, I gave them to these friends as well.  Now they are getting to a point in game that they are doing well, they feel a need to return favors.  I don't expect it, and I probably won't accept it (I may, I may not, it depends on what it is).  I have other RL friends on this server.  For one of them, I spent 10 hours camping a mammoth cloak.  She ports me around whenever I need it and she isn't busy (then again, we usually group so I know if she is busy or not. :P ).  The girl in question is a closer friend, doing favors or going out of our way for one another is par for the course in this case.  We do it if needed (or asked) but it hardly ever comes up.<P>But again, this is giving stuff away to friends.  It has nothing to do with selling services.<P>"This is where Verant's logic seems to fail (IMHO)."<BR>Who's logic failed?<P>"When you put an item up for auction on eBay, you are not playing the game."<BR>Yes, you are.  You aren't actively logged into the game, but you are doing activities that are directly related to the game.  Similar to the way you can get warned or banned for posting here.  <P>"Verant has no right to tell you what you can and cannot do OUTSIDE their game."<BR>If it has nothing to do with their game, then they can't tell you what to do.  For related matters, see above.<P>"When you go back INTO the game, then Verant can tell you what you can and cannot do. "<BR>-Hehehehehehehe.  silly human.<P>"Do they allow the planning of raids outside the game? Yes."<BR>-There are no prohibitions on talking about the game.  This has nothing to do with ebay sales.<P>"Do they allow the allocation of items (e.g. deciding who class-quest item will go to if it drops) outside the game? Yes."<BR>-I haven't heard this one.  If you are planning a raid on something that drops one specific item and you are getting it for a specific person, then again, this has NOTHING to do with the question of ebay sales. <P>If you are going on a raid for something that has known drops, then chances are most everyone knows what classes are allowed to roll on what drops (i.e. Nagafen or Vox).  Again, this has nothing to do with ebay sales.<P>"How is the transfer of money REALLY that much different?"<BR>-You lost me.  What does any of this have to do with the transfer of moeny in RL?  <P>"If the guild leader doesn't like you all that much IRL, then he's probably less likely to designate items for you. If you bribe him, then he probably will. That's just life."<BR>If this were the case, I wouldn't be in that guild.  However, that is just me.  <P>Assuming you had many friends in the guild and stayed for that reason, then the friends can put pressure on the leader to make things fair for you (that is the kind of thing that friends do).  It doesn't require bribery, it requires people skills.  If the unfairness persists, the leader may find himself with a significant cut in his guild power because you and all your friends left and made your own guild.

</FONT><HR>Well, very interesting posts from all of you. I guess I will stick my two cents in just for the hey of it. First of all, to the people who are like NARCing on the eBay site, that is about the lowest thing I have heard of. I mean I havent heard such whining and complaining from two year olds much less than you young adults or adults who enjoy this wonderful game. Let Verant handle the problem. It is the business between the individual on eBay and Verant, not the players themselves. And on the point of Verants, maybe it is a copyright violation, only the supreme court could weigh in on this case and someday probaly will. But what if I buy a book, or a music cd, or a board game and sell it on eBay. All those items are copyrighted so why isn't that illegal? Of course I guess it is not really illegal but just against the terms of agreement. Will eBay ever push the issue in court? Doubtful, although both companies have a pretty good amount of cash and could battle it out. And my favorite point, is buying an item off of eBay the same as twinking a character? Theoretically I would say yes, and why isn't that against the terms? Anyway those are my thoughts and just wanted to share. Am I against the selling of items on eBay? No, I am not, for this is America and it shall always be free. I think it is the same as buying or selling anything else on eBay. Would I do it if Verant said it was ok? Yes I would. Am I against twinking a character? No, why not take advantage of the spent time retrieving an item. Anyway, have fun in Everquest as do I and remember, it is just a game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"I'm a loser because all I want out of the game is to have fun with my friends? "<BR> <BR>No, you are a loser because you forked out real life cash for imaginary items/plat that only exist in the confines of a video game. <P>I know, let's play Monopoly... I'll sell you Boardwalk and Parkplace for $100 real cash. You can then claim you won and go home happy. But who would be the real winner in that scenario?<BR> <BR>And you don't need 1,000 plat to be able to play with your friends. You don't need a bonecaster robe to be able to play with your friend either - that turd just doesn't flush. You probably have "toon envy". You like to guess at what other people are like so I will guess what you are like - I bet you are a middle-aged balding fat, and like so many others like you, go through their midlife crisis and go out and buy a sports car. But you know what? A fat bald man in a porsche is just a fat bald man in a porsche. And likewise a toon is a just a toon and toon items are just 0's and 1's. Nobody is going to have respect for you or look up to you or something just because your toon has better items than other toons. The item doesn't make the man, the character does - or lack thereof. The fact that you've chosen to not play by the rules speaks volumes about your character btw. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Would it take me, at level 40, longer to buy that fbss working an hour and a half irl (which btw I dont mind doing because you see I happen to like my job), or to camp it for 12 hours in the game?<P>obviously, it's a much better use of my time to get that fbss via RL ends.  Because, unlike computer nerds like you (should've figured you were a computer programmer), I dont enjoy camping 12 hours on end for an item like an fbss. I dont want to and I dont HAVE to.  But nerdy guys like you dont mind doing that I'll bet because time spent doing that is better than doing the alternative things you have to do in your life: NOTHING.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The ebay-ers are the symptom.<P>The poor design of EQ (that encourages farming, camping, and mindless, endless hours of repetitive activity, unless you are one of the few, the proud, the uber who can play 16 hours per day) is the disease.<P>Until Sony/Verant comes up with a comprehensive fix for _FARMING_, not just for the ebay-ers who take advantage of farming, the problem will just continue to morph.  I mean does it really make a difference if someone is farming for plat or farming for US dollars?  The spawn is still farmed and _I_ won't ever get to see it, that's for sure (since I can't quit my job and live in front of the computer waiting for the camp to open up).<P>Anyone who thinks that banning auctions on ebay will make a significant difference on farming is either naive, a fool, or just stoned.<P>The demand for the items/characters exists because Sony has decided that "extreme mind-numbing boredom and repetition == legitimate, exciting risk".  Frustration is not the same thing as risk.  However, since nobody at VI has really grasped this concept yet, people who hate doing the same thing, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over (you have killed a_blue_mob_01... your xp bar goes up a sliver... DING!  time to kill a_blue_mob_02 so that your xp bar can go up another sliver and inch towards the next level) will keep trying to find a way to beat the system.  Make the system less frustrating, cater less to the top 1% and the "uber" elite, make farming impossible or unprofitable, make the game more FUN and with a little variety (quests for XP?  whassat?) and you'd see less demand.<P>There are those that argue that the point of the game is socializing, and hey -- socializing IS fun.  But I can socialize on IRC or in (horrors!) real life!  EQ needs something more than just socializing to drive it.<P>How about making ALL items above a certain value LORE?  There's a great, easy to get, and semi-valuable item in OOT that is never camped simply because it is Lore (a druid could farm about 10-12 per hour and sell for about 40pp each, otherwise -- but the camp is ALWAYS empty whereas the giant "Gornit" next door has someone camping there 24/7).  How about implementing that only X number of loots of a given item per character rule (that was a good idea)?  That would pretty much end farming.  Amusingly, everyone shredded that pretty quick, which makes me believe that this whole 'ebay-ers are bad, m'kay'... thread is really more about envy (and the eternal drive to find someone lower than ourselves that we can despise legitimately) than about "preserving the purity of the game".  If you wanted to preserve the purity of the game, you'd support any measures that would end FARMING and endless CAMPS (how realistic are those, anyway, from a RP perspective?  Conan the Barbarian enters the Dragon's Lair for the fifty-eigth time to kill the same dragon to get the same item which he knows will drop off its corpse in order to sell it to pay his fantasy-mortgage or give it to his uber-buddy Cohen the Librarian... REALLY realistic).<P>And get real, folks.  Sony/VI isn't interested in "preserving the purity of the game".  That's not what this ebay thing is about.  If you buy a character that's already at level 55 or whatever, you don't have to put in the six months (or whatever) of mind-numbing work to get him there.  If you do that, you aren't enriching Sony's coffers with your ten bucks a month in the meantime.  If you aren't doing that it's bad, bad, bad m'kay!  Sony is after your money, not the purity of the game.  If the two coincide, great, they're heroes.  But the goal is still your ten bucks a month (which is fine -- they are a business, that's what they SHOULD be doing; just don't buy the PR that they are "doing it all for you"... it's just spin).<P>The biggest things that ebayers did wrong (aside from making everyone else envious that they couldn't get that stuff as easy as the rich kiddies) was to crowd the servers.  THAT, however, is an ongoing concern that Sony refuses to address (again, from a profit-margin point of view, overcrowding the servers is to their benefit because the trickle of cancellations still doesn't offset the vast profits of the 300k player base).<P>No, I don't ebay, mostly because I can't afford it.  And yes, I do think that ebay is "cheating" just like the god mode in Diablo or whatever.  But for pete's sake, get off your high, sanctimonious horses and realize that the problem isn't with the ebay'ers, it's with the shoddy core design of EQ.  It's addictive, but that doesn't mean it's fun.<P>If Sony made it FUN to get from level 1-60, why would people buy characters?  They would be missing the fun.  Instead, they know very well, that the game doesn't really start being much fun until the higher levels (oh yeah, killing snakes, bats and rats for the thousandth time is REALLY a thrill...) and they want to skip there fast.  Simple human nature.  But if the PROCESS, rather than the DESTINATION, were more fun, the demand would wither to almost nothing.<P>But, I'm sure, this is just "p*ssing in the wind".<P>To the "I'm so righteous because I hate ebay'ers" crowd, who will predictably flame the cr*p out of me pretty quickly for this, get over yourselves.  Try making suggestions designed towards fixing the game instead of taking your petty thrills by screwing other people (even if those people are in the wrong...  I hate to go Biblical on y'all, but ever hear the phrase "Judge not lest ye be judged"?)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Other than VI and other things that disagree with it, the hard truth is that american inginuity calls for taking advantage of situations where in a profit could be made. The internet makes this easy, but in truth if one wanted to sell A_Cool_Account01, you could very well advertise it in a local news paper..or put flyers up around town, or in local computer stores. <P>Cold Hard fact is that no one is going to be able to stop the sales and purchases of Everquest Related ingame items. Sure we can gussy it up saying we are selling our time invested.<P>VIs Argument: We pay for their service and therefor have no right to sell it.<BR>ie: Pay lawn mower guy to mow the lawn then act as his manager and take the profits he makes mowing other people's lawn.<P>EBayers Argument: We pay for our time therefor we have purchased it and we OWN it. Therefore we have the right to sell our time as we choose.<P>ie: Lawn Mower guy Sells his TIME to a respected buyer and provides a service.<P>---<P>no matter what the actual rules say its a fine line and it will be crossed. I think that ebay really hasnt dont anything at all to hurt the game, and if it has done anything to hurt the game it sure isnt as bad as how Verant handles customer relations and in and out of game problems(there are many). In away ebayers are doing exactly what VI encourages.. player interaction.<P>Maybe if VI stoped this venture and had full consentration on improving the gameplay and class balance the game would be better than it is today.

</FONT><HR>Okay, read some of this stuff and have formed a few more opinions then I started with.<P>First: <BR>Farming.  <BR>Okay, like Ebay is the only source of the problem with this.  There is also the very real in game economy based on the farming and sale of items for plat, which is then used to buy other items.<P>Yes, Ebay does make this worse then it would normally be.  No, I don't like spending many many hours waithing for the GBS to only have it KSed by some lv40 whatever coming over and gacking the NPC in one hit.  But, what in the world does this lv(ohmygod) need with a GBS (heck, really, what do I need with it either)... except, oh yeah, he can take it to EC and sell it for uber plat to buy something else he wants but can't just walk up on and gack like that.<P>Second:<BR>Bad players getting good stuff.<BR>Okay, newby has nifty stuff and goes on plane raid with a bunch of experienced players and gets everyone killed.<BR>Bad, very bad, should never happen.<BR>Um, guys, aren't you forgetting that someone can be twinked without there ever having been a single sale on Ebay or other sites of that nature.<BR>Yes, this is very bad, but not 100% related to the topic.  ANY bad player could cause these kinds of problems.<P>Third:<BR>VI/Sony not wanting to be involved in any disputes related to the sale/failure-to-deliver of items, well, that isn't a valid arguement, as their legal department could simply put it into their EULA that they are not responsible in anyway shape or form for outside/inside sales/deals gone south.<BR>In other words, they basically did this with the whole "it isn't allowed, so don't do it, don't come crying when you do and get ripped" thing.<P>Fourth:<BR>Profit loss.<BR>Here is the biggest motivator for any company.<BR>Fact of the matter is, if Ebay (and the other sites) had a way to cut in Sony/Verant for a 10%sales 'tax' on the auctions, they would and Sony/Verant would jump on the deal as it would equal more money then they generate with our pultry membership fees.<P>But, as this isn't really possible (simply because a way around it would be found), it isn't going to happen.<P>Now, as to my personal feelings on some of this.<BR>Texture, and the others out there doing the same thing, get a life.  I mean, really, you spend all that time on ebay scouring their pages looking for deals (and, I guarantee you didn't find 1/10 of them) instead of playing the game.  Get Back In The Game where you belong =P<BR>Sony/Verant, wish there was some way you guys could make money on the deal (oh, wait, there is, but then you would have to be involved in the whole process from screening sellers and buyers to prevent misconduct, but also to ensure that inexperienced players didn't get uber items and create problems like above.)  And, while you could do this, I am not sure it would present you with a truely profitable situation.  Time and money involved in the developement of such a system would probably be cost prohibitive.<P>As to why some people will continue to buy these items/plat/characters, who knows.  Some people simply do not have the time to invest in the game, others simply don't want to spend that much time.  And still others are simply greedy and want it all.<BR>Can't blame any of them personally, just wish it didn't have to effect my game play.  Lord I hate wating in line for a spawn or trying to lvl in an area and find it impossible to do due to some newby twink (from what ever cause) bringing down trains on my head.<P>RobertMc<BR>lv12Magician<BR>lv14Necromancer<BR>lv4Shadow Knight<BR>Casual player, in it for the fun.<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, two in one day, this is some kind of record for me.<P>Okay, I am sick and very tired (literally folks, case you haven't pulled your heads out of your collective modems anytime recently there is a nasty case of the Flu going round and I got it) of reading all these snip-at-you-snip-back-at-you.<P>One guy is a millionair the other is a programmer who owns a small part of some internet based company, and another hasn't (that I noticed at least *what do you do texture*) stated what he does other then run around internet auction sites getting auctions shut down.<P>You know what, you all should really look back and examing your past performances, not just in RL, but on this single thread even.  Very much the child throwing a tantrum look to this whole thing.<P>Text Cab, either one of you start going to Ebay and sending in notices to them about the auctions before Verant stepped in???  Deafening silence. . . NO, and don't even try it, or you would already have been talking about how proud you were to have been doing it before Verant jumped in and how you are such great heroes and such.<P>As to those defending Ebayers.  Hey, guess what, it is in the EULA that you shouldn't do it.  Does that mean it won't happen, certainly not, there will always be those with need/desires that do not fit with what society/companies/laws say is right.  And you know what, they will continue to do so, but saying 'I personally have never done this, but... don't see what is wrong with it.' is just idiotic.  If you don't see what is wrong with it then why haven't you done it.  Cause you didn't want to loose your accounts and or, cause you really have done it.  Either way, we really don't care.<P>I would rather have seen a thread that was three pages long that actually discussed the issues, and way to maybe fix them (like a server dedicated to the sale of items in RL, temporary like so as to see what the affect IG is).  But, no, I have 3 pages of Tex, Cab and other saying the same thing over and over.  Look, you could have achieved the same thing by simply stating that you were going to support Verant and help monitor Ebay And LEFT IT AT THAT. But, no, you wanted your cudos... so here you go, cudos you have just made asses of yourselfs and others by continuing with needless spam.  Quit wasting your time and ours, either get back in the game where you belong or over to Ebay and help police there, but eitherway, if you have nothing intelligent to say on the subject, please shut up.<P>To those that I haven't offended yet, I am not done.<BR>All of you out there that have been equally annoying with your whole 'power to the people' speaches and your 'how can they control what I do outside of the game'.  SHUT UP.  Same thing here.  Either you have something constructive to add to the conversation or you are just wasting electronic oxygen.<P>Verant/Sony, please pull your collective heads out of your collective asses.  You have created the environment that feeds the Ebay situation.  Your game mechanics for getting extremely powerful items are very nonD&D like.  They do not promote grouping so much as they promote Guilding-for-Farming.  Anyone else watch the D&D movie and get the feeling that someone sat in on a game and simply wrote down what everyone was doing, that the person writing the script really didn't know what the fantasy genre was all about.<P>I like the game, I love to play with some of the people, others I wish would learn more about their computers and RL before they get on the game.  But, I ignore those I have to and play and have fun with those that deserve it.<P>If you really want to do something about the Farming/ebaying issue, look at the way things are done in the game (programming mechanics and the encouragement of highly inflated prices that leads to 100+people being in EC when only 12 or so are actually out killing things, the rest just being there to sell/trade so they can get what they need for their higher level items.<P>I mean, really, the basic problem is as simple as the idiots out killing the guards in WC cuase, and I quoute 'if Verant hadn't intended for us to kill them, they [Verant] wouldn't have made them [the guards] worth so much XP.'  These people should be off in some uber land fighting to stay alive, but, instead are in WC killing guards.<BR>Same thing with the farming and such.  If the drops didn't happen if you weren't in the right power/class/race level then, guess what, there wouldn't be lv50 people killing lvl25 encounters just to farm the bloody loot.  They would be off at some other game if they only care about the money/trading aspect, or they would move on to stuff of an appropriate lvl.<P>Rant Mode OFF<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     I agree 100% with Ouroborous. Even though ebay farmers suck, the problem is the way the game makes you camp boring hours to obtain and item. We all want to be level 60, and have the best gear, just not everyone can sit on there butts 24/7 to achieve this. <P>    The way the game is made and items are made ultra rair is why there was such a big market for ebay farmers. When you look at an Ultima online auction in contrast, usually someones selling gold, a house, or there account. Items arent that valuable there. But in Everquest sometimes to obtain that ultra awesome piece of gear you have to be able to sit in a camp for a week or more non stop to get this item, "Glowing Black Stone".<BR> <BR>     As long as theres items that are that hard to obtain; and require camping, there will be people buying and selling EQ stuff. And as long as the levels are so hard to obtain, there will be people buying accounts. Whether it be because they just dont want to start at the lower levels, or maybe that just want to buy and account so that they can play with there higher level real life friends. People will find away to do this. If you want farming to end, revamp the camping system, and item value. Hell make everything no drop, i dont see how any ebayer could get by that one hehe.<P>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>you people make me laugh...the anti ebayers vs the pro ebayers. would it bother you if you never read the threads on this board? would it make you mad if you just played the game and enjoyed it like your supposed to? pro ebayers are just as lame fro trying to justify there stance. verant says no. its their property. end of story. what it does remind me of is the napster issue in a way. music is sold by a company.  copyrights are made on music. technology has allowed us to copy and distribute music via internet for free. company sues and shuts down napster. now companies are clamoring to get in on the new wave of marketing. monthly fee now for napster?<BR>i see the same thing happening. verant shuts down ebay auctions. when the dust settles and if eq is still around when there isnt an issue or its finally impossible for ebay to hold eq auctions, im sure there will be a similar deal. because we all know what the vision is. its dollar signs in the eyes of sony, anyway they can get it. its the american way. people in every facet, will always find a way to exploit (or capitalize) on something that is going on at the time. there is revenue to be made from almost every aspect the current society of today. we are a generation who is catered to by television, internet, fast food, and playstations. im not looking down on our current evolutionary status, just pointing out that in the grand scheme of things, nothing matters but money and we will pay for our entertainment at any cost. even if it means our time is spent doing absolutely nothing, getting nothing, progressing nowhere as a person, and acheiving no great status as a human being. not mindless, but complacecent, and oblivios to the world, and happily so.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>GOTCHA!!!! im not that serious you geeks!!!<BR>hehehehehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057107&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057107&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
