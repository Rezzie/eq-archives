</FONT><HR>Ok Alan. You wanted suggestions that would not make necros more powerful, but would solve the problem.  Here is my suggestion:<P>What about making uber mobs take one quarter damage from taps?  This would take some coding, but since there is code already for partial resists I imagine it can be done.  This way the mob would take 180 damage from our 720 tap, but still give the necro 720hp back.  Then you can lower the resist rate to say 30%.  To keep necros from abusing this by chain casting you can make the agro for the spell fairly high.  This way a necro can only cast let's say 3 taps on the mob for the duration of the entire fight.  Any more than this and the necro gets attacked.  This would be a VERY bad thing for the necro as it would either take a LOT of mana from the cleric to save him (thus defeating the purpose of tapping in the first place) or get him killed (which not only defeats the purpose of tapping, but in addition takes a lot of mana from the cleric to try to save him AND takes time and mana to resurrect the necro). So restricting the necro to 3 casts means they would do on average a total of 378 damage to the mob (180x3)-([180x3]x30%)  but receive a good amount more health to convert to mana and give away.  Even if the necro decides to use up an essence emerald per uber mob casting a Trucidation he still only does 443 damage total ([275]-[275x30%])+([180x2]-[{180x2}x30%]).  This is hardly a scratch to a 32khp mob. In order to kill a 32khp mob with pure necro damage output it would take 73 level 60 necros (32000/443) to do and even more with the new Velious mobs.  This does not, however, take into account that for the 18 seconds (All 3 taps have 6 second casting times) the mob will be killing off the necros and regenrating hit points.  For obvious reasons I just don't see this ever happening.<P><BR>You also have to take into account that in all my examples the necros are 59th or 60th level and they all have the 59th and 60th level lifetap.  They would be doing MUCH less damage with lower versions of a tap. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, here's a good idea that will "fix" necros during raid time, but not give them any more power or be unbalancing.<P>First off I want to say that I agree with Absor on most suggested necro enchancements.  Unlimited stacking dots, unresistable lifetaps, and so on are unbalancing, and increase our power not only during raid time, but during every other time as well.  Necros are just fine during normal grouping conditions, and so dont need any enchancements.<P>However, we are less than useful during the actual boss encounter. A few mobs, we can land the occasional DoT, lifetap, and so on, but on the majority of mobs we are limited to dumping mana.<P>Mana pumping is just fine, in my opinion, but it is horribly inefficient. I can pump about 500-600 mana from FOM to OOM.  That's using around 2k of my own mana. This translates into about one complete heal plus change.  Liching, I can give 100 mana per minute.  So during the 3 minute fight, I'll have given 800 mana total: two complete heals.  Why bring a necro when you can bring anoher cleric, or another tank (a "complete heal")?<P>My solution is the following: make mana transfer efficient *only during raids*.  How is this possible?  Add a spell that transfers ALL of the necros mana to another class.  Recast time on the spell: 30 minutes (or 1 hour, or whatever).  The recast time makes this spell useless under normal conditions, as it will only add "free mana" (Absor's example of liching necro + cleric, ie infinite mana) once every hour,and it will take up a spell slot.  It will only be memorized during the raid.<P>This spell benefits necros in that it lets a necro effectively become any casting class during a raid. A necro can make a cleric have twice the mana, or a wizard twice the mana, etc.  It will still, however, be better to have the actual extra cleric there.  Yes, a necro and cleric could have exactly the same mana as two clerics.  However, two clerics can heal twice as fast.  Two wizards can do damage twice as fast as a necro and a wizard.  A wizard with a necro pumping him might get himself aggroed because he did too much individual damage, which wouldn't happen to two wizards.  Basically, this new spell makes necromancers desirable on raids, and yet still lets other classes be more desireable.<P>You may be thinking that with lich on, we could start medding and pump even more mana after we "complete mana dumped".  This is true, although I've found that I can only pump 100 mana per minute.  This is almost trivial... During the course of a fight, I MIGHT get enough mana to the cleric for another complete heal.  However, if you think this is "too good" with the necros new complete mana dump, make the new spell have this effect: decrease necros HP by 70%. Since HP = mana for a necro, this will effectively stop the necro from liching / pumping any more after he complete mana dumped.<P>Whew, I'm done  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I personally think this is a decent suggestion, which is completely realistic.  I'd like to hear your comments about it, as well as Alans.  <P>Thank you, <BR>Wyvil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   I'm not sure necros have much to contribute on raids.  I spend most my time pumping mana to a cleric at a TERRIBLE ratio.  I dump a full tank so that a cleric can get less than 2 bubs.  That sucks!!!  If there are enchanters then I'm not permitted to summon a pet.  Ebolt and bond are pretty much the only dots I can use, but I have to compete with any other necros/shamans to get them to do actual damage.  I find that my tap line gets resisted too much on top of having a crappy dam/mana ratio.  ST doesn't work on high lvl mobs.  Now SKs have summon corpse so there is no need for a necro on the CR side of things.  That leaves me with pump mana and cast dmf.  <BR>   I think necros are a powerful class when soloing or in small groups, but man do we pay for it when trying to go on a raid.  I hate being the last person picked for groups.  <P>This lack of power on large raids has forced me to start a new character.  I can't wait until my cleric is 46+, then I might actually be able to help my friends on a raid.  As apposed to the necro tag along, hoping for loot.<P>vinz<P>Oh well</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Maybe I can help a little on the poofing problem.  Try erasing the hate list of mobs right as they are about to die from a dot.  I'm not sure if this will do it, but it would make sense that if a mob dies, with nobody on it's hate list then *poof*.  In raids you would see this more often with folks using blur type spells to break casting etc.  More spells have memory blur effects than you might think, including pixie strike(bard) if I'm not mistaken.  I've had it happen a couple times with my enchanter and her little dot at level 16.  Not often mind you.<P>If this is causing the problem it's really a problem more of the memory blur than the dot causing the corpses to disolve.<P>Something to think about anyways.<P>Vmlinuz Gateslayer 55th Templar of Tunare<BR>Listener Luckytune 51st Minstrel<P>Test Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems the idea is that necromancers need to be able to do damage in a raid, and yet this damage can't be allowed to make them more powerful at lower levels.<P>Obviously, making the DD spells drop the skeleton illusion would fix this. The official response was "that's not interesting" and yet neither is being ineffective in a raid. That would be something at least.<P>The other possibility is to make a lifetap that works. Now, Lifetap is stopped by high magic resistance, and the high magic resistance of many high level mobs is incredible. No problem, just make a fire or poison or other type of lifetap that is less likely to be totally locked out.<P>Balance this fire-based (or whatever) lifetap. Do so by making its effect no better than a much lower level lifetap. That way, in a non-fear raid situation, you'd never really use this lifetap. Finally, if you dont want them having such an ability at pre-raid levels, make it available only in the 50s, say at level 55.<P>Then, give it a cool name, like "Burning Hunger" or "Feast of Flames" and give it a red aura. Or if the uber mobs resist fire too, give it a blue aura and make it cold resisted and call it something like "Vampiric Banquet of Velious".  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I'm mostly sure Verant could do better.<P>AnimatedU</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Classes like the shamen and the ranger these classes i think have more a need of verants attention. if you think you have it bad after lvl 50 you should play a ranger after 50. They have less a purpose than you do in group i mean you pet can tank better than they can. they arnt realy group pullers even you though you think they would be with track and all. They CANT solo the jokes on you if you even try. All i am saying here is necros have had their attention i think its another classes turn for verants spot light to fall on them. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But guess what...&lt;whispers&gt; This isnt a Shaman thread. &lt;nod nod&gt; This is a Necromancer thread. The Shaman thread is still around and they are working on their issues just like us.<P>You see, theres this company called Verant. And they have several employees who take care of the game and its functions. This one guy, named Alan, he is the internet relations guy, and we talk to him and in turn he talks to the other people at Verant. You with me so far? Ok. Alan is one guy...BUT, he talks to many people. So Im sure his ability to address issues is not limited to one at a time. Mmmm'kay?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would also like to comment about the skele effect not being 'interesting.'<P>Alan, you said that without the skeleton illusion this spell would be 'Just another direct damage spell.'  Well...  Ummm...  Right....   So what is wrong with that?  I don't see any druid DDs turning things into bears or shaman DDs turning things into wolves....  If Ignite Bones was 'just another DD' then at least we would be able to USE it....   Everybody here is telling you that the illusion spell makes it useless and you respond by saying "Without it the spell would be no fun."  So this spell is basically in the same category as Eye of Zomm right?  "Oh look!  A NEWBIE!  I'll turn this orc into a skeleton and make him stare at me in awe...."  <P>The problem with doing that though is wizards didn't lose a DD spell to make newbies eyes widen.  It is a seperate spell for them that they don't have to buy. Necros however........</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still see a problem with Lure like Lifetaps<P>If I was going to organise a raid against some of the nasty ubers in Velious where the battles are take 20mins and up I'd bring Necros instead of Wizards.<P>Sure the damage to mana ratio is not as good but with liching and tapping back HP the necro would most likely be outdamaging before the equivelent Wizard finished medding up his second bar of mana.  And most definitely by the third.<P>Add to that not having to worry about healing the AE damage as much since the necro can tap back the HP at a decent rate, summon corpse, FD, and pets to do damage when the mob isn't an AE/Fear caster there would be NO reason to bring a Wizard, except maybe for the 5pt damage shield they get haha.<P>And no one sees something WRONG with asking for this?<P>Also keep in mind that wizard lures are based on specific resist types.  While you are asking for a Lifetap that works on the best resist type automatically.<P>Low resist DoT's I agree with.  Even ones with LONGER durations so that they do damage throughout these encounters.  But no you can't be a Necro AND a Wizard in one package sorry.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Response to Terenil<P>Then your raid is finished. First point Lures are found in MANY forms, HEAT COLD MAGIC. Were talking about giving Necros ONE form of a lure type sv, that being Magic and only at lv 59.<P> If you have fought the epic/dragon mobs in SOV you will know that ALL casters are for the most part useless. All mobs in SOV have insane svs. SOV is a melee raid only on uber mobs. To say that giving one spell a lure type sv (magic) is gonna render wizards useless and not required is a joke.<P> Mana and liching and the 20 min fight. Are you a necro? Have you done damage to a LARGE EPIC mob and then TRIED to sit? Your butt get summoned? Lich is not effecient enough that your gonna gain any mana standing there fighting for 20 min. Personally id love to see what caster is alive during a 20 min epic encounter. As for my pet hahha , I dont know what uber pet u have but my spec summoned with a book rarely lives long without me feeding it like mad. IT has the HP of a lv 49 pet and requires me to feed it my health during the fight. I cant heal it worth a dang on epic fights because I cannot heal myself.<P> Why take a necro to an epic raid? He cannot damage the mob, cannot make a pet nor heal it well. Drop the necro take a wizard, warrior or cleric. That is exactly what is happening. This thread is about the HIGH level necro (59 , 60) and his role in big raids. Were not talking about low level taps or dots stacking ect on gnolls. <P> We all know they wont ever make dots stack thats simply stupid. If all my dots stuck land I can do close to 10k alone. The answer to making necros happy imo is to give them 1 spell they can do damage with and allow them to heal their pet at the same time. It makes sense to me as a reasonible solution to a LARGE PROBLEM.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Terenil:  I think they need to lower spell resistance across the uber mobs to begin with.  Then wizards could use their huge dd's and necros could use their lifetaps.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems that the majority of the problems here boil down to one simple fact.  The necromancer class breaks down if they cannot regain health via taps and that MANY high level mobs resist taps completely.<P>I have a coupld of suggestions:<P>1) Change the resist type of Taps from Magic to whichever is found LEAST on mobs, Disease or Poison<P>2) Decrease the resist rates on taps but leave them magic based<P>3) Here is the really creative one and I'm going to use a bit of simplistic PseudoCode for when a Necromancer attacks a mob via the Tap Deflux which damages for about 310 and heals for about 310<P>If MOB_LVL &gt;= (Player_Lvl + 6) Then 100% Resist ELSE Check Resist<BR>   If Check Resist=True Then MOB_Damage=0 and Necro_Heal=310 ELSE MOB_Damage=310 and Necro_Heal-310<P>In case my pseudocode doesn't make sense, here it is in english.<P>If a mob is 6 lvls or less above the necro, he will ALWAYS be healed based on the power of tap used.  If the spell passes the resist test, then the mob will also have damage done to it.<P>Now..some of you might be thinking...what a coding nightmare, but I don't think so, because this is already how things work a necro Tap-Over-Time spell is active on the mob.  For example:  If Necro #1 casts Bond of Death on the Mob, the Mob is damaged about 800 over time and the Necro is Healed the same over that period of time.  If Necro #2 casts Bond of Death on the Mob while Necro #1's Bond of Death is still active, then the Necro is healed, but the Mob is NOT DAMAGED.<P>Personally, I think this solution is quite clever as it does not add any significant power to the Necro Class, yet allows that class to perform its new support roles efficiently against high-level mobs because it can regain health lost to lich whilst giving mana to others.<P>What Say you...Absor and Others.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hmm, so (Alan) you are looking for ways to improve the demand for necros but not making them more powerful.  I think you are going the right way, I think us necro's are already very powerful, but it is true that we dont really have a good role on a raids.<P>Necros kill, thats what were best at, were not the fastest killers, but were very efficient...and on raids, we can't use those skills very well, we as a lvl 50+ necro on a raid, we  become as usefull as a lvl 29 character at killing (in my opinion).  We can't use our pets, we can't use our DoTs, even though its fixed lvl 54+ as you say, what about say hate or fear? most mobs are not lvl 54+ there, and no raid leader in their right mind would let a necro dot up there.  So what can we do? <P>Necros can heal, but were not primary healers, we can crowd control, but were no enchanters thats for sure.  The only thing that is really unique to a necro that is really usefull is our ability to transfer mana.  So, what if that skill was made better?  <P>What if there was a spell added; that had a long duration, and would donate mana over time.  Like the pact series of spells, but with mana not life, and it could donate it at the same rate Lich works.  So essentially with lich on, someones mana would stay the same.  But giving the mana gain of lich to another PC, but of course you are taking the HP drain.<P>And what about necros being able to give a usefull buff or two? the only buff we get is Dead Man Floating.  What about some unique spells, something new...maybe giving some ability that we can already do to another player, like what about a lich type spell that can be casted on someone else?  less powerful and shorter duration maybe.  What about a buff to help tanks too?  What about a buff that was equal to our pet buff for PC tanks?  or maybe thats augment heh, i dont know ... just brainstorming here.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necro dots are first cast/highest level.<P>Necro 1 lands Bond then ALL other necros are out of luck as their bond spell is now useless as it cannot land.<P>Necro 1 now casts Pyro and lands it. Since Necro 1 is lv 60 ALL other necros are unable to cast as their spell wont land. If necro 2 had landed it first and was less then lv 60 his spell would have been overwritten by Necro 1.<P> This all leads back to the fact that Necros were NOT A GROUP FRIENDLY class when they were designed. VI changed their vision midstream and tried to make them group friendly and the result is this current nitemare.<P> A lv 60 necro is a manastone and thats it. Woot great reason to play a game!. Give us a reason to play "the most powerful class" in EQ. Being a manastone is not a good enuff reason to have suffered being an outcast in every city in the world for 60 levels. We were always told the reason we were so hated was do to our immense power and this horrid faction was the result. If your taking away that power how about taking away the crappy faction i had to live with fer 160 played days. The biggest error you made with necros was giving us the ability to twich. It always shud have been an enchater spell.<P>Sorta off topic but its all part of this issue imo.<P>Nillayan<BR>Warduck of RoV<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor you are looking for raid specific abilities so here would be some nice ones.<P>1.  Group Dead Man Floating.<BR>2.  54+ taps upgraded to lure resistance (or at least stick on these uber magic resistance mobs somehow).<BR>3.  More effective ways of holding/purchasing 39th level coffins. (they are very hard to get especialy for an iksar).<BR>4.  Pets... If you dont want to make them immune to fear how about just the dragon fear?  Personaly i believe all undead should be immune to fear except the undead only fear.  In all roleplaying settings i have seen undead can not be affected by mind altering spells unless they were specificly used against undead.<BR>5.  Group Dead man floating again.  Or at least get rid of the recast time on it.  Its very annoying having to DMF 60 people because a mob Fluxes or on a Trak raid (especialy in places like WW were people get dispelled).  <BR>6.  If you cant make pets immune to fear how about a pet buff that makes them immune to fear but have it last only like 2 min.<BR>7.  Can pets please use the summoners resistances?  AEs kill pets way to fast.  At least magicians can summon pets according to the type of mob and therefore are immune to the AE. (IE firepet agaisnt a fire AE).<P>just a few raiding suggestions<BR>Rekna 55 Defiler<BR>Rodcet</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
