</FONT><HR>I think the suspension was totally justified ... no doubt at all, it was trade fraud. The person buying the wurmslayer made a mistake dropping it, but no one is perfect. This type of fraud really angers me since a more experienced player took advantage of a possibly inexperienced player, and someone that made a mistake. If I were the GM that received the complaint, I would follow the "guidelines" and suspend. I would also be looking for ANY good excuse to ban. I think the GM was looking for the slightest hint of a threat and colla made that pretty easy to find. I enjoy playing because for the most part, the people I run into are friendly and honest. I have also run into a few people that ruin the environment for the rest, and now that number has decreased by one .<BR>I do have one question ... what would have happened if someone not involved in the transaction standing nearby saw the item and picked it up, not knowing why it was there? What are the official rules about finding items on the ground? <P>Rol<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, I think that what you did, whatever the GM might call it (trade fraud), was very wrong. In your shoes, I would have gave they guy a tell saying he droped his trade, gave it back, and went on my way.<P>Secondly, as a trader, as we all are, what happened after you clicked on "TRADE" was not your fault. I repeat, NOT YOUR FAULT. That guy was, IMO, very um.. "not smart". In all probobilty, his account was ebayed. *probobly*<P><BR>Suspension for 3-5 days would have suffice ...<P><BR>But anyways, nowadays, I think GM's are having TOO MUCH real life powers. This game is becomimg TOO serious for more people everyday, and the GM's are begining to loose their love for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's so funny hearing these stories of how people say they were unjustly banned and then you read what transpired, and all I have to say is WTG GM's, it's good to know you are looking out for things like this, and that there is some type of justice served on occasion. What person would not have tried to give the guy his Wurmslayer back that he just paid for(actually I think you've answered that for me). I mean if the game has made you so involved, and greedy you want to cheat another person to get ahead, then it's time you quit anyway.

</FONT><HR>If I were you I'd pick it up and give it to him again.<P>But that was not trade fraud, item and money were put into trade window and both player hit trade. Whatever happens money/item after clicking trade is not buyer/seller's responsibility. If the new owner decided or accidentally dropped the item on the ground and got picked up by player/NPC. The item owner is the only one to blame. Remember, a trade is ended when trade is clicked and trade window closes, this is no way illegal by laws. Verant should get their stuff straight.<P>Again, I am not on either you or Verant's side, but like I said earier you should just give it back to him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You got what you deserved, little man.  You ripped the guy off.  The buyer might not be the brightest bulb in the pack, but he expected a fair trade.  He got robbed.  Buh-bye, thief.  Maybe this will teach you a lesson, but by the tone of your posts, I doubt it.<P>Also, for those that use the argument that you're not responsible for what happens after both parties click the Trade button, that's simply idiotic.  Over and above this moronic ethic is what we call "common decency."  If you don't know what that means, ask your grandparents.  Their generation had it.  Basically, if the weapon fell because of no room in the inventory, then you pick it up and give it to person.  Period.  If you don't, you're simply an ass and a thief.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Boy sounds like my children when they get into an argument. I would rate this one a 10 for entertainment value, boy those GMs do a good job in and out of game. If it wasnt for them banning whiney prepubescent ego tripping punks like this, I would not know what to do for laughs before i decide to login. As to the poster wiht the child analogy, sorry to tell you but you were entrusted with the care of an adolescent which make you responsible for that childs well being, your irresponsible action of leaving the child near an oven that is hot is considered neglect and indeed you should be sued for medical costs at the least. I am amazed at what one thinks is socially justifieable, and expects others to see as the same. Heres a little hint for you buddy go clear up your acne, brush your teeth take a shower, using soap, and go find a girlfriend seems you take your level in EQ too seriously and think that due to how long you have been playing that WE the EQ community OWE you something, guess again we are not your free ride to riches. Trying to pull scams like that in real life can get you seriously hurt, yes it is a digital world that we are dealing with and yes people will do things in game that they would never do in real life, sounds like pent up inferiority complex, based upon a lack of honor integrity and moral responsibility. Perhaps when you join another MMORPG you will be a bit older with a bit more consideration for those around you, good luck on growing up.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Damn it and I said it twice "If I were him I'd just give it back" I am not on his side nor verant's, but something's wrong in this picture, I don't know what RL law applies in EQ but "if" this is RL, there's no law that requires you return lost goods to the owner, but a good person would, return the item. As for trade fraud, trade was complete and what fraud there was? If you trade me a wurmslayer I gave you 5k some pp, both shown in trade window and we both click trade to honor the trade, the action is complete here, if I find no wurmslayer in my invtory can I petition against you? no. In this case the one who picked up the wurmslayer happened to be the seller, after the trade, the seller would be treated as common player, not a seller anymore, so this case became a player picked up an item another player drops, it's not a trade fraud.<P>First, It's "Morally" wrong for the seller here picking up the item knowing the buyer dropped it without returning it. However, it's not illegal keeping an item you found with no identifaction on it.<P>Second, For Verant. The trade is completed, there was no fraud during the trade, You can add some other crime title i.e dishonest or whatever you want, to the seller, but not trade fraud.<P>AGAIN, I do not stand on either side, seller is wrong, for not returning, buyer is wrong for not clearing up space, Verant is wrong for giving the wrong sentence. That's all I have to say.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After reviewing the eqlog, as I player I am convinced that EQ made the correct choice in this matter. What I found particularly disturbing was the attitude of the author of this post.<P>He had the chance to issue a say to the player after the trade and give him the wyrmslayer. After he was TP'd to another zone he could have given the buyer a 'Tell' to arrange for a meeting.<P>The seller could have even petitioned the GM himself to the effect of "I just attempted to make a 5.3kpp trade for a wyrmslayer with player X. He droped it. I now have both his money and the slayer. Can you facilitate an item swap?"<P>Even though the seller did not chose to do any of these things, he could have avoided being kicked off the server by first handing over the money, and THEN discussing the issue with the GM.<P>The seller may not belive that this trade was that big of a deal. What about the buyer? Clearly he felt it was enough of an issue to petition the GM's.<P>The seller in this matter should be glad that he was only suspended on the first go-a-round. I would have booted him right then and there.<P>The GM was nothing more than polite. He was directive, and would not cave in on his position, but none the less polite.<P>I reconize that "GM harrasment" may be the best name for being kicked of the server. I would call it dishonesty, cheating, and arrogance. These are certainly not conducive to "playing nice".<P>Remember folks, first and formost EQ is a GAME. That is all. If you can not play nice with the other peaple at the table, at some point they will pick up their cards and leave you sitting all alown.<P>Perhaps this was indeed the first instance of this player breaking the rules, or not playing nice. In fairness I will assume so.<P>Just like in Baseball, if you ignore the umpires ruling and debate the issue with him, you will be suspended. That is the way that it should be.<P>It is a good thing for the seller that the GM was not reading his Guildsay's at the time. The quality of the sellers personal chariter in the matter is clearly shown by his "Hey I am locked in a room and being interigated....".<P>That comment alone should be a slam dunk.<P>EvilEric<BR>Seventh Hammer<P>OOC: I have been working in Customer Service for over 10 years.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read the text of ur hearing, from what I got out of it is that u did get caught in a trading scam, the simple thing is the right thing to do. At the time he dropped it u should of picked it up(like u did) and should have given it to him because he (plain old bought it), we all make mistakes in this world and in rl, but that old question stands (do the right thing), U did not U choose to ignore the person u traded with and say ah it's his tuff luck(lucky me I got 5300pp for nothing hehe).Well u got pulled into a hearing and I bet u weren't laughing at that point(because u didn't do the right thing),and then u choose to say hey I did nothing wrong.I don't know if u can get what I'm talking about I have repeated it many times (Do the right thing, treat everyone fairly)but u may never get it.U choose not necessarily coming out and saying to the GM hey I am threatning u, but it definately was implied from what I saw in the text.<BR>So I agree with the GM and believe he was right in his decision, and hope that his decision will stand, the world we fight , find love, make friendships, and die in , is a very harsh world indeed.So don't be surprised that this world we have come to love, gives out harsh punishments.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow.  Someone made a trade, picked up the item they were trading and ran off with it.  Didn't even bother to tell the person who they were trading with what happened.  Hmm.  I have to wonder if we are getting the whole story.  Since we will only ever get the 'one side' we may never know.  I have to agree with the suspension and the resulting banning.  I think it was trade scamming anyway you want to look at it.  Even the log you posted shows all you wanted to do was complain about not being able to scam the poor guy.  As for the poster who doesn't think they should be sued if they allow a child they are watching to burn themselves on a hot stove......well, not only could you be sued for not ensuring the childs safety, but you could also be investigated for child abuse by a child protection agency.  ( I hope the post was only hypothetical ).  As for a good analogy,  could a UPS delivery driver be forced to pay a person for an item that they took from a front porch after attempting to make a delivery only to find there is no one home and no place in the mailbox to put the item?  Actually I'm sure that that could be prosecuted in the REAL world as theft.  As far as a virtual world, well the GM are considered the police, judges and executioners. (  read the Judge Dread comic ) It's stupid to argue with them or even make the appearance of *threatening* them.  You got exactly what you deserve.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Remember the saying "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutly" I think from what i read this saying aplies. I saw no written threat... all i did see was home boy tell the GM he was gonna fight the decission and the GM says "Is that a threat?" NO you dumbass that was not a threat! Personally I think that if the other kid in the trade was too slow to take the advice from chilly willy here then its his loss... anyone in the bank could have taken the WS and run... cheeze boy just happend to be the first... personally i would have given it to the kid but thats just me. I know how hard it is to come up with even 1Kp but 5.3!?! thats a little harsh! yes I have made the mistake of droping a rather expensive Axe of the Iron Black and had it stolen... I even saw the lil basterd that stole it but I did nothin because I was a dumbass for droping it in a crowded place!! Anywayz I think the ruling was way too harsh and refer to the saying above for my feelings on "GM's" I have been haveing a problem with my EQ game and have been asking GM's and callin CS and posting on chatboards and still nothin!

</FONT><HR>Judging the tone of some of these responses in here, and the type of language used, a lot of these posters must be below the age of 16. Now for my 2cp worth!!! Point Number One: This WAS a trade scam, seeing as how you picked up the item he dropped and got ported somewhere quickly. Point Number Two: From your responses to the GM, one could imply you were threatening him. Point Number Three: You got peeved because you either had to give back the plat or the weapon and decided to get abrasive with the GM. They can care less if you are the President of Verant, much less a former "employee"!!! They are the final say on the servers. Point Number Four: The banning IS justified seeing as how you have a past history of misbehavior. The only reason you got back in last time was that you managed to flood the message board(which they fixed so you can't do it again). Point Number Five: If you will CAREFULLY read both of your flood attempts on this issue, you will see an overwhelming majority of people that are NOT on YOUR side. Let it drop, find another game, and scam the players over there til you get banned from that and then move on to the next. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"> <P>Now I think it is time to let this particular discussion die off so we can get back to helping the people that are having REAL problems, not ones they created in-game by getting snippy with the GM's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having read these posts I can't help but add my 2cp.<P>1) This guy seems to be quite a jerk.  Whether he purposely ripped this guy of is questionable, however, he did not return the item which should have been given to the purchaser as common curtesy.  Can you imagine a $4,300 piece of jewlry dropping on the showroom floor and the sales person picks it up and puts it back in the display case along with your $4,300 in tha cash register.<P>2) I can see this guys argument, in that he is trying to look at the circumstances, paying no attention to common decency.  Yes, it is not your fault that the item fell on the floor, and you have every right to pick it up, but you are not some radom guy who found the item laying around.  You are the guy who knew that there was a good chance it would fall on the floor, knew that by examining the rules this would (so you may have thought) not be considered a scam and picked it up and TPed out of there.<P>3) When the GM called you in to be Judged you figured, based on the fact that the item was free game, you had done nothing wrong.  Having been summoned you should have given up the item, and from what I read, that would have been the end of it.  Instead you decided to argue the point as if it were a court of law based on circumstances.  This was not a court of law but Verant's court of Play Nice or Else.<P>4) The GM did not ban, but suspended you for threatening him.  As far as I can tell your initial remark was a threat, and even though you denied it, overall you came off as a bit arrogant.  I think the suspension was reasonable given the circumstances.<P>5) You were later banned.  From what I read I think that banning was a bit harsh, but then again I never read the email you sent to the manager.  Somehow, I doubt it was your admitting you were wrong for doing what you did.  <P>In conclusion, I agree with the suspension but feel I do not have sufficient information to determine whether the banning was just.  Perhaps you should post your email correspondense leading to the banning. <P>Either way, as indecent your act was, I do wish you luck and hope that you have learned a lesson.  <P>Yis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think you guys understand what happened.. Colla here wasn't intentionally going to rip-off the guy,.. he just happen to pick up a DROPED ITEM on the ground FULL OF OTHER PLAYERS. That is what happened literally.<P>Now, I don't condone what he did. In fact, I think it was morally wrong... but he did get caught -- Atoned for it by giving up the money to the guy and getting summoned forcefully.<P>Now, I've met a lot of GMs and whenever I get summoned for one reason or another, they always give a tell saying "you will be summoned .. are you ready?".  But forcefully summoned is like getting kidnaped!<P>From the log, I say the GM took Colla's words and twisted it around so he can hear what he wanted to hear. If you're any smart as you would hope, you could see that.<P>Suspension I think was necessary but outright banning is kind of harsh. One mistake of a typing and if a GM takes it the wrong way and misunderstands it, BANG .. YOU'RE BANNED!<P>Now ... what do you say?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ROFLMAO!<P>You sir are a GEM  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I DO NOT agree that it was a trade scam... as a trade scam CANNOT happen! the coding is strict enough that noone can cheat you... but you have to check everything before clicking TRADE.<P>Your act is indeed dis-honourable and therefore GM involvement is essential. ONE THING I don't understand... how did Jumlace know YOU picked it up?<P>It's could've been anyone right? Either there was noone else - and so he immediately confronted you... or there was and he questioned you about it.<P>What you failed to LOG Mr Collo was your contempt for this idiot, you quite obviously LAUGHED IN HIS FACE... instead of saying something like "Eh? what.. I traded it... I haven't got it? blah de blah" YOU like all dis-honourable thieving GITS LAUGHED in his face told him where to go and RAN. Scarppered and then discussed your lucky strike with your friend.<P>Ha hah. GMs ROCK in situations like this.<P>But your attitude - by your own admission with your post - is unbelievable. How can you READ thru that and NOT understand your THREAT. You clearly state that you will take it further, it's not over blah de blah.<P>In Real Life you are Stan. Just leave your girlfriend (oh you haven't got one cool), erm.. your Gerbil then, at home before you drive yourself off that bridge.<P>With lvl 50+ chars.... why would you need to rip him off? Your other characters must have fortunes.. twink yourself, you can probably get a Wurmslayer in a few minutes with characters like that AND belonging to a GUILD.<P>A GEM sir.. a true GEM.<P>Shame we may have to suffer you in ALL other games. <P>Hey VERENT/SONY. Can you Ban him from ever starting a chaacter on the new SWG too.. before it's too late?<P>heh heh and while you're at it, change the TRADE code. if there's NO ROOM, cancel the trade and show a warning message - don't DROP IT.. that's a stupid bit of coding anyway.<P>Patch DAY tomorow again then Hazaah!<P>Oh yeah and get these Servers up... tis the only reason I'm readin these boards.<P>You know that IF they re-instate you.... everybody KNOWS your name and of all your characters, you will be berated for LIFE LOL<P>So will Jamlace 'Hail', 'please', 'what?'<P>Jumlace you too are a true GEM. 'Hail' ROFLMAO<P>GEMS the lot of ya 'Hail'<BR>LOL<BR>LOL<BR>I'm wetting myself now LOL ROFL<BR>ARRRGGHHH 'Hail'<P>Classic All Time Comedy.<P>Eveybody say 'Hail'<P>Ha hah hahha haah<P>phew... anyway banned for your attitude towards a GM was the reason... and a just BAN it was - you DID threaten him you idiot, and he even gave you the contact number as HE knew he was right, not that he would be backed up by his friends.<P>Does your GuildMate Ogglok or whateverhis name is even know you 'character witness' - I think he was a jesting. <P>'Hail' LOL</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
