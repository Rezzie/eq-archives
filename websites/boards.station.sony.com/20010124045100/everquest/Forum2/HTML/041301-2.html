</FONT><HR>But can you picture a rogue doing double 400 backstabs every six seconds? plus quad 25's every 2 seconds from haste? That's 3300 damage in 18 seconds. I don't know how realistic this is, but it does not seem too far fetched. Through in some resistance on your wizard, and the results are comparable. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hahahahaah!  Yeah, that's IF the rogue is able to do full damage the entire time, which is VERY rare.  Backstabs get the rogue up a few notches on the hate list every time they connect...<P>Maybe 2 double BS's and the mob will probably turn around unless you've got a REALLY good taunter, like a ranger, fighting...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They can go up to 2 BILLION+ hp !

</FONT><HR>Imaginactra says, "I base my scenarios on what 90% of everquest players experience. Certainly on a group raid you don't want to be pulling a target to anyone except the people you want doing the most damage to it. However, since the majority of EQ players will never be on a plains raid or never see Trakanon (unless the GM's sick it on a zone) my scenarios are quite valid."<P>Uhh...since when can you stand at max range an nuke something?  Outdoors you can but in dungeons I'm usually not more than 5 ft back from the tanks.  There just isn't room for that.<P>"A wizard going full burn in a group raid is the last thing you want. You're going to pull the target right to you when you want to keep it in melee range if your warriors. Save mana to evade and evac, use only very conservative applications of DD (after all, why did you bring the beef if your going to be doing all the work?). Go full burn on green stuff when your trying to build faction Blackburrow or Karana or something like that."<P>lol...duh.  However, there are times when full burn is in order.  It's called knowing your role...<P>The point of the post had nothing to do with whether you should full burn it was how much damage you could do compared to a rogue.  One of the roles of a wizard is to drop something fast if the cleric should get low on mana, etc.  However, that role can just as easily be filled by a rogue.  <P>EQ is about roles, not about who's got the most power.  If my roles are being taken by other classes than I have cause for concern.  As it stands, the role of the wizard is subsummed by all other classes.  Rogues can drop mobs quick, several other classes can stun/root, druids can evac, etc.  So, that leaves raids and aoe groups.  We got lures but on mobs with 300khp, that doesn't amount to any significant damage.  Again, you'd be much better off with a rogue.  So, that leaves aoe.  We are good for aoe and rogues aren't.  Too bad that 90% of all grouping situations aren't aoe compatible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The rogue does one thing and one thing only, and they do that one thing better than anyone else.<P>Would you give up root, gate, bind, and teleports for more hitting power?

</FONT><HR>The reason the melee groups are starting to get exp in multi group raids is that the hate list has been increased in length from (I think) 20 entries to 64 entries. Since melees hit many more times for less damage than a single wizard nuke, more melee damage is left on the list when the mob finally dies.<P>The kill is not awarded to the group who did the most total damage to the mob, it is awarded to the group that has the most damage on the hate list at time of death.<P>Incidentally, hate list mechanics are also why dots are a no-no on big mobs, because if the dot caster is pushed off the hate list before the end of the dot's duration (easy to do with a dozen meleers whacking the mob), and the mob dies from the dot, the damage is considered 'environmental' and the corpse poofs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

See, at first they were supposed to be the Masters of Magical Damage, and then it changed to the Masters of Fast Damage after they realised that mages and necros will out damage wizards over time.  Since rogues can out damage us, then they should change it to Masters of Fast Damage Except When There's a Rogue Around.  Or maybe, Masters of Kinda Fast Damage.  Oh...wait, mages and monks fit that role..I know!

</FONT><HR>I too doubt a rogue can outdamage a wizard in a short period of time.  Realistically a rogue will backstab in the hundreds and than they do their normal damage which is like a ranger or anything else.  The KS groups on the planes that I've noticed are still always casters, groups of necros and druids and wizards, especially if pets are allowed, watch out for the pet classes.  The only exception to this was if the mob was especially resistant like a spite golem or the fight took exceptionally long, the mob was CHed or something.  Using draughts a wizard is doing 700 damage every 5 seconds or so.  A rogue isn't doing more than that, get your head out of your ass.  wizards get resisted but melees miss a whole lot.  I remember my ranger which at least had a good offense if nothing else would always miss on large bosses.  At level 50 I think I did about 300 damage to Vox altogether and I lived through the whole fight Lol.  Believe me boy the problem is just mana regen.  Caster power is nothing but mana regeneration.  Get a bard in your group juggling songs.  The new druid clarity will up the power of casters I'm sure.<P>And rogues are so one dimensional more so than wizards.  They do damage.  Oh and they also open locks and sneak around.. ok.  No they cannot tank, don't try to pass that off on me.  I see rogues overtaunt all the time off the warrior and you will see their bar go down like a ranger's.  Rogues can do what wizards do without the fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Im glad the Paladin in my guild started a rouge is all I can say. That rouge and I are going to rock.<P>Dont get me wrong, the rouges have been needing something to cheer about for a long time. Just never thought that this would be the end result. Get a rouge with a Rage Bringer a FBSS or better and watch the reign of terror begin. Kinda slick actually.<P>If you are a caster and happend to get in a plane grp with a rouge its on. As much as it kills me to admit it. These guys have been long overdue for a bone from verant since day one.<P>Whats funny is at one time rouges were all but dead on our server. Now hehe they are multiplying like jack-rabbits in heat. They are more sought after now and better than (in my opinion) The Paladin Class and the Warrior class. Dont get too uptight Paladins and Warriors we all still love you meat shields but there is a new sheriff in town. He will rob ya blind too if you dont watch em hehe.<P>cheers for rouges....just keep em off me...<P>signed "The waterballoon throwing Wiz"<P>hehe cause thats sure what it looks like compared to these guys hehe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, just to clear things up: Rogues will CONSISTANTLY out damage wizards past 50, and even before if they have good enough gear. This began in Kunark, with the melee disciplines and weapons that destroyed anything found on the gods or dragons even before. What did wizards get? Spells that do half as much damage as ice comet, but are more efficient. Until level 57, chain casting ice comet does more damage in the same amount of time as any draught/lure spells. <P>Meanwhile, I see rogues in my guild backstabbing for 300-500 damage consistantly. I see rogues with their epic weapon (the easiest in the game to get) sometimes backstabbing for over 900, and have seen screenshots that were in the thousands. I saw a screenshot of someone backstabbing Trakanon for over 1000, so don't say it's just the mobs 45 or less. <P>Also - Rogues got the melee disciplines, which totally rock. Have you seen Venril Sathir raids lately? All warriors, monks, and rogues with 100% riposte discipline, and a half dozen wizards to finish him off when he's down to his last 20 or 25%. My last VS raid I cast Lure when they shouted for wizards to cast, landed it once, and started recasting. Half way through the second cast he was already dead. So big whoop - I landed one spell, for 640 dmg. I'm betting our 60 rogue did that with one BS, about 2 seconds into the fight.<P>I've been in full groups that could ONLY get exp from a monk if I cast 3-4 times as well. They don't do as much as rogues, but monks do such close damage to wizards, I really can't see why you'd pick us instead of a rogue either.<P>Consider this as well - mobs in velius have over 200,000 hp some of them. A wizards max damage has not increased at all. So while we were considered "balanced" by verant against uber mobs like Trakanon with only 32,000 we are somehow supposed to be "just fine" against something with 230,000? It shouldn't take a brain surgeon to realize that giving mobs 5-10x as many hp and NOT changing a wizards damage abilities in any way basically renders us useless.<P>Shazariahl, lv 56 wizard of 7th hammer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Truthfully (in my opinion) I think us as casters need even more mana-regen. The prob here is you cant keep up. Really in truthfully, if Harvest netted your mana back just 2 bubbles. No one could touch us and we would be just what that description says.<P>As wizards we have too many things that effect us manawise that we have no control over. Like one nite while in Sebilis...I dunno if this was a bug or not but. While flaming on the frog Wizards down there almost all the time I would get summoned. Spell interrupted no mana cost right?? Yeah thats what I thought too. But turns out I and the other casters were getting charged on mana for spells that should have been interrupted. <P>Now if this was relevant to melee characters. They would swing miss and their weapon goes flying outta their hands. Partial damage..I understand the idea behind partial damage for spells and GZ can say whatever he wants. This should not effect spells. Resists yeah ok ill take that. Partial damage has no relevance in spell lines.<P>Think of it like this. Guy swings a sword. He hit the creature in a vital area. Lets say a slice across the stomach area. That woulds score full damage. For that wepons damage rating. Ok same guy swings a sword and catches the guy on the wrist. Not a crital area...Partial damage. Now spells should be all or nothing. Either you hit or u dont. There is no in-between.<P>I would rather miss totally and not Agrro the mob. Instead of hitting for partial and having the creatures treat me like I got full damage. <P>Our high spell mana costs combined with the slowest of all pure casters on med time. This is whats got us falling short. I think Harvest should bring back 2 bubbs of mana. We wait like 10 minutes for it. Its not like its every 3 min or so.<P>But all in all. Im happy for the rouges. I hate it took em damn near 2 years to finally become the force they should have been from the onstart of the game. *waves his finger at Verant*<P>Thats ok I started a Rouge too.

</FONT><HR>Personally I think there is no way to modify wizards so that their damage will exceed rogues without overpowering them.  I love my wizard and would love to see him do more damage but that's probably not the right way to go about it.<P>Instead, *puts on his asbestos suit* I think they should nerf melee gear.  It's way overpowered.  The stuff you get nowadays makes the best pre-expansion gear look like total noob gear.  The consequence to this uber gear is that we get mobs with a half million hp and fast regen.  That should tell you something.  They are overcompensating for this gear.  <P>If they were to buff wizards it should probably be through gear.  Perhaps a wand with unlimited changers of draught of fire (9 sec casting time) would be ok and stuff like that.  At least then we are in the same boat as melee in that we are very dependent on gear to fulfill our potential.  Before everyone tells me about the rend robe...that's great for the .05% of wizards that will actually get into VP but it does absolutely nothing for the rest.

They are<BR>                        overcompensating for this gear. <P>So very true Sorshasu I never thought about it like that.<P><BR>Grim that would rock all I can say is I wish hehe..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Uhh... have you Wizards ever heard of AE groups?  I don't know about you but dishing out 3k-5k every few seconds is outdamaging a rogue.  Would like to see a rogue do damage to 8 or more mobs at a time.  Can't be done.  See, we are the masters of damage.  Nobody can beat us when we're AEin'.<P>Sabbok<BR>53 Wizard<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thats a real valid pnt. On the AoE's. The bottom line is AoE grps for some come too far and in-between. People are soo accustomed to MEZZ, that even in some AoE situtations, people still consider MEZZ over AoE.<P>And truthfully you cant blame em either. AoE is a big risk factor. If the mobs start resisting the stunner that whole grp is finished. I think AoE depends on your server. I have read on some boards folks utilizing AoE in dungeons. Which should  be a severe no no. But I think people were able to control their fears and practice to get it right.<P>Some cant even practice it. Servers do things very differently. But like you said throw in AoE and yes we are truly the best. Well that is if the rogue doesnt have a RageBringer hehe 8)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, I just want to say, leave the Rogues alone!<P>Second, I was really annoyed with this thread until it turned into a pretty intelligent discussion about ten responses or so ago.  I only hope someone at Verant cares enough to read this far down.<P>Wizards badly need some help, but please don't pick on the melee classes.
