&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>In the wake of the recent "connectivity issues" with most of the EQ servers (not the recent power issue), I compiled a significant amount of data from public sources and sent Verant a detailed e-mail concerning the problem.<P>The reply, while polite, accomplished two things. First it validated my findings, and second seemingly shrugged off the issue.<P>I send this to the message boards for several reasons. First, while Verant refuses to state who is to blame for conectivity problems this data clearly places some (undetermined amount, but likely significant) blame on Verant. Second, to gather opinion on the issue from my fellow players. Third, to appeal to Abashi to provide more detail in this matter. (The EQ CSR's response of "considerd," in the past tense, is of most concern) Almost any change Verant makes to improve connectivity will be publically available, if you know where to look.<P>Abashi, as a relatively new player the perception is not good, please help me understand what Verant is doing to correct the underlying problem.<P>---------<BR>Original message to Verant (Names witheld)<BR>---------<BR>Preface:<P>    I'm a Sr. Network Engineer in the Backbone Engineering department of a Tier1 National ISP. (I can't identify who, but anything beyond a cursory check should answer your question). I'm writing this lengthy email for several reasons:<P>        1. To understand why Verant is having these "Connectivity Problems".<BR>        2. To ascertain what Verant is doing to avoid them in the future, and to assist in that task.<P>Information Base: Much information is available (publicly) regarding the layout of the EQ servers. In fact many GMs will give out the DNS names of specific servers in the Chat room. They are numbered eqworld-XX.989studios.com, and the login server eqlogin1.989studios.com. Given the IP address of those servers and a look at the BGP tables from a few ISPs (my own, and from<BR>http://nitrous.digex.net) the logical (and many times physical) layout of the entire EQ network can be obtained. Further, many 'fan' web-sites have lists of which world server number is which server name.<P>Analysis: I have enumerated the eqworld-xx and eqloginx IP addresses and compiled a list of IP blocks Verant is apparently using for EQ. This list includes the following: 64.37.148.0/22, 192.215.37.0/24, 192.215.33.0/24, 192.215.54.0/24 and,192.215.55.0/24. I next performed an ARIN search and BGP query on each address space and obtained the following information. The 64.37.148.0/22 space is owned by sony and clearly labeled "EQ". The 192.215.0.0/16 space is owned by CerfNet and not SWIPed or rwhois allocated to Sony (or Verant or 989studios, etc.) The BGP lookups from Digex (nitrous - MAE East) are below:<P>Query: bgp<BR>Addr: 64.37.148.0<P>BGP routing table entry for 64.37.144.0/20, version 43309794<BR>Paths: (16 available, best #14)<BR>  Advertised to peer-groups:<BR>     rr-pop<BR>  3356 13720<BR>    209.244.219.161 (metric 150200) from 165.117.1.195 (165.117.1.195)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:172 2548:264 2548:666 3706:115<BR>  7018 13720<BR>    165.117.67.94 (metric 430300) from 165.117.1.180 (165.117.1.180)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:171 2548:282 2548:666 3706:115<BR>  701 13720<BR>    137.39.52.77 (metric 110401) from 165.117.1.139 (165.117.1.139)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:180 2548:246 2548:666 3706:132<BR>  3356 13720<BR>    166.90.50.141 (metric 290501) from 165.117.1.204 (165.117.1.204)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:172 2548:263 2548:666 3706:170<BR>  3356 13720<BR>    165.117.60.230 (metric 310300) from 165.117.1.155 (165.117.1.155)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:172 2548:302 2548:666 3706:161<BR>  701 13720<BR>    137.39.23.153 (metric 630200) from 165.117.1.50 (165.117.1.50)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:243 2548:666 3706:140<BR>  7018 13720<BR>    165.117.59.254 (metric 430500) from 165.117.1.153 (165.117.1.153)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:171 2548:283 2548:666 3706:161<BR>  701 13720<BR>    137.39.140.21 (metric 410500) from 165.117.1.76 (165.117.1.76)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:180 2548:254 2548:666 3706:102<BR>  701 13720<BR>    137.39.141.41 (metric 420300) from 165.117.1.84 (165.117.1.84)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:255 2548:666 3706:136<BR>  7018 13720<BR>    192.205.32.113 (metric 430600) from 165.117.1.24 (165.117.1.24)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:171 2548:280 2548:666 3706:132<BR>  7018 13720<BR>    165.117.63.82 (metric 450600) from 165.117.1.172 (165.117.1.172)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:171 2548:281 2548:666 3706:170<BR>  3356 13720<BR>    165.117.63.66 (metric 160400) from 165.117.1.110 (165.117.1.110)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:172 2548:303 2548:666 3706:168<BR>  701 13720<BR>    137.39.52.33 (metric 280400) from 165.117.1.199 (165.117.1.199)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 2548:180 2548:245 2548:666 3706:161<BR>  701 13720<BR>    165.117.51.254 (metric 110200) from 165.117.1.165 (165.117.1.165)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal, best<BR>      Community: 2548:180 2548:244 2548:666 3706:164<BR>  1239 3356 13720<BR>    192.41.177.241 from 192.41.177.241 (144.228.107.1)<BR>      Origin incomplete, metric 35, localpref 100, valid, external<BR>      Community: 2548:200 2548:666<BR>  1239 3356 13720, (received-only)<BR>    192.41.177.241 from 192.41.177.241 (144.228.107.1)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 35, localpref 100, valid, external<P>BGP routing table entry for 192.215.0.0/16, version 34140075<BR>Paths: (2 available, best #1)<BR>  Advertised to peer-groups:<BR>     rr-pop<BR>  1740<BR>    134.24.32.65 (metric 210500) from 165.117.1.44 (165.117.1.44)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal, best<BR>      Community: 1740:500 1740:777 1740:10001 2548:185 2548:210 2548:666 3706:130<BR>  1740<BR>    134.24.32.69 (metric 360600) from 165.117.1.49 (165.117.1.49)<BR>      Origin IGP, metric 4294967294, localpref 100, valid, internal<BR>      Community: 1740:500 1740:777 1740:10001 2548:211 2548:666 3706:133<P>The last piece of analysis I did was with my firewall logs. When I play I use the Torv server. The Firewall logs UDP to the CerfNet address space, therefore Torv is located in CerfNet's Colocation Center (educated guess based on mutual clients use of that address space). The use of multiple upstream ISPs in the 64.37.144.0/20 block is a good sign, UUNet, Level 3, AT&T, etc. What is of concern is the complete lack of redundancy for the CerfNet-located machines. A Ping test against the enumerated world DNS names returns 14 servers on the 64 space and 24 on CerfNet. I do not have historical information, therefore I do not know if this number has changed<BR>in proportion, either for the good, or bad.<P>By having CerfNet (AT&T) SWIP, or RWhois Sony (or whoever  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> the IP space allocated to them, and provisioning additional circuits to redundant ISPs (like has been done with the 64 block) the connectivity issues of recent memory can (almost) be avoided. Clever announcements, use of route-maps, and community strings can further utilize these links in a backup-only or partial-load-balance manner.<P>The analysis complete, I am back at my 2 basic questions:<BR>        1. To understand why Verant is having these "Connectivity Problems".<BR>        2. To ascertain what Verant is doing to avoid them in the future, and to assist in that task.<P>Speaking to question 1: I can plainly see the technical reasons why these problems are occurring. The question is more of a political (?) nature, not a technical one. Given enough pressure/time/incentive this can easily be fixed. Abashi has commented to me publicly (last week, I believe) in the chat server during another connectivity incident that Verant does not state 'who' has the root problem.<P>Speaking to question 2:  If CerfNet/AT&T is not allowing you access to redundant links (as some Hosting centers tend to do, unfortunately), tell the user base. Perhaps Verant can not provide the incentive, but 50,000+ users might. If the root cause is a decision made by Verant, admit your fault (we are all human after all), and tell us what you will do to fix this, and when. The<BR>outcry will likely be severe at first, but less severe then the outcry if this continues. As for my assistance - I hope I am bringing this issue to light in such a way as to provide _constructive_ criticism, unlike the recent barrage of posts on the message board.<P>Please respond at your earliest convienence.<P>Sincerely,<BR>(Name Withheld)<P>----------<BR>Verant's Reply<BR>----------<BR>Your observations are quite astute, and your recommendations are valid.<P>We are constantly scrutinizing our network, and planning ways to bring better connectivity to our customers.<P>Thank you for taking the time to share your ideas with us.  You'd be happy to know that some of what you've said has already been considerd as growth plans for our network.  Though I cannot disclose any specifics, we actively changing and building our network for even better customer experience.<P>Feel free to respond back to this email address if you have any other concerns.  Thank you for being a customer of Sony Online Entertainment.<P>(Name Witheld)<BR>--------<P>Abashi - Thank you for your attention to this matter.

</FONT><HR>Greetings all,<BR>I have spent much time in Chat for months now (and here), I have observed the following:<P>* There was a dramatic increase in connection problems when the LinkDeath nerf was introduced on Wed 19th July.<P>* Ever since then I estimate a few hundred players cannot play each day.<P>* Each patch since then seems to CHANGE the subset of players who cannot connect - there are many players unable to connect for various periods of time over the past few months - way before the last patch.<P>* Tragically, the trend is upwards, Chat during busy time is packed with connection problem reports, each month it gets worse.<P>* EQ Connection problems are much more prevalent during peak EQ time.<P>* During EQ peak time, CERFnet is often overloaded as measured by repeated traces (i.e. high packet loss).<P>* Connection problems, however, STILL OCCUR during quiet time (but MUCH less frequently).<P>* EQ connection problems ARE often ISPs, and routers - but there is clearly a remainder of problems at EQs end.<P>* Many people erroneously think that because it IS sometimes routers/ISPs, then it MUST be always routers/ISPs whenever ANY connect error occurs - this is the frustratingly wrong line pushed by the guides and GMs in Chat that gets everyone so upset.<P>* Many people erroneously think that if it was an EQ problem then everyone would be affected, not just a few hundred - that is completely FALSE, that is not how bugs work, bugs usually strike a minority, the smaller the minority, the harder to find. It is blatantly false advice like this from Verant reps which make them lack credibility on tech issues.<P>* Many people erroneously think that a Connection Problem MUST be the Internet. Not so - the connection problem could be at Verant's end of the connection. <P>* Verant representatives have firmly and clearly stated repeatedly, over many weeks of connection problems by hundreds of players, that Verant does NOT have a problem at their end. I haven't seen a Verant rep even answer a connect problem post for weeks now...<P>* Oddly, for some people the EQ connection problems SOMETIMES seem to come and go for no obvious reason (i.e. everything is fine, ISP, modem, etc, even checked by experts) - sometimes it just goes bad one day, then goes good again later, various things may contribute to the improvement (re-dial, re-install Dx7.0a, re-install TCP/IP stack, Win98 Critical Updates) but the real problem seems to be at EQ's end.<P>* Connection problems sometimes strike ONLY one character, while other chars are fine.<P>* Connection problems sometimes strike ONLY one account, while other accounts from that very PC are fine.<P>* Connection problems sometimes strike just one <BR>PC, while another PC right next to it is fine.<P>* It is known that the 1018 Active Char/Synch problem occurs after /q or LinkDeath (GMs warn not to use /q specifically).<P>* 1018 Active Char error can last for days (which it clearly should not if acting as intended).<P>* 1017 Error can last for days (unlikely for internet to be bad for days, particularly if all other signs show the Internet is fine, just EQ is bad)<P>* Verant admitted a connection problem several patches back when they said the 1018 Problem was fixed in the patch message - no improvement was observed.<P>* One or more servers has come down for one reason or another almost every day for the last couple weeks - usually during peak time.<P>Posts like Daroz' should help to isolate the problem (at least technically) - the really issue is that Verant has done nothing after months of  service denial to hundreds.<P>Findel<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*shrug*<BR>Earlier, when the 1017's were hitting, we were in the chat room with a GM in there.  Don't remember the name and wouldn't disclose it if I did, but anyway... We were given the "Log out of EQ, reboot, and then run the thorough file check twice" thing, which of course spawned a lot of the "Touch your toes, go outside, spit on the back of your left hand twice," etc. etc. etc. (insert more random things in there).  Well, I spoke up.  Asked everyone to shut up for a sec, and asked if there was anything we could do to help since the problem was on their end.  They denied it.  I mentioned that I'm at Georgia Tech on a massive fiber pipe (believe it's 4 OC-48's that make up the backbone that mindspring, bellsouth, GaTech, and all these peeps around here share) and that the problems I was hitting would not, and could not, be an isp issue.  That and I checked with OIT here to make sure the routers weren't crapping on UDP packets, which some hyperarc cards did at ISP's, and it's often a software issue.  Anyway, I digress... my our network was running spiffy and clean, and the GM was silent on the issue for around 5 minutes when a network ops guy shows up.  We all were surprised, but he asked us to traceroute and dump the log to a file and email it in.  We Georgia Tech boys did that in short order, of course (from my linux box that I'm ipmasquerading through so I didn't even have to close EQ... *contented sigh*) and around 3 minutes later, no lie, he says "Try to connect now."<P>1017 was gone.<P>Moral of the story - there's people out there who can help Verant, or hurt Verant.  That's the people that know their stuff with computer systems, be it networking, graphics API's, or what have you.  There are problems on Verant's end.  Noone is blaming them or yelling or pointing fingers because of that.  It's the fact that they generally don't own up to it that causes problems... <P>Be honest with us.  We're honest with you (unless of course we're the 12 year old trolls that want the world to crash and burn and die etc. etc. etc.... *sigh* they give the rest of us a bad name, methinks).  We love your game, and we're willing to forgive and forget, and most importantly, and most obviously, to work with you.<P>Silrellia</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Nothing at all !! So if the tech read that please don't say that ... and if someone send you a trace route read it !!! If you do not know how to read it then ask to be formed to that and stop sending pre-formated answer that would be kind . There is nothing more that bug me than receiving an answer where i have the feeling the other is playing the fool with me and having other stuff to do than my problem.<P>Well this is all i had to say.<P>Menaden<P>PS : if you see spelling mistakes, don't take them in account .. i am not english native at all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>PSS : i also have spoken to some tech who have tried to do some stuff and we agree with the pb of cerf ... after well i mailed to cerf ... but not answers ..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've recently god the description of the server status protocol, and found a fairly recent list of Server Names and IP addresses. I have a set of tools I can roll out that measures traceroute hop counts, times, and plain-old ping times as well. I'm considering making a 'status page', most likely for my own use, and mabye opening it up to everyone in the future. The problem is that I only have a single point of measurement and should there be problems at that point a cursory glance would make it appear to be Verant's problem, not mine, which would not be fair.<P>My hope still remains that Verant will come clean on at least this issue of their own accord.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant does pay attention and listen to what people are saying sometimes and when they do things can only turn out for the better (unless of course those people are begging for nerfs hehe).  The errors saying you have to wait to resync after you go LD was a quick patch to cover up a corpse-dupe bug, although they will never admit it (can you blame them).  Hopefully someday they will fix it the right way...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Amazing - Tonight both myself and my wife were trying to play on Torv. And were getting disconnected quite often. Lo and behold, upon entering the chat server there were several others who were going LD on various other servers. A qucik check of the server-IP list shows them all on cerf.net.<P>After performing about 2-3 dozen traceroutes from both east and west coasts from my network and digex (looking glass) the routes internal to cerf.net were not stable and having either/or high-latency or packet loss.<P>When on the chat server the GM on (9:00P ET) refused to answer the questions about the server issues, but would be more than happy to answer soesone intricate question about a random spawn/despawn not spawning after the patch, and asking for PoH, PoF, and PoA repopped.<P>About 20 minutes later the GM issues a general statment blaming the users ISPs for the problem, and when countered with my basic recount of the problem and telling him I had direct evidence of a problem with Cerf.Net his responce was "We don't control Cerf.Net" After being asked to confirn if Verant has told Cerf.Net of the problem or not we were all ignored again, save his canned responces.<P>When will we ever get an answer to this?!<P>[BTW: There were 2 -ECI blue-named individuals there who came in about 1/2 way through this who did attempt to help, but seemed rather powerless themselves. For that I do thank them, but 1 question.
