</FONT><HR>This IS OUTRAGEOUS - the other day I found some of BeckyDruids Popcorn on the floor. I picked it up and gave it back to her.<BR>She said that's OK keep it. I told her that I didn't like Salted popcorn and she became CRAZY. She challenged me to a duel.. which I declined of course (I'd never dry slap a female). She spammed the SHOUT channel with taunts of <SNIP> and kept harrassing me. In order to avoid anymore 'confrontations' (I mean I was scared by this point) I asked my friend Beanbag if he could teleport me away... far away from her, otherwise she would emotionally scar my EQ experience.<P>Popstars was on the telly so I went and watched it.. leaving the game running... <BR>About a 1/2 hour or so later, GM Zrinic summons me to a small room with no entrances in Qeynos Catacombs and me and Jumlace meet up. <P>And well to sum a short story long...<P>Well....<P>The complete log of my conversation with GM Zrinic on the Rodcet Nife server as approved by GM Henderson:<BR>[Sat Feb 10 17:19:57 2001] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.

</FONT><HR>My question is this.<P>Was your character a Dark-elf, Ogre, Troll, or a Rogue?  If so I don't see a problem if you manage to steal virtual property from a virtual being in a game where your role is evil.<P>The way it should have been handled should have been in-game by some in-game law emforcement officer (If he can catch you).<P>This one Troll once convinced me to let him loot my corpse because I died in a really hard place to get back to.  I did, and guess what?  All gone.  This was before the patch where no one can loot your corpse.<P>Yes I was upset, but only as a player character.  In my opinion I learned a good lesson that day.  The hard way.  But never would I petitioned over that.  He was a Troll, what did I expect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It is so very sad to see this sort of thing happen.<P>However, it has led to to register for this board and post a reply so I assume there is some good that has come from it.  (I do realize that calling my post good is highly debateable.)<P>Firstly, you did scam this person out of their equipment.  Someone of your level should know better.  Quite frankly as a relatively new player I am surprised that level 50+ players would act in such a way.  For some reason I assumed that they would be better behaved. This is a good lesson for me.<P>If someone drops something and you know they did, how long would it have taken for you to simply send a tell and avoid this whole debacle?  Face it, you tried to get away with something and were caught.<P>As far as the threat thing goes.  You did threaten the GM.  The simle statement of "You have no idea who I am," is a threat.<P>It was not as if you were making a factual clarification.  It is not as if the GM said, "I know who you are."<P>You represented yourself as being someone in a position to impose repurcussions on this GM for their actions.  Were you a lawyer?  Were you their neighbor?  Were you a disgruntled former employee who spent their non-EQ time sitting in a pickup truck in front of the Verant offices cleaning your gun?<P>It was a threat.<P>You are spoiled and suffer from delusions of grandeur.  You are deceptive.  You play the game out of selfish greed and to fill some sad void in your life.  You play to "win" at the expense of others.<P>Consider yourself judged.<P>Everyone has a purpose and your was to serve as a bad example.  I hope everyone who reads this has learned from your mistakes and I do commend you on giving a very good detail of how not to play the game.<P>I will roam the lands of Norrath today, occassionally skipping, knowing that one less person like you is sharing that world with me.<P>Ahliana Ochsanfree<BR>"Monkee see Monkee do."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yeah it'd be nice for a ruffer world and more depth to RolePlaying.. but NOT EQ. <P>It follows a different set of rules. And RPGing is not as rife... to behave like this in EQ and call it roleplaying is to use it as an excuse. Wait for another game to do this with as the EQ community and it's guardians (Verent) will dawg you for it.<P>As you can blatently see from all these posts. YOU and COLLA are the only one's and by HIS own admission he say's it WAS wrong. So a cunning man such as Colla surely would have used hie TROLL excuse straight away if HE was a DARK toon.<P>But he didn't dis-proving your theory before it should have even entered your head.<P>Not a personal attack Vanhin... but an attack on the character that you have portrayed in your post.<P>Becky on the otherhand.. that little mynx has gt eveyone thinking the sun shines out of her...<snip><P><This has been edited by a REAL person this time that actually read the posting on the fly in a matter of seconds and with thier sharp and trained eye noticed the derogetory remark. They are highly trained to at noticing $ signs instead of S's... so don't think you can trick us - SIGNED an verent employee.<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]
