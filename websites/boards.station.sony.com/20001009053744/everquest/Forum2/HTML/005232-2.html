</FONT><HR>Ok - so if you make it have a component with a 10 hour camp..err i mean "spawn" time to get, it makes the item enter the world at a rate of 1 every 10 hours.<P>So obviously only one person can complete the quest every 10 hours, provided that spawn is always camped.<P>but if you break it up into 5 separate pieces of 2 hours each, 5 separate people can be doing the quest at once, providing a "richer" experience for more people, without 5 people standing in a spot pulling PnP on each other.<P>Which is more beneficial?  5 people travelling the world and getting the item in 10 hours, or 5 people sitting in a circle in south karana petitioning the GM's and getting frustrated.  Verant's policy is obviously the latter on the nice items, such as the Aegis of life and Jboots.<P>There is another option though...<P>Make the items drop once in 10 hours off a type of npc in a zone, or make the npc not spawn in a static spot...IE, have grimrot pop once every 5-6 hours in one of the karana's in a random spot, and de-pop after say 10 mins.  Sure its a lot harder to program, and would require more spawn tables, but it would eliminate camping.  <P>The downside is that the D3wd druids would have a distinct advantage...but just make the faction requirements such that you'd have to be pretty persistant to get it, and make the resultant object no-drop.<P>Make questable items as good as the droppable ones, and you'll see campquest deteriorate into something nearer "the vision"  We don't want to sit for 20 hours in a little room looking for goblin_421 to pop, we'd rather be out exploring the world and doing quests...but the risk/reward points eq players to sit and camp.  why do a quest when you can get better items and exp by sitting on yer butt and fighting once in 5 minutes?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, making the spawn time longer seems to reward camping. X item used to drop every 4 hours, now it drops every 12. Guess what, if it's a popular item, the price just went up substantially to compensate for the increase in spawn time. Also, since a 12 hour camp is out of reach of most casual players, many will now buy the item instead of trying to get it themselves, raising demand, and thus the selling price, even more.<P>I wasn't talking about raising something from 4 to 12, as 12 is still within many people's camping range.  I'm thinking more like 30.  If something only dropped once every 30 hours or so if camped constantly, who would camp it?  What if it was 70 hours?  As you've mentioned, shorter "camp times" just increase the number of people who find it worthwhile to camp that long for the item.  My belief is that the only way to stop camping is to make it so that these items are beyond *everyone's* camp range.  <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>**ABASHI*** You aren't required to "sit and wait" for the NPC. You are only required to be there when the NPC spawns. That can happen at any time, and you could choose to leave and come back later to try and complete the quest. <P><BR>If a person needs this item or wants it then there are several hundred who probably want it to.  Spawns can happen at any time....not so. The for the most part are all timed.  I see casters binding at spawn points, leaving to go do something and then having them gate back at the appointed spawn time to TAKE the spawn no matter who is already there waiting.  I can set my watch by the MOB in Qeynos Hills that drops the Fishbone Earing.  <P>If its an important item then you will more then likely have to camp it or join a list to wait and wait to get a chance at the item.  That is if there isnt a lvl 50+ player there, that cant use the item but has a sole purpose of selling it, taking up the spawn.  Dont mention PnP because in the hours it takes to get a guide / gm to the place all they will say is  "You have to take turns".<P>Its been almost a year since I had a totaly random encounter with a MOB I would need for a quest.<P>Goto Guk, SolA, SolB and sit and listen.  All you hear is "CAMP CHECK" or "Who has the list for so and so"<P>Make totaly random spawns and make items CLASS specific.  It took me 4 weeks to get a mammoth cloak due to the fact that Warriors, Necros, Wizzards, most of them over lvl 45, are camping the items we need.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's absolutely silly that the hard part of questing is that sitting and doing nothing is a requirement.  There are no two ways about it, unless camping is made impossible then the "just stop by and see if the mob is there" will NEVER EVER work.  It's dumb to get a quest and then not be able to do it because the mob required for the quest is never there.  Did King Arthur have a hard time getting excalibur because he waited and waited and waited for the rock to spawn so he could pull the sword out?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Someone will jump in and take the spot, so therefore, people are required to sit and wait out the time.

The solutions is simple.<P>1.  All quest items NO DROP.<BR>2.  Spawn time for QUEST mobs same as others in the dungeon and NO PLACEHOLDERS.<P>  This will make quests fun again.  Travel, find where the mob spawn, kill him, and goto another area to get another item for quest, and so on.  Again, I stress quests should exist to make the game fun and interesting.

</FONT><HR>oh my word... you didn't just say this did you Abashi??<P>&lt;&lt;&lt; You aren't required to "sit and wait" for the NPC. You are only required to be there when the NPC spawns. &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Of course nobody is required to do this.  Nobody is required to play EQ.  However the way that the game is designed in order to get what is needed to complete the quests or in order to have the right equipment for your class you DO have to do this if you want these items.  I'm only level 39 in the game but I know from things I've read and heard that without certain items later on in the game, you're screwed.  It doesn't become a matter of choice at that point.  People don't really have a choice once they've chosen to play EQ.  After that choice - we're in your world now.  And your world equals camps.  <P>I actually love the idea of having to get 2 bags full of items instead of waiting for 7 hours for one item.  <P>&lt;&lt;&lt;My belief is that the only way to stop camping is to make it so that these items are beyond *everyone's* camp range. &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>And umm... so what do people do in the meantime?  I really like the idea of quests requiring more items that are from NPCs with shorter spawn times.  As for making camps extra extra long so that they're beyond everyone's camp time would be insane.  As it is now I've heard of a lot of guilds who have been known to put people on shifts to camp things 24/7 over many days until they have enough of what they want.  So I don't think even a 70 hour spawn time would stop camping.  It would just make it more difficult to the casual player who just wants something to enhance their game playing experience.  <P>What really needs to happen is to make certain items random drops.  That is really the best solution.  <P>I wish for once someone at VI would just come out and say something like, "Yeah, camping stinks.  We're sorry we designed the game this way, we'll do better next time."<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"I wasn't talking about raising something from 4 to 12, as 12 is still within many people's camping range. I'm thinking more like 30. If something only dropped once every 30 hours or so if camped constantly, who would camp it? What if it was 70 hours? As you've mentioned, shorter "camp times" just increase the number of people who find it worthwhile to camp that long for the item. My belief is that the only way to stop camping is to make it so that these items are beyond *everyone's* camp range. "<P>Gordon you are sadly mistaken if you think just because you make someone wait 30 hours for a spawn it will end camping for it.  The only thing is does is cater to the powergaming goober who can stand to sit on his butt for 30 hours straight.<P>The only way to end camping is a) no longer require it or b) random loot tables c) make it craftable<P>a) Involves keeping the static spawn system but go with a Monty-haul loot system.  Where the monsters always have the goodies everyone is after.  This drastically would deflate any value of items in the economy but at the same time allow the casual player to obtain items at will.  The only requirement then is being able to defeat the monster(s) that have the item(s).<P>b) Random loot table.  With this system any mob at a given level range has a slight chance of droping a rare item for a given level range. You've shown you can do this somewhat. Level 1-7 mobs tend to drop rusties while 8-19 drop bronze and 20+ drop Fine Steel.  So instead of camping X mob for X amount of time you "do" dungeons in the traditional fasion known as dungeon crawling.  This would incourage more social interaction because caster's would get melee only items and melee would get caster only items.  Thus you have a working trade system.  How rare something actually is remains a unknown until a lot of the same item goes into circulation.  Supply and demand will determine the trade price.<P>c) The only reason to gain items is to make the character better in some way. If the same thing can be accomplished by spending time on a tradeskill, then players will still be spending the time but doing something more productive than sitting on their duffs waiting for spawn.  UO is a shining example of how this is accomplished, no need to explain further.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Some of the Kunark quests are done quite well.. <P>For example, the trooper pike quests needs 2 froglok heads.. The first can be got from a Froglok that spawns in 2 locations in swamp of no-hope, 1 spawn in Innothule swamp and 1 spawn in upper guk.. <P>Unfortuneatly, no-one knows where the second head is of yet, hehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Similarly, the previous pike required killng a skeleton in kurns, who had 2 reasonably reliable  spawns in the basement, but could also pop in *very* rarely at other skeleton spawns. So while most people chose to camp the basement, ocaisonaly someone would get lucky on the upper levels..

</FONT><HR>Making a quest spawn 70 hours will probably stop camping, but it will probably  stop that item entering the game if it's not done properly...<P>Take the Goblin alchemist in Misty Thicket for example.. Not many monks are going to be hunting here at the level of the quest (30 something? I'm not sure).. So if the quest spawn was 70 hours, then more often than not the item would rot, or be looted by a halfling newbie.. <P>Wouldn't it be better to make the Alchemist similar to the Kunark quests described above.. Have him rarely spawn in areas where monks of the required level would be hunting, not in a fixed spawn, but as a very rare spawn in place of regular creatures of the zone..<P>Another example is the Gnoll Brewer in Blackburrow, for the burning rapier quest.. Now the casks are part of a newbieish ranger quest, so it makes sense for him to spawn in an area where rangers of that level are fighting.. But the problem is that 25+ rogues also want the cask, and again not a lot of people 20+ fight in blackburrow often..  Perhaps the brewer could also spawn in Paw? Or have the brewer in multiple spawn spots - then the rogues wouldn't camp it, they'd be able to buy it from the 'teen players fighting in that zone.. But that could then cause problems with higher level rogues running around slaughtering everything in sight in the hope to get it to spawn, thus denying the dungeon experience to lower level players.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

So if the quest spawn was 70 hours, then more often than not the item would rot, or be looted by a halfling newbie.. "<P>Yep, another perfect example of why the EverCamp quests just suck.  I have sat in Misty and watched monks wait 5, 10, 15 hours for the Alchemist to spawn.  And guess what, there is nothing in the zone they can fight during that time for xp or loot.  nothing.  unless they want to kill guards.  So they can go into Runnyeye and kill stuff, but then guess what happens?  The orcs will kill the alchemist if no one takes him as he wanders around (I've seen it), and then the stuff just poofs on the ground.  Or some caster walks over and blasts him, not realizing that the ribcage he just looted is a 15 hour monk-only no drop item.  Which kind of contradicts Abashi's claim that all items enter the game at x rate per hour.  The ribcage will never enter the game for anyone to use unless it's being camped by a monk.  So it's actually rare items enter game = spawn time in hours/class appropriate looters.     So what I'm basically saying is that if you want to do the Treant Monk Fist quest you have no choice but to sit in misty staring at your keyboard for 5, 10, 15, 20 hours.  And that is just one part of the quest.  Now you think making that time 70 hours would be an improvement?  What is that, game design 101 for people with no lives?  Do you want this game to suck even more for casual gamers who can ONLY play a few hours a night?  I know, I know, those players don't NEED the good items...  And I don't need to play your game either... (-;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, making the spawn time longer seems to reward camping. X item used to drop every 4 hours, now it drops every 12. Guess what, if it's a popular item, the price just went up substantially to compensate for the increase in spawn time. Also, since a 12 hour camp is out of reach of most casual players, many will now buy the item instead of trying to get it themselves, raising demand, and thus the selling price, even more.<BR>I wasn't talking about raising something from 4 to 12, as 12 is still within many people's camping range. I'm thinking more like 30. If something only dropped once every 30 hours or so if camped constantly, who would camp it? What if it was 70 hours? As you've mentioned, shorter "camp times" just increase the number of people who find it worthwhile to camp that long for the item. My belief is that the only way to stop camping is to make it so that these items are beyond *everyone's* camp range. <P>-Gordon&lt;&lt;<P>Nice logic, but it goes against everything I've seen in the game.  The items which are easiest to get are the least camped.  Take the Evil Eye in Lower Guk.  Never camped.  You go in there, you kill the eye, bam, you have your bag.  No one camps the eye for any length of time.<P>Some stuff probably should be rare than others, but the biggest flaw in your reasoning is the "People choose to camp, blah blah."  THERE IS NOTHING TO DO IN EVERQUEST EXCEPT GET ITEMS.  Period.  You gain levels so that you can get nicer items.  You kill monsters to get items, or to gain levels so you can get nicer items.  You perform trade skills because they help you get money, or they help you make items.  Anything else in Everquest falls under the category socializing.  What ELSE are you going to do but camp for items?<P>If all items were as hard to get as you seem to want them to be, NO ONE would bother playing.  Why bother when you're never going to get anything?  Items should NOT be as hard as possible to get.  There is an equilibrium at which an item's desirability offsets its difficulty in getting.  There are MANY items whose difficulty in getting far exceeds their worth as an item.  Sometimes people still go after these items; usually the purpose is for satisfaction at getting a rare thing more than the value of the item.  <P>I recall a certain dwarf paladin who was doing an absolutely RIDICULOUS quest (I can't recall which one) which forced him to seek out ungodly rare spawns in the Faydark and in Dagnor's Cauldron, for pretty much useless rewards.  He just did it because it was a dwarven item, and he roleplays his dwarfish pride to the hilt.<P>I think certain spawns need adjusting.  Dismissing this offhand is pretty silly.  Most stuff might be okay, but some things are just totally wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

And the quests are FAR too time consuming and boring.<P>Like I said before, I have no problems with difficult quests, make them CONSTRUCTIVELY time consuming, requiring travel, adventure, multiple MOB's, sneaking into dangerous areas, etc.  But don't make it require sitting on your a$$ for 40 hours staring at a monitor or paying someone else a few hundred or thousand plat for something you can't reasonably get yourself.<P>Some of these things are no drop.  Your suggestion of raising time on the quests makes it even less likely that people of those classes will EVER get those items.<P>If it isn't no drop (or the quest is shareable), it makes it far more likely that the Druid or Ranger hunting HG's in the zone will get it, because he will just check tracking every so often and head for any rare spawn the moment it pops.  <P>And thus charge a fortune to the hapless quester who has just been forced to wait another 70 hours or pay some outrageous price to the aforementioned druid.<P>Please!  Some of these quest times are ludicrous and need fixing!  And NOT by making them require longer boring camps!!!!<P>As I said before, NO item in this game except God-items should take more than about 10 or 20 hours of play time to get, and NONE of them should require that amount of contiguous time.<P>Vivid Dreamings, 32nd Enchantress, Hand of Mana officer, Craftsmistress, and Linguist on Nameless<BR>Tylendell Ashkevron, 31st Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon, I understand why the spawn time is sometimes long, and I understand that for the very rare ones you arent supposed to camp it, but rather stumble across it while roaming the zone, or passing through, but there is one particular spawn that literally forces camping.  Kwinn the Outlander in FIriona Vie, needed for the Monk Shackle of Copper quest and for a quest that he gives out, lasts for no more than a minute.  He is KOS to all the Frogloks and Drovlargs in the zone, and he spawns among many of both.  The result is a spawn that is very rare, AND that one cannot stumble accross because he is always dead.<P>This issue has been brought up in other threads, with no responses, and everyone agrees that this cannot possibly be intentional.  If it was meant this way, then you are forcing people to camp him.  <P>From many other posts, you say that camping is not part of what you think the game should be, and I understand that.  But please look into this spawn, because the way it is right now, you HAVE to camp his spawn spot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>70 hour spawn rates would be great for limiting items, but dont most people explore to get kewl items?  If there were like 20 people on a server you could say, wow I walked around Unrest one day and the ghost was THERE!  But we pretty much need at least half decent items to survive long at higher levels.  If vendors sold some stuff that could compare to camped items, people would do it less.<BR>I mean think about if you are playing a single person RPG like FF.  You go all the way into a dungeon and slay everything to get what the "boss" drops.  Except in EQ another 1000 people are going to do that dungeon.  But even in those games the towns vendors sell some stuff so you can survive to get to those items.  Maybe they should make something like "enchanted steel" armor thats double the ac of bronze + a few saves that costs like 30p per ac at the vendors.  Then you would have an alternative to camping/buying crafted or staying with bronze for example</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Look, saying that you can walk around and find the mob you want rather than camp it 24/7 is ridiculous.  Anyone who has played the game knows that any rare spawn that pops is usually killed within 30 seconds of it popping.  The chances of wandering into a zone and happening to find a rare mob are about as good as hitting the lottery.  What's the next solution proposed, only play on servers at 4AM when there are less than 800 people on-line??  I guess that would improve my chances of getting a rare spawn a bit.  Wait, I've got it.  I'll quit my real job, play EQ full time and get 2 extra machines so I can camp and farm 24/7.  What's that you say, there are already lots of people doing that??

Heck, for all the time I spent seeking one carapace, I could have sold skunk glands for a few gold a piece and bought banded from a player. In short, you need to be equipped in better stuff than the quest will award you to complete the quest.

It's painfully obvious neither Abashi nor any verant employee has actually tried to complete a mid-high level quest without making an item spawn.<BR>We should probably all just save our breath, or quit EQ and truly make our complaints known. But no, EQ has that wonderful subliminal message system built in to keep people addicted to it. <P>OBVIOUSLY the fun method would have been to have the NPCs that carry the quest items spawn every time, without delays of 8hours/8days or whatever, but no, Verant chose the Mind-Numbingly-Boring method, with rare spawns + place holders + long spawn times, because that's their definition of fun.<P>Kinowek<BR>43 monk<BR>21 Magician<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have some ideas for that. Tell me they are rotten if they actually are cause I dont camp for items normally.<P>1. Put in a NO DROP NPC-Trader somewhere. Make him a very strange guy who happens to collect and exchange stuff the other traders dont want. Let us have a place where I can bring the gypsy lute (for bard quest armor) I came across by doing a dungeon and get my Icon of the reverent (for cleric quest armor) for that. Make it in a way that I can hail him and he asks me "what do you you want", then I tell him what I want and he says "What can you give me" and I show various items to him I found somewhere until he says "Ok, I will take these for that". Make it expensive, I dont care. Make me turn in 3 rare quest items to get only 1 back. I would just love the picture of an old gnome, having built a strange looking hut in a swamp somewhere, being rumored to collect strange stuff...<P>The effect would be I could actually do dungeons and still get the items I needed to camp for otherwise.<P>2. Leave the items as Rare Loot where they are, but put them into an "extremly rare random loot" table, too. Couldnt it be that the icon of the reverent (e.g.) has been looted by an adventurer that later was killed by a frost giant who decided to keep it? So why not have it spawn on a random NPC of about the same level every 2 weeks?<P>If I really decided I needed it I still could camp Regis, if I just liked to have it I could come across it by doing a dungeon.<P>3. Have the NPCs spawn randomly in those zones the could logically be. Does Regis have to spawn in SK all the time? Sure, he would normally spawn there, say 80% of the time he spawns, but isnt it possible he is visiting Unrest or Lower Guk at times? Dont you like the idea of the Archon doing holidays in Lake Rathetear sometimes? He has to get bored with that pyramid of his time to time.<BR>Plus there are lots of NPC who have to spawn at a given spot, but there are others who can spawn everywhere in the zone they are in. Ever seen someone "camping" the gnoll hunter in Qeuynos Hills? I guess not...<P>Just adjust the quests a little for points 2 and 3. Dont make the NPC who gives the Quest for the Cleric Bracers say "...the icon can be found on Regis, who turned undead..." have him say "...last we heard was that Regis turned undead and he still had the item at that time, but maybe someone took it, it could be anywhere. I would advise you to try Regis first, though..."<P>And to whoever said "check guk, people are 'camp checking' there all the time": It might as well be that they have a new group started and want to find a free spot to hunt. Guess it is in 90% of the cases.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There is no spawn time that is outside someone's or some guild's camping range. Someone will do it. Someone will always be there. Verant needs to understand that. <P>With this, trying to artificially influence the value of an item by forcing it to be rare isn't "valid" method.<P>Just because something is rare doesn't make it valuable. It makes it rare.<P>I'm sorry Abashi, I just don't see any logic behind your logic. The only thing I see is Verant not wanting/accepting people to have the things they want without real life strife. I started playing EQ because I thought the game would be focused on QUESTING. Questing to me sounds like it should be active not passive like waiting for a spawn or having to wait in line for a spawn. <P>To your point no one has to sit and wait for the spawn. If they are smart they can time the spawn and show up a short while before and make an attempt for it. Play Nice or No Play Nice. I certainly didn't wait for the Testament Guy in HH for 7 hours. I found out when he spawned and then picked a time that was a couple spawns in the future when the number of people on line was low and got it that way. Took a couple tries because of Kill Stealers (and this was before the uberksguilds).<P>That isn't always possible. Or reasonable.<P>Not every value relationship is based on risk:reward or desire:reward. Sometimes Verant needs to forget about how many items they want in the world and think about what is reasonable and enjoyable to their customers.<P>Right now they are artificially extending the game play rather than coming up with something compelling and truely enjoyable. <P>So much potentional... Falls flat on its face if it doesn't meet reality somewhere.<P>Ok... Cliches abound... off to bed!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> Abashi,<P>In this posting, you've mentioned that quest items have a story behind them in order to justify their placing on certain mobs with long spawn times within the game.<P> My question is: What about the pelt from the glacial bear in EF for the totemic helm? Where is the story for that long and rare spawn? Where is the story for getting the grizzleknot bark from Grizzleknot in SK?&lt;another very rare spawn&gt; for the totemic breastplate. The guy in Lake Rathetear just says "oh, I need these items"..some story. <P>If you are going to make statements about quests/rare drops/spawn times like you did, make sure that what you are talking about is consistant with the facts. Not all quests for rare drops have a story associated with them and to make such a statement shows a bit of ineptitude on your part.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The longer it takes you to level, the longer they get money from you. Verant seems to be following that MO.<P>What they failed to realize was that they had an engaging game from the start, and lots of people want to try out different classes and different races, im a bunch of different combinations. But I think greed has gotten the best of them.<P>They should realize that instead of making time-wasters, they should be making the game more FUN. Not more tedious. WHO CARES if there are 30% more Jboots in the game if it increases customer satisfaction by 200% because they feel like they can actually accomplish something in the game.<P>It's the SAME THING with the melee bind issue. I spent FIVE MINUTES TOPS in Runneye tonight. And THREE HOURS in corpse recovery. Just another example of forcing people to waste their time and pretty indictative of the trend in general.<P>Increasing camp spawns from where they were previously accomplishes the same thing. <P>I could never understand why Verant CARES if we can bind melee classes or if we camp spawns or any of the other useless positions Verant takes. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
