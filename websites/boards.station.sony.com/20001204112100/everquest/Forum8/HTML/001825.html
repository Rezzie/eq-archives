&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Have been thinking about this for quite awhile and have come up with a couple methods for implementing it.  They over lap a bit but are hugely different in terms of their effect on the game.  Also they are all very much a work in progress so help me debug them. =)  First rule to any of this is that you can not enchant an item that already has magical properties, no jboots that give you levitate. =) <P>First method involves giving the enchanter an "enchant item" line of spells.  Casting the spell results in a no rent, no drop, lore item, container with a combine button.  In this container you add the item you wish to enchant, the scroll for the spell you wish to put into it, and a vial of mana.  Hit the combine button and the container disappears to be replaced by the newly enchanted item, or the original item if that combination has not been coded.  The scroll, mana and container would be gone either way.<P><BR>The Second method involves adding onto the existing trade skills.  First rule of this method is that you can only enchant player made items.  Place the item to enchant, a spell scroll, and a vial of mana into the trade container that the original item was made in.  Hit combine if successful you get the newly enchanted item, if partially successful you get the original item back, and if you fail everything is gone. (This BTW is pretty close to how Wu's Gauntlets are made.)   As to how hard the item is to make, it gets more involved as I move into the next steps, but as a base lets say it is X number of points harder than the original item and that the level the item casts at and number of charges are factors of x. <P>Next part of the puzzle is what level does the item cast at?  First idea I had was to base it on the lvl of the person making it but I threw that one out almost immediately.  Next one was to base it on the lvl of the spell scroll, this cause problems in terms of spells like levitate where different classes get the spells at different levels.  The one I like best so far is base it on the type of mana used.  Viscous Mana is a level 12 spell so an item made with it casts at level 12 etc.  Also it should be possible to base the effect on the level of the character using it but I am not sure how feasible that is.<P>Final piece of this puzzle is how many charges?  Have three methods worked out here, although they are not all compatible with all of the methods above.  First one is to base the number of charges on type of mana.  Second one is to some how base it on the character that is making the item. (I really do not like this idea, the item should turn out the same regardless of who makes it) Next up, Add additional copies of the spell scroll for extra charges.  1 scroll=X charges, 2 scrolls=2X charges etc.  Final way I have to do this is use mana instead of scrolls.  Now as to X, off the top of my head I would say X should be one or at most 2 for balance reasons, any bigger than that and you risk making items that are WAY to powerful.  One possibility is to combine the scrolls and mana methods, make the equation look something like this, X scrolls + Y mana= XY charges.  So 1 scroll with 3 mana gives 3 charges, 2 scrolls and 3 mana gives 6 charges.<P>I also worked out a way to make procing or right-clickable items (like jboots) but it would have been a nightmare to code and would have severely screwed with game balance.<P>The way I think this would go together best is the trade skill addon, casting level is based on type of mana used, and number of charges is based on the amount of mana used.  I think the XY method would probably throw the balance as well (it would give a tailor made item a max of 12 charges instead of 6, smithing and pottery can go higher I think? Is based on the size of container used to make it) <P>Also there comes into the picture being able to recharge items after they are extinguished or possibly even before.  For the sake of throwing something out here on the topic lets say when you run out of charges the item reverts back to its original form and can be re-enchanted from scratch.  While it still has at least 1 charge left you can add a charge by combining it with a number of mana vials equal to the number of charges it has.  At 1 charge add 1 vial to get 2 charges, at 6 charges add 6 vials to get 7 charges etc, puts us up to a max of 8 charges as a tailor.<P>One last thought on the issue that just occurred to me, if we do all of this we now have the ability to make jewelry that has a click effect instead of stat bonuses by using metals that have not been enchanted, max of 4 charges.<P>Couple quick notes about me.  I am a fairly casual player, I started playing in December and my top character has just reached lvl 21, I also have 3 other characters that are around lvl 10. I mastered Pottery back in March or April but have hardly touched it since then, I have slowly been working up in Jewelry and Tailoring and am approaching master level in both.  <P>There are a lot of things about the game engine that other people will know much better that I, so I leave the details of working out those areas up to them.  From what I have seen so far I think this would be a workable add-on to the game but needs some refinement.  Lets see what we can put together.<P>Roswell of Quellious <BR>Gnomish Enchanter of the 21st circle<P>PS think about the roleplaying potential to this, The Mixing Bowl of Bounty(summon food), The Silken Mask of Far Seeing(eye of zomm), The Boots of Quick Stepping (shadow step), or The Burning Chest Plate (radiation).  Way to many possibilities. =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>IMO, *permanant* Enchantment of items would require a combination of an appropriate trade skill and the use of the particular spell.<P>Example; Combine a Granite Cutter from an Earth Elemental with Essence of Fire from the Reckless Efreeti, a Blackened Stave from the Burning Woods and a Scroll of Berserker Strength to make a Polished Granite Tomahawk.<P>Only an Enchanter could combine these items, perhaps even having the process rigged to actual de-memorize the Berserker Strength spell from his spell book (meaning that he needs the scroll not to combine with the other ingredients, but to rescribe the spell when it is wiped to fuel the Combine process).<P>*Temporary* Enchantment of items would be relatively easy as well, simply have the spell consume the item and replace it with an enchanted item.  So casting 'Enchant Fiery Mantle' would consume whatever shoulder piece was used as the component and create a temporary magic mantle with a fiery damage shield like that of the Fire Elemental illusion-form.  This 'enchanted' item would remain, whether given to another or kept personally, for the duration of the items stay in zone.  Like a pet or summoned item, if the item's user zoned or camped (or went LD), the 'enchanted'<BR>item would fade away.<P>Essentially, the temporary Enchantment would be a variant of the Magician summoned object spells, but require a component to create and (assuming it is possible to code this), returning that item upon the 'end' of the spell.  So in the case mentioned above, the mundane 'mantle' component would be in the characters inventory when he finished loading into the next zone or logged back on.  The component would be re-usable.<P>In my 'vision' the components would all be specially crafted in some method, so that the 'Enchant Fiery Mantle' spell would only work on a specially tailored mantle made of Smoke Silk from Lava Duct Crawlers and if cast when holding a normal Raw Silk Mantle on ones cursor, the spell would fail (and you would get the same sort of message you get when trying to summon a pet and are out of Tiny Daggers).<P>To save on having dozens of overspecialized spells about, the team could create only a few Enchant series spells, each coded to respond differently to different components.<P>So if I cast 'Enchant Item' while holding the Smoky Silk Mantle on my cursor, I get a Fiery Mantle.<P>If I cast it while holding a 'Feathered Cloak' (Raw Silk Cloak tailored with a Griffon Feather in the mix), I get a Winged Cloak that has the Always On effect of Levitate when it is equipped.  <P>If I cast it while holding nothing at all on my cursor, or while holding a Froglok Poison Gland I just looted, I get the standard error message, since the spell is not coded to respond to these items (or lack thereof).<P>(If, like Enchanting Metals, the spell searches the inventory if nothing in on the cursor, the Enchanter simply has to remember to place his Smoky Silk Mantle lower in inventory than his Feathered Cloak if he is trying to make a Winged Cloak.)<P>Due to the nature of these Enchantments, the 'component' versions of the items (the Feathered Cloaks or Smoky Mantles mentioned above) should be lightweight and stackable until replaced with the Enchanted versions (the Winged Cloaks or Fiery Mantles), so that an Enchanter does not have to fill up six inventory slots just to carrry around the components to create Winged Cloaks for his group!<P>A second spell could allow the Enchantment of Armor and a third could exist for the Enchantment of Weapons.<P>Other variant 'Enchantment' spells could involve a 'Quicken Weapon' or 'Strengthen Blade' series that replaces a mundane item (code the spell to use any Rusty, Tarnished, Steel, Fine Steel, Balanced, Well-Balanced, Forged or 'normal' weapon) with the same weapon + the effect of Quickness or Alacrity or Celerity as appropriate to the level of the spell.  Unlike a normal 'haste' spell, this Enchantment would affect only the single weapon it is cast upon, does not affect magical weapons (perhaps an exception would be made for Combine weapons?), can be transferred from character to character (in fact it would have to be in many cases, since the Enchanter would have to hold it to cast the spell, but then could give the 'faster' weapon to an ally to use) and *lasts the entire duration of ones stay in zone.*<P>This spell would be considered 'useless' at the higher levels (when everyone is using magical and even No Drop weaponry), but would be fairly creative for the lower levels and certainly fit the concept of an 'Enchanter' better than the current 'speed' line does...<P>Strengthen Weapon would perform almost identically, except instead of decreasing the Delay numbers, it would work to increase the Damage numbers.  Unfortunately, the spells would not stack (since the coding here would be impossible IMO).  Alternately, one generic <BR>'Enchant Weapon' version could have both effects at once instead, allowing an Enchanter to pick up a Damage 9, Delay 50 Rusty Two-Handed Sword (example, not sure of real numbers) and cast his Enchant Weapon spell on it and end up with an 'Enchanted Rusty Two-Handed Sword' with the Magic and No Rent tags, a Damage of 12 and a Delay of 35 (for example, the numbers of damage increase and delay reduction would have to be tweaked for balance).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I must say that now that I have revisited the idea when I am more awake I see the problem with the item database. (funny how I alway dream this stuff up when I should have been asleep hours ago)  As to coding the actual items, if the data structures are set up they way I think they are it would be fairly easy but the resulting database would be huge!  Just a thought but it might be possible to make such items No Rent and use a temporary file to track them.  If I were to attempt to make a cloak of levitation (good example) the game could check the temp file to see if there is one in existance, it there is assign it that item ID, if there isn't take the next number in the stack and add these item stats to it.  to make it work the temp item records would have to be searchable by the base components.  ie, I started with a raw silk cloak, the spell levitate and viscious mana, search temp item file for an entry that used those as its base.  When the last character with this item logs off it gets removed from the temp file and its ID number can be used by the next thing that is made.  There is another level in the code that we are not seeing as well, how do they track the number of charges an item has?  are there multiple copies of each charged item in the database or is it stored somewhere in your character info?<P>Also I think I like the idea of a genaric line of spells to alter an items stats, would be a hell of alot easier to code and a bit more realistic.  <P>The point of the way I originaly described the system was that it didn't require an enchanter to make an item beyond obtaining the mana.  A Dwarven Warrior that is a master smith could make himself a chest plate with charges of radiation (or anything else for that matter) by finding the spell scroll and getting an enchanter to make a mana vial of the appropriate level then going back to his favorite forge and finnishing the task.  <P>As to being able to duplicate items allready in the game it was a matter of being able to create any item/effect combination more than anything else.  Basicly for the fun of roleplaying it, what combination can I dream up today...., or,  Hmmm I think I want a...<P>The more I think about this the more I like Drahlek's version of the generic spells designed to use certain items as components and give a certain result.  <P>Allthough rather than making them zone specific, like pets, lets do them as no rent, like other summonings.  Basicly I see limiting it to the zone it was made in as impractical for anyone that is not playing an enchanter or grouped with one.  If I have a warrior that is hunting in BlackBurrow and I manage to get my sword enchanted then the first time a train big enough to kill me comes by I have lost the effect, either I died or I zoned.  Doing them as no rent means that a young tailor could go on a quest and make themselves a feathered cloak, then they just have to find the nearest enchanter with the spell, talk them into casting it on the item and go back to where ever they would like to hunt for the day, also the warrior from before would be able to hunt in BB without having to worry about zoning.  <P>Two other details I would like some feedback on,  One is that I don't think the raw item should be allowed to have any special tags, magic, lore, etc.  It must be a plain item with nothing special about it (I also still like the idea of only being able to enchant player made items)<P>Two is that the resulting item should be tagged as Magic and Lore, possibly no rent as well but only if they can code the no rent to return the original item when the player logs off.  I havn't seen anywhere that they have done this, have any of you?<P>Roswell<P>PS for any of you that are not programers I am sorry about diving off into the mechanics of how it could work at the beginning of the post, if you didn't understand it don't worry  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
