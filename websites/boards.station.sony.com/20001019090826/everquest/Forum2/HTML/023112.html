</FONT><HR>Abashi, I recall someone from Verant answering a post regarding this same issue several months ago.  At that time it was said that this was a bug, and was due to the skel images being shared by the mobs and the necro pets, and that someone was looking into it.  Now you tell us that it is by design, and that skeletons are supposed to look "inconspicious".  If you ask me, a rat should look much more inconspicious as it walks along the ground, but it has a title over it's head...  (Now watch them remove titles from rats...)   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So, what's the story...<P>Elym<BR>Level 10 Magician - Morrel-Thule<BR>Level 20 Cleric - Rallos Zek<BR>Level 30 Magician - Rallos Zek<P>P.S. - Still love the game - Just want some clarification.

</FONT><HR>Hmm, inconspicious? Well it works, possibly too well. During a large raid, when a necro casts the DoT that turns the mob into a skeleton for a brief time, it is very easy to lose sight of the mob.

</FONT><HR>Geeze people.  Is htis really that big of an issue?  Let's see have Verant spend time putting names over skeletons, or do better things, like new quests, new areas new items, etc.  How hard is it to just left click on the creature and get it's name?  Get over it.  Heck if you go on raids, especially dragon raids later on in life you turn NPC and PC names off to cut down lag, I wen a whole month with names turned off and it didn't affect my game play one bit.  This also seems like an issue that become null after lev 20.  I say keep the names off of them and turn your attention to quests and such.  Just my opinion.  <P>Everyone else calm down.  Stop demanding Verant do this or Verant do that.  Heck if it was me I would have told you all to leave along time ago.  Guess what, you can.  No one here has a gun to your head forcing you to play.  Get off Gordon's back already, not just this post, but all of them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Especially since I hope someone will go and find the post Gordon/Abashi made about how this was a very low priority issue and wouldn't be fixed, even though it was in fact a mistake.<P>This is really just an example of how poor Abashi/Gordon can be at dealing with customer issues.  He would have been infinitely better off if he had said absolutely nothing, and obviously that isn't what we want.<P>So we get a choice, nothing or rude, trite dismissal?  I'll pick nothing every time, but those of you concerned with actually involving your customer base in improving this game might want to realize that anyone with anything worthwhile to say isn't going to put up with those two choices very long.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Icelion - I must be reading different message boards than you, I have never found one of Abashi's posts to be rude,trite, or offensive.  <P>I think considering that everything he has to say is relayed in text and not sound, things can be perceived incorrectly.  If you have not been using email or newsgroups long then it is quite easy to mistake the tone of a message.  <P>It always appears to me that Abashi is simply trying to give cut and dry answers to peoples questions, attempting to get to the issue at hand without doing a song and dance.<P>When you realize this, you will see that you ARE getting the information you are looking for in his responses (good or bad).  <P>If what he says isnt giving you your fix of "warm cuddly" feelings, go watch Barney.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>On /assist:  It works properly.  I play a Warrior and regularly find myself being the name my group mates type into their /assist macros.  The only time /assist fails them is when I'm the one screwing up.  That's when I change my target after already picking one (and you don't know how often I get "why did you attack THAT first?" after already committing quickly) or when I start autoattack late (like time spent picking that "perfect target" out of the train).  Knowing all too well what happens as the assistee, when I'm assisting someone else I always hit it several times to be sure I'm staying on the right target.<P>On names over skeleton heads:  Given that /assist works, this only poses a targeting problem for Enchanters picking out single targets to mesmerize and other such crowd-control methods.  It's more an aesthetic matter, that it's inconsistent with the rest of the world.<P>On Abashi:  For what he posted above, I'm guessing that fixing skeleton names is simply not feasible (too much work for its affect on the game) and instead of giving us an unpleasant "no", he gave us an amusing version of "working as intended"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> .

Besides, the pile of bones with a name floating above them looked funny. This was by design. The bug was that Necro pets didn't have names above them, making them impossible to distinguish from NPC skelies.
