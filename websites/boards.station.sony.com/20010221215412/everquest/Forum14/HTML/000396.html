</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Shamans:<P><BR>ITEM:  Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There is a general consensus that clerics are the only useful healers past 50th level.  Shamans and Druids are supposed to be secondary healers.  But post 50 their spells are too inferior and fizzle too often to be effective as healers at all.  Some suggestions are to move Superior Heal to level 51 (and reduce its fizzle rate) and/or add in a new one at 56th.  Perhaps Torpor can fill that role (either leaving it where it is, or moving it down a few levels).  But we also need to be careful not to make them too good at healing.  That’s the cleric’s turf.  Whatever is done here should also be done with Druids, in some similar fashion (though probably not the same way).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This affects everyone.  Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Group buffs.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that group buffs would offer the same (or even better) effects as the original buff.  The value of them is that they save time and mana by casting a bunch of buffs at one time.  It seems, therefore, that a group buff would have all the effects of the single buff, perhaps with increased duration, at twice the cost (figuring that casting them twice is pretty normal and making the extra few recipients the bonus).  As it is now, Shaman will most often use the single buff spell because they give better results.  They are unwilling to trade the reduced downtime for a less effective spell.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Fizzles on higher level spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Cannibalize II, Superior Heal and such are the spells that Shaman think they fizzle on too much.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEMS:  Alchemy.<P>DESCRIPTION:  They would like more stuff to make and a better return on the items made when selling to vendors.  And they need more ‘How To’ books.<P>Bugs:  Kilva's Skin of Flame is producing the same effect as Kilva's Blistering Flesh.  <P>Some potions require components, and they probably should not (levitate and water breathing as examples)<P>It would seem fair to create a gate potion for Iksar shaman to use to get home.<P>On the higher level potions, the small negative debuff components make stacking the potion effects with spells difficult.  This reduces the usefulness of the potions.  This may be as it was intended.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rage Line in General.<P>This line was changed because of its ability to use mana that didn’t exist.  But that change also really changed the use of the spells.  Where it was (at least intended to be) a last minute, I’m about to die and so is the enemy, so I’ll go insane and beat the monster to death, spell; it is now basically a buff.  It might be nice to rescue the original intent somehow.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pets.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The 55th level pet was changed recently.  Its dodge was fixed and its level was raised.  But many shaman say that the pet actually does 2 points less damage when it attacks, and that increasing the level by 1 (since they will always cast until they get the best one, and the old one maxed at 38) isn’t enough of a change.  It might be a good idea to either raise the level again and/or reduce the mana cost to be in line with the spell progression (it currently costs 850 mana, where the previous spell costs 500 mana).<P>Additionally, there have been several requests that these pets all have Spirit of Wolf as a innate ability.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Torpor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Torpor does not stack with the regen line. At the level they obtain this spell, a Shaman almost always has Pack Chloroplast, Regrowth of the Grove, or Regrowth on. Torpor will overwrite all of these spells, causing them to have to recast them. This reduces its overall usefulness because, although Torpor is only 200 mana, if you have to then re-cast Regrowth for an additional 300 mana, you just cost yourself 500 mana for a 1200 point heal. They might as well have cast two Superior Heals, it would have saved a memorization slot and casting time. Torpor lasts 4 ticks (24 seconds). During those 4 ticks, the most they can regain is 60 health with Regrowth. There doesn’t seem to be an exploit in regenerating 60 health while under the effects of Torpor. There seems to be no reason not to make it stack with the Regen line.  This would allow them to keep Torpor memorized and use it at will, instead of just when Regrowth wears off.<P>One idea presented was that Torpor also act as a feign death for its duration.  The value of this addition could be far too great.  But if this spell can't be clicked off until the duration runs out…<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Tigir's Insects.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The spell is cool, the drop is too rare.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pox of Bert.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Also too rare.  But also perhaps not effective enough, might need a bit more damage output per tick.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bane of Nife.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Too rare of a drop as well.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rage Line stacking with Focus.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The 59th level Berserker spell does not stack with the level 60 Focus spell.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Voice of the Berserker.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Was this one fixed with the other Rage spells?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Stacking of Curse of Spirits.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is the effect on epic weapon Spear of Fate.  Splurt, Choke, Ignite Blood all overwrite it. It does not work on someone with the Skin Like Nature series buff on. These might be oversights, and most shaman thing that it should stack on these spells.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  New Healing spell at 60th.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Based on what has been seen on the Test Server, with Druids getting a new healing spell at 60th, many Shaman would like a new one at that level as well.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Cannibalize II quest.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This quest requires components from a dungeon that is 50+ in level range.  Cannibalize II is a 39th level spell.  It would seem that this component is harder to get than the level of the spell warrants.  There is also a belief that this spell is less efficient than its predecessor.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Avatar.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Perhaps a duration increase on this spell is in order.  Considering the component cost of this spell and its short duration (1 minute, if I'm not mistaken) many shaman claim that it is fairly undesirable.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Shrink Spell.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell can only be cast indoors.  Shaman would like it to be castable anywhere.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Jaundiced Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Iksar shaman would like to be able to wear this armor.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Malo line of spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  One poster suggested that this spell isn't overly useful.  It is saved against as magic, which is the same save that it is designed to reduce.  So if you can't stick a spell and you want to use Malo to reduce the magic save, the Malo won't stick any better.<P>STATUS:  None<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I happen to like the current state of the Rage series, and use it quite often. Rage itself, for instance, can never be used as a last ditch spell, for it fizzles a great deal even with a maxed Abjuration at 51st level.<P>Another point is in regards to the Malo series. I had thought the original intention was to have this spell check against disease. That is why shaman get a separate disease debuffer series, and why Malo does not reduce disease. No wonder it is as ineffective as its current state, it saves vs magic. Not good at all.<P>Physical statistics should really be revamped. Currently they have very little effect in game, and a good number of our spells deal with stat buffs. An example, with my STR buff and Rage up I have a 231 strength. This very little noticeable effect on my melee, and is really only good for carrying extra weight. A 231str should have very noticeable effects in melee, to say the least.<P>Lastly, I noted that Druids may be slotted for a SoW 2. I don't feel that is their realm since shaman gain this spell at 9th and druids at 14th. If druids are in line to receive a sow upgrade, shaman should also be on that list, especially considering shaman are supposed masters of buffs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>At 1st glance, Torpor now stacks with regen lines and Avatar has alot of stacking issues(Focus comes to mind) and only last 6 minutes with 3 minute refresh.  Once you use Avatar a couple times for the fun of it you never do it again.<P>My real concern here is this was basically posted by you Absor weeks ago and Shaman still have not seen anything.  We were the 1st class to start these "Talk" threads.  I would think we be the 1st to get some resolution, and not just a rehash again.  I am very disappointed this only as far as you guys have come, basically I see NOTHING new.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Re: Avatar, somet things you might want to consder<P>Avatar does not stack with our 60th buff Focus, which replaces our Kragg\Str\Dex buffs, for lesser mana and more effective results. Because I can not use Avatar on a tank that has Focus, which every tank asks for and should have. I have to use my lesser buffs Kragg(55th level HP buff) and Mortal Deftness(58th Dex buff) and leaving off Maniacal Str(57th str buff) for Avatar overwrites our Str buff so casting it on a tank is useless and wasteful of mana. So now I have a Tank with lesser buffs on him and no str buff. Then I cast Avatar on him that lasts about 5 mins with a cost of a gem 13-17pp. I used 23 gems last night to keep one tank buffed on big fights.<P>From what I have seen, Avatar stacks ok with our our Agi, Dex and HP buffs. The only one it does not stack with is our Str buffs. <P>Now I would suggest one of two things, either allow Avatar’s Str part to stack with all Str buffs OR to remove the Str buff effect of Avatar. Either one of these two things will allow Avatar to Stack with our normal 60th level buffs. <P>Thank you for reading Absor,<P>Mallaur -The Hammer(tm)- Bloodstone <BR>Heyokah Oracle of The Tribunal <BR>The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. <BR>~AlbertEinstein <BR>jitcotu <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Including dots since this spell has to be our don't die level 60 heal spell.<P>2) More about buffs not doing anything. It was one of the major focuses and was not even mentioned here.

</FONT><HR>Where did the level 51 for Superior Healing idea come from? The vast majority of the posts I read asked for it to be at 44 or 49 level range. I know that its already very hard, if not impossible to keep up with healing in groups at 45. I just cannot generate enough mana to do it. Even with BOTH an Enchanter and a Bard in the group, plus using Cana.<P>Sure would like to see Superior Healing pushed down to 49 at the very minimum though. 51 is a long long ways from 49. And if I cant heal at 45, I sure wont be able to at 50.<P>And yes, if Druids are going to get a better healing spell at 60, then Shaman should too. We match each other in healing spells at every point so far. We should continue that.<P>The group strength buff Tumultuous Strength is level 39 shaman spell that apparently drops in Velious. I have yet to find it, and I have asked for it alot. So far, only 1 shaman that I have talked to has had it. So it appears that this is yet another of the dropped spells that isnt dropping enough.<P>Why didnt bind and invis potions make the alchemy list? and the negatives on all stat potions are the problem. Not just the high end ones. Lessor, Greater and mid-range stat potions all have negative effects that players refuse to accept. We cant even GIVE THOSE POSTIONS AWAY. Much less sell them. Any why wasnt the low costs the vendors pay us for potions listed? This was mentioned dozens and dozens of times. We need the vendors to give us something decent for the potions we must make, but cant sell to players, in order to make alchemy something we can even afford to increase our skill levels in.<P>Why was the fact that our buffs are useless or next to useless not even on the list?<P>STR does next to nothing. Many people have logged players with and without logs, parsed them, and they were all within a percent or two of being exactly the same damage output. Sometimes, they showed more damage being done without the STR buff than with it. So basically, statistically, there was no difference with or without it.<P>DEX helps proc'ing weapons, but nothing else anyone can see.<P>STA adds some HP, better at higher levels.<P>AGI adds a tiny bit to AC at higher levels. However, no change in damage taken can be seen.<P>CHA is only useful for enchanters (and maybe bards) or when we are selling and buying from vendors.<P>And we are the masters of stat buffing. At least make the buffs do something players can see please.<P>Is Talisman of the Serpent and Unfailing Reverence for the famous Shopping Mall Quest? Pretty useless at 58 and 59 dont you think? Why do we need 2 charisma based group buffs on back to back levels? Especially since they do NOT stack with the enchanters CHA buffs. Who else would need this? Maybe they forget that they nerfed our ability to charm animals to the point that we dont even bother with it. I think the design team ran out of ideas, but needed 2 more spells to make things look good. So much for being useful spells. I for one wont waste the plat on either one of them.<P>Scale of Wolf sometimes comes off when we are attacked. Its supposed to come off if WE attack, cast or loot. Not when THEY attack us. Seems that if a caster NPC hits us with a DoT, Scale of Wolf drops. In my case, the General in Overthere hit me with what I think was Boiling Blood. I got a red Hand icon. The instant that icon appeared, Scale of Wolf dropped. I had just refreshed scale of wolf at the most 5 mins earlier. The result of loosing the speed was that I died a few seconds later since I no longer could out-run him. This simply should not be happening.<P>And we get SoW 5 levels before Druids. Why do they have a request for Scale of Wolf II and we dont?<P>And yes, the 55 pet is a joke. Watched one in action last night. If that pet isnt raised a good 5 to 8 levels, I will never even buy the scroll. It missed and missed and missed and missed against the things the Shaman was fighting. How is that a help in any way, shape or fashion? Oh, yeah, it did finally hit a few times for less than 10 damage. wooooooopppppppie. Even my 44 pet misses more than it hits in Karnors. I quit bringing a pet up in Karnors. Its nothing short of an embarassing pet.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif"> Whoever decided that our pets should be the levels they are really should be replaced ASAP! Either raise the pets to where they can help out, or give us the ability to melee at higher levels.<P>And I am all for making the entire rage line back into what it used to be. As the simple buffs they are now, we simply have lost yet another ability we used to have.<P>Unfortunately, its clear that while you tried, the list you posted was rushed.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor thank you for summarizing the shaman talk for us.  We certainly appreciate all your work on behalf of all the classes.  <P>I would like to suggest again that the effect of our buffs be looked into.  I find it discouraging that at higher levels our stat buffs are considered nothing more than "fluffs."  The problem is that despite our substantial enhancement of the individual's stats, that enhancement often makes little to no real difference in combat.   <P>I would very much like to see giving someone upwards of 50 extra points in dexterity have a meaningful impact on their dexterity.  Could you please try to look into this and at least check if there's anything that can be tweaked for higher level buffs?<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello Absor, nice to see you moving towards the finalization of all this stuff!  I have some things I'd like you to consider adding.<P>Spell fizzling:  Please add in the following:  Talisman of Jasinth, Talisman of Shadoo, Acumen, Torrent of Poison, and Rage.  They all fizzle TOO much.<P>Tigir's Insects:  The radius and distance of this spell should be increased.  How about the same as AE Mez?<P>Bane of Nife:  This spell needs some more damage output or less mana.  It's ratio is too lean.<P>Armor:  The AC Bonus associated with the Iksar Race should probably be reevaluated.  Most of the Iksar classes don't have any "uber" armors until Velious (Iksar Monks for some reason can wear Shiverback), and as we all know, Velious isn't an easy place.  It's awfully shortsighted to require the new playable race with Kunark to have to purchase the next expansion in order to get Planar-level armor (Plane of Air doesn't count...the majority of that stuff is a waste of time, Iksar or Non Iksar).  To sum up, Iksar should be able to wear the JB armor, as it's part of Kunark...same with the other Iksar classes; Iksar Warriors should be able to wear Cobalt, Iksar SK's should be able to wear Blood Ember...etc.<P>Poison based DD spells:  We get one at 34 and 44...perhaps another in the 50's?  The 44 spells hits for 400max.  Our mid 50's cold based DD hits for 660max.  A mid 50's 600max poison DD doesn't sound overbalancing.<P>Offense:  Out of the "Healers," Shaman make the best meleers, because of buffs and skill caps.  A low capping Double Attack would allow Shaman to melee better at lower level and still able to contribute (a teeny tiny amount) at higher level.  Perhaps a skill of 85 or 95.<P>Defense:  Shaman get hit on a lot more than the other healers.  Turgur's Insects is a pretty high aggroing spell.  A higher dodge and defense cap would be good, probably at 51+ though (gotta have kunark/velious basically..more money for you guys).  <P>An idea for the Sow II idea:  There already exists the premise of Sow II...Scale of Wolf (and Spirit of Scale).  It seems silly to add in more spells, just change this into the "Sow II" upgrade...make it function just like Sow.  No more Scale dropping if you attack/cast/get casted on.  Viola.<P>Talisman of Tnarg/Altuna/Kragg line:  Would making these spells stack with everything (pure casts personal shielding line) be overpowered?  Perhaps it isn't, and maybe a group buff would be good.  Instead of Focus of Spirit being a lvl60 single target spell, how about a group version at 60 with a slightly less single target at a few levels lower?  Focus is a good thing, it puts 3 buffs in one (HP, STR, DEX).<P>Level 57 Maniacal Strength:  Only 1 more str point than the 49 buff?  This needs more str points.<P>Stamina line of spells:  They all need more points.  It's not too difficult to get 255str, but 255sta?  Shaman are the masters of (stat) buffs.  Let us really shine.<P>Avatar:  6 minute duration is silly...recast is even sillier.  Make this spell last as long as Focus.  This spell should give Agi, Sta, AC, and Atk.  Focus takes care of Hp, Str, Dex...allow this spell to be the complimentary spell to Focus.  The stat buff parts of Focus and Avatar should stack with the high level single target and group stat buffs.  Shaman are all about stat buffs.  Let us shine in that area.<P>Healing:  The main reason Clerics are capable of seriously outhealing Shaman, is not because of their availability of spells, but because of the Complete Heal spell.  They can take a level 60 Ogre Warrior, fully buffed and having over 5000hp, and heal him from 1hp all the way to 5000hp+.  4 Torpors = 4800hp, and almost 2 minutes, and 800mana.  CH is 400mana, 10 seconds.  Druids and Shaman needs a % heal spell.  25% heal, 50% heal, 66% heal, 75% heal...whatever, we need heal efficiency.  2000mana worth of Superior Heals gets you 4800hp.  That is not efficient.  This matter needs looking into.  Perhaps mobs hit too hard and need to be nerfed.<P>Thanks for your time Absor.<P>Jilariz Intrepidus<BR>Level 56 Iksar Luminary<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I also notice you haven't pointed out about the group regen series, group sow... What's up with that?  Just want to point that out.  Also the Cannibalize II quest isn't that hard, I done it in one days.  It's a hard quest, but imho it was well worth it.  In fact that's first time I really did a quest and after I finished it, it felt great.  So all you people who think the quest is too hard it's cause you guys aren't patient enough.  I can tell the difference (slightly) between Cannibal I and Cannibal II, but I still recover mana faster then Cannibal I even though there is more life to mana ratio (and since I have Chloro it's not a big deal).  Most of the time it's just camping for the items in the zone (which in fact is not hard at all).<P>And a lot of time people hold onto the clay in CoM for such things like that.  So ask around and just camp.. it's not biggie.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>ITEM: Healing.<BR> <BR>Here is the problem.<BR>Scenario 1:<BR>39th+ Cleric grouped with 60th Warrior.<BR>Ratio: 1 mana for 7-12 points using Complete Healing.<BR> <BR>Scenario 2:<BR>60th Shaman grouped with 60th Warrior.<BR>Ratio: 1 mana for about 2.3 points using Superior Healing.<BR> <BR>Conclusion: In this scenario, a 39th level cleric is a better healer than a 60th shaman. This is due to their best healing spell being up to five times more powerful than the healing spell shamans get at 53rd level.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Q: But can't the shaman can cast Torpor?<BR>A: No. Look at the casting time of torpor and its quite serious negative effects.<BR> <BR>Q: But can't the shaman slow the mob?<BR>A: No. And here's why...<BR>1) Many mobs are spellcasters. Slow isn't going to help against them.<BR>2) Many melee-based mobs have such a high magic resistance, most notably in Velious, that they simply cannot be affected in any way by magic-based spells.<BR>3) Slowing is not an options while the shaman is performing a primary healer role for a group. Shaman slow spells have a MASSIVE amount of aggro attached and are highly resisted, often requiring multiple casts. A shaman attempting to slow 55+ mobs requires a cleric in the group to keep the shaman alive.<BR> <BR>Q: What about cripple?<BR>A: PvP spell only. No noticable effect on mobs.<BR> <BR>Q: Can't the shaman cannibalize to have a larger mana pool?<BR>A: No. When a shaman is actively healing a tank they are chain casting Superior Healing in an attempt to keep up with mob damage.<BR> <BR>Q: So what if we give shamans another healing spell to fizzle at 55th level, similar to Remedy?<BR>A: You've upped the shaman healing ratio from 2.3 to 2.5. Nothing really has changed. The imbalance still exists.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>What I would like Verant to try out:<BR>(spell) (class/level)<BR>Greater Healing (Cleric/29, Druid/34, Shaman/34, Paladin/39)<BR>Superior Healing (Cleric/34, Druid/44, Shaman/44, Paladin/49)<BR>Complete Healing (Cleric/never, Druid/never, Shaman/never, Palain/never)<BR>Celestial Healing (Cleric 44, Druid/never, Shaman/never, Paladin/never)<BR>Remedy (Cleric/49, Druid/53, Shaman/55, Paladin/57)<BR>Divine Light (Cleric 53, Druid/never, Shaman/never, Palain/never)<BR>Celestial Elixir (Cleric 59, Druid/never, Shaman/never, Palain/never)<BR>Torpor (Cleric/never, Druid/Never, Shaman/60, Palain/never)<BR> <BR>Revive (Cleric/29, Paladin/30)<BR>Resurrection (Cleric/49, Paladin/49)<BR>Convergence (Necro/53)<BR>Reviviscence (Cleric/56, Paladin/never)<BR> <BR>* Rebalance all encounters that were tuned to Complete Healing.<BR>** Note how clerics continue to have a clear edge on healing.<BR>*** Note how it's just possible that the Paladin may also be used as a healer.<BR>**** Remove the negative impact of Torpor.<BR>***** Remove the component from Convergence.<BR> <BR>The end result?<BR>- The high end game will no longer be centered around a single spell.<BR>- The raid will end when all *healers* logout. (Or everyone gets tired)<BR>- All healing classes receive a small healing boost.<BR>- Clerics remain the best healers, best ac/hp buffers, best res'ers, among other things.<P>Absor said, "Clerics will always, let me repeat, always be far superior healers than any other class. Keep a few things in mind here. Clerics get any shared healing spell many levels earlier than any other class. Clerics have a larger variety of healing spells to choose from, making them much more flexible in their healing powers. Clerics are also innately better healers than any other class. They will heal more hit points with the same spell than any other class (they have a built in bonus on all their healing)."<BR> <BR>Aradune said, "NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion..." (This should of course apply to a single SPELL and also to a single CLASS)<BR> <BR>Search the threads for "Mudflation" and "Mobflation" and it will become very clear that you don't want more healing in EverQuest. You want to redistribute the healing that's already there to create balance.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Complete Healing costs 400 mana to cast.<BR>A meditating cleric regains about 35 mana per tick.<BR>It takes about 12 ticks (72 seconds) to meditate enough mana to cast Complete Healing.<BR>It takes about 2 ticks (12 seconds) to cast Complete Healing and sit back down.<BR>...This means it takes 14 ticks (84 seconds) to get 400 mana, cast complete healing, and meditate again. Therefore...<BR> <BR>With 5 clerics, complete healing can be chain cast once every 17 seconds. (84/5)<BR> <BR>- Now add a warrior to the group.<BR> <BR>This group can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not capable of killing the warrior in under 17 seconds.<BR> <BR>(Actually the number is more like 15 seconds, but I rounded everything such that there is plenty of slack)<BR> <BR> <BR>Absor said, "One cleric and one warrior, using this one magic item, can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not capable of killing the warrior in under 30 seconds."<BR> <BR>Absor said, "I hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone. If we allow this item to remain in the game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds. 15 seconds if the group consists of two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there..."<BR> <BR> <BR>Q: What about the aggro of Complete Healing?<BR>A: Complete Healing has very low aggro. Combine this with the fact that it's five clerics alternating such that each one only casts Complete Healing once in an 80+ second time period and aggro will be no problem.<BR> <BR>Q: What if there is more than one mob and the warrior is too lazy to taunt and take a swing at each mob?<BR>A: Well, give the warrior a sword of skyfire or poison wind censor. Problem solved. <BR> <BR> <BR>Hmmmmmm. Absor, care to comment?<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>This still occurs.<BR>It's annoying that it happens *at all*, even on the lower level mobs.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Group buffs.<P>I think the shaman group buffs were designed with anti-twink mentality.  A group buff will work on players that are level 40 and below.  It's time to fix that bug and give shamans group buffs with appropriate increases in stats for the level they are received at.  (57th through 59th)<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Fizzles on higher level spells.<P>Reducing fizzles basically gives us a bigger mana pool.  This may not be intended, but it's what actually happens.  I think this will result in more "mobflation".<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Rage Line in General.<P>I do like what was done with these spells however they need to have their durations increased dramatically.  Spirit Quickening is another spell that is basically useless due to it's uncomfortably short duration.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Pets.<P>The shaman pet was upped ever so slightly in level and had it's maximum damage reduced from 53 to 51.  Are we supposed to be thankful?<P>The only thing a shaman pet is good for is taking out massive numbers of really low level mobs for faction.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Torpor.<P>This spell is hideously broken and ill conceived.  Please destroy this spell and give us something that is actually useful like celestial healing.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Other 50+ spells.<P>The DoT's should be purchasable at a vendor, like the druid spells.  All other spells should not require more than one night of camping.<P>Grow should be a workable spell.  I've seen GM's cast it on themselves and become as large as a hill giant.  This spell needs to be in the game, if for no other reason than to remove the effect of shrink.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Stacking of Curse of Spirits.<P>First it was a useless proc, now it's a useless right-clickable effect.  YES, of course it should stack with the aforementioned spells.<P>The value of the effect is further diminished by the extremely long casting time.  Please cut the casting time in half.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: New Healing spell at 60th.<P>Maybe that wouldn't be necessary if VI didn't write the high end game to be based completely on a spell that only one class gets.  See my aforementioned suggestions on healing.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor.<P>What is the point of Iksar getting an AC "bonus" when they play a shaman, warrior, or shadow knight?  We all know that in fact Iksar get an AC penalty because of the amount of items that Iksar cannot use.  And it's MUCH more than just an AC penalty because some of those items have nice right-clickable effects that aren't available on other items.  This makes a non-iksar shaman VERY desirable over their scaled counterparts.<P>Iksar shamans worship cazic thule.  Why has a symbol of cazic thule quest been put in for trolls but not Iksar?  Quests are just another way non-iksar shamans can gain huge advantages.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>ITEM: Malo line of spells.<P>These spells should be resisted like lifetaps or there's no reason to cast them until you're 60th and it's unresistable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I agree with the list but wish when we get stat buffs they be considered a minor secondary spell.Stat buffs are not class defining.True effect stamina-50 plus stamina does not add 125 hp's it adds about 20 over previous series(very minor) effect increase.Agility,same thing you receive the effect of 4 armor class over previous spell.All stat buffs are minor upgrade in effect to previous spells and should be treated as such<P> There's no reason shamans should get no offensive spells prior to level 56.Reason we are the only caster class to not receive any is because verant considers stat buffs major spells instead of considering them as minor upgrades.How could anyone consider a 50+ spell thats only effect is 4 ac more than previous spell a major improve i'll never know.<BR>Druids get a 900 DOT at 52 vendor bought-1300 dot at 53 vendor bought.<BR>Necro's 3 new dots,1 dd new pet by 53.<BR>in fact all casters get some spells by 53 either DOTs or dd's except shamans.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was rather impressed with how Absor summed up a few of the other classes concerns. I am not very impressed with how ours was summed up.<P>He says little about Avatar although this was spoken of in length in the posts with multiple examples given on what this spell should do. (the one thing he does say is wrong and will probably get any request ignored. I mean they will say hell it's already 3 times better than the way he described) Why didnt he post any examples of ways to fix this spell? I have a bag full of 160 emeralds in the bank. I do NOT use this spell ever. This should not be a "once in a blue moon" spell. <P>He says nothing about the fact that torpor cannot be cast on ppl who have certain buffs or are under some dot effects. This is very important and needs to be addressed. This is a great spell when it works but how stupid to cast a heal and get "spell does not take hold" msg. <P>I know getting a couple more gate potions were talked about in the threads but he does not address this at all. Why? Our gate potions cost about 200pp certainly at this price we will NEVER infringe on a tp class. <P>Rage line: Fix the stacking increase the duration. <P>Increasing the effectiveness of stat buffs was talked about a lot and yet not one mention of this by Absor. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Healing -<BR>   Torpor will be forever compromised as a primary healing spell unless it can stack with everything including negative effects. There are many effects right now that currently do not stack with Torpor.<P>Fizzles -<BR>   Cannablize 3 is the spell that people complain about the most in my experience, not 2. Also Acumen and the Rage line have horrid fizzle rates.<P>Torpor -<BR>   The spell was changed so that it DOES stack with the regen spells. It does NOT stack with Ressurection Effect, Necro Lich Line, Any attack speed slowing spell, Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir. I'm probably missing some.<P>Stacking with Focus of Spirit -<BR>   There are a number of spells that will stack with the components of Focus of Spirit (Talisman of Kragg, Strength, Dexterity) or will overwrite a single part of the triad (Rage line overwrites Dex buffs, Avatar overwrites Strength buffs). These spells do not stack with Focus of Spirit at all. Avatar, Rage Line, and potions that effect Strength or Dexerity come to mind. If they do stack with the components, why not the all in ones as well?<P>Stacking with Avatar -<BR>   One of the new Ranger buffs does not stack with Avatar. Considering the recast time on this spell Shamans are touchy touchy touchy about the stacking issues. It probably wouldn't be as much of an issue if we could recast the spell on someone else.<P><BR>I know you don't want changes, but I did feel there were some areas where clarification was needed.

</FONT><HR>Absor, is you completely missing out on stuff lots of us asked for considered "compelling"? I urge you not to rush to the Dev folks until a small dialogue has been opened, and options examined. We will be right back here in a couple months if you close the dialogue. <P>ITEM: Fizzles on higher level spells.<P>Addendum: Add Cannibilize III to this list as well.<P>-<P>ITEMS: Alchemy.<P>Addendum: Evil large race Shaman (Ogres, Trolls) Need both Alchemy vendors in their own cities just like Barbarians were granted in theirs by Yakatizma. Just because we're both evil doesnt  mean the 2 races completely get along; many quests can't be done in either city without ruining the other's faction. So unless you intended Shaman to have to use a mule to practice a trade skill, this needs to be fixed. Because it was fixed for Barbarian for that very same reason.<P>-<P>ITEM: Torpor.<P>Addendum: Leave spell as-is for in-group efficiency and add a Nature's Touch (or it's Shamanic equivalent) at level 60. It's already been changed to stack with the Regen line.<P>-<P>ITEM: Tigir's Insects.<P>Addendum: The spell is rare, but it is not cool. The idea is cool. The implementation is not. The radius of area effected is too small and it uses waves so it will only slow 4 creatures maximum. Get rid of the 'waves' and let it effect everything within the area.<P>ITEM: Pox of Bert.<P>Addendum: Disease based spells in general are not useful. They take far too long to do their damage; in a group or raid situation the mob either dies before the DOT does full damage or the uber mob resists the spell. Disease based spells probably need to be moved to a 1 minute timer.<P>-<P>ITEM: Voice of the Berserker.<P>Addendum: Is part of the Rage line, and does not stack with Focus.<P>-<P>ITEM: New Healing spell at 60th.<P>Addendum: Refer to my Torpor comment; the best solution for all involved seems to be to leave Torpor as-is and add Nature's Touch or the Shamanic equivalent at 60 for side-effect free, traditional healing.<P>-<P>ITEM: Avatar.<P>Addendum: The spell lasts 6 minutes, not 1. There are 2 problems. (1) Stacking issues; we can't cast it if anyone has Focus or other str/dex/agi type buffs on. (2) Boon of Garou due to similar effects, no component, and less mana cost. Suggestion: Fix the stacking problems and lower the "cost" of the spell; remove the component reqirement and reduce mana to 175.<P>-<P>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor.<P>Addendum: While I don't want to take anything from our Iksar cousins, please consider the only balancing points of Iksar Shaman vs. Old world Shaman are: lack of slam and inability to wear Jaundiced (eg, no bracer nukes). If Iksar gain the larger of these 2 abilities, there will be no real point to playing an old-world Shaman. They will have the best everything: Best regen, Best night sight, best armor, best innate AC bonus, best newbie areas, best central location in Kunark, etc. All for the same XP penalty a Troll pays now.<P>-<P>ITEM: Malo line of spells.<P>Addendum: The Malo *LINE* of spells (Malise, Malisement, Malosi, Malosini, Malo) saves VS. Magic. The Malo spell itself is unresistable. Malosini, Malosi, Malisement, and Malise themselves aren't overly usefull because yes they save vs. one of the resists they attempt to debuff. If it saved vs. something else as the Enchanter Tashan line "saves" VS. Poison, they would have a better chance of landing.<P>Tugg<BR>L60 Ogre Oracle, Prexus<BR>Keepers of the Faith<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, something missing here that has me very disturbed.  Our primary role in a group is not as a buffer, it is as a debuffer, it is our slow line of spells.  However, there are two problems with these - they are very nearly matched by enchanter equivalents, and are magic based, which means on velious they are pretty much unuseable on many, many critters.  Since nerfing the enchanter line is obviously not gonna happen, how about cementing our foothold in our primary arena by giving us a secondary line of slows based on disease resists?   <P>Also, absor, you have missed an entire point we've been talking about for months, stat buffs offer minimal, for the most part, inconsequential impact on player performance.  And yet our spell line, especially after 50, concentrates heavily on what amount to borderline worthless, fluff spells.  Thankfully our role is not that of buffer, but rather debuffer.  Yes, you disagree, yes our spell lists center around buffs, but no, that is not what happens in practice.  What we get in groups for, what we get on raids for, are our malo and txgxr's line of spells.  Forget what you see on a paper printout of a spell list, watch a good shaman in a group - his primary concern is not being a buff machine, it's getting each and every target slowed and resist debuffed as needed - all else is secondary.  I'm rather disturbed that you've played blind monkey here, and really colored the list by your own personal (and incorrect in practice) bias that we are at our heart, buffers.<P>If you and the devs are dead set on us being buffers first and foremost, fix the buffs, make them WORK.  Not just silly green numbers on the stat screen with an actual effect that is little more than a placebo, but actually effective improvements on the performance/durability of our tanks.  It's no joke that a single level 49 enchanter Swift Like the Wind haste buff will have more impact on a tank's performance than every single one of our level 50-60 buffs *combined* - that is a problem.  The stat system in EQ is flawed, their effects barely minimal.  Our stat buffs need MORE to make them *effective* buffs than just the stat component.  <P>My suggestions here are:<BR>Strength - an outright damage bonus and/or a marked increase in the "to hit" portion of the ATK composite statistic in addition to what it already does for the damage component.<P>Dexterity - a secondary haste buff (one that stacks with the regular haste lines ideally - we're the master buffers, right, not masters of redunancy) which level for level combined with our regular speed buffs keeps us competitive with enchanters in this arena, and when combined with an enchanter augment the tank above and beyond what either of us could do alone.<P>Agility - easy, a straight out AC adjustment - a significant AC adjustment, not the paltry hint of an improvement gained by just the stat increase alone.<P>Stamina - Perhaps the most effective of our buffs as is, but you can still get creative here - more hp than just the stat increase alotment alone, an increase in stamina (yellow bar) regeneration a-la augmentation/acumen, a small regeneration bonus.<P>If you want to fix us by keeping within the bounds of your vision as master buffers, those are a few ideas to make our buffs useful. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor didn't even list stat buffs as a topic!<P>Yes, it is very important to me that we shaman get the ability to do useful levels of healing.

</FONT><HR>Absor<BR>I read all the posts since the second talk and saw more then one post on these issues. Balance isn't all just about twinking spells: <P>1 The slow of a shaman vs Enchanters.<BR>2 The comparison of slows/speed <BR>  ratio between these two classes. <BR>3 Malaise of shaman vs magicians.<BR>4 Shaman buff usefulness vs mana cost/benefit.   <BR>5 Shaman Buff Usefullness in itself. <BR>6 Healing Roles.(This you did address)<BR>7 The role of a shaman in a group, what can they  <BR>  bring to a specialized group? <BR>8 Debuffing Stats (Cripple line): Useful?<BR>9 Stat usefulness: How many shamans posted ideas  to make them more useful. The need to do it with the soft caps and armor. The tests run by shamans shsowing a minimal upgrade in performance with these buffs on? <BR>10 The idea to combine stats to save mana and time<P>I'm trying to convince you here:<P> I slow thats what I do. That is what I bring to my group, Slow and regen line(which two other classes can do). I can't heal and most humor me now on stat buffs. <P>Do I want it this way? Not particularly. I want to be wanted for my buffs. I want my buffs to make a noticeable difference!! Not an ok I have an extra buff thats cool I won't tell you when it runs out cuz I don't really think it important. But if no enchanter is around will that tank complain till he gets his Speed. Wishful thinking scenario :"Shaman Looking for group" Group member "Lets get them they can buff all my stats!"<P><BR>Please address this issue at least by bringing it on the table. They are at the core of what shaman's are feeling frustrated about: Usefulness in groups, mainly post 50. Yes alchemy isn't the best, yes we wish our pet didn't bite, but that isn't what gets us into groups! Alchemy and pets are side things that, while help define us are more for looks.<P>What is a Shaman? What is their core? <BR>If buffing then is there not a design problem since shaman's don't use them/group members don't care if they have them. That other classes buffs are more wanted then a class whose core is supposed to be buffing, since its not healing because clerics have that role.<P>If debuffing then it needs to be made the core not a side project they can only be 5% better then other classes and not even that with Malaise line.<P>Solutions:<BR>Route 1: <BR>Add some of the ideas on stat buffs in the posts done by shamans. Add stats together, add significance to the stats, add positive side effects to Shaman stat buffs. <BR>Route 2:<BR>Make our debuffing stand out. Make them the core with our mediocore healing. Add a few more spells to this line, especially for high mob encounters<P><BR>Its wonderful that you are taking the time to do this. But please don't skip over a topic that has been posted on till even us shamans want it to go away. In the end thats what we want. We want this to be solved so we can go and feel useful/needed.<P>I still believe that debuffing and healing should be our main since I don't see how Verant is going to be able to alter stat buffs (stats) to be more meaningful. But I found it unfair that you didn't even address this issue .<P>Take care and I hope I was able to somewhat convince you to at least bring it on the table.<BR>If its never going to happen then by all means tell us now. Be blunt!!! I rather try to give ideas that might help then those that will never be attainable because how the system is set up.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Eq really had potential but programmer screw it up by puting a buf class when we all know str dex and agi are preatty much useless. They should have fixe this in the 1 place and put good spell i hate useless spell Every useless spell should be change and that not just shaman.

Your response is not dissimilar to the responses we've seen from clerics on the topic of sharing the healing role.<P> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Let's look at the facts regarding Iksar on a point-per-point basis:<P>Dirk_Tuggler_KTF said, "They will have the best everything: Best regen"<P> - Iksar have the same regen as a Troll.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Dirk_Tuggler_KTF said, "They will have the best everything: Best night sight"<P> - Iksar have infravision, just like a troll and ogre.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Dirk_Tuggler_KTF said, "They will have the best everything: best armor"<P> - Iksar do not have anywhere near the selection of armor OR items available to them as the other shaman races.  The is a combination of "old world" items that were simply never updated to include the Iskar to quests that were never put in.<P>It appears that Verant went back and updated a LOT of armor for Iksar Monks and Necromancers but forgot about the shamans, warriors, and shadowknights.  I personally feel it's because Verant ran out of time, had to put RoK on the shelves by X date, and thought it would be easier to say "It chaffes their scales" than to put the work into updating all those items.<P>Rune etched armor should also be wearable by Iksar.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Dirk_Tuggler_KTF said, "They will have the best everything: best innate AC bonus"<P> - Iksar receieve an AC bonus based on their level.  Are you suggesting that Iksar monks shouldn't be able to wear shiverback armor?  Or Iksar necros shouldn't be able to wear some of the old robes?<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Dirk_Tuggler_KTF said, "They will have the best everything: best newbie areas, best central location in Kunark"<P> - It sounds like you got desperate for ideas.<P>Best newbie areas?  You're saying the first 24 hours you spend as a newbie should drastically affect your viability in the high end game?<P>Best central location in Kunark?  I can only imagine you're trying to imply that starting in Kunark is a bonus of some sort.  A shaman has the easiest access to the area they are bound from 14th level on.  And what does that have to do with the armor an Iksar can wear?  Nothing!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>EvilChu, I think what Tugg is trying to say is getting lost here.<P>From a pure game logic standpoint, Rune-Etched, Totemic and Jaundiced Bone armor *clearly* have Chain AC and not Plate AC (compare a Totemic, RE or JB Breastplate to a Ravenscale, Woven Shadow or Myrolakars BP and then to a Darkforge, Umbral or Blood Ember BP, the Tot/RE/JB armor is clearly equal to the Chain and not the Plate).<P>Shamen, Iksar or not, are a Chain class and Verant threw us a cookie when they made our *chain AC* class armors have a Plate graphic.  It is a visual.  Nothing more.  Thus there is no 'in-game' rationale for Iksar being unable to wear those three armor-sets.<P>Lack of Plate graphics isn't a real excuse either, since my Iksar twink in Tizmak / Ulthork armor sure likes like he / she is wearing steel  Plate...   So a Plate graphic *does* exist for the scaly folk.  It only would need a tint of green, blue or sickly yellow to become Totemic, Rune-Etched or Jaundiced Bone.<P>Tugg is however suggesting the game balance reasons for why this may have been intended, since we have pretty much proven beyond the shadow of a doubt by this point that Shaman class armors are not and never were any form of 'scale-chafing' Plate.<P>When you look at what you *can* wear, the various Sebilite and Kylong and Jasarth stuff, most of which has excellent AC and decent stat and resist modifiers, and combine that with the racial AC bonus and the naturally higher Wisdom of the Iksar Shaman over his non-scaled brethren, the advantage *already* lies with the Iksar.  My Ogre can't wear Jasarth or Sebilite, even though it has *superior* AC and Wisdom bonuses to the Totemic I was wearing when I started getting the stuff in Sebilis.  So I am tossing out Iksar Shaman wearable armor that my Ogre cannot wear that has better AC and better +Wis than what I do have and Iksar Shaman naturally have more AC and Wisdom than me anyway?  Hopefully, you see this from the other side as well.  The only place where it gets dubious is of course the ubiquitous Barbarians, who can wear anything and get superior gear to the other three races (and, prior to the Iksar, had superior stats too boot!).<P>The fact that Iksar cannot wear RE, JB or Totemic armors makes no sense in-game.  But it is, like the super-heavy Druid Planes armor that Gordon claimed was an attempt to punish them for being 'too good,' a desperation move by Verant since they realized belatedly that they had made the Iksar with too many built-in advantages...  <P>I thought they sounded fun to play around with *before* they announced that they would have <BR>Regeneration or a natural AC bonus or could be Monks or Necromancers (classes which their racial advantages horribly unbalance in my opinion).  <P>(I thought they might get Hide based on some chameleon trick or be hulking saurian brutes, like fantasy lizard men from other games or novels.  Silly me.)<P>After I kept hearing week after week what new exciting ability or option they had over previous races, I was numb, awaiting word that they would be 100% magic resistant or fly or breathe fire or something, since it could hardly be more obviously unbalanced against say, a Gnomish Necromancer or a Half Elf Warrior.<P>It was IMO, an insane balancing decision to create the Iksar the way they are (and a fairly bizarre one from a fantasy standpoint, unlike Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, etc, they have no real precedent and we begin to feel the need to pull out a block and tackle to suspend our disbelief when we see 'kung fu dragons' attacking people by turning around and swinging their elongated butts at them...).   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The no Plate thing, IMO, was a bad decision meant to mitigate a much worse one.  Presumably the committee that cobbled the Iksar together out of a dozen peoples uncoordinated 'visions' was hung over and begin desperately suggesting drawbacks like naughty factions and no plate and breaking *every single Cabilis class quest*...  Or that last one could have been an oversight, or rather a lot of them, I guess.<P>The no Totemic / Rune-Etched / Jaundiced Bone for Iksar Shaman notion is even more obviously desperate, since it doesn't take a rocket scientist to check the class description and find out that Shamen are not a Plate class and that our gear has the exact same AC as Ranger / Rogue Chain class armors of equal drop (comparing between mid-level quest armors, Planes armors and Kunark armors) regardless of how it looks.<P>Such is life.  My Ogre is 53rd level and has been to Sebilis many times, but I still don't have the precious 'bracer' that everyone says is so class-defining.  I still function.  I am not shunned or kicked out of groups for lack of this item.  I expect that your Iksar, who with commensurate armor will have a superior AC *and* a higher Wisdom (I am *still* not at 200, and not likely to get there without an Epic weapon...), will be able to function in these groups even better than I do.<P>And *that* is the point that Tugg was making.  You're already better.  And you want more?<P>It is unfair yes that Verant cheated you of armors you could *obviously* wear.  They shouldn't punish you for their own unbalanced racial designs, they should have built the race correctly the first time.  But they didn't, and it would just compound the unfairness to the rest of us to give Iksar even MORE advantages over the scale-less Shaman.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well they might let Iksar wear the shaman plate-look armors, but don't count on a new graphic.  It'll probably just look like jarsath tinted in whatever color the original armor possesses.  <P>It was my far-blown theory in the early days of kunark that the only reason Verant didn't give Iksars the ability to wear plate was because they were too lazy to come up with a graphic (my other opinion was that they didn't want the iksar looking TOO cool, full black plate on a lizzie... mmmm).  I think it would just be a joke at this point anyway unless they did add a new graphic that looked like plate (they got the helm).<P>In my opinion, the racial bonuses of the Iksar, including regen, forage, swimming, and the innate AC boost, do not offset the inability to wear plate.  Some class-defining items were off limits to our scaly brothers and sisters, besides just the class-specific plate (effy boots and hero bracer come to mind).<P>Pre-Velious, it was clear that there were not enough high level armor options for the Iksar.  You either saw them in jarsath or sebilite scale, period.  Coincidentally, both these kinds of armor are considered trash by the races that can use plate, with a few exceptions of particular pieces (jarsath leggings come to mind).  It was evident that Iksar warriors and shadow knights were at a complete disadvantage with their inability to wear their classes' planar and kunark plate.  However, Verant didn't fix the issue until Velious came out.<P>Well, Velious did come out, and Verant responded.  They implemented armor drops in plane of growth and rewards from quests that put the kunark and old planes to shame.  This stance completely illegitimizes the argument that Iksar shouldn't wear plate, because this equipment is already better than any plate armor in the game for those respective classes.  Iksar might as well be able wear the plate, and as a Barbarian, I wouldn't have any objection.  It's not like any Iksar would be foolish enough to spend time doing the totemic quests or agonizing over drops in plane of hate.  It would be nice to have the option, though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Remove negative effects. Allow Stacking. Add gate, bind, and lower heal potions. Increase buyback from vendors, and make the vendors recognize 10shot stacks vs. singles.<P>5. After buffs are fixed, give us either group buffs that are the same increases as single versions, or buffs that get several stats at once and stack together.<P>6. Increase the drop rates on our high end spells or make the ones similiar to other classes' purchasable ones, purchasable. More effectiveness wouldn't hurt either.<P>7. Make our pet something more than a decoration.<P>There ya go.<BR>Please let us know if arguing about stat buffs is a worthless effort.
