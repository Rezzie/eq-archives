</FONT><HR>Well, hello Abashi, and thanks for posting a response to this issue. It's been so long since your last one, and I think it was brave of you to enter this heated discussion.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It may sound like we're just not taking no for an answer, but we actually do have some good points, which I won't repeat since they are already written above and in other threads.<P>My request to you is to hold an in-game poll as to whether a roleplay server would be played on or not. If a sizeable proportion of the player base votes yes, then it would be in Verant's best interests to introduce a roleplay server to keep us happy longer. If the vote is no, then give us the results for us to see, and we'll admit that it wasn't going to work. I do think an in-game poll is the only way to get the opinions of every EQ player.<P>Thanks again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

To make it a real RP server, and one who wouldn't require guides and GMs to babysit everyone, I'd suggest discouraging non-RPlayers in some ways.

</FONT><HR>Why an RP server?<P>I spent six years playing Neverwinter Nights (on AOL) and enjoyed my stay there immensely.  I wasn't entirely satisfied with the RP then, but in retrospect... it was amazing.  Since mid-1997 I've tried Diablo (Battlenet), the Realm, Ultima Online, Asheron's Call, and EverQuest... none have had more than, perhaps, a 1% in-character rate.  There tend to be small enclaves of RPers.  The best place for RP now is UO Emulators (Mytharria.org comes to mind) and MUDs.  <P>The high-level MOBs, "dynamic" world changes, and scripted GM quests aren't adding to the EQ experience... at least not much.  What's missing is the community, the RP atmosphere... an RP-tagged server would provide a *chance* for that.  That's what appeals to RPers about online games.  Without it, you have a computer game with levels, treasure and some "risk" (if you call sitting in front of a screen risky).  Ultimately, that's very dull, regardless of the advances in graphics and sound.<P>So why won't Verant tag a server for RP?<P>Simply put, Verant won't place an RP tag on a server because they think the complaints would be too numerous to handle.  Role-playing isn't as precise as player-versus-player combat, and what that entails.  They don't believe they can "enforce" even the perception of a role-playing server... and that would lead to a lot of disatisfied players.<P>But RPers are already unhappy with the game.<P>That said, I think two simple steps could be taken to make an RP server.  1)  Tag the next new server "RP" and 2) impose some sort of global experience point penalty (25 to 50%).  <P>Will that assure RP?  Of course not, but it will encourage it while discouraging power-gaming--or rather power-gaming without regard for an in-character atmosphere.<P>Staff shouldn't concern themselves about what is RP and what isn't.  I suspect many players would be willing to create characters (and move guilds) to an RP-tagged server.  They may not give up their 47th level shadow knight, but I think their are enough RPers to provide a more RP-intensive environment.  How different would the game be if even 10% of the characters were RPed?  25%?  Imagine the change if half the characters you've encountered were role-played!<P>Verant doesn't need to say "you can't be a smart troll" and decide what is RPing and what isn't.  They need to provide some tools and let the thousands of dedicated players build an RP community.  Unofficial RP servers don't work.  We need a few tools... a tag, and perhaps a method to discourage power-gamers/farmers/etc.  XP penalties are what I feel would be most effective, but at this point... I suspect those that consider themselves RPers would be willing to compromise.<P>A tag is enough.  If it fails, the players aren't going to be any more upset about the game than they are now.<P>~dirge<BR>(Shivrehel Despana on Xegony)<BR>(House Winterborne)<BR>(www.phoenix.org/winter/)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Maybe I missed it, but i did not see naything on how those penalties would be applied.<P>I favor roleplaying too, but it won't work in the utopian way you are suggesting and to try it anyway would hurt the RP community and credibility and also the EQ game as it sucked resources into a black hole.  This is obvious to anyone who is willing to open themselves up to an unhappy truth.<P>Your only hope is to come up with a workable means of enforcing or coding it BEFORE an RP tagged server is setup.  So talk about that, and come up with a COMPLETE idea, not some unexpalined exp penalties for not roleplaying.  "Those penalties will be given when people are not roleplaying.  We will determine not roleplaying by .... mumble, whisper ..."<P>To those people who keep attributing other motives to Verant for not setting up an RP server (and for everything else they dont do when someone wants them too).

</FONT><HR>The only thing that can be happening is that Abashi simply did not read ANY posts of the numerous threads we've kept running under the subject. He says there will be non-roleplayers without enforcement and that they can't enforce, so a tag is a bad idea. <P>HELLO??? Who said we want the tag to keep non-roleplayer away? We want it to attract other roleplayers. If we are harrased (sp?) a GM will deal with the trouble-maker just like it happens on the others server. If non-roleplayers join the server that's no problem,  since roleplayers will go to the server in order to get together with other people with the same wish (to roleplay). The main problem with the current servers is that it is very hard to even find, not to mention group with, other roleplayers. In a tagged server, we will have people to group with so the presence of ooc dewds is irrelevant.<P>Let's just hope Abashi checks this thread again...<P><BR>Githoniel, the furious<P>PS: English is my second language so bear with me   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>Lots of good ideas but we are missing one essential ingredient....<P>Organization<P>My suggestion is to stage a roleplaying night, where everyone can create a new character or play one they had created earlier.  WE need to show Verant it can work.  Here are my suggestions.<P>1)  We need an organizer, not a game player, who can take charge.  Someone who can take the bull by the horns and lead the way, keeping track of all the details.  By the way, that person isn't me.<P>2)  Plan the event well in advance, so people can arrange their RL needs.  At least a month is needed, maybe more, so arrangements can be made by both the players and the organizers.<P>3)  Get the word out by using forums and web sites.<P>4)  Create a email list of people planning to attend.  Weekly updates will remind people of the upcoming event.  Web sites and forums can be  helpful but there is no guarantee players will remember to check them.<P>5)  Don't get lost in the unimportant details.  Fighting about what server to use or what races can attend, will only cause confusion.  My suggestion would be that everyone creates a human and then meets in some large city such as Freeport.  Remember, the idea is to create a statement that Verant has to listen to, not to create a new roleplaying world.<BR> <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, here's one more post.  Perhaps, if nothing else, it might serve to let Abashi know that we're not all raving, deaf lunatics.<P>I hear you, Abashi: there is no ISO standard for roleplaying.  It's subjective and unenforceable.  Well, it's subjective.  As one poster noted, it's enforceable (a la the subjective whim of the AD&D DM).  *Equitable* enforcement is more problematic, and nearly impossible.  I can understand Verant/Sony/et al. not wanting to go down that road.  All-in-all, I wouldn't want someone imposing their version of roleplay on me.  So thanks for not going there.<P>But I do like to roleplay.  And that seems to be an anomaly.<P>To my fellow roleplayers, I caution you not to request or rely on polls.  I think the evidence that we're asking for an RP server -- and I do say "we" because I support the request -- tells both us and Verant that the majority of players are *not* roleplayers.  If they were, the servers already would be as we are dreaming: a place where non-roleplayers are ostracized by the majority.  In fact, several posters have reported the reverse: being ridiculed/ostracized for roleplaying.<P>Abashi, please listen when I say that I hear you again: an "RP" tag-only server will not be respected by 100% of the player base.  I'm sure that you hear the response among roleplayers: "that's okay."  I think you hear the rest: that we roleplayers want a place to gather with like-minded folks.  There are other means to do this; perhaps you advocate one or more: looking for other players with /roleplay on; independantly organzing ourselves to play on one, specific server.  The roleplayers' response is that these methods are overly-cumbersome.  They also place "virgin" players -- players new to the game as a whole and/or those who don't read the message boards *anywhere* -- at a big disadvantage.  We're asking for a little help in meeting folks.<P>I haven't read every post.  Many of them are long, and I'm guilty of being longwinded here, too.  But I haven't seen many posters say that they understand Verant's point of view on this next part.  I think one of of Verant's concerns with tagging a server as "RP" without some distinguishing "RP"-type rules is that these same virgin players will come to the RP server with expectations that, if Verant "endorses" this server as roleplay, then they have a right to complain if someone isn't roleplaying.  All of *us* may sign a blood pact that we won't /report non-RPers, but the tag still sets an expectation in the public mind.  I think Verant fears -- and with some justification -- that the Guides and GMs on such a server will spend a proportionately larger amount of time addressing RP issues, even if just to say, "Roleplaying is subjective and we take no stand on what is 'acceptable' roleplaying."  You can well-imagine the irritated and highly emotional player's response: "Then *WHY* is the blankity-blank server tagged *ROLEPLAY* if you [insert expletive string here] people aren't going to *enforce* it?!?!"  Angry customers, stressed GMs...not a good situation as Verant envisions it.  And I suspect that they're not far off the mark.  And how about those "disruptive influences?"  I can just picture them petitioning as "harrassment" those of us RPers who take steps to ostracize them.  Again, the Guides and GMs spend time answering misperceptions created by the RP tag.  In Verant's mind, it's wiser to avoid the misperception in the first place.<P>So is this the end of the line?  Well, as many of you have said in one way or another, it is, sort of.  Depending on how you want to look at it, either Verant or the majority of the player base holds all the cards.  We roleplayers are neither of these (see above).  We *are* a minority.  The decision is really out of our hands.<P>If Verant were so inclined, I think both they and we would be better off to alter the requested tag slightly to "Roleplay preferred," "Roleplay requested," or "Roleplay encouraged."  I have no emperical evidence, but I believe this would go a long way towards mitigating player misperception.  As the roleplayers have already said, it would also go a long way toward putting us together with like-minded players, i.e., roleplayers.<P>In conclusion, it's a compromise.  The roleplayers don't get everything we want.  There will still be disruptive influences.  And Verant will not be totally spared RP-based petitions.  I'll say it again: I don't think it's that much to ask.<P>Abashi, I hear you.  I even agree with you.  A lot.  Now, your turn: do you hear me?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Here is a very simple way to implement a role-playing server.<P>Simple really. Use a slightly modified versin of the PvP play nice rules.  Modify the client to pop up a disclaimer that must be read stating thatthat such server is for roleplaying, and trhat sometimes people can do not so nice things in the name of roleplaying, and by clicking on OK  after typing the words "i understand" you signify that you understand it.<P>Enforcement of roleplaying guidelines woudl be on the shoulders of the roleplayers.  Trainigand KS-ing would still be considered abuse.  But you could roleplay evil better. Dark elvs in particular, are supposed to help oters only as log as it suits them.  Getting into a group, looting the quest item and gating is in character for a dark elf grouped with god races Yet if you were to do such a thing on a blue server, you would be told to stop it.<P>I'll tell you what would happen to powergamers that found their way onti such servers.  People would ignore their obviously OOC speech, and they would get mad, andstart shouting at which point the poeple in the zone woud take notice and try to initiate duels with the unruly person, and if he/she refuses, they would be proclaimed COWARDS in shout rather quickly.  Troublemakers would get the treatment even more quickly, and woudl get no help from the guides or GMs.  After all, help by a GM or guide is certainly not roleplaying is it?<P>That's the thing. The roleplaying server would be EASIER to run than the blue servers.  Just make sure a group of roleplayers gets established on it. With all the demand, it shouldn't be too hard.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>AS it stands, blue servers are powergamer havens, because the play nice rules ensure that they can powergame uninterrupted!  In fact it is the current blue server polay nice rules that create the vast amount of powerrgaming.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There are a few things that could make a roleplay server very feasible.  1)Increase NEGATIVE faction hits by 3 or 4 fold, without increasing posative ones(this would make it so people would be more accountable for their actions, no  more bard hunting until dubious then questing back up to amiable) 2) disable the /OOC zone chat(preventing any esacape from RP, theoretically speaking)   3)set all all player flags to /roleplay( I know this doesn't mean you actually roleplay but it would prevent people from making some sort of "ha-ha I'm not a roleplayer" statement)  4) decrease the drops on magic items by 50%, except ones that are for quests (making it more difficult to gain good items unless you quest for them, and making items seem a bit more unique or special)<BR>  The key point of all of these things is that they would all be considered "BAD" by your typical power-gamers.  By creating an environment that is full of penalties, but has no bonuses you make people want to avoid it, this is a good thing for role-players.  We don't want people swarming to the RP server like they do to every other one.<BR>   If you weren't a roleplayer why would you want to play on this server?  I can't think of any reason except "to tick off the rp'ers".  No problem, we can take care of that ourselves.  We aren't asking for your help in monitoring whether people are rp'ing or not, frankly, we don't need it.  We can tell if someone is or isn't a roleplayer.  If they aren't no problem,  /Ignore powergamer; it's that simple.  RPers tend to form strong communtities in the way of message boards and the like.  We could simply spread around the names of known dissidents and soon they would be on everyone's ignore list, I bet they'd have a real good time on a server where A) no one will talk to them B) faction hits are higher C) item drops are lower D) no one will group with them   E) no one will sell to them<BR>   Now, I know what you may be thinking, the French Revolution syndrome.  You don't like someone so you go around saying he's a power gamer to get him in trouble.  The thing is other people will know this person and will speak out for him, I doubt this would be much of a problem.  Most RPers like to make judgement calls themselves and could tell if someone was really a powergamer, or just being slandered.  Either way, it would be our probelm, not yours.<BR>    In any event, if you could make a server with these stipulations(please inform me of any technical difficulties in implementing them, I really have no idea of the logistical feasability) then we could take care of the rest.  That just produced a after-thought.  The test server has different "rules" then the main servers.  This requires different patching to play one or the other.  If the rp server required diffferent patching that may seem like an annoyance but it could actually be a boon.  It would just be another way of discouraging people from playing.  You may be thinking, hey, we don't want to discourage people.  But the thing is, it doesnt matter how much you discourage a true roleplayer, s/he'll still play if you offer him the oppurtuntiy to make an RP server.  It will only really discourage those who aren't rp'ers, and all the better to that.  I'd like to hear Verant's opions on our policing ourselves, because your main con-argument seems to be "people still won't roleplay" and our response to that is "yeah they will, we'll force them to or make their life miserable".  I'd also like input from my fellow players, I doubt my ideas are perfect, and would appreciate comments.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>All good ideas, but we're trying to work within the 'physical' boundries Verant has presented. (ie no creation of new rulesets etc which equates to more coding being required on their part).  We feel the best way to accomplish what we want is to take one step at a time.  Not ask for everything and then some right off the bat.<P>That's why we asked for the simplest thing possible.  Verant tags the server then lets the players create an environment that encourages RP and discourages non-RP.

</FONT><HR>As a traditional Roleplayer I of corse agree with almost everything said on this post.  I personaly would like a server tagged RP server.  I don't care if after about a few months some powergamers move in and farm and camp.  What i would like to know is that when i go to that server, there are others there that like to roleplay.  Personaly i like to play webrpg more then i like EQ because i like to ROLEPLAY.  <P>Abashi if the only reason you won't tag a server roleplay is because " we can't enforce"..." if its not inforced it won't work to keep non roleplayers away".  You have said this many times and wonder why we keep posting " please give us a roleplay server".  <P>The reason we keep saying this is because we obviously don't care if it doesn't work.  It won't be your responsibility to make it work.  I just want to go to a server where there are other roleplayers.   As far as Finnin Ro me and my real life friends are the only roleplayers i know on the server.  So please give us a roleplayer tagged server.  When you do that i will leave webrpg and come back to everquest.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If the worry is that the tagged server will be more work, then let us commit to making it less work.  Not only can you not petition about people not roleplaying, but you also cannot petition about kill stealing, ninja looting, or any other thing that could be considered a role.  Only the most sever forms of harrasment (virtual rape, foul language, etc) will be petitionable.  The server will actually be less work than average instead of more work than average.  Kill stealing is a "problem" invented by power-gaming babies.  Having someone else take a kill could easily be considered roleplaying, and if never having a kill stolen is important to a person, then they will learn to stay away from the roleplaying server.  It will be a self-sufficient environment, since having a GM come in to solve a problem goes against the roleplaying experience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
