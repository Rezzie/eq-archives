</FONT><HR>Absor: Again my apologies for creating a second thread; I wanted THIS thread to be more positive with people's findings of the good-things that are in there that didn't make the patch, like the Track IMPROVEMENTS you've made. If you're still reading here, please lock (heck, delete) the thread about this being class crippling since rather than moving the topic it appears to have simply created a multiple-thread-poster spam thread.<P>stillgar: No; it would be like finding your AC had suddenly been decreased by half and that your track skill had been capped to 5.<P>It's like a druid finding their Abjuration skill has been capped at 1.<P>Brofie - it's not faster than SoW. I have people running past me (infact I've died twice because people have run past me leaving me with their train to deal with). Infact it's slightly slower than jboots.<P>Bards have lousy AC, lousy defense skills, and they stun at the drop of a hat. The reason we NEED to move so fast is because it is the only way we stand a chance of getting away from an NPC.<P>Most importantly on this issue, I think it needs to be noted; not a single bard has said a word about undoing the snare-fix. Not a one. Every single post has been about the impact of the drum problem.<P>When the bards say "This is critical to our class", it needs to be weighed against the absence of complaints about the nerf which brought this about.<P>Absor - will you at least do us the small favour that if we are going to have to wait a week for our class to be restored, you will PERSONALLY oversee a rigorous testing of these songs with and without various drums, and confirm to us, your own personal word, that they will be working as before in the next patch? Not your word that they tell you it will, YOUR word that it will be fixed.<P><BR>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gravey/Lyrical;<P>That's quite unfair. Based on my personal experience as a programmer, developer, project lead and manager, and going on the hard work of the likes of Esther, Absor and Abashi, the problem is fairly obviously with the programming team and their interface to the customer-facing elements.<P>Programmers have a tendency to shun the likes of testers; testers are paid to try the unlikely. Programmers are frequently irritated by  testing's tendency to try stupid things, to listen to not be able to look at the code for themselves, for not using Emacs or whatever the programmers favourite editor is.<P>Often-times Absor, Abashi and Esther have seemed more like they are one of us than "one of them" - little more enlightened (even sometimes less), except that they have the ability to walk thru a door into a room full of the programmers.<P>Q&A can't be blamed for not testing this bug unless a code change had been reported to them.<P>Given the number of bugs that we DON'T see, and the number of bugs that don't make it off test, and Verant's ability to rapidly recreate problems once convinced of their existence, I'm fairly confident their QA and testing departments are pretty solid. But they show all the signs of a lack of co-operation and support from the programming team.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is unchanged.<P>2. Elemental Armor (Wiz 44, Mag 44) has been FIXED.<P>For a long time this spell would stack with Resist Cold but NOT Resist Fire. It now stacks with both.<P>NOTES: Elemental Shield is still broken and will not stack with Resist Fire.

</FONT><HR>Selo's is one of the major distinctions of being a bard.  It's one of the few things we excel at.  <P>YOU failed to catch this simple bard bug, yet again.  YOU failed to listen to your bug reports on Test server.  Thanks for making US take the hit until it's freaking convenient for you to fix it, especially after taking away the break-root ability in the same patch.  You could at least have the decency to fix this song, which is a core song to bards.  This song never gets unmemmed in outdoor zones, even when using SoW in groups; it is that {explicitive} important to me.<P>Be sure to pass my regards on to your Q/A department.  Also, get them to get someone who understands what a bard is to help test, since they won't listen to the Test server bards that report bugs.  This crap is getting quite old.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's well known that Bards on the test server reported this bug over a week ago, and yet nothing was done to correct it. No one looked into it, and it most certaintly wasn't fixed. Why does Verant not have anyone on their expanded "Live" team have anyone who tests Bards, or at least plays the class on a regular basis? I don't think anyone at Verant understands the impact of this at all. It baffles me. If this bug goes unresolved until late next week, I will seriously consider simply canceling my account and waiting for another game that actually cares about all classes invovled, whether they make up 10% of the population, or 3%.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There probably wont be an emergency patch to fix them though so just group for a week or something like that.<P>Had this been the problem do you honestly think it would be fixed at next patch? Or would have an emergency patch been made?<P>The people at Verant certainly know nothing about bards if they think breaking our drums won't affect us enough to call for an emergency patch.  So our groups in the planes can be fried by the Maestro and other nasty things because our MR songs powered by drums don't work.<P>I have come to terms with being the weakest class on Norrath against the NPCs, of coarse we are one of the most powerful classes PVP(maybe not when we cant twist MR over 200). I for one though am not going to whine about this in our post just suggest that you give Bards a little attention for once.  Frankly we get bored of hearing how Rangers or Pallys got something big this patch or how lvl 60 Pallys and Rangers Dis was upped to 5 minutes and bards up to 4?<P>Try to play in our shoes for once, especially now that they are almost as slow as normal people.  You have no idea how many times now that I sit and say "why could I not have made an enchanter or any other character besides this lame bard that hits for 31max melee and 23 max with our dd with my friends hitting for around 100 melee and well if your a ranger your certainly doing more than 23dmg with magic."

</FONT><HR>Absor, perhaps the best analogy I can make is this:<BR>If my druid's speed in casting an  evac spell were reduced by an error in coding, my group and I would be much more likely to die.<P>If my bard's speed from her MM drums is removed, so that she now moves as though she were running naked on a CR, she is much more likely to die; if the group is also depending on her Selos to get them out of danger (and at lower levels quite often that is the case) my group and I are much more likely to die.<P>DRUM EFFECTS ON SELOS ARE A DEFINING ELEMENT OF BARDING.<P>Perhaps the difference between my first example and my second is that the number of druids (and those who depend on them for evac's) is enormous.<P>Druids are easy to play... many druids make it up through the 50's.<P>Count the number of bards on your servers, folks... you won't find a lot over level 18 or so.<P>Why? Because bards are damned difficult to play, b/c half our songs suck wind, because too few other folks know what we can contribute to a group (my cleric friend had to explain in words of one syllable to his group last night why they DID want a bard... and the group ranged from 28-33).<P>We don't constitute a critical mass, do we, Alan? So we get to wait... a week? two weeks? how long?  Not enough of us for OUR problems to matter... HOW LONG did it take for them to listen to us at all on any of our issues?<P>There are a lot of WONDERFUL improvements in this patch, from the discipline upgrades to the hybrid casting/melee fix. For those I am grateful for my ranger and for my friends who appreciate these upgrades.<P>But I am furious at the cavalier "you're not important enough for us to worry about fixing this major and highly destructive nerf" attitude toward bards.<P>Finally, how important is the difference between drum and no drum Selos?<P>Well, how many of you would accept a level 24 SoW if you could get a level 49 SoW?  I can attest to the fact that the difference for my bard at 28 between no drum and MM drum is nearly that great.<P>Would you accept wizzie and druid evac spells taking as long as regular port spells?  That's about the difference we're talking about here.<P>If you've never played a bard, you really just don't get it.<P>Alan, you just don't get it, and neither do any of the other decisionmakers there, I'm afraid.<P>Marithea Hawkheart (nee Sparrowhawk)<BR>Kelethin-Xegony<BR>Soldiers of Fortune</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I just started my Bard and he's only level 5, but I agree.  This is ridiculous.  I've fought with Bards many times and without thier drums, thier gonna get screwed.  That's like capping my warriors taunt at 1 or taking away half his AC.  He wouldn't be able to tank effectively at all.  This is devistating to the Bard class and there is NO reason to let this go until the next patch.  I realize that bugs get by programmers.  That's fine, but to not fix a bug that will seriously effect hundreds of players when you already know about it is lazy and irresponsible.  Apparently you even knew about it before the patch which is just plain stupid.  I'm certainly glad that this is the only service I get from you.  I would never accept this from any other company I subscribe to.  I guarantee you that if my phone company or power company or bank had this kind of attitude, they would've lost my business a long time ago, along with probably everyone elses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is for all the people saying we are whining about it, it isnt a big deal, and "Opps they made a mistake dont bite their head off."  This bug was on the test server before it went live.  I know this for a fact because a week ago some of the Test bards posted over on the Concert Hall that Selo's was bugged over there and they hoped it didn't go onto the live servers.  They told the GM's it was bugged.  Verant knew about this bug before it even went live.  But hey, what do you know, it went onto the live servers anyway.  Why even have a test server then if you are just going to ignore your testers?<P>As far as I'm concerned you owe to us to have an emergency patch to fix this since you knew it was going into live before hand.

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with most of the above, and if you think Selo's with no drum is bad at lvl 50 or so, try it at lvl 24. I can't outrun most MOBs, especially if they are sowed. IOW, I can't play my bard until this is fixed. For those of you who don't play a bard, this line of songs isn't just something we play to cut down time crossing the Karanas, we cannot survive virtually any encounter without it. Anyway, alot of what is being said is frustration that bards have had pent up for a couple of years now. Basically, we just don't have the player base to keep issues on the front page for weeks at a time like some other *cough*Necros/Mages/Shamans*cough* classes do.

</FONT><HR>So people seem to think that bards won't suffer one bit from this other than a minor inconvenience, I will repeat as others have, this is one of our primary defenses, especially in the midlevels (20-40) where a bard solo is quite weak, and a bard in a group is almost always the first one to die when things go wrong.<P>The difference between normal selos and drum selos is as follows.<P>Mob strikes you<BR>you are stunned<BR>(equipping drum, starting selos)<BR>if lucky, make a good escape with between half life and 1hp. (Ive even crossed zonelines and fallen unconcious on the other side because the mob hit between when I hit the zone line and the loading actually started.<P>Without drum<BR>Mob strikes you<BR>you are stunned.<BR>(selos)<BR>mob strikes you (unable to make enough distance to get out of melee range)<BR>you are stunned<BR>etc<BR>etc<BR>you died.<P>The main component here is that once a bard turns his back on a creature that is even as low as the high greens, stuns are *very* frequent 50%+. For something equal level or higher, a hit is almost a guaranteed stun, which means a very dead and chain stunned bard.<P>I'm glad verant cares so much about bards that "if that's the only thing, we don't think it warrants an emergency patch" I've been pretty tolerant for the most part, even given them the benefit of the doubt for longer than I should have (fix chains? fix lullabye? etc) but it really busts me up. It was hard enough for me to get through those midlevels, and the number of times I died was hideous - I lost 2 levels once, with each and every death in a different location. I shudder to think of what myself and other bards will have to deal with until this gets fixed. Yet another example of just how little they care about bards. Even rangers got things far more trivial than this fixed in emergency patches.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Appears they didnt test snares/darkness and mage earth pets either. <P> Cast with Quacker staff, mob now snared and 1200damage dot starts to work, Mage sends in earth pet , pet casts root , dot broken root broken snare beoken. So much for root not cancelling snare/darkness.<P> Another reason the Quacker proc is a farce ; and I had just gotten to the point I thot it cud be useful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If Selo's + Drum is "The Defining feature of a bard," then Verant's doing you a favor.  Sounds like a pretty boring class, go start a Druid.<P>Seriously, yes Verant screwed up.  Yes, they probably SHOULD put up an emergency patch.  <P>They're not gonna do it.<P>Every Bard in Norrath could hop onto these boards and express their displeasure.  They probably still won't do it.  Wording "By Tunare, they made my class TOTALLY unplayable" 10,000 different ways isn't really gonna get anything done.<P>Verant made a mistake.<BR>People are unhappy.<BR>This is unusual...  how?<P>The point is, yes you all have a valid point.  Verant (or at least Absor) has obviously read it.  I've read through the entire 3-page melodrama myself.  They're not going to fix it until the next patch.  Nothing more to see here, move along.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046448&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046448&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
