</FONT><HR>There are a lot of serious problems with PVP teams as its set up, most of them can not be fixed in the current EQ system (like the geography problem).<P>In this case, I think perhaps good VS evil only (opposed to race based) is the best answers.  Good and Evil can not assist each other just like Non-PVP and PVP can't now.<P>With less factions (only 2 instead of 4) groupability will be more viable.  One big problem I see would be otherwise good races with evil factions being in serious trouble.  IE: A gnome necro, what is he supposed to do trapped in akinon when he should be on the Dark elf side?  He could not hunt without being hunted by players of his own race.<P>Would it be possible to have a double restriction with race and alignment?  IE:  shorties could never attack shorties, even if one was good and the other evil.  To be PVP you would need opposite alignment and faction.<P><BR>On a final note abashi:  For EQ2 (which I know your working on) perhaps you can start several forums, one of which would be a PVP teams forum taking suggestions on how teams should be done in the new game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm on Tallon Zek and I believe there is no reason to change things as they stand now.  I actually like the "immortal healer" concept because I believe it promotes role-play.  Why shouldn't race-traitors be allowed to help their allies?  Dark alliances and treachery have always been a part of Fantasy lore.<P>Also, I think it would be a fantastic idea to switch from race-based teams to alignment-based teams.  Your team should be chosen when you pick your God and class.  Then you could have the war between the Heretics and good classes that is talked about when you create a character.  This would do a lot to promote role-playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Option 4 and 1 combined would be the whip, in my opinion.<P>4- make the server code-wise how the players already play it: Good vs Evil. No catch-22 for paladins anymore regarding them being good and them being on a team that kills other good beings.<P>1 only goods can heal/buff other goods. Same for darks. Makes sense. However... one problem with that is that unless you allow a loophole for enchanters using illusions, they may end up losing the ability to blend a bit. So consider that.<P>Looking at option 2:<BR>2- no buff/heal if level is +/-8. Makes sense and it will totally cut down on powerleveling. However... it will also create what I think would be a problem in that a guild member of a high level would possibly have to sit by and watch a very weak member get torn apart by some others who are lower level. With no ability to help out his ally, it makes the idea of "powerful mage(etc.)" sort of meaningless unless there is a guild war going on.<P>So I think 4 and 1 would be best for now.<P>Definitely Good vs. Evil.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>D</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think that GvE server is the way to go.  I mean the servers already lean that way and I prefer it that way.  God, Race, and Class should determine who is good and who isn't.  There would need to be coding changes to allow those classified as evil to be able to earn faction and enter Evil Cities such as Neriak.  Or perhaps some way to raise faction with those cities through the home guilds.  Well thats just my two sense.  Also, there shouldn't be color difference in the names above peoples heads.  It should all be one color so we would never know who is good or evil unless we knew the name or recongized them.  <P>Kolane<P>PS.  I was reading that someone said they wondered where Rogues fit in.  I would say rogues aren't always bad but are more shady.  Rogues are the spy and assiasins of the good as well as evil.  Good is only good because they tend to live my vurtous but they aren't perfect.  <P>pps. Sorry for all my spelling error.

</FONT><HR>After looking at all the suggestions, I think the best compromise would be the following:<BR>1) Have 3-teams: good, evil and neutral.<BR> Good = current light races<BR> Evil = current dark races<BR> Neutral = any race at all.<BR>2) Membership in neutral is voluntary. I don't know whether it would be easier to make this a one-time choice, or whether switching back and forth within some limits would be practical.<BR>3) No cross-team healing or buffing. Since belonging to the neutral team would be voluntary, the loss of the ability for, say, a light race character to be healed or buffed by the "good" team would be a free choice made in return for the right to PK members of the good team.<BR>4) No out-of-range healing or buffing in PvP situations, as per Abashi's suggestion. To prevent exploits though, have this be triggered by attacking another PC, not being attacked by one.<P>This above solution would remove the Invulnerable healer exploit, allow lights the freedom they have to group together, allow those who want to PK all races, even their own race to have a team in which they could do so.<P>3-teams would allow a more complex, ****ing set of alliances and enmity, and also avoid perhaps shifting the balance too far against the dark team.<P>A little something for everyone ...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Astrael</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>The choices you have offered are (in case anyone has lost them in 5 pages of replies):<P>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<BR>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<BR>3. Combination of 1 & 2.<BR>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1 on that basis, rather than on cross-teaming.<P>I vote 4. <P>Kill off xteaming between Light and Dark races. Period. <P>As for immortal healers, I think there is a different spin on this everyone has missed so far. The benefit to being in a large, well run, old guild is that there are older folks to help you. When you go up against critters at level 20 you would love to have an older healer around to make sure you survive the encounter. Is fighting a lighty supposed to be any less dangerous than fighting the eqivalent critter? It can be annoying, but the right thing for a player to do when confronted by an immortal (+/- 8) healer is to get help and kill the healer. The primary objection most have is that you cant find anyone to kill the out of race healers. Fix that problem (prohibit xteam composition).<P>Lanath T'Vyl<BR>Wizard 51<BR>Dark Storm<BR>Vallon Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>BIG problem with the GvE thing. Think about this, what about all those "Neutral" characters? You know, Agnotsic Characters, etc. Where would you put all these "Neutral characters? Place them on G or E based on race? All and All I'd like to see it changed to a GvE pvp setting instead of the Race war bit. No have no idea how many times my DE Cleric was PK'ed by Human Necros of Innoruuk. This is actually a good idea I think, and makes much more sense. Heck I'd start playing on TZ again if that was the case. You just have to wonder about what would happen to the "Neutral" alligned characters. <P>Evil Gods: Innoruuk, Cazic Thule, Rallos Zek, and Bertoxxulous.<P>Good Gods: Tunare, The Marr Twins, Brell, Karana, Rodcet Nife, Quellious. (Mind is a bit blank)<P>Neutral Gods: Solusek Ro, Prexus, and Bristlebane. (tell me if I left any out)<P>Angonstic would deffinactly be a shady area and would probably go off of race so why bother trying to be a "Good guy" Dark elf if you'll be stuck on the Evil team if you're stuck there by race? I think those that are agnostic should have the choice of being on either team and have their Factions adjusted accordingly. Because there's no doubt at all that a "Good guy" Dark Elf would be KoS in Neriak and the other evil citys if he is a "Traitor" to the Dark Elf cause.<P>And if it's set to GvE the teams should have the advantage of better factions with those on their team. But then again, faction issues is another thread all together.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personally I think there should only be 2 teams.  One good and the other evil.  To determine who is who Race, Class, and God need to be considered.  A point system could be created to help this determination. Good Races such as elves earn 2 points, Neutral races which can swing either way such as Humans and gnomes should earn 0 points, and Evil races like trolls earn -2 points.  Next add in classes where good classes like druids earn 2 points, neutral classes like rogues or warriors 0 points, and evil classes like necros or SK earn -2 points.  Finally add gods in there with again 2 for good, 0 for neutral, and -2 for bad.  <P>When you combine all the scores anything 0 or higher is relatively good and falls on the good side.  Anything -1 and below has embraced ways of evil and should fall in on the bad side.  <P>For example a Human Warrior who is Agnostic would be good on the vitue that humans tend to be good.  <P>A gnome Necro would be evil because of his god and his class, while a gnome wizard who has also imbraced Bertoxx would also be evil.  <P>Finally, I would like to add I don't play on the pvp team server but if it was to go to GvE I think I would switch.  Also, I do believe that all the color of the names above people's heads should be the same as to provide more mystery.  Also that way reputation can be build instead of just color of who.  <P>Just my thoughts on this whole issue<P>Monolith<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>soo many people seem to believe that just because its a team pvp server, you must battle anyone not on your team at all times, i dont feel this is true.<BR>to me, the pvp servers open up roleplaying to a greater extent than the blue servers.<BR>i play a wood elf ranger on vallon zek, and am the guildleader of an all light elf only guild. but me and my guild group with members and are allied with guilds that have humans and shorties in there guild.<BR>in a realistic sense there is nothing wrong with this, why cant the human shadownight that worships Innorukk have an alliance with the Dark elf cleric that worships the same diety.<BR>what about honor among thieves? in fact there is a guild on vallon that is rogue only. all races accepted that can be rogues.<BR>there is a problem with crossteaming healers giving an advantage in pvp battles, but then in a roleplaying stance, thats why i maintain alliances and friendships with honorable guilds of the other two "lightie" teams. so if the group of trolls attacks my elven brethern in gfay, and has a highelf cleric healing/buffing them, then i call on my shorite or human team allies to come and take care of the betrayer elf!<BR>both team servers are mostly good vs evil, or lightie vs darkie. which works just fine, cause it seems quite ballanced in that respect, no one side controls the majority of the server. and even after going coin only, there is still strictly pk guilds that pk all races not there own. which adds to the realistic roleplay environment, where instead of just giving a /rude gesture to the darkelf at the bank in kelethin, now i can attack and kill this evil creature in my lands.<BR>i feel that disallowing cross team buffs at all will drastically ruin the pve environment, which is 95% of the play on the teams servers.<BR>and the time limit or zone after taking damage from pvp before anyone not on your team or in your lvl range can heal you is a good idea, but has flaws, and rude ppl will take advantage of it, for instance, im fighting a mob, and losing the battle, a much higher lvl friend of mine is nearby so i call for his help , but the rudeplayer hits me once or casts a minor offensive spell on me, just so i cannont be healed by the 9+ lvl friend , and the mob then kills me and i lose xp.<BR>i dont see any big problem on pvp teams servers right now. there are flaws, but there always will be,to handle crossteaming, you just need to make friends on at least one other of the four teams , that way that xteaming healer isnt so invulnerable!<BR>Wolfystyle Xesevoli<BR>level 35 woodelf Ranger<BR>Leader of The Elven Royal Guard<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I know people keep mentioning the agnostics, and so they prolly skipped over my post before. If you look at it, the *only* races with both "good" and "evil" deity combinations are humans, Erudites, and gnomes. Everyone else has good and neutral or evil and neutral. Thus, I proposed it would work like this<P>1. Certain races are without a doubt "evil", these being the dark elves, trolls, ogres, and Iksar(moot point-*all* Iksar are Cazic worshippers). A dark elf of Solusek Ro or Bristlebane is still gonna be an evil dark elf(the guys in Temple of Sol Ro being one of the tiny handful of exceptions).<P>2. Now, the humans, gnomes, and erudites are considered predominatly "good" races as whole, this being evidenced that thier evil members are without exception forced to live in either the sewers and back alleys of thier home city or in the case of erudites dwell in a totally seperate city. Therefore, since they are mostly good, an "neutral" would most likely be "good" guy.<P>3. Therefore, my proposal was to set the GvE flag as so. <P>When the "evil" flag is set, first Race is checked. If dark elf, ogre, iksar, or troll, you are evil.<P> *Next* Deity is checked. If Bertoxxulous, Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, or Mayong Mistmoore(ok, so only one player per server can worship Mistmoore, he at least deserves a mention=p), then the flag is set to evil.<P>Boo-yah, problem solved.

Same goes for a Human or Erudite follower of Bertoxx or Cazic. <P>Keeping them on the "Light" team is a joke. They're not good characters by design, so why in the heck should they be on the side of good? If they wanted to be good, they'd be Paladins or Clerics that follow "good" gods.<P>The setup now, and this setup-- which ignores a character's class or religion, and relies solely on race-- would be worthless as far as roleplaying goes, and makes no sense. It lets "Light" races off the hook for playing Evil classes. They essentially kill their own kind when they kill "Darks", because in the PvE they're just as evil as my DE Shadow Knight is. <P>Making VZ a Good vs. Evil server, putting the "Light" people who play Evil classes and worship Evil gods on the same side as the DE's, Ogres, Trolls and Iksar, and disallowing buffs/heals across the Good/Evil division would eliminate cross-teaming, and would be much better for both roleplay and PvP design.<P>It just makes more sense to do it this way than the way it exists now, IMO.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Don't get me wrong, using religion/race/class as a determination for which side you are on would rule.  Why not stop there, why not take all of your actions to determine which side you are on.  Killing dwarves in Butcher should plop you onto the evil side.<P>Lets look at the reality of the situation though:<BR>1. The team servers can be exploited by using invulnerable healers via the EQ code.<BR>2. PvP is a small portion of the EQ playerbase.<BR>3. Verant isn't going to dedicate the resources that would be necessary to create the ideal situation.<BR>4. A fix is needed.<BR>5. The easiest solution would be to create 2 teams, light and dark based on race and disallow xteam healing.<P>This solution would fix many problems, stop the invuln healing and would be in-line with the current server society.<P>Wise up people.  You are asking for a lot of coding changes for 2 servers.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi Abashi,<P>It is good to see that you are giving thought to the PvP servers.  I am the member of a rabid one-team PvP guild, so I think I can give an objective assessment of your options:<P>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<BR>No. Light races should have the option to ally with the other light races (although my character despises this activity)<P>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<BR>No.  Too big of a nerf to Sow/Clarity ...  Personally I find Highlevel immortal healing less noxious than xteam immoral healing.<P>3. No<P>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1.<BR>No.  Almost, but you would be completely rewriting the characters of many who are following the current 4 team philosophy.  <P>5. (Damage Flag)<BR>Yes!!!  Realize however that this switch would give much power to strict non-xteamers such as myself.  I would continue my practice of "pinging" (bashing) other team members as I run through the zone to check their level.  It is also a bit of a nerf to the priest classes (such as myself) but it would be worth it to effectively end the immortal healer hunting.  <P>Lastly, I'd like to plug a small faction change:<BR>  - Remove faction hits in the arena/duels<BR>  - Add faction hits for xteam heal/buffing during PvP (same rules as PvE).  <BR>To my mind, this seemingly small change to faction would produce the necessary penalty to Xteaming without disrupting the current gameplay. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Being a part-time game designer I have a few idea's that I think would work better than the current system.<P>Ok here's my idea for PvP rules, first of all get rid of the +/-8 lvl limit.  It is not only annoying because of 'invulnerable' healers but also when a group is attacked by a high leveler and only half the group can effect them.<P>If you are worried about a bunch of high levelers killing newbies simply implement 'protection' for chacters under 6th level(or whatever level)ie they can not engage or be engaged in pvp combat.<P>Second, faction hits should work like it does on mobs, if a high-elf heals a human fighting another high-helf it SHOULD effect his/her faction.  This will also encourage roleplaying as most will not heal or buff someone of another 'team' (whether is be light vs dark or the way teams are now) because of possible faction hits.  What high elf wants to be known for associating with a dark elf?<P>If done right faction is all you need to govern pvp rules because even if you could kill someone of your own race it would mess up your faction and you'd have no where to bank or buy food.<P>In my opinion the best rules for a pvp server should not be arbitrary rules like level limits or even teams but a complex faction system that has repercussions for certain activities (the one's that are problems on pvp servers, ie kinslaying, etc).  The problem with rules like level limits is that they can and will be ways around it or to exploit it.<P>And on a second note I do like the idea of good versus evil, except that on Faydwer there is a lack of dark races present.<P>So what does everyone think of my ideas?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Now to stop the Invunrable healer issue you will need to make the Neutral team able to attack the Light, Dark AND Neutral teams. AND disable Xteam healing/buffing for the good and evil teams. That is really the only way to stop the Invunrable healer bug without adding a heal/buff lvl range. The lvl range on buffs/heals is a bad idea, it would really hurt SOW and other spells like it, And if I bite off more then I can chew and a high lvl healer is there then I would sure like to get a heal.

</FONT><HR>First off, good thoughts Abashi.  These kind of ideas are what keep me playing.<P>Second, don't ever get rid of faction hits for killing other teams...There has to be some penalty for killing opposing team players.<P>Now, as for your original question, I like idea 4.  Good vs. Evil with no cross-teaming help allowed.  Being a Shank on VZ (barbarian only anti-crossteaming guild) there is nothing more frustrating than being in mid-fight and having a human run up and cast a damage shield on my enemy, or simply heal him up to full while there is nothing I can do about it.  So first and foremost I want to see this problem eliminated (which is your option 1).<P>But secondly I'd love to see a GvsE change.  It would be different from all other servers and really add some spice to gameplay.  It would kinda throw a wrench into what the Shanks stand for (if it revolved around religion as opposed to race), but I'd support the change.<P>Morvran the Rogue<BR>Shanks!

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, this is buried pretty deep, but I'll give my 2cp anyway:<P>The one thing that makes PvP difficult is the PvE issues with faction hits.  Take away faction hits from killing player chars and this would greatly increase the 4 team "vision".  <P>Right now I play a gnome, and I will NOT kill elves for fear of ruining my Kunark faction.  I still want to be able to use the "light" outpost.  Norrath was not set up for 4 teams.  There are no shorty outposts or human outposts, so this greatly discourages PvP between the light races, for fear of becoming KOS to the only city on Kunark available to them. Get rid of the faction hits, and I think PvP on a 4 team basis would increase tremendously.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What do I think..what I think is you guys have messed around with the PVP servers far too much already.<P>PVP, specifically, PVP teams would have had to be a thought while designing the world. Not an afterthought.<P>In order to facilitate fair and 'true team' PVP (not Good VS. Evil), each 'team' would need access to its 'own' areas, items, supplies, etc. For example, the shorties and elven teams are *constantly* *BY DESIGN OF THE ZONES* going to be at war, close to home, because there is NOWHERE for them to escape. If they stay on Faydwer, they are in continual skirmishes. If they cross the sea to Freeport they fight with the humans. While the Humans team is safe in Qeynos away from battlefields to level up faster. On the one hand, this turns out very vicious soldiers at an early age in the ranks of the shorties/elves. On the other, it allows the human team to level faster but maybe not be as PVP saavy. This is but 1 example. In order for you to have done PVP right, the shorties, elves, humans, and darkies all need 'their' areas. And everywhere else can be contested.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>9 v 4 is killing PvP on Tallon Zek. High lvl pvp is bad enough without having to fight at those odds. Sure there will always be low-mid range dark twinks, but soon the number of "light" will control all the high lvl dungeons. Making it so that the 3 "light" teams become 1 team would remove the 1 element that gives the orange team any kind of advantage. You also must consider that the Blue team is equal in strength to the Orange team (if not stronger from more available classes).<BR>  The simplest and fairest solution is the suggested fix suggested by Abashi. <BR>  I strongly suggest that someone at Verant visit the Team Zeks and do a tally of "lights" at each level vs the number of Orange team. <BR>  Another thing to understand is that it isnt GvE to Orange team; IT IS TEAMS. The "light" races added the RP excuse of GvE after the Human team (which had the power at server start) was beaten by Orange team. The remaining teams resorted to cross-teaming to stay caught up. THough Orange team never had the advantage of numbers, it made up for it in team identity. As the sheer number of slowly leveling lights enter the high lvl game, the balance of power shifts fully into the hundreds of cross-teamers that control by completely outnumbering their opponents (as would be expected when 9 races gang up on 4).<BR>  The proposed solution in NO WAY forces these allies to go to war with each other, it however does bring the added RP of living and working with your own team/race, it also prevents exploits being used to force players in the "light" teams from roleplaying their neutral or evil characters and forces them to cross-team.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First, I would like to say thanks for looking into this matter.  IMO, all the folk who are insisting that this is not a problem are probably the ones most guilty of using this exploit.<P>Personally, I do not like numbers 1 through 4.  One through three are too broad, and although I dispise cross-teaming of any kind, would be too limiting to those who wish to roleplay a more tolerant character.  Number 4 would force some folk to be on the same team with people who they have considered enemies until now.  For myself, I have an Erudite SK who absolutely despises all Iksar as blasphemers and heretics.  Just because 2 characters worship the same deity does not mean that they should get along.  I also play a barbarian Rogue who is rabidly xenophobic.  He sees Humans and Erudites as unfortunate, but races to be pitied, rather than hated, and all other raced should be eradicated as the abominations that they are.  Yes, boys and girls, he is a Shank.<P>To my mind, the best possible solution would be to impliment a damage flag.  When a player is damaged by some one, immediately (for a limited time) prevent all beneficial spells from players +/- 8 levels *of the attacker*.  Also, again for a limited time, prevent all beneficial spells from players of the attacker's team.  This senario would prevent the *immortal healer* problem, and yet minimally impact pve play. Frankly, I don't think that anyone gives a rip if a lvl 20 dwarf cleric is healing a lvl 20 ogre who is being attacked by 2 lvl 20 humans, as the humans would simply kill the dwarf in his turn.<P>Yes, there would still be opportunities for abuse, but as was said earlier, that is the price for allying yourself with the enemy.  Also, what is to keep the x-team group in question from pursuing their *driveby* attackers, aside from not being able to exploit a coding oversight?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am all for just setting up two teams instead of four, however with the current geography of Norrath, making the distinction between the two teams based on alignment is highly impractical.<P>Classes which are inherently "evil" are still available to races which are often considered good (Human Necromancer, SK, Gnome Necro)  Since they start as newbies in lighty territory, making them part of the evil team, would make life hell for them.<P>As an alternate solution, instead of calling it "Good" vs. "Evil", why not turn it into a war between political factions and still based the division on race?  <P>First faction: Alliance between all the light races consisting of Human, Barbarian, Erudite, High-elf, Wood-elf, Half-elf, Halfling, Gnome and Dwarf races.   <P>Second faction: Alliance between all the dark races consisiting of Dark Elves, Ogres, Trolls and Iksars.<P>Now you may ask, why would necromancers who serve the same god, kill each other?  Well, as you can see clearly in real history, all wars, even those based on religion or belief, ALWAYS have some political reason behind it.  And there hasn't been any lack of wars in recent history between two countries that have the same religion.<P>From another perspective, I think the evil gods wouldnt even care if their followers fought against each other. They are after all, EVIL.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think #4 is the way to go because people playing on my racewar server are already doing GvE. I never get attacked by fellow light races and always group with them.  I never see lights grouping with darks and always see them fighting.<P>I think your last suggestion would cause headaches for the light races since they are always grouping together and rarely fight each other.  I'm sure dark races would then enjoy 'tagging' light races while the lights are fighting mobs so they cannot help each other and would then have to zone to clear the tag.  And darks could do this over and over just to keep annoying people.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just my 2 cp - I really like the idea of having a Good vs Evil server with no crossteam buffing and healing.<P>The racewar aspect of the servers are interesting, but most players like myself came to play the good versus evil game.  It doesn't make much roleplaying sense for my halfelf ranger to be beating on human rangers.<P>One thought - does good versus evil mean light race versus dark race? ...good religion versus evil religion?<P>If the later is true, then does that mean that a human shadowknight and a human paladin would be on different teams?   That would be cool, though I imagine it would be somewhat hard to implement.  Also, if that is the case it would be nice to see the other religions opened up to HalfElves, like Innoruk worshiping HalfElf warriors (that exist on the blue servers).<P>At least put the Erudite Necros, SKs, and evil Clerics on the evil team since they have their own starting zone.<P>Arafas Swiftwulfe<BR>Vallon Zek Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>MY PATHETIC TALE on Tallon Zek<P><BR>Abashi-<P><BR>this is my pathtetic tale of how I have exploited the Out of range healer senario with my Level 51 druid under the pretense of "it's helping a guild member"<P>I Orinda, &lt;Level 51 Druid Human of the X guild&gt; buffed and healed a &lt;Level 7 warrior of x guild also&gt; with Skin like Nature,Sow, Chloraplast, and Damage Shield, for the sole purpose of harassing another guild B. I took this &lt;Level 7 warrior&gt; on a Pking rampage and purposefully helped harass guild B into submission, leading to the guilds breakup. I actually followed this fellow guildmate around and healed (not that they really needed it of course).<P>I was a total *****. I left those other PCs feeling cheated, angry, and resentful of me, my guild and EQ in general. It left me feeling ashamed and that I had taken a game I like very much and cheapened it.<P>It was just plain unfair. They never had a chance and I am sure you understand this already. I consider what I did as an "exploit" or "cheat". It was just plain abusing the game code to be real jerks.<P>Since that episode I have created my own Out of range healing policy and Posted it on TZ times.<P>It's very simple. If you con blue to me I can heal/buff you for the purposes of PvP. If you con green to me, I cannot help you. This is just my own personal code. But, we need real software code to help us do the right thing. Or, to help us NOT do the wrong thing.<P>What exactly to do I leave to you to figure out. This is your expertise and it's nice that you ask people what they think, but you're the expert. And, I know you want EQ to continue postively evolving like it has been. I trust you will do the right thing.<P>Orinda Druid Human Level 51<BR>Venomah Necro Dark elf level 40<BR>Badra Barb Shaman level 22<BR>Reyna High Elf Mage level 12<BR>Ashlyn Human Necro level 9<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
