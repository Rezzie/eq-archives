</FONT><HR>Replying to MacRae from original thread:<P>No words in english or phonetic representations?  To be extreme, "A" is a word in this language.  I assume that the letter "A" could be used.  My name has "ale" in it (with no reasonable way to interpret it as referring to the beverage); does that count?  "Vendarkas" has THREE english words in it, even in a row; does that count?  And those are just the REAL words, not even getting into phonetics....<P>See where I'm going with this?

</FONT><HR>THAT is totally and utter BS, if that is what happened.  Tigergirl is a phrase?  Well so is Dances With Wolves, or Boy-Strength-of-Blue-Horses (for reference to that name, I suggest reading the book "Knots on a Counting Rope" by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault. )<P>Just because classic "European" names aren't phrases doesn't mean that the above "Native American" names are any less valid.  I DO understand having to lose Piddlemaker.  Although that's a DRASTIC form of censorship, if enough people are offended, then fine.  But Tigergirl?  Having to change this is not only wrong but very narrow minded.  <P>- Vorrek, 52 SK, Quellious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Vorrek- You're absolutely right.  And you can't have any of those names in EQ either.

</FONT><HR>The key to consistency is not in the policy itself, but in the application of the policy.  The policy needs to be ambiguous to a degree for two reasons -<P>1)  To allow some room for judgement calls.  Ideally these calls are made by the same person, who takes time to ensure they are judging things consistently.<P>2)  So it's understandable by players.  This isn't a contract so to speak, it needs to be readable by people other than lawyers :)<P>I work with these types of issues regularly at present.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, clarify this for me, since I'm a bit confused after reading the log.  Is Tigergirl an actual animal?  If it is, then the name should be restored (although the last name was definately offensive  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">)  If it is not, then yep, it's a phrase and had to go.  BTW, the "make a phrase" rule was added on not too long ago...  If the player's name was given before the rule change, I think VI will let the name be grandfathered in (don't quote me on that though, not completely positive about the grandfathering thing).  As for getting it changed by Akriss or Absor, I seriously doubt it, mostly because of the attitude that you pitched at the GM then posted logs here.<P><BR>Tigergirl, like Managirl, is against the naming policy and should be changed.  Don't like it?  tough, it's VI's policy and VI's servers and you do what they say or you leave (as per the EULA that you agree to every time you click "I accept")<P><BR>&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Vorrek, <P>While I understand that you consider forcing the name change as "totally and utter BS" and you are entitled to your opinion, it still goes that the rule exists and the GM can (and did) enforce the rule.<P>FACT OF THE MATTER: Phrases are not legal in EQ. It don't matter one hoot where they make sense outside of EQ. In EQ, they ARE illegal.<P>Descriptive Compound word AS SURNAMES are legal.<P>So since, in context of multi-work names, Tigergirl is not a surname and is a phrase and therefore by the rules, its illegal.  Had it been her surname, well then is it a phrase or is it a descriptive compound word.  Enter the ambiguity. Enter the area of discretion for GM's.  Some can be forced to be changed, some can be allowed, totally subjective.<P>Anyone who has an emotional response, like Vorrek, is human but it doesn't change the reality of EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do not wish to debate if the name is right or worng. Personally, I see no problem with the name tigergirl, especially since there are people running around on my server with names like Horny Humperleg.<P>My problem is that both names were approved by another GM on a previous occasion. I can understand a new person being asked to change their name if it is inappropriate, but a player who has invested so much time in their character is very inappropriate.<P>We need a system in place to protect older players. Perhaps once a character requests a surname, a GM can reveiw the first and last name, and once approved CANNOT be changed, except for a last name change in the case of marriage or divorce. Period, no exceptions. If a GM does not have sufficient judgement capacity to decide if a player's name is appropriate, then they should not be performing those duties. If this happened to me, I would be offended too, unless my name was totally inappropriate.<P>On the topic, why aren't people with really offensive names being dealt with. I have seen Horny Humperleg, Nodrah, Abigfatdyke, Stinky*****, well you get the idea. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Several people have implied that the fact that you have the name for a long time is some sort of permission from Verant to have a particular name (I confess adult-style amusement at your first name, Cravin, though it would have bothered me had I seen it in-game).  However, the reason that these names stick around so long is simply because nobody petitioned it.  That doesn't mean that nobody was bothered by it (there are many people who don't bother to read manuals and don't know what /petition or /report mean) and would have *liked* to see it changed after being offended.  Also, unless I'm completely wrong, even when you /petition a GM yourself, they don't see your full name (just like when you get a tell in-game or look at a /who list) but rather just see your first name.  The same applies even to a GM in-zone that never actually sees you "in person."<P>I know, I know...The old saying "If the cops didn't catch me, it's not illegal" is sure to pop into people's heads, and it's true to the extent that you can go a long time (sometimes forever, I'm sure) without getting caught.<P>I'm curious though, Cravin.  How did you respond when your last name was changed/removed?  I'm sure it bothered you somewhat, but did you come on message boards and decry the horrible GM that changed it, or start doing /petition in-game to whine about it?  I had a friend who had a name that was questionable (though not offensive or an obvious violation).  We even talked about it.  He said that if a GM ever came to him, he would just nod and offer up a new name (he had one in mind) to use instead.  I guess this would be the difference between being mature and easygoing and being whiney and abrasive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Descriptive compound words are allowable as surnames.  They are also allowable as first names (or the rule would not read "ESPECIALLY as surnames", it would read "ONLY as surnames), but there is no way to tell from the rule what descriptive compound words would be allowed as a first name and what ones would not.  <P>To say that these are phrases and hence not allowed, utterly ignores the fact that the second part of the rule is an explicit EXCEPTION to the "phrase" rule, and to continue to repeat this just displays the posters' innate lack of English reading comprehension skills.<P>This is the only rule, as I read them, that applies, all other ridiculous arguments to the contrary.  And it is so wildly ambiguous and wide-open to subjective implementation that all of the people posting that these names "obviously violate the rules" are just rationalizing their own dislike for the names themselves.<P>It isn't at ALL obvious.

Anytime a name came into question send it to the name guy. No other information but the name. No possibility of favortism. Simple up/down ruling. Player petition automatically routes it to the name guy. GM's cannot do it. And once given the nod by the name guy the name may not be placed in double jeopardy. Names's reviewed are placed in a database approved or disapproved, and identical names submitted for review are checked against this database b4 bothering the name guy.

Rather than the current system, where players are required to use some discretion in choosing their names, and when overstepped and noticed by another player, those names are sometimes (very rarely, really, in the cosmic scheme of things) removed by GMs, you want a system where someone can come up with something that the rule didn't think of, and it can be very offensive to some people, and they get to *keep* it because the rule is not subject to interpretation?<P>It is better to be right than to be good, in your world, huh?<P>Perhaps a system such as what Amethyr proposes is a better solution to consistency, but really... it wouldn't be an issue if people didn't feel the need to push the rule in the first place.  If we had to take it so far, that one person ended up spending all their time making such decisions... I would argue that one possible consequence would be not just to have the name removed, but the character deleted.  If people are going to insist on creating work, they should have something at stake.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, as I have stated before (I think I have, at least obliquely), I don't think Tigergirl should have been a problem.  I thought it was MADE a problem when the fellow was obstinate, particularly regarding his last name which could easily be considered offensive (or at least very inappropriate to the setting).  This probably caused the GM/guide to interpret the rules far more strictly than would ordinarily be the case.<P>I wouldn't have any problem with someone reviewing this, deciding that Tigergirl is fine, and reinstating the name.  This, of course, would also obviate any "real" complaint since the first name is the one which all of a player's friends are going to look for.<P>I've admitted that, being human, the VI official in this case overreacted.  I don't think the person should be fired or even disciplined, because the frustration is understandable (counseling in this case *would* be appropriate).<P>I do have a problem with people trying to justify the last name (which is what I was piling in on in the first place), and nobody can convince me that Piddlemaker is appropriate or in keeping the naming policy.<P>Having one (more likely at least three people, considering that this is a 24/7 experience) or more people specifically responsible for checking names that are /petition'ed would be ideal, with the database of approved names as suggested.  Of course, this would STILL not get rid of any problems with people getting their names changed at high levels, both because of the ability to level very quickly (heard of powerleveling?) and because it is possible the name will take that long to be noticed by someone willing to do a /petition.  It *would* ameliorate the possibility of one GM saying yes and another saying no.<P>That being said, there are still a couple more issues.  The first is this:  How often is this happening?  How often is a level 30+ character being forced to change their name due to a violation?  My speculation would be that it isn't very often.  Further, this is only a subset.  How often are ANY characters being forced to change their names?  This is the question that would have to be answered by VI in terms of deciding whether adding people to the staff just to handle this one issue.  The second issue is WHO are these people who are violating the naming policy, and why should Verant be so solicitous to people who are going out of their way to break the rules?<P>Let's say I manufacture a VCR that people like to open up and modify/remove the Macrovision (copy protection) chip(s) from it so that they can copy videotapes easily.  How much technical support/customer service am I going to give them when they come to me having broken something in the VCR, *despite* the fact that I informed them in the warranty that once they opened the case it was no longer covered?  I would suggest that these people would be way down my list of customers that I am concerned about, and I would rather offer better support to my customers NOT trying to break the rules.<P>I think that, despite the fact these people get focal on the message boards, the people who are purposely trying to break/evade the naming policy are a small minority and should not be rewarded with extra attention from players in-game and Verant, which is probably what they are seeking in the first place.  (Of course, I haven't been helping that, have I?)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  That's at least part of the reason that I simply /petition and move on when I see an offensive name, without engaging the d00d in conversation about why I don't like his/her name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>by the way, is anyone here aware of the common meaning of the conjunction "or", as in "or more than two words?"  Some people are under the impression that it has the same meaning as "and", which would make it a required part of the description... rather than one possibility.  The example Ontop is two words, just to drive this home.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, my guess is junior high must of just got out, from the quality of the new posts.<P>We all go through our phase of immaturity and indiffence to others (known as adolescence) but some of us grow out of it. Unfortunately some do not, as just get there kicks out of harm to others, whether is civil harm like offensive language or criminal harm like assault and battery.  <P>I am moralistic.  Amazing how when you say in with venom, you can make it sound like a bad thing.  But to not offend and to request that those who do offend, cease and desist in my presence makes me a moralist, then a moralist I am.<P>In my judgement fun ceases to be had when people are offended, for any reason, by the actions of others.  And EQ is meant to be fun.  And its meant to be nice (except perhaps the PvP servers).  Unfortunately, that's can't be enforced completely.<P>Objectively, changing "Tigergirl Piddlemaker" is required for the exact reasons the GM gave.<P>Subjectly, I wouldn't have a problem with the phrase / DCW "Tigergirl", but if asked, I would vote negatively on "Piddlemaker" on distasteful grounds.  I say distasteful because offensive is a little to strong a characterization.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nictamer,<P>If you read my posts carefully you would see that my position is that "Tigergirl" is both a phrase (by virtue of being two words used in one expression) and a DCW (which has no definition, but by example, as you illustrated, it matches a certain pattern of word usage, i.e. two word concatenated together to express a single idea)<P>The point of that is that it is both legal and illegal at the same time. That makes no sense.<P>Therefore, when logic can not prevail, judgement must step in.  Judgment is subject to one's personal bias, interpretation of the rule, and precedence.  The GM probably used all three.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
