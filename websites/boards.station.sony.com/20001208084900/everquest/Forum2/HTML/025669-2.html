Someone has a name that, while not being at all offensive, you have to petition just because it doesn't live up to your high standards? Just because you find it stupid? What a crock...<P>Why can't you just play the game and leave other people alone? So someone wants a name like mrmojo risin, so what?? That's his choice I believe, not yours.<P>And please, do away with the "fantasy name" crap... when was the last time you or anyone else you know actually roleplayed? Yet you'll force a fantasy name on other people? Sheesh...<P>"I've seen some prety lam names and that deserves to get changed"<P>Yeah ok a name like 'farkyas', fair enough that'd deserve to get changed. But 'mrmojo risin'? Lame to you, but not to him. And it is HIS character, after all. Why should he have to pick a name for HIS character that YOU don't find lame?<P>Honestly, I feel like throwing up amid some of the responses that this thread has attracted :\</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off: The Naming Policy is far from perfect.  The policing of names is not very effective at identifying violations early in the characters lifespan.<P>MrMojo-I really hope that you decide to quit playing.  If you do understand the concept of role-playing you chose to not follow it.  You are a very good copy cat.  You decided to take something from the real world and insert it into a fantasy role-playing environment.  You clearly violated the Naming Policy. End of story.  <P>Disrupting areas in the game singing songs is definitly not part of role-playing.  I hope that you are able to gather together a large number of players that agree with you and all boycott the game due to the Naming Policy.  You will be doing not only me, but many other players a favor.<P>By reading the posts of others that replied to your origional post, I have to agree-I'm glad that they 'caught up with you'...your name does not belong in Norrath-Learn to live by the rules, or leave the game disgrundled because you are spoiled, and the Guides didn't cater to your un-origional name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They have been so successful in reducing the amount of player dissatisfaction in regard to offensive or inappropriate names that it's a foregone conclusion that all Verant games will have one,   though they may be enforced under different rules depending on the game.<P>I'm sorry that you feel that your change was inappropriate, and am equally sorry that it wasn't caught sooner in your characters life, however we've committed to enforcing the naming policy for the betterment of all the players.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, a response from Abashi!  Too bad I'm on my way out...<P>I want to thank everyone for their support in game and on the board.  I'm sorry there are others that feel it is their duty to report people with names that are not offensive in any way and yet somehow not "fantasy".  The concept of role-playing is so subjective and Verant's application of their policy so inconsistent, I'm afraid it does more harm than good.  I have seen at least 5 threads in the last two days regarding the naming policy, and none of them were in its praise.<P>Well, thank you Verant for a wonderful game, I have enjoyed 6 months with some very fun characters.  I'm sorry Verant as a whole is so clueless when it comes to customer service.

Wow, that is very sad.&lt;&lt;<P>It's not surprising that it didn't occur to you that perhaps someone DID notice it, and didn't know they were supposed to (*yes*, I said "supposed to") petition it, or didn't have time, or whatever. Or, perhaps someone that would've caught the reference to The Doors didn't notice your name (with presumably 5000+ characters (not accounts) on each server, it's impossible to see every name). Or, perhaps someone petitioned it, but no GM's were on, and the petition was deleted before it was read.<P>There are so many factors playing into why it took so long for your name to be petitioned. It's not as cut-and-dry as you're trying to make it out to be ("Well, of all the people that have ever seen my name, it took 22 levels for it to be reported").<P>&gt;&gt;Not only is the game run by immature, heavy-handed, power-happy thought police, but it is populated by it as well?&lt;&lt;<P>Verant has set down rules that you must abide by in order to play their game.

Yet nobody until that sullen afternoon took 'offense' to my name.  So stuff the so-called rules.<P>Mr. Mojo Risin is rearranged from Jim Morrison.  So somebody was unique enough to take the name and actually play the part.  Not too many of those, even with the purple names that claim to be role-players.  If he was spamming the zones, one could always have turned off shouts for a bit or just asked him to stop.  What a novel concept... unless most people's lack of social skills in real life carry over onto a game.<P>And to answer another's post replying to my first, Jim Morrison and Axl Rose are (were) not exactly known for following the rules.....<P>Too bad you were not on Bristlebane server Mrmojo - it would have been a blast jammin' duets together.

Why can't they simply add those that are having a little fun with their character to their ignore list and be on their up-tight little way?

</FONT><HR>I do see how it's important for the players to help the GM's police the names of characters.  However, it's clear that a lot of players abuse the /petition command, when they think someone's done them wrong, or when they just don't like the sound of someone's name.  So Mrmojo's not really in keeping with the RP aspect of this game, but really, who is??  How many of you truly roleplay?  He seems like he was trying.<P>I think they gave us the power to /petition names like Wansompuss (yes, he being the only name *I've* ever petitioned...after he came up to me and said "hee hee, baby, gimme some puss!").  Not people who are having fun with their names, and really, truly, not hurting anyone.  How was Mrmojo hurting anyone with his name?  He wasn't.  <P>Sure, he was out of step with the official Naming Policy.  And really, that's up to Verant.  <P>But it's up to *us* to NOT be babies and cry to the GM whenever a name reminds us of our dead cat or an old popsinger.  Show some backbone.  Don't abuse your /petition power.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That is probably why your randomly generated names are being rejected.<P>(And about the name Ifurita:  That is Japanese for efreet, so probably not a technical violation of the naming policy.  Similarly, I knew someone who had named their character Talia and feared that it might be changed until we convinced him it was a perfectly ordinary name.

</FONT><HR>Bah, in the immortal words of GrollerDaBard:<P>"It's over.  Let it go."  ;-)<P>About the Draconian reference, it is indeed referring to an ancient Greek lawmaker in Athens named Draco.  His laws were ruthless, and punishments severe.  If any of you are familiar with the Code of Hammurabi, the Draconian Code is just as cruel, if not more so.  I can't give examples from the Draconian Code, as I don't remember, but as an example from the similar Code of Hammurabi:  If you are a builder, and a building you have built falls and kills a man, you shall be put to death.  If it kills the man's son, so shall your son be put to death.  If you are caught stealing, your hands will be cut off.  <P>Thus, when you hear someone mention Draconian policies, it means rules that are overly cruel and unbalanced.
