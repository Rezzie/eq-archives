</FONT><HR>Back in beta, they had just brought up these neat new zones called Rivervale and Misty Thicket.  Great! I'll start a halfling rogue away from the crowds of Qeynos!  So, I take this newbie rogue into the thicket and start exploring.  Whack a few rats, etc.  Find this neat wall stretching across the zone with these neat towers.  Oh look!  Ladders!  I guess I just run into them and look up, and yes... I'm climbing...<P>*plop*<P>You are bleeding to death.<BR>You are bleeding to death.<BR>LOADING PLEASE WAIT!<P>Then the machine locked up and everytime I loaded back in I bled to death and crashed again.

</FONT><HR>Well after spending Hours trying to find my way out of Neriak as a level nothing DE cleric, I get into Nektulos to try and find my way around.  I find this bridge and the water looks very dangerous.  So, I see another player sitting on the bridge so I ask him, "Is the water safe to swim in?"  He responds, "Only one way to find out.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">"  So, being the newbie I am, I dive off the bridge into the water.  The first few seconds were no problem.  It is when I finally notice the big fishies with monster teeth that happens to be gnawing on my butt is when things went bad.  Oh yea, this is also when I found out you can not swim backwards in EQ.  hehe.<P>Also, another time, I see someone yell out in Nektulos that they need a Bind.  Well, not knowing what Bind Affinity was, I think he need a Bind Wounds.  Maybe he is hurt.  Please keep in mind that I was a cleric at the time.  So I shout out, "I can bind you".  he meets me at the entrance to Neriak and I commence to binding his wounds.  Did not even consider casting Heal on him.  Anyways, he keeps moving around and I say, "I can not bind your wounds if you keep moving".  hehe.  That is when I learned about the Bind Affinity spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About a week after release of EQ, I had made a High Elf Paladin on the E'ci server.  I met with some mid-level teens wizard who offered to give me some items to start me on my journey.  I remember him giving me a mino axe.  I went out and started killing in gfaydark newbie grounds.  After a bit, I noticed you can throw the mino axe.  I thought, well this is cool, I can keep throwing these axes at a distance.  I put it on throwing slot, I throw it, it misses and is now gone.  I was like ***!  I run around trying to find it on the gorund while some orc pawn beats on me.  I was low on life and thought, hey...I can use Lay on Hands cause I'm a Paladin!  I go through my abilities (while still being hit) get Lay of Hands up....hit the button quickly in frustration and BAM...sparkles fly everywhere and I thought I was healed...oops I casted it on the orc  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I first started, I created a bard.  Made it all the way to level 4 until I got Percussion skill.  Actually got a drum from some bard guild quest, but didn't know what to do with it.  It wasn't until level 5 that someone told me about buying and using songs... hehe  It took me a week to get that far too, no wonder...  I also learned how to drink... hehe<P>Then after learning Selo's Accelerando (I ran around GFay shouting, "I'm flying!!!  Woooo!!!!") I started exploring other zones.  While exploring, I accidentally wandered into Mistmoore (at level 5 mind you).  As I walked down the slope at the entrance, not paying attention to all the corpses at the zone, I noticed some group fighting a gargoyle.  As I watched them, I remember thinking, "Wow, now those are pros, just look at them working together!"  Then I walked a little further and saw this blue woman in full armor.  "Oooh, a blue woman!"  She begins to cast a spell, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  I never ever went back to recover my corpse.<P>A couple of days later, I was unable to get on to my server (Quellious).  I went into the chat room and complained loudly to the poor GM's in there that, "What was I going to do?  I must play!"  They asked me what level I was.  Hmm, level 5, why don't you try the E'ci server.  "But I'm LEVEL 5!!!!  It could take weeks!!!"<P>So I started an erudite wizard on E'ci, just to try something different.  Got to level 3 or 4 when I decided that it was too confusing.  Alteration?  Evocation?  Divination?  I don't have enough skill points, and what do they do anyway???  So I gave all my (extremely skimpy) equipment and money to another newbie wizard that was there and got him drunk... hehe<P>So I figured I'd stick with the bard and created a new one, just like the old one.  And I still play him today!<P>Just for a kick, a few months ago I logged back on to Quellious to see if the original Olgwin was still there.  Level 5, some cloth armor, a couple of rusty weapons, grand total of maybe 5gp AFTER selling everything... hehe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

At that time you could heal or buff anything includeing MOBS (when they nurfed that it really seemed to kill the one RP thing you could do in the game oh well) needless to say my group was quite ticked off as the orc now at full health proceeded to beat our brains out.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
