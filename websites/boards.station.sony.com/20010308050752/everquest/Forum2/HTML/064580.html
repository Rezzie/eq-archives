</FONT><HR>Ok granted I chose TWO of the four(I think) possible racial mixes(halfling, and woodelf), I played BOTH to the 12 hour /played time limit. I DIDN"T group, as the post stated she didn't group, and I used EVERY quest I could find to RACE to level 16. I could NOT break the level 16 before 12 hours /played. I got to level 7 almost 8 with the Wood elf, and 6 nearly 7 with the halfling. <BR>    I used EVERY tactic I know from leveling a druid to 41, including an accidental quad kiting of Orcs, LOL you shoulda seen it. I got a pity buffing on the way to sell/buy spells/train in guild once and looked later to see I had str of earth, skin like stone and sow. I had 8 orcs on me, something odd about the test server, the orcs on orc hill aggro ANYTHING that heals(I was using FIRST level heal spell, the one you are "born" with) and the trains can be SPECTACULAR(think MISTMOORE or Kedge Keep). But with a damage shield and my AOE I managed to get all but ONE dead, the guards had to off him.<BR>  She also said she NEVER died, well, more power to ya, with BOTH of my trials, I died, the Halfling made it to 4 without leaving town, she was about 5 and half b4 she died. The Woodelf got a MASSIVE orc train just after her FIRST accidental quad at level 6, it was QUICK and painful, about 8 or was it 10 orcs with NO sow.<BR>  Now I did NOT try a Human druid, there might be quests that help the rush to 16th, but the stats STINK, and I was going for a test server druid that would be PLAYABLE after this test race to 16th, and I also do NOT know the quests in the Qyenos area that well.<BR>  Just to let you know, I tried it, maybe I SUCK at leveling, and maybe there is MORE to eq than rushing to hell levels to SIT and Root the dorf, dot the dorf, sit/med, loot the dorf *YAWN* Repeat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You can join a group and meet new people.<P>But if that isn't your style you can try these exciting things with your new druid:<BR>-"Accidentally" train a group.<BR>-Time some spawns, port to another class's quest mob, track it, then kill it right under their nose, and port out to the next timed spawn.<BR>-Demand 50pp for a port but also not offer to pay anything for a rez.<BR>-Hover around a named spawn area with a cool drop and just make the much lower level guys nervous.<BR>-Brag about the latest addition to your class you got in the last patch.  Brag about how this will make you even more effective at doing the things above than you were before.<P>If you do these things the reaction from other people will be priceless.

</FONT><HR>To the poster that thinks I do NOT play a druid, re read and note that I play a level 41 druid on Fennin Ro. YES I know most of the power gaming skills.<BR>  I used a certain set of rules, that the original post set up, NEW server meaning NO existing friends, NO twinking and NO begging for stuff(as per the original post statements). So discounting PLing(never ASKED for buffs, but did NOT turn off any that were given without asking for them, and DID thank the giver kindly), and twinking to hunt low reds, I don't see how. That doesn't mean it CAN'T be done, just I tried, TWICE so, I will see how long it DOES take to get to 16th.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are many things you can do to have fun in the game. I see nothing wrong with Speed Leveling. I think it can be interesting one or two times. After that it's like "what's the point?" <P>I personally don't care about leveling as much as I did two years ago. I have sort of time frames in mind but I don't HAVE to level to have fun. I don't have to get rich or gather items. (Though another fun way to play is see how well you can build up a character with out really playing it. Eeek Twinkage!)<P>Way to go to the speedlevelers!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The funniest thing about getting powerleveled, is the fact that while you've gotten to level 46+ in just a small amount of time, your offensive and defensive skills suck.<BR>There is no way you can possibly get all of your skills up to the level you've attained. In fact, it's impossible.<P>So while you can all gloat saying "I got a level 50 Druid in 2 hours", I will sit back a laugh. Sure, he's "listed" at level 50, but you're fighting at level 12, and you'll probably die hundreds of times because you thought levels meant something.<P>Instead of playing this game like a friggin race, why don't players just sit back and enjoy it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok this was a test, after reading of another that said she made 16 druid in 12 hours /played. I went into this with one attitude, follow the "rules" she stated (NEW server, take anything given but do NOT ask, use quests or ANYTHING to level As FAST as possible). This was a diversion from my normal mode of playing.<BR>  I DO tend to solo, quite a bit, BUT I am social, that is what OOC and shout are for, and /who can show you /who is in zone hunting when you are. I make friends and ususally MY spawn time and theirs mesh rather well, when medding/waiting on a spawn we /tell or OOC or whatever. <BR>   It is fun to go on the odd raid. I went on a Kedge Keep raid with Atani(great folks to hunt with FYI), but it was for Learning and FUN only, I got next to NO xp(for three hours hunting LESS than a blue bub), and VERY little loot. So while it was WILD fun, it is not something I could do ALL the time. If I did, I would still be around level 15 or so.<BR>  And Yes I do the /ooc level XY Druid LFG, about 6 times in several zones(OT, BW, or EW come to mind) BUT I hunt WEIRD hours(somedays it is ALL day from about 3 PM to 3AM ish, and somedays it is 8am to about 3PM ish), with irrgular hours you can NOT get a regular group going. Not a whine, just a fact.<BR>  I did group up with a level 47 ranger(or was she the 48?) and a level 48 druid(or was he the 47?) from Sterling order of Knights the other day, they were GREAT fun, and quite the education. But they had to log, after about 5 or 6 hours I couldn't complain about it at all, but I didn't see them on latter that day. I do hope to run into them, but it might not happen.<BR>  In other words, I group whenever I can, but that is NOT that often. I have learned to adapt and cope.<BR>   The MAIN point was I tried the test. I am interested in others that try it. I would like to know the name of the server, the /played time to level 16, the race and if they followed the NO twinking NO begging rule. The test was NOT normal, it was a "scientific" test, for information for myself, and I chose to share that info with yall. Take it or leave it, your choice.<BR>The "rules" for those that wish to do the test are:<BR>1. NEW server, do NOT tell friends you are moving and ask where they play when not on your favorite server and go there for handouts.<BR>2. NO twinking and NO begging.<BR>3. level as fast as possible.<BR>4. She and I both used druids, under the assumption that they are the "easiest" to level. But for the "further /played to level 16 race" I would like to see OTHER classes try it. I love debunking myths, help me prove the myths wrong.<BR>5. if you have PLAYED this class to level XX(I would say over 20) and know advanced skills/tactics with this class, by ALL mean use them. I was "kiting" firebeetles with my halfling druid at level 5, and had an accidental quad kiting with orcs on my Wood Elf druid at about 6th level. Basically if it is NOT twinking or begging and it works DO it(as long as it is not breaking a rule of the test or the PnP rules, or other EQ rules).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok... didn't see the original post... but am I to understand that someone is upset about cheezy druids getting to lvl 16 in 12 hours?  <P>Give me a break folks.  Power levelers are power levelers it doesn't matter what class they play.  My husband regularly gets tired of whatever he's playing an starts a new charactor.  Last week it was an Inky Warrior.  Lvl 18 in under 10 hours.  He wanted to be able to play with one of my charas who was lvl 20.  If you know what you are doing anyone can do it.  Should they?  Why not?  If you get tired of your lvl 43 warrior and want to play a pally for a change but your friends lowest charactors are low 20's... you do what you need to to catch up with them.  Lets face it.  We've all killed enough rats to know that lvl 3 is not a lvl to 'enjoy'.. it's a lvl to get thru so that you can get to a lvl where you can group and have fun.  <P>18 months ago I went on vacation... camp.. no phone, no electricity, no computer, no EQ.  It was horrible! (j/k).  But my lvl 20 at the time friends decided that they missed having a druid in the group.  So one of them camped his bard for a couple days and made a druid.  He was our lvl when I got back.  So what?  <P>I think some of you take this stuff way too seriously.  It's just a game!  *oooooh sacrilige* It's a fun game where you get to meet lots of different people from different countries.  Some of them are lame... some of them are great.  Some of them roleplay (YEAH!)... some of them don't.  But it's just a game.  <P>Suzaku<BR>Order of the Dragonkin<BR>Morrel-Thule   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For me it was a test, a challenge that did not beat me like the red headed step child that I truly am(yes red head and with a step mom, IRL). Maybe I am truly a science NERD that likes to set up a "scientfic challenge" complete with "rules" to follow.<BR>YES it is PAINFULLY easy ON THE SAME SERVER to PL your own BRAINS out, get another account and another system and role up whatever you want PLed and use your druid to do the dirty for you.<BR>BUT the test race requires that this is NOT the case, and that NO preexisting "friends" or "guildmates" were along to assist in the race.<BR>  The original poster said "I went to another server, where NO one KNEW me"(and went on to say something about SHAMED about Giving into rolling up a druid, like it was something "dirty" or horrid to do). She STRESSED that she started out NAKED with NOTHING and was at 16th level in 12 hours of playtime, and "kiting dorn at 15".<BR>So I followed her rules. Maybe I got too much time on my hands, and just MAYBE level 40 to 42 got TOO tedious and I wanted to get the CRAP nocked outta me by an orc pawn again(LOL YEAH right and Oasis was FUN ROFLOL)<BR>BUT I would like to see others honestly try this, and see which truly DO run to 20ish fastest. YES my druid is/was/ever will be faster and EASIER to play than my mage. But I would also like to know of others that have done the Zero to 16 in 12 hours /played, and what server,class, and race, Just for the info.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Maybe some of you are exagerating maybe some of you arnt.  that 50 in 9 hours was *impressive*.  But heres my point: when i first started i couldnt find my a** out of town in 9 hours.  Leveling is a skill and we tend to level quickly to points we have been before.  i dont think you are going to be able to adjust that out.  But once we hit that wall... its guess and check baby thats the game.  If someone got to 16 in 10 hours their first time playing THAT would be a broken class. Classes have different walls too.  Some levels are a pain for some... some arnt.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
