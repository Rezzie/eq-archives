</FONT><HR>Well, then chickenlegs' point is correct in essense, a_monk00, but a) ridiculous, b) numerically incorrect and c) not a monk issue.<P>That is like saying our class suffers a "lure based damage spells penalty" because wizards have lure based damage spells!<P>Also then his numbers are wrong (IMHO), hence everyone assuming he misunderstood it.  As I understand it everyone is now at 1.0 (in effect through the "compensation" bonus on exp awarded) with warriors/rogues at 0.95 or 0.9 or whatever.  NOT 20% which was the old monk penalty (1.2 modifier) over base.<P>Now, are we all agreed that this is not a monk balance issue (but rather a general game mechanics issue for 12 of the 14 classes)?  Ok, back to monks then.<P>Lythe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the rogue/warrior bonus.<P>I'm think it's safe to say Verant wanted to get rid of the bonus when they revamped their experience system (didn't they even say the bonus should be removed but they couldn't?).  If they had there would have been nuclear flames crying NERF from the rogues and warriors.<P>I think it would be fair to nerf warriors and rogues back a bit so they earn their experience bonus but I don't see that happening either for the same reason.  Alternatively, buff all the other classes but they probably can't afford to buff everyone since then we have a form of MUD inflation.<P>So the bonus is an unfair aspect of the game which will always be in it looks to me.  I DO hope they really dig in their heals about giving rogues and warriors anything more though.<P>It is SOO hard to change a game once it's started.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Improve FD<BR>___________________________________<BR>Monks need FD to work against high level mobs... it should also work in breaking disciplines and spells targetted against the monk (would make monks more useful in raids).<P><BR>Give FD a slight untaunt so the monk can use his/her low delay weapons without taunting off the warrior.

</FONT><HR>no one sees the big picture... they are too small minded<P>monks HAVE/HAD a 20% penalty because they were supposed to be the MOST DAMAGING MELEE CLASS INGAME (even more damage then a rogue) and not rely on armor... this was ORIGINAL EQ before Kunark before Velious<P>warriors and rogues sucked in ORIGINAL EQ, so they got exp bonus<P>warriors and rogues whined so much they got MASSIVE UPGRADES<P>now warriors and rogues BOTH DO MORE DAMAGE THAN MONKS<P>yet they still keep their BONUS wayyy back when they were inferior<P>monks still level SLOWER than warriors and monks...

</FONT><HR>about the exp bonus, we know warriors and rogues get a bonus, its because no one plays them, they're borring classes, lets get back to talking about how to incress monk damage back to where its suppose to be, not complain about exp bonuses, in an attempt to become more like warriors and rouges.<P>My favorite idea so far in these talks was to unhook the punchs and kicks, this would not only incress damage (not enough but somewhat) but it would also make us look really cool while fighting, this is a change I would most like to see made</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is something that makes me frustrated as hell, and has to do with something as important as a new improvement to our attack...<P>First I have to point out a few things that because it's the combination of them that hurts the playability of monks in the upper levels.<P>First I'm sure everyone is aware that mobs at a distance don't update on your computer/screen as fast as a mob that is in close proximity.  What I'm refering to is the way your pc gets updates from the server, their seems to be a high priority on mobs that are close to you.  You have all seen it:  You run towards a mob that is on the horizan far away, and half way to him, he pops only to reapear hundreds of yards away as if he didn't travel as far as your computer calculated originally... No problem, it makes sense to update mobs closer to you to save on bandwith in the design of the game.<P>Second point: for those of you unaware of this..  (Verrant apparently attempted to nerf FD by implementing this bit of code,  By the way, very poor way to nerf a skill)   Lvl 35 mobs have a very high % chance of seeing a monk stand, no matter how far they have walked, after a successful feign death.  Thats right.. I said stand.  Note: this doesn't occur till you start fd'ing on mobs above lvl 35 so newbie monks won't know what i'm referring too... I have read on some boards that this % is 80%, and from playing this seems to be true.  So in effect if a monk succesfully FD a lvl 36 mob off me.  And stand up after the mob walks away.  About 4/5's of the time the mob comes running back to me.<P>PROBLEM:  The problem occurs when a high lvl Monk FD's a lvl 35+mob off.  And the mob walks off... and off... and off..  And when the monk stands the mob still is walking away... walking away... nope suddenly the mob is standing next to you... even though you were just watching him walking away on the horizan.. (because the mobs that are that far away aren't updated on client side very often.)  <P>Result: These to designs cause a huge playability issue.. Here is the scenario that usually plays out...  I FD... the mobs begin to trott away.. i wait a matter of minutes and change my view to get a good look at the mobs... sometimes waiting long enought to mend again..  Group members always thing it's safe at this time and healers come over to heal me... Well, when I stand, a moment or two later, the mobs are on me again, so I FD, and now they have returned (appear to pop from all the way across this zone) and demolish the rest of the group.   Secondly, I want to say that sometimes the mobs don't even appear, you just start taking melee dmg, (very bad nerf code).  <P>First I want to say I wish verrant would fix some of the playability issues b4 trying to implement Balance fixes... because if a class is more playable than it's more likely to appear balanced to those playing it.<P>Please fix this after-lvl-35 FD code...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>again Kunosian u dont see the big picture...<P>lvl 60 warrior does 3000dmg per minute max hasted...

ONLY 450 more damage per MINUTE!<P>do you really think 450dmg per MINUTE is enough to justify a monk's role in group CONSIDERING that the monk has 2000hp and 1000ac (that is 1000hp LESS THAN A WARRIOR, and 100ac less) AND a monk cannot interrupt casters spells AND a monk cannot taunt a monster off a cleric or enchanter when they get aggroed to save his life<P>do you all really think that an extra 450dmg is SIGNIFICANT enough when the average monster we encounter at lvl 50+ has 6000hp or greater...?<P>do you all really think that an extra 450dmg every minute is REALLY ALL THAT GREAT when you consider that the average fight for a lvl 50+ group is 1 minute long???<P>do you all really think that an extra 450dmg every minute is FAIR when you consider that a rogue can do an extra 3000dmg per minute( thats 2550 more damage than us for those with limited calculation abilities)... and we are BOTH supposed to be considered damage dealers?????<P>what needs to be done is this...<P>warriors do 3000dmg per min<BR>rogues do 6000dmg per min (if the can stay behind mob)<BR>MONKS SHOULD DO 4500dmg per min ALL THE TIME (50% increase over warriors)<P>this would make the monk desirable enough because he does significant more damage than a warrior whos MAIN JOB IS SUPPOSED TO TANK AND TAUNT... and while a rogue can still outdamage a monk, the rogue must stay behind the monster and the damage spread is not so great anyways (with new evade changes i should like to see rogues max damage output drop a little)<P>that is how it should be... that was the original vision<P>i dont want 10% exp bonus, i was simply showing you the penalties our class got for SUPPOSEDLY BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH DAMAGE... which at present we do not live up to</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I understand the concerns poster and find Bodi' post affirming, I might offer my own suggestion.  Quests for trainers. Upgrade monk significantly with several offensive and defensive skill but make it so you must complete a quest in order to get the trainer to start it.

</FONT><HR>Hey PrinceDolph, before you go telling other classes how they should be played, go play them yourself. You mentioned about how Shamen and Druids should not get Superior Healing at 51. That is completely off base and if you had a druid at 51, you would be crapping your pants at someone who said that, like I just did. Check how many hit points a warrior has at 51. Go look. Now. I'm not going to tell you because I want you to go get off the message boards from posting uneducated ideas and go actually look into what you post about. I'll wait.<P>Back? Good. Greater Healing heals around 350 hit points. That will maybe heal a half bubble to a quarter bubble of a warrior's hit points, and around a half bubble to three quarters of a bubble on a hybrid. Given the casting time of Greater Healing, that won't even spare our Warrior's life for 7 seconds in most encounters. Clerics have Complete Healing, which is a 1500+ hit point heal in most circumstances. Now where in your mind would increasing 350 to 500 even come near threatening 1500? In case you're slow at math (and I get the feeling you are), 1500 - 500 = 1000.<P>Wow. Still 1000 hit points difference between the average heal. Now let me give you some ratios. Greater Healing/Complete Healing is .2 or 2/10, Superior Healing/Complete Healing is .333 or 1/3. Now where in that thick head of yours does giving a class with no ability (after 50, I don't even consider myself a secondary healer)to heal a heal that does 33% of a Cleric's best heal even threaten a Cleric's position. You're telling me you'd rather have a slowed mob than a resurrection? Pardon, but what have you been smoking? Know about other classes before you talk about them and you'll find people actually listen to you instead of pity you.<P>Oh, and I completely back the Bodi post.<P>Phlegethon Malebranche, Gnome Druid<BR>Ramiraz DePietro, Human Monk<BR>Cazic-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First I would like to see that maybe since monks are having to wear more equip and weapons jus to try to match warriors/rogues are stone limit should be upped to 20 or 25 not alot but enough to help us carry higher ac items or more dmging weapons.<P>Or instead make it so that H-H start going down in dly at maybe 15 instead or 25 making the monks H-H from 14-26(Hum lvl 60) to 14/22 which would make us much more useful in a group and help monks at the lower lvls get into groups easier.<P>Also, the FD should be looked into it is a known bug that needs to be fixed.<P>Also maybe put a possible crit hit or stun on our special attacks to give us the feeling of doing more dmg or able to help prevent a mob from casting a spell.<P>Also the monk quest spawn times are jus way to rare and longwhen a lvl 35 monk is able to kill for his rotlc and a lvl 46 is there no way he is going to get the items needed and is having to resort to a lesser gi or some sort.<P>I relize some of these may be drastic but considering ever since RoK and SoV the rogues and warriors have been leaving monks/hybrids in the dust when it comes to dmging. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I currently play a lvl 25 monk on Teris Thule.  My reason for choosing the monk is the unarmed martial arts aspect.  I'm hoping that I can carry my plans of a pure empty handed combatant throughout the full carreer of my character.  After reading several postings and much of the experience I've had so far, I'm starting to feel that I don't want my monk to get above lvl 30 because of all the unnecessary limitations.  I have seen many of these equipment dependant monks and I do not want to have to resort to those means to be able to be a viable participant in a group.  If VI is going to keep monks as undesirables in grouping situations, then VI better do something to make the monk an unparalleled force in soloing.<P>On the martial arts aspect...<P>Monks should have hitpoints and I mean alot of them.  They train their bones, ligaments, muscles, respiratory, and cardio vascular systems for endurance.  Thus they can take more punishment.  Hence the escalating fatigue bar much like the mana bars for casters.  You'll come to that farther down this post.<P>Monks should have an escalating AC bonus due to their training to be able to "roll with the punches".  I figured this would be an apt description here since, from my understanding, damage taken is based on one's AC.<P>Monks should do more damage.  After all, they are trained in methods of punching and kicking to get the most efficiency from their bodies.<P>Monks should be able to stun. They are trained to strike weak points.<BR>  <BR>Monks should be doing critical hits. Once again we come to the point of being trained to take advantage of an opponents weakness.<P>Monks should be doing crippling strikes at higher levels once again because of their intensive training on where the weak points are and how to strike them.<P>Monks should have triple, at lvl 20, and quadruple, at lvl 40, attacks.  Compare the striking rate of a master martial artist to that of a swordsman wielding a hand and a half sword.  This shouldn't be a problem considering that, as far as I've seen, EQ doesn't take reach into consideration in melee combat.<P>Monks should have crits on throwing.  Trained for accuracy in darts, shuriken, knives, spikes, and even spears.  But don't give the throw crits unless you give the hnd to hnd crits too.  That would just be dumb in my opinion.<P>Monks spend years, or even lifetimes, honing their bodies and atuning themselves to their inner natures thus, monks should have high resistances at least to elemantal and natural based attacks, magical and otherwise.<P>Defensive skills...<P>Monks have a good start with dodge, block, and ripost.<P>How about adding iron skin/shirt where the monk has a chance of reducing the damage to mabey 20% if not negating the hit all together.<P>There's also a technique called Maka Wara where the monk hardens his arms and legs to possibly damage to an opponent while blocking.  It could function like an intermitant damage shield in game.<P>There are also reversals where an opponent would make an attack on the monk and have that attack redirected to damage themselves.  I've seen it done, done it, and have had it done to me.<P>Monkly Magic...<P>If one must go there, then consider the possibility of special abilities that affect the fatigue bar.  Of course this means that there's a possibility that a monks fatigue bar would increase like the mana bar for casters.<P>Lasting Breath.  Once the air bar runs out, the fatigue bar starts to reduce.  After the fatigue bar is depleted, then the monk would start drowning.  Say 30 seconds per base bubble.<P>Feet of Wind.  Like SoW.  The level of the skill would be the percentage of the speed of SoW.  How long it last depends on the drainage rate of the fatigue bar.  At least a minute per base bubble.<P>Grasshopper.  Jumping where the level of the jump skill would determine the safe height of the jump and landing.  This does not need to be based on Safe Fall as the monk has to prepare for the jump and expend fatigue.  Suggestion of 1.25 base bubbles per jump.<P>Healing.  The monk expends qi (fatigue) to heal self or others.  Percentage of damage healed equal to the monks level.  Succeed or fail, entire fatigue bar is depleted.<P>Drifting Smoke.  The monk expends qi (fatigue) like breath is normally expended while swimming underwater to gain the ability to move through small openings from one room or passage to an adjacent room or passage.  Getting caught in a wall when qi runs out would kill the character of course.<P>The list of abilities and how to implement them can go on and on.<P>Feign Death really needs to be fixed.  Once you've convinced someting that you're dead, it should completly forget about you.  After all, you're dead.  You're no longer a threat.  And fix the bug that makes it to where FD doesn't work well in a group.  I was being chased by 4 Sarnaks tonight, I was nowhere near my group and I was outpacing them by a good margin via SoW.  I FDed successfully 6 times in a row and the Sarnaks kept comming and were still beating on me if I let them get close enough.  This is not good.<P>Most of the things I've mentionsd here are practices and disciplines that are persued in real life by many practitioners of the martial arts.  Then there's the monkly magic section which is based loosly on the Chinese wire dance fantasy kung fu movies.  LOL<P>Monk gear needs to be light weight.  Assuming a stone to be 7 pounds, a really, REALLY, strong wooden staff would not weigh more than 0.8.  A pair of gloves that weigh 10 pounds (1.5 stone)?  I've worn plate gauntlets (SCAdians know what I mean) and they don't weight that much.  Monkly gear weight really needs to be looked at.  It needs to be lighter and stronger based on how hard it is to get.  Based on that formula, from what I've been hearing, the RotWF alone should be almost impenetrable to anything but a god.  Make the item match the quest or the quest match the item.<P>As far as the special attacks go.  I agree that the hand strikes should be unlinked from the foot strikes.  And a flying kick for an average of 3 points at lvl 60, the gist I'm getting from reading these posts, would really suck the wind from anyone's sails after doing a tail rake/dragon punch for and average of 18 points at lvl 25.<P>Well it's late and I hope some of these make the list.<P>Good luck and good hunting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think that one important way of increasing monk damage has been sadly left off the list.  Critical Attacks, Crippling Blows, Deadly Strikes on unarmed attacks would not only raise our damage substantially, but would reduce the need to arm all monks with heavy expensive weapons to keep up with the warriors in damage.  I've seen a warrior 4 levels lower than me with an 8 damage weapon in offhand, 5 damage in primary, crit for 50, 39, and 60 in a combat, whereas my most powerful blow with my 14 damage weapon is 33, averaging 22.<P>Even with my twinked weapons, the untwinked warrior 4 levels below me outdamages me half the time.  It is my understanding that monks were supposed to be the masters of melee, dealing out massive amounts of damage with their fists, only outdamaged by rogues backstabbing.  In practice, i find that this is not the case.  I find that i have fewer hitpoints and less ac than a warrior of my level, and i deal less damage.<P>Monks need to get back to their roots and begin using their bare hands again.  Adding critical attacks to their unarmed combat seems to make perfect sense to me.  Monks are highly skilled un using their fists as weapons, why shouldn't they command the same kind of skill in occasionally landing a critial blow as a warrior does with his weapons?  I know I would sell my twinked weapons in a heartbeat if i started critical attacking with my fists.  I think many other monks would agree.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think something simple to add to the desirability of monks in groups would be what was mentioned about adding an ability to interupt. Adding to our special attacks maybe at the level of eagle strike and up a 50% chance to interupt a caster. There would have to be a max lvl you can interupt though or having enough monks on a dragon raid, for example, could eliminate the dragons ability to cast anything effectivly. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love some of Malkiths ideas, MONKS are supposed to be a superiour trained fighting machine, in all aspects of body control such as breath holding, speed, and the knowledge of vital areas on another oppenents body, hence, i think the idea of a monk being able to have something of a endure breath of short time such as a skill or something would be a great idea, but just as a add on, speed, monks are trained to be extremly fast, therefore should be able to have some sort of burst of speed example spirit of cheetah but could also drain some stamina, and critical hits, crippling hits ETC should be a monks STRONG point, we should be able to do devasting attacks with our hands! thats something i would love to see the most, is monks with crit and cripple hits, and possibly a tripple hit or something like that, oh also on the melee skills such as tiger strike, etc, monks should be able to use flying kick, and still have something like TIGER strike still up! just because we kicked doesnt mean we coudnt pull another move with our HAND!<BR>and monks most certainly do need something along the lines of evade and FD fixed</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is something that would help balance monks and make them a little more fun. Plus increase the usefulness of those monks who choose fist over weapon. As this would be Fist only skill.<P>I'm not sure if this has been mentioned in the past, but Pressure points should be implented into the monks arsenal. Example:<P>It could be a push button skill that recycles every 10 or so minutes. You use it on a mob and if successful you would do increased damage of a normal hit and for maybe 30 seconds the mob could be more vulnerable to melee attacks. We could see a message like "you hit so and so's pressure point! they flinch in pain!" or some such.<P>It could be a natural thing like a warrior's critical hit. When you land one it could do increased damage and stun the mob.<P>Lastly, it could all be random depending on which 'pressure point' you managed to hit. Maybe it will stun, maybe it will make mob more vulnerable, maybe it will make the mob choke and work as a low dmg DoT. This has a lot of possibilities. Please consider it.

</FONT><HR>here are my 2cp :)<P>i'm not a high level monk, nor an expert in EQ gaming (lvl 22 monk iksar, Kunis in MT)<P>what i'd love to see for a monk is :<BR>- h2h dmgs output raised... we are mokns... we should basically do more damage with our fists than with any other weapon. by this way; some magic gloves with procs should be added (and not only rare drops for lvl 50+ monks, pls)<BR>- monks shouldn't get riposte this late in game... but that's not a great deal though<BR>- unlock hand and feet combat skills ! i want to see my monk floating in the air while kicking and striking :)<BR>- add an evade skill maybe, even with our mend we are not as good tankers as any other melee classes... as a monk i reaaly shouldn't care about AC, but the reality is that we tank almost aswell as a bard :)<BR>- monks shouldn't have to look for incredible stuff. i've chosen the monk cause i thought he was independant and didn't care on loot... that's wrong ! and that's not normal... instead of trying to balance this class with new weapons or armor you should rethink just a little bit what a monk could achieve naked, with his bare fists.<P>that was it...<BR>of course i'm not the best one here to talk about this class but i love my monk and would really like to see him a bit improved... or just funnier to play :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I get such a kick out of reading Prima's Official Strategy Guide for Kunark.  Man, who gave the author for this book rights to print the information in it?  But the point of my post stems from reading about monks in this strategy guide, I'd like to quote a little bit from the book(so none of this is mine, it is straight from the book).<BR>This is under the entry for Combat.<P>Combat:<BR>Don't even try to learn a weapon.  Weapons are not only superfluous - a Monk's moves are just as deadly as a blade - but they are too heavy.  A monk will not be able to perform up to expectations if she's weighted down with unnecessary items.<P>Stategic withdrawal. If you're outmatched... run! A Monk can easily outpace his enemies (although  creatures in Norrath never give up the chase until you're out of zone).  Since Monks are often loners, learning to perform tactical withdrawals is a survival trait.<P> <P>I just thought this related to what we're all talking about in our class thread.  It's kinda funny that even the strategy guide says monk's should run faster, then VI turns around and says absolutely in no way will monks get a speed boost(not directed solely at monks but I think Abashi stated a while back that no classes were ever going to get a natural speed boost.)  <P>Another funny thing is how the guide says monks should never even pick up a weapon, yet look at the current trend with Kunark/SoV gear for monks....all heavy weapons to make us more "balanced".  <P><BR>Well this is my 2cp, for those of you out there that have the strategy guide, dust it off and re-read the thing, it's quite hilarious to see what was intended way back when RoK was released  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>You never know till you try.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After posting on pressure points I felt the need to ellaborate on extending a monk's choice of combat options. This is what my post will focus on, giving monks more choices over how they do damage and having more fun along the way. Let's start by seeing where the choices begin and where they end.<P>-Point A- here you are and there's the mob<BR>-Point B- here you are (still alive) and there's the mob (quite dead)<P>We all want to get from point A to point B. At least I hope =) I don't want this to be greatly altered by huge damage increases or overbalancing skills. I would like to see How we get from point A to point B change. This is what I propose:  making use of a popular martial arts idea of 'chi' or 'lifeforce' energy (make sure you read the entire post before drawing pre-mature conclusions). As with everything in EQ, there is a need for balance. I realize we cannot bestow monks with powers and not expect a downside. In hopes of having this considered for implentation, I have tried to make it balanced as possible.<P>I have created a set techniques that could be used from earlier levels and up to 60. I feel that what you learn should always be useful, no matter how early you gained that knowledge. Here is where we make use of the empty mana bar all monks carry around. The last thing I want is for monks to turn into hybrids and just carry around spells or have any association with having mana. But, since the mana bar is there we can use it to represent our 'chi' or 'lifeforce'. Each technique would cost a certain amount of 'lifeforce', but it wouldn't be a situation where you click a button and use X amount of your energy. For example, if you wanted to use the Open Wounds technique (this will be detailed later), you would charge it for X amount of time. The longer you charge it the better of an effect you will have and the more energy it will drain. As you drain your energy in preparation to perform the technique, you are more vunlerable to attacks and cannot be disturbed by damage or it will be ruined and energy will be lost for nothing. Basically, you are 'stunned' for the duration of the charging and will be free to move normally after executing the technique (barring the various side effects). Your energy will regain over time, but cannot be effected by clarity, bard songs, or other mana giving items or spells since a monk's energy is not mana. It's just that, a person's lifeforce. Your lifeforce could become stronger after gaining levels, but not by leaps and bounds.<P>These techniques would be usable only if both hands are free. They are meant for the true, bare-handed martial arts masters out there. I feel this would bring about an interesting set of strategic options. Do you choose to go bare-handed and use your techniques and pressure points (i posted about pressure points earlier)? or do you use your nice blunt weapons with good stats and procs? As I stated, your hands must be free to use a technique and there will be a time limit on when you can equip a weapon after using a technique..maybe as low as 20 mins or as much as an hour (starting from your last use of energy). Now let me explain a few of the techniques I've pondering over, inspired somewhat by the discipline concept and all those movies i've watched over the years:<P>-Shadow Fist Technique-<BR>1. The upside:<BR>A technique used to concentrate dozens of blows to be given within moments of one another. The damage of each blow would scale from 50 percent of your maximum fist damage to 75 percent of your maximum fist damage, depending on the amount of energy used to charge. The actual number of blows attempted would range from a few dozen up to several dozen, depending on the amount of energy charged. This would occur in a very short amount of time, about 2 or 3 seconds (the actual punching, not including the charge time).<P>2. The downside:<BR>After usage of Shadow Fist, your spirit is tired and will not allow you to execute any technique for 5 minutes and will not allow you to use Shadow Fist again for an hour. For 5 minutes after using Shadow Fist, your movement speed will be reduced by 15 percent up to 35 percent depending on the amount of energy used. The delay on your fists would be increased by 20 percent up to 60 percent, depending on the amount of energy used. I feel this balances out the nice damage output you could give to any single mob in such a short amount of time.<P>-Flaming Palm Technique-<BR>1. The upside:<BR>A technique used to harness the fire of one's spirit and focus it into tangible flames. While charging this technique, perhaps flames could surround the fists (similar to when casters begin casting fire dd spells, the graphics are there so lets use them). Each successful blow would carry 75 percent up to 125 percent of non-melee fire damage based (based on charging time) on the total amount of damage given by that melee blow. <BR>The bursts of fire that hit the mob after every few punches could carry a small fire dd graphic, it's there so lets use it =) This would last for 20 to 45 seconds, depending on charge time.<P>2. The downside:<BR>After the technique is completed all resists except fire will be reduced by 50 percent up to 75 percent, depending on the amount of energy used. This will last for 15 minutes. Also during this time your fists will need time to recover from the extreme heat and will only do 65 percent up to 85 percent of their normal damage, depending on energy used. Your lifeforce will need time to recover as well and will not allow you to use any techniques for 5 minutes and the Flaming Palm technique for an hour. The extreme heat has also left your defenses hindered. Your Ac will be reduced by 10 percent up to 20 percent depending on energy used. Also, dodge, block, and riposte will be slightly less effective. I feel this adequately balances the fire-based damage monks could dish to mobs.<P>-Open Wounds Technique-<BR>1. The upside:<BR>A technique used to exploit the wounds previously given to mobs. This technique would only have effect on mobs that have lost at least 10 percent of their total life. Starting after the first successful blow, each following hit would do a minimum of 5 percent up to 15 percent extra damage than the previous blow, like a crescendo, depending on charge time. This would top out at a certain point, however, doing no more than 3 times the fists maximum damage on any given blow. This technique would not carry from mob to mob. It could be used on a single mob until it dies or the time expires on the technique. It would last 10 seconds up to 30 seconds depending on charge time.<P>2. The downside:<BR>After using Opens Wounds technique, you cannot regain health for 1 minute via healing spells or natural regain. Your lifeforce will not allow you to use any technique for 5 minutes and Open Wounds for an hour. From all the mess caused by exploting wounds, your aim is greatly hindered. For 15 minutes after using Open Wounds your ATK is decreased by 15 percent up to 25 percent and you are more likely to blocked, dodged, parried, or riposted...the severity depending on the amount of energy used. I feel this balances the nasty amount of damage possible.<P>Now that I've explained 3 of my Techniques, I'll explain further on their general states. These 3 could be learned by monk guildmasters and their could be hidden monk master in the lands that would train you in other techniques. They could be available at low lvl's, maybe starting in the teens and range up to 60. The negative effects of techniques will stack.<P>I feel that this could increase the effectivness of monks, but due to the risks of the side effects, would not be overbalancing. This would give monks the opportunity to use strategy instead of targeting a mob and pushing auto-attack. And most of all...it would be fun.<P>Rlaiel Riptide: 56 former human monk of Tunare<BR>Relh Butterfly: 30 iksar monk of Vazaelle (3 dings today, yay me)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Chickenlegs...hehe I agree totally with your posts above. All I am saying is that monks have better things to complain about than a 11% bonus to exp which is what your posts on the last page seemed to concentrate on. <P>However I do understand that you are angry that the two most useful melee classes get a bonus when they arent even balanced vs monks. However using exp as a foundation for this complaint might tempt Verant to give us an exp bonus rather than fixing our class.<P><BR>Rogues ___________________________<P>They were boosted because their skills were broken..then their skills were given to them and then Kendrick helped to design a weapon that destroyed balance for the entire raiding side of the game. Verant then designed raid type mobs around they now overpowered rogue which stuffed the rest of the melee classes except warriors.<P><BR>Warriors______________________________<BR>Boosted in Kunark and given weapons as good as monks in Velious. Defensive discipline makes them the only viable tank in most boss encounters and highly desirable in groups (to the exclusion of others).<P><BR>Monks_______________________________<BR>Given weapons in Kunark.. but lost ground overall to other melees. Given better armours in Velious.. but still cannot be a viable main tank. Lost more ground in Velious due to other classes getting fantastic weapons. Flying kick was not upgraded since release and is now underpowered vs the mobs monks have to fight.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
