</FONT><HR>Ok i am sick of Cabriolet. PLEASE tel us why YOUR whole pre 50 life sucked. Not clerics lives but your own. You say clerics endure a hard time at levels 10, 20 , 30, 35. I say bull. All classes do. I noticed clerics in groups all the time and most are chosen b4 druids, want to know why?<P>The tanks! Tanks have a love affair with clerics right from the start. Even when both classes have equal healing abilities, which isn't long, tanks always prefer clerics. Even if thier perception is misguided at some levels its still there. The tank, cleric relationship evolves the whole game and is very much there even at low levels.<P><BR>Clerics have two very, very unique spells. REz and CH. Don't cheapen either by saying paladins get it and necro's. Thats a pathetic excuse since thie is hardly any of those classes at the level they obtain them. My druid(second main) is already starting to feel the agony of our disability in dungeons late in the game. i am mid 40's and in solb alot. Often i think the group would be more efficient without me. wish it were not so but i don't complain cause about 5 other classes get my main abilities and do it better. <BR>I fill in where needed, just like a bard. That is what we do.<P>And when they make changes that is still what we will do. e a fill in  groupmate when someone else is not there( insert cleric) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hootie, you need not worry about me defending Cabrio-nerf, but I have to ask you a question.<P>Why aren't you soloing or fighting and an outdoors setting like DL?<P>Don't complain about your group appeal bud. Cleric don't look appealing till we get CH and then Rez. Before that, it's just as useful to have a shaman or a druid along in the low levels. Those reasons are why this discussion is post 50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok let me get my facts here straight...<P>Superior healing is being moved to level 51 for druids and shaman right??? and then druids and shaman get chloroblast at 55 and then druids get another heal spell at 60 right??<P>Soooo all this does is change things abit in the 46+ game right?? (planes, raids, and dragons Oh my) <P>I think its time for the Cleric community to shape up, the majority of you have allowed yourselve to be nothing more than walking bandaids for far too long.. This absurd notion that all Clerics can do is HEAL is nonsense. With the healing duties (yes duties) spread out abit more (after the patch goes live IF it ever does) Clerics will be able to show off their Other skills (better start practicing).<P>To those Clerics who refuse to fit the mold and just Heal I salute you, and this rant does not apply to you... <P>to the rest of the Player Base if you'd give your Clerics the leeway to USE their other spells, IT IS A GAME stop bean counting, who cares about mana/damage ratio, its not about exp/hour played, its about having FUN. <P>/em puts on all his fire resist gear :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yo, Khord, not trying to flame you...<P>But what other abilities are you talking about?<P>Buffing? Already done in a group...<BR>Rezing? The idea is for us NOT to show off that ability  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><P>Nuking? We're inferior.<BR>Undead Nuking? We're still inferior.<BR>Stun? Well, we can, and I think we do.<BR>Root? Same as above.<P>Mark of Karn? Nerfed. Now mostly useless.<BR>Pet? Mostly useless.<P>Frenzied Strength? Joke.<BR>Yaulp? Joke.<BR>Summon Hammer? Joke. But I can make food+water if you're tired of foraged stuff.<P>Fear? I've done some good fearkiting with two rogues who wielded weapons that proc'd snare. But when else is this useful?<BR>Invis? Well, to undead, sure. But how many mobs at our level DON'T see through invis? I can get into lower Guk...<P>Bind Affinity? Ok I admit here we shine...<BR>Cancel Magic? Right, sure<BR>Cure Poison? Ok at this point I'm grasping for straws...<P>Hey, buddy, I'd love to have some other abilities to show off, but I don't. The best I can do to "show off" my cleric skills is stun+rootpark extra mobs to crowd control. Which can be done better by a shaman/druid... unfortunately most people I've met haven't figured out how though.<P>What other abilities?<P>When I'm not main healer, I'm crowd controller and puller, and I stun casters. That's what I do. I pull to keep a constant exp flow going (our melee never stop swinging. Ever.) and I crowd control to keep the damage light. I've done a group with me as pull/crowd control and a druid as main healer. But that's about the only counterexample I can think of.<P>No intent to flame you. Just understand: We don't have the abilities you're talking about.<P>- Gaeb<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have no problem with druids and shamans getting better heals to help balance them against clerics. I do have a problem with clerics and shamans getting nothing at all to help balance them against druids.<P>I have never had a problem with shamans getting better heals. Since shamans can not port, and are limited by their running speed, be it SoW or whatever. They are in the same boat is clerics when looking for groups. <P>Druids, on the other hand, with new improved healing spells, should have no problem EVER finding a group. Even if the group is 20 zones away. This is where I have a problem. Clerics AND shamans are going to be in direct competition with druids for pick up groups. ONLY druids have the ability to port 20 zones to join a qroup.<P>In my opinion, shamans and clerics need to be balanced vs the improved druid heals and their ability to port around to find or join groups.<P>I believe clerics need the following to help them compete with druids.<BR>1) SELF invisibility.<BR>2) SELF port to HOME diety specific temple. Make it 1k mana with res effects.<BR>3) Incresed cap on CURRENT melee skills.<P>I believe shamans need the following to help them compete with druids.<BR>1) SELF port to HOME diety specific temple. Make it 1k mana with res effects.<BR>2) Add a complete heal over time for shamans at level 60. The CH should heal a players hit points over a 10 second period.<P>How do I feel this balances the three "priest" classes? <P>Clerics retain the best possible healing and resing ability, but lack the ability to cover great distances to join or find groups. Clerics would still be cursed with very difficult solo ability and still require groups. Invisibility would help in travel as would the self port. Clerics would still be required on raids for their instant complete heal and resing ability.<P>Shamans retain their buffing and DoT abilities and gain the ability to CH at the highest level. The CH helps to add to their usefullness in raid encounters with highly magic resistant mobs. The self port would help in travel.<P>Druids retain their unmatched ability to travel and with improved healing spells, become a quick and easy addition to any pick up group in need of a healer. The improved healing spells make them a good addition to raids but does not overshadow either a cleric or a shamans CH ability.<P>So many players are fixed on this "uber" encounter mentality. Uber encounters for the normal player are a tiny percentage of actual game play. No one can deny a clerics importance in uber encounters but no one can truthfully deny that clerics will be delt a painful blow in every day pick up groups. <P>Many seem to find this amusing that "clerics will have to look for groups now". When have clerics not? Clerics have to wait for groups just like any other class, and unlike the other two "priest" classes, clerics have very little solo abiliy when not grouped and travel painfully slow from zone to zone when in search of a group.<P>In my opinion I dont think anything, anyone has said has mattered in the class threads. I appared to me that VI already had an agenda when the threads were started and already knew what they were going to add with each class. I believe thats why Absor comes off so hostile in many of the class threads opening posts.<BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gaeb, please stop reading my mind...<P>Khord, every cleric that I know that's post 50 is squeezed into the same roll. We buff the standard group buffs, assume stun duty against gaters that we can stun, occassional CC (Crowd Control), and we try not to find a need to rez people.<P>On a more unique not, I'll stand up and hit a mob once just to get the faction hits in Sebilis. Ohhhh, aren't I a unique cleric :P<P>Now please post about the versatile abilities that we have.<P>Added versatility would be if our hammer didn't poof and had more HP than a wet paper sack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056194-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056194.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056194-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056194&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056194&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
