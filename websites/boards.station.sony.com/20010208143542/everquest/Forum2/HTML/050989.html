</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here:http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739.html<P>Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 01-22-2001 12:38 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>All right, due to the impression that you all have given me, it seems that I need to cover wizards next…<BR>I’ve already made several notes to myself about wizards, and I may as well start out this discussion with those notes. Keep in mind that these ‘talks’ are geared toward making sure that the classes are ‘balanced’. Please work toward that goal when posting (yes, even if that means you suggest a ‘nerf’). But I’m also interested in hearing about bugs and such too, I’m just not going to focus on them.<P>Here are the notes that I already have. Keep in mind that these are only my notes, and just because I’ve listed something does NOT mean that I like the idea or that the designers are working on making changes based on these notes. This is just what it is, a list of ideas. I’ve also added my notes to you all under the header of Note:<P>AoE spells: Mentioned elsewhere… (earlier on my list, probably under mages: basically the idea here is that maybe pets should be removed from the equation).<P>Gaze/Glimpse: Due to the clipping plane, these spells don’t really allow further seeing, just zooming in (which makes your resolution worse anyhow).<P>Note: this may not be ‘fixable’ at all due to the way the game works. It’s not like we can force your PC into a higher resolution when you use this spell…<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder: There seems to be a problem with these spells. Since they will not teleport you up, they don’t work too well in hilly terrain; because the spell only sends you a few feet (stopping when it reaches a hill or building).<P>Note: Again, this may also not be something we can change, but it’s on the list.<P>Bind Sight: Seems to cause viewer to see the target as running into walls or spinning in circles if target goes up an incline.<P>Enstill: It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive. <P>Cazic Gate: At level spell is attained, using it will most often cause death because the caster appears amidst many aggressive monsters that /con white to them.<P>Note: We’ve actually discussed this before. If I remember correctly, the general feeling was that having a dangerous gate like this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But it is also still on my list.<P>Tishan’s Relocation: This spell evacuates you to a very dangerous location, a monster crossroads in the Skyfire mountains. Could the location be moved, or was it intended that this be a very dangerous evacuation spell?<P>Note: See note about Cazic Gate.<P>Concussion: A level 39 spell dropped by a creature in a location that requires a party of level 50s to handle. Should it be in such a location?<P>Icestrike effects: Graphical effect looks like fire.<P>Lightning Bolt effects: looks exactly like Fire Bolt.<P>Other lightning and cold effects: It seems that there might be other spells that have the look of fire when they should not.<P>Having just re-read this list, I see nothing at all related to actual balancing stuff. This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such (with the possible exception of Area of Effect spells, changing those would certainly have an effect on class balances). So, please, try to focus on balance issues…<P>Alan<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Again, I think the most important first step is for the Verant team to discuss the design concept for Wizards.  If you want the class to start weak and be powerful later on, how does that fit with your stated intent for all classes to be balanced at the end, equivalent in power and ability?<P>If Wizards are meant to be the big cannon, the one you turn to for a fast blast, how does that fit with other classes being able to out blast a Wizard with a single blast, or with blasts that take 6.3 seconds to cast?<P>If Wizards are meant to be the gatekeepers to the planes, why are there so many planes that don't need a spell or HAVE a spell to get there?<P>Why was the class called the masters of seeking knowledge and masters of magical damage when neither is remotely true?  What prompted that concept originally, and what changed?<P>Design Philosophy, once you think about what the class is SUPPOSED to be like, then you can start out with a clean board and understand where a lot of these requests you call 'nit picking' come from.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most of it isnt nit picky, most of it is pretty major changes to make wizards more balanced.  Right now they are probably the weakest class, they are the least desired class to have in any group, and there damage spells are supposed to be so much better, but they arent, they are imbalanced and underpowered.

</FONT><HR>Of course the basic design of a "wizard" class in RPG is that they are basically toothpicks to begin with, and slowly, tediously, rise in power, until they are the masters of the land. This disparity between the classic RPG of a wizard and the EQ version is what this whole thread is about IMHO. The VISION (tm) states that all must be equal, at all times.  It didn't start that way, but it ended that way (thats why we started with xp penalties).<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ooo ooo here's a neat one.  How about replacing Okeil's with some a hp damage to mana conversion sheild where whenever the target takes damage it adds mana to the wizards mana pool.  <P>I think at about a 1/20 mana/hp damage ratio at first then going up to a 1/10 ratio for the higher level spell.  Then you have a buff you want to cast as a wizard on another player.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> And it helps out with long slug fests.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Drummrboy.  Most of my ranting is in the general chat, check it out there...but one thing I missed...<BR>Familiars<BR>Wizards do get a "pet".  The Eye of Zomm is considered a pet by the game...you know, the one the tank thinks is funny to kill, paralyzing you and getting you whacked...and you can't cast it again without logging out because "you can only have one pet at a time"....<BR>Eye of Zomm is a cool spell(albeit useless) and if they do anything along the pet/familiar line for wizards it should be to fix this spell..<BR>Nuff said?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>By the way, the AE RAIN SPELL problem again, in cause you all missed it, especially you Absor:<P>This spell line, like all AE spells, had a larger area, and had no maximum number of targets. All AE spells had their mana cost raised, damage lowered, and the areas and maximum targets reduced. AE Rain spells were FURTHER weakened by making them not hit with the correct number of waves. <P>Instead of hitting up to the maximum number of targets (4 now) with up to 3 waves each, it works like this, optimally:<BR> <BR>1 target = 3 waves hit<BR>2 targets = 2 waves hit each<BR>3 targets = 1 wave hits each, with 1 extra wave on a single target<BR>4 targets = 1 wave hits each target<BR> <BR>Now, as you can see, unlike ALL other AE spells, the more targets you get, the more inefficient and more poor the spell becomes. As a result, the AE Rain spells are junk. In addition, the AE Rain spells actually hit with EVEN FEWER waves indoors than they did out doors.<BR> <BR>In the Fall of 1999, Verant made an adjustment to the rain spells that made them hit more indoors, so they were the same as outdoors, but were still limited to 4 maximum waves, no matter how many targets.<BR> <BR>In January, after repeated pleas, comments, and complaints, GZ Finally responded to Graffe, Baelish and I with an email that said, in effect, "wow, it does that? It's not supposed to, we'd like to fix that before Kunark comes out, AE Rain spells will feature heavily in that!" <P>In other words... they are broken. GZ was the guy in charge of spells then, the Archmage. Geoffrey Zatkins, works for Verant. Then after months of waiting we got no word, nothing was done, they STILL didn't work properly. So we brought that up AGAIN to GZ and he responded to Graffe with this (approximately) "We are going to get to those, but we can't right now, can't give you an ETA." <P>So we stand right now at that point. AE Rain spells have these three problems: <BR>-Hit with too few waves<BR>-Hit pets<BR>-Resisted more than individual blasts <BR>The last two are shared with all AE spells, but they are AE Rain spell problems<P>There is some confusion about AE Rain spells, how they would be 'overpowered' if they were working properly etc. <P>First off, There are two classes of AE spells for Wizards, who get the best ones in the game (damage and mana-wise). At level 4 and level 50+, the AE Rain spells, if all 3 waves hit, do about 150-180% of the damage a given blast that level does. The rest, between level 5 and 49, do about 110-120% of the damage a given blast that level does. <P>In other words, at level 4 and 50+, an AE Rain spell would do 15-18 damage when a blast that level would do 10. <P>At level 5-49, an AE rain spell would do 11-12 damage. <P>This assumes all three waves hit the target and are not resisted. Now, this seems exceptionally powerful IF you don't know how AE rain spells work. There are several balancing factors here that make them controlled with the power given: <P>-Three waves, each one is resisted separately, so that instead of the damage being added up, it has to be considered in three different packets.<BR>-The damage is over 12 seconds (3 waves 6 seconds apart) so it has a similar effect as a DOT, it might not even take effect due to the creature dying in that time.<BR>-The area is fixed at a given location, and the monster can physically LEAVE the area of effect, thus negating 1 or more waves entirely.<BR>-Like all AE spells, they will affect the caster, and damage him. <BR>In other words, looking at the damage as a single, total package is misleading.<P>ITS NOT JUST ABOUT PETS BEING HIT<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that Verant should examine the role it intended Wizards (and other Nukers for that matter) to have in SoV.  It seems as if the Wizard's role has been *substantially* diminished in engaging a Mob that could have a million HP, if not altogether eliminated.<P>Absor, I would like you to address this issue.  Pick a high HP Mob in SoV and analize how much damage (as a percentage of its HP) a single Wizard could inflict.  Then ask the team whether that is what they intended and post your results.<P>It may be that Wizards were supposed to shine in Kunark alone.  If so, just tell us.  Again, this applies to other Nukers as well, but especially to Wizzies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I think should be changed.<P><BR>Mages nuke just a few nanoseconds slower than wizards do, their spells do about 90-105% damage to wizards depending on level, and they have a tank to boot! <P>No group before level 52 would give the choice between a mage and a wizard would take a wizard. I know I am level 50 wizard on The Nameless, Mages and Necros do way more damage than wizard could ever hope to do in a group, and Enchanters have a monopoly on dungeons (No smart group will go into a Dungeon past the zone with out one.)<P>Presently Wizards Suck.... Well they come in dead last in preference to Groups looking for a caster, unless they need a ride somewhere.<P>I have a few suggestions for fixing the wizard class, but I have been playing for a long time and have yet to see Verrant even say anything close to wizards need a fix. "If you don’t like the class play another" is the only answer I have seen.<P>But here is my wish list.<BR>1. Increase the Direct Damage spells of wizards by 25-35%. With out adding the corresponding Argo to go with it. (We are a specialty class, make us special at something, not a mage with out a pet).<P>2. Increase the time limit our root line of spells will hold (if not broken by damage). At the very least this will be a less effective alternative to the Enchanters monopoly on the game. I have seen many groups have 5 powerful members and still will not take another character unless it is an enchanter so they can go into a dungeon.<P>3. Wizards are petless casters, we do not hide behind them, and from level one if we cast on a creature we will be dodging its blows. We NEED Dodge from level 1 with no cap on the skill. An increase in AC on Wizard only armor would be nice as well.<P>Those are my suggestions for fixing wizards. Here is a tidbit for the game in general. <P>I know you would like to encourage grouping, what about a "Meditation Confidence Bonus". It would work like this:<P>2 members in a group = 2 additional mana per tick since you feel more at ease with a partner and can get into a deeper trance.<P>3 members = 3 additional mana<P>4=4 <P>5=5 <P>6=10<P>You could also use for warriors resting regaining HPs.<P>Anyway those are my thoughts on things.<P>Ertye Novastorm, the lonely wizard.<P>P.S. I love the familiar idea as well.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Posted a long thread on potential ways to improve the class but not outdo or stand out from the other  classes on the first thread. And after thinking about it some more that the logic still stands, if warriors are one end of the spectrum then wizards represent the other.<BR>  One is totally melee with no mana , the other all spells with no melee capabillities. The other classes fall within those two extreemes. So on that logic thought if warriors get hp boost from bieng pure melee then wizards, with no pets or special funtions they only own, should get a boost in mana capabillities as much as the warrior gets for hitpoints.<BR>  Having the extra mana would only enable the wizard to help a group as they still have no abilities to resist dmg in melee conditions. But whould enable the caster to spread out the help to multiple mobs, with less down time at the same rate as others.<P>just my thoughts</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Backstab... LOL  That was a good one.<P>Seriously, what about making Harvest able to regain mana up to full mana.  Make it slowly raise your mana until you get to full and work like bard songs, so you can click them to stop in the middle of it.  You can't do anything else while in the middle of it except click it off.  When you are done casting, then you still get the stun.  Raise the recast time to balance it.  Its not like we could do it in the middle of soloing and we couldn't really do it in the middle of a fight for long and even if we could its not like we could just keep nuking like crazy or we'd have stuff beating us into oblivion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Someone mentioned it previously, but an area that is almost always overlooked is our dodging capability. For all we give up in Str, AC, HP...etc. we get very little back in this area. When we are OOM or our roots and stuns don't stick, we are dead in seconds. It literally takes about five hits to kill a wizard and most exp mobs can do this at lightning speed. We should be able to dodge very well. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Repost:<BR>                    Well, it's been close to a year since I quit EQ to find a game where a wizard wasn't<BR>                    gimpy. <P>                    There is one basic problem with the EQ wizard, which has been mentioned here over and<BR>                    over again - a wizard runs out of mana very quickly, and once he is out of mana, he is<BR>                    worthless. A wizard has no contribution besides his ability to turn mana into damage,<BR>                    except for evacuations, which druids typically do a better job of anyway. For this, they<BR>                    are the weakest of all classes defensively.<P>                    Yeah, there's other minor issues, concerning how pointless most of the wizard spells are,<BR>                    or where their TP points are, or how they can't affect a red creature through most of<BR>                    their lives. But when you get down to why wizards aren't desired much, its simply they<BR>                    don't have enough damage output over time - even shaman and enchanters can do more<BR>                    damage over an hour of playing than wizards.<P>                    So, if you can accept that as the main reason wizards are unpowered from other classes,<BR>                    there are several ways to remedy that problem. The remedy should not step on other<BR>                    classes specialties, such as buffs or damageshields, or mana regen (with 1 possible<BR>                    exception). They are:<P>                    1) Create a skill, similar to that of backstabs, kicks and bashes, that allows a wizard to<BR>                    do a DD or bolt, free of mana, at the touch of a button. This would obviously need to be<BR>                    weaker than the wizards most powerful spell, perhaps as much as 1/10 weaker. Actually,<BR>                    the best ratio would be to let the wizard have an attack between 1/4 and 1/2 of a<BR>                    typical melee character, as the wizard won't be in combat, and shouldn't come close to<BR>                    damage with the manaless attack as a warrior of that level. <P>                    So, a level 12 wizard could maybe do 5 to 8 points of a magical attack, say every 6 to<BR>                    10 seconds or so, and a level 60 wizard 80 to 120 damage in that time (perhaps more or<BR>                    less - its been a while). This lets the wizard do much less damage than a typical melee<BR>                    type over that time. He can do this when out of mana, or can pace himself to use the<BR>                    big, mana eating spells when needed.<P>                    This fits in perfectly with the wizard description, and again, is similar to other classes<BR>                    who get rapid special attacks.<P>                    2) If this is too extreme, a very easy solution would be to dramatically increase the<BR>                    damage cap levels for wizard spells. This means that instead of maxing out in spell<BR>                    damage 4 levels after geting the spells, you can keep increasing the spell power for 12 to<BR>                    20 levels. This lets a wizard chain cast a bunch of highly mana efficient weak spells (so a<BR>                    level 40 wizard casting a level 20 spell would be doing 40 or 60 more points per cast than<BR>                    when he first got it, instead of the 8 to 12 he currently gets), or bring out the big mana<BR>                    hogs for power attacks.<P>                    This also fits in perfectly with the extreme focus of the wizard spell line on damage.<P>                    3) Give wizards a much higher cap per level on evocation skill, much like the monk gets<BR>                    for dual weilding or hand to hand attacks (again, its been a while). Since the EQ system<BR>                    for resolution is so opaque to the players, I cannot suggest what this would affect, but<BR>                    hopefully it would dramatically lower resist rates or increase damage potential, or both.<BR>                    I'm not positive that this would solve the problem as completely as the first two<BR>                    suggestions.<P>                    4) Give the wizards a higher meditation rate. Now, this does not mean a clarity effect - it<BR>                    would only be effective when the wizard was meditating, not while running around. This<BR>                    would fit in well with the decription of the highly disciplined students of magic that<BR>                    wizards are described by. I don't know that it would really fix the problem - the wizard<BR>                    would still be sitting on his butt most of the fight, just less time than normal.<P>                    I think the order of effectiveness is the order given - the first is the most ideal because<BR>                    it does not help the wizard in solo play at all - his damage output is actually less over<BR>                    short periods, but is greatly increased over long periods. #1 also enables the wizard to<BR>                    be a factor in combat without mana. The second would be easier to implement, since it<BR>                    should just be a simple data change, and would acheive much of what #1 does - the<BR>                    wizard could still run out of mana, but would be able to do more damage over time than<BR>                    he currently does, since low level spells that now get moved to the back of the spell<BR>                    book become much more mana efficient.<P>                    Good luck wizards!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>(please note, I dont expect all ideas to be considered/implemented as that would just be TOO much for one class, but I am just tossing out all ideas that I have)<P>I was wonderng if an upgrade to the harvest spell could be implemented?<P>Possibly a spell that is sort of like a "self clarity", but only for a very short period of time.<P>It would have a 10 sec cast time, with a 40 sec stun and "blind" the caster, they would instantly get a % of their mana back, then have a clarity-like mana regen for the duration that they are stunned.<P>Another suggestion. This may be more appliable to other class's then the wizards, but something to consider<P>- As it stands now, many monsters in SOV are magic immune. These same monsters also like to RUN, currently all movement-stopping spells are magic based. So you now have monsters which have a considerable ammount of HP left running off and causing trains (ie: sirens grotto). Would it be possible to add a spell (preferably to wizards), which is not a magic resist check but can snare a monster?<P>- Would it be possible to change thunder-bold from a ranged AOE attack, to a point-blank AOE attack. As it stands now, wizards doing AOE is a highly risky thing to do, mainly because unless your enc is high level their stuns will get resisted alot. By making thunder-bold a PB aoe instead of a range, it could help keep things a bit more under controll and take a bit of burden off of the enchanter.<P>- On many of the SOV boss monsters, they have obscene ammounts of hitpoints (really, they do). Which greatly reduces the effectiveness of a wizard. A wizard can unload a full bar of mana then item-nuke and do possibly 12k in damage, while melee class's are doing 30k in damage, we cant even come within 50% of what a melee can do. This does not sit right with me. Would it be possible to add a spell which does 0.8% of the monsters max hp. Some numbers to consider<P>- mob you would kill in sebilis has, 9k hp (just a guesstimate), a spell doing .8% of its hp, would only do 72 damage<P>- uber-SOV boss has 500,000hp, a .8% spell would do 4,000 damage<P>- super-uber-SOV boss has 1,000,000hp, a .8% spell would do 8,000 damage<P>- pre-SOV-uber boss has about 32,000hp max (a tad more), spell would do 256 damage<P>I could see the spell costing about 400 mana per cast. The mana effiency on it would be horrible for exping, not worth using on pre-SOV boss mobs (0.64 dmg per mana isnt all that appealing) but would become a rather usefull spell on SOV encounters. You could even up the mana-usage to 800mana, and it would still be worth casting.<P>- The wizards robe from POG. As it stands now, the cast time is way to long to be of any use. It locks you into a cast for 32 seconds for a rather small nuke, during that time you could of just medidated to get mana back to cast the nuke normally. If the cast time was reduced to 15-20 seconds, it would become alot more usefull.<P>- This is an "off the wall" idea, but something that struck me as "this may be neat" the other day. Wizards are supposed to be the masters of sight/vision. I was just wondering if any of the following would be possible<P>-- "Transport Self", when a player has bind-sight on a target, casting this spell will take the wizard to the location of the player/NPC they are bound-sighted to.<P>-- "Transport Other", when a palyer is bound-sighted on a NPC/player and casts this spell, whomever they have targeted will get transported to that location.<P>-- When a wizard is bound-sighted to a NPC, they get a LOS check that the paticular player/NPC would get. This could have some balance issues, as it would allow casting around corners/walls/etc .. but would be neat none theless. So I would understand if you simply said no to this idea, but just tossing it out there.<P>- Currently the spells Abscond and Evacuate are currently reaching the "my most useless list". Sure, I use the spell to cut down travel time a bit, I'll gate to like waeking lands, evac to kael, then evac in kael to get to eastern wastes fast type of thing. But as for actual game usefull ness these spells are lacking. Why? - they dont clear aggro.<P>Evacuate is supposed to be an inner-zone evac, which takes you from the "bad spot" your in and transport you to the safe area in that zone (usualy the zone in, or zone out). However though, these spells do NOT clear the groups aggro which makes them useless in the high level zones. Example<P>- One day me and my friends are hunting in Chardok<BR>- There is a lvl 50+ mob in the mix that we are fighting<BR>- Things go bad, the tank dies<BR>- We evac to the zone in (thinking it cleared aggro)<BR>- One by one, our group gets summoned down and killed<P>This is a bad thing. Could you please make it so evacuate at the least, clears the aggro that your group has, it would make this spell much more usefull.<P>- Many wizards I know are growing acustomed to using their rain spells as single-target nukes for higher mana effiency. I was wondering it would be possible to add a line of spells which act like a rain spell but only hit one target and no more? Have them at a higher effiency then the draught for that level, but due to the "risk" of having 1 or more of the waves fully/partialy resisted it would not allways be the most effienct nuke.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing that would help with balance issues would be a wizard type DoT.  As it stands, the rain spells, if they worked correctly, would do damage over time to a mob(3 waves).  If this were increased to a spell that would work over several minutes, this would eliminate much of the problem fighting the uber mobs, as well as avoid the feeling of being fairly useless when low or out of mana.  By allowing wizards a LONG duration DoT based on the cold/fire/magic based damage, these issues would drop.<P>We don't want pets, but we want something that will work while we sit and med.  Pets are really a way of doing this, cast it, and then even if out of mana, it does damage.  Wizards can get a similar effect by casting a long duration DoT(see it like a rain spell that doesn't get resisted every other time, yet moves with the mob.  Tiny rain cloud over the mob for an example that would drop lightning bolts on the mob for the duration of the spell).<P>Allowing the wizard to root with a fixed duration would be a good one as well.  Invis fixed duration was done, a fixed duration root would make the wizard a LOT more useful to park mobs.<P>Another useful addition might be a 2 or 3 second gate/evac spell for post 50 play would also be good.<P>I hope these don't get lost in the pile of people saying how they don't play a wizard, but don't feel that wizards need anything.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Kunark teleports.  The "run to karnors and evac to ____" method of travelling is NOT a balance issue.  It is an issue of annoying gameplay. This should be fixed.<P>2. Velious boss creatures having so many HPs makes wizard damage not nearly as important as melee damage.  Considering these mobs usually require the Lure line of spells, it is even expensive for Wizards to deal damage to them.  Someone suggested a velious_only line of high level spells that did damage based on the HPs of the monster.<P>3. Western Antonica Teleport - same as druids.  I don't think they have to make a gate or change the zone physically.  Rather, add a spell that goes to Queynos Hills or to the Everfrost Stonehedge or something.<P>I have seen what some level 60 wizards can do, and it seems to be sufficient for most of the rest of the game.  I would think that my complaints are more nit-picky than anything else.

Verant on the other hand is afraid to unbalance things in the old world.<P>Personally I think a percentage increase in DD damage and/or mana efficiency is called for.  That can be accomplished with items (focus crystals in the range slot) or by modifying base abilities (mana regen).  <P>The focus items are best idea so far.  Make them questable at the levels they are meant for... don't go the cuncussion quest route.  The focus items could address the following areas: casting haste, %DD bonuses, mana efficiency, mana regen rate (stackable with all existing clarity spells/songs).  Veliuos issues could be addressed my making focus items that only work in Velious.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I liked gregorianchant's contrast of a wizard and a warrior. Maybee the fix for wizards could be the same as warriors. DD crits, higher caps, better equipment, better disciplines. These would fix the wizard, making him the equal of other casters the way Verant fixed the warrior to make him the equal of other melle types.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whatever changes that are made to increase the damage output of Wizards post 50 should IMO be to an extent mirrored for <BR>the Mage class and for the Druid class.  The damage difference in so far as DDs are concerned between these classes has so <BR>far been a roughly 30 to eventually 50% greater amount of damage that Wizards can potentially do per cast.  This is as it <BR>should be.<P>The argument that Wizards do not have a pet and have nothing to hide behind is not a valid argument because wizards can <BR>root and stun and have a host of spells for defense.  All of these capabilities are not available to Mages.<P>To simply say that DDs are not "good enough" in SoV or planes and should be upgraded for only "Wizards" is rather unfair.  <BR>How about Mages and Druids?  To suddenly have Wizards doing 60 to 100% more damage then me per cast would make <BR>me as a mage even less desired in a group unless mage spells were also scaled up accordingly.. the same for Druids.<P>It should also be taken into account that Wizard DD spells are more mana efficient and take less time to cast then the ones <BR>mages receive.<P>For this reason when comparing a Wizard to a Mage you can say a mage got pets in exchange for far less choices and on <BR>average DDs that are substantially less powerful and no defenses except for Gate.  This is a massive trade-off.  To further <BR>reduce the desirability of Mages by giving Wizards even more powerful DDs without scaling mage and Druid DDs would be <BR>a serious disservice.  I am not advocating for the same DDs.. just a scalable increase to what Wizards receive if they receive <BR>anything.<P>A far better idea would perhaps be to wait on making any power increases.. infact why not instead design the next expansion <BR>so that mages and wizards are more required in groups.  Having lots of summoned, or slightly melee resistant mobs that <BR>require fire (mage) and cold (wizard) DDs to die and having the HPs of these mobs be lower then SoV would be a great <BR>idea.  This way melee and healer classes will not be upset.  let the melee/healers have SoV.  Let current the planes belong to <BR>the Enchanter and the melee/healers but if new expansions (maybe next 2) were the realm of the Mage and the Wizard i think <BR>it would be great.<P>These are just my opinions and obviously not ones some agree with.<P><BR>Rthen Majere<BR>Level 54 Elementialist<BR>Guildleader - Nightwatch of Norrath<BR>Saryrn<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. Fix rain spells. They should not hit pets and are resisted way to much.<P>2. Alkabor spells are just worthless. Many others have suggested ways to fix them.<P>3. I dont want to Nerf other classes, but when a shammi can out nuke me with a bracer, and a magi does the same with a staff - both have pets too. Compensate us or nerf them. You did admit the bracer was a mistake?<P>4. Make the Wizard spell Thundarbold a Point Blank spell. It would make this spell usefull I think.<P>5. The Wizard Sword spell. Make it work against the ubermobs - 1 AE or Rippost dead. As is. the Sword spell is utterly useless.<P>6. We need mana faster to be effective in groups, even with enchanters in the group we need to regain mana faster. As is we are the least desired class for a experience group.<P>7. Lure spells still do not work right. If they are working as intended then we have been nerfed again. Please Fix.<P>8. Atols Spectral Shakels and other Alteration based spells fizzle way to much ( mentioned allot).<P>9. SoV super mobs. A spell that takes a percentage of Mob hitpoints spell sounds good. I think the sword spell was intented for these incounters, was it? If so, its useless.<P>10. Across the board damage increases to our spells. This is a balance issue, it is all we bring to a fight. It is either faster mana regeneration or more damage per spell or less mana used per spell.<P>In conclusion, to balance wizards against the current level of other classes our damage output must be increased. This can be done via items such as the bracer/staff shamans/mage get or can be done through spells tweaking or mana regeneration increases. <P>Thank you for reading my post. Good luck.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>Being a wizard I have had a long, hard road to get where I am today. I have solo'd and I have grouped. I have kited, group kited, traditional grouped, dungeon crawled, and Area of Effect grouped. I know each and every spell we get up to my present lvl (52), and every spell line is just furthered along at a high lvl save our pet spell so I can speak with some authority. <BR>Please keep this to specific issues, ideas, and remedies for specific problems. This will only get Verant's attention if we can keep this within these parameters. So let's start the ball:<P>1)Direct damage spells. This is the bread and butter of the wizard class. we get more, different resist type, faster casting, innately less resisted afer 35 spells than anyone. However, the amount of damage at early lvls makes playing a wizard not only too challenging, but also has other classes doing more damage at every spell lvl up to 34. This should not be the case ever. I propose minor, and I mean minor, changes so that every lvl increase the wizard will always out hit any other offensive caster. I don't care if it's 5 points at lvl 34 or 1 point at lvl 9, a wizard should always be able to focus energy into one powerful blast more than any other caster.... Period.<P>2)Rain series- Originally 3 waves doing damage to 4 targets each round. Changed to 3 waves doing damage to a maximium of 4 targets. Problems- it hits pets and wastes a shot, mana ratio is horrendous. Solution add an indicator to pets such as &lt;flag pet=rain aoe no&gt; that will allow all pet classes to be uneffected by this and any other AoE spell. Moderate increase to the mana/damage ratio for spells between lvls 1 and 52. Spells post 52 are fine damage wise.<P>3)Proposed change to quadkiting. I don't care about quadkiting. I have done it, will continue to do it as long as the game mechanics allow it, however, nerfing AoE's in general to solve a relatively inconsequential issue that affects less than 1% of your game by hurting multiple lines of spells is not a good decision. if you want to lessen duration of a snare for druids to a wizards timeframe, you'd see that quadkiting has serious risks involved for the reward.<P>4)Change the way the z-axis works. when casting such spells as shadowstep, fade, etc.; the z-axis will not allow a caster to move up ever. This can not possibly be the way that this spell line was meant to be used, as it stands right now, they spells are regulated to the back of a spellbook unless you are going to be on flat terrain, and even then they are risky to for sure. In case you haven't noticed, flat terrian in not common in ANY zone, outdoor zones included. Solution Make a fixxed z-axis parameter for such spells. I understand that you don't want casters going to places that mobs can't touch them, I also understnad that simply removing those places would solve this whole problem, but if that is too hard to do, simply making the spell check for x axis range, y axis range, then determine if the coordinates of that location are within the z-axis parameter, then port. if not then move furthest position away from caster allowed z-axis condition. example you are on a mountain and root just broke, you cast shadowstep. you are at location 100, 100, 150. the random generator for the spells spits out a location of 150, 124, 500 but 500 is too high. Have the spell check for the highest point of z-axis closest to 500 and port to that location. IF you have to fix one axis point (x or y) to make the computation easier, so beit. but as it stands right now, if you were trying to use that spell on a mountain, you were dead before casting.<P>5)Do something with the Al'kabor line of spells. Every wizard, and I do mean every wizard knows that these spells are complete junk. I don't mean, occasional use, I don't mean, take out greens, I mean worhtless. Period. Adjust the mana/damage ratio, make them stun, make them blind, make them...... useful. As it stands right now these are not used at all. Parse a game log of any server on any day, if you see that spell being used, it's being used by a NPC.<P>6) Eye series. Marginal usefulness at best, and quite frankly nothing but a "fun' spell. the only problem with this spell is it aggroes. If you want this spell to be a scout, make it not aggro. if you wnat this spell to be something other than a way of taking a picture of yourself, make it non aggro. I don't want a pet, if I did, I'd pick a mage. <P>7)which brings me to our flaming sword. Why? What is this spell? It's not a status symbol, you can't just cast it for show, it has to have a target. It's not for a tank, one hit and it dies. What is this? A 700 pt mana drain. You should have named it Al'Kabor's flaming sword then we'd know what you were doing.<P>8)Cost of manskin/diamond skin. Why are these the same? Manaskin is a very useful spell and I could easily justify spending the 11+pp on one, but diamondskin? Change the component to something more inline to what it actually should cost. we go from 1pp jasper, to 11pp peridot. I think somewhere around 6-8pp would be perfect.<P>9)Abscond/Evacuate. These spells are misleading to say the least. they are not to save a party. at thier lvls, mobs are summoning, if you cast this, you get 5 people half a zone away, and one unlucky person stuck deep inside. Evacuate also sucks 600 mana from everyone in the group, so again, this is not a spell that alot of people are willing to use. So you are then left believing that this is a travel spell, first personal, then for groups. Well, to be a useful travel spell, they would have to transport you somewhere useful. in some zones that is true, in others that is just plain not the case. Solution-<BR>If you want this to be a travel spell, drop the mana drain and make some of the port spots make more sense. Take WK for example. you port into WK, tell your group you are going to cast Evacaute. Laughter ensues. why? becuase it right next to the WK/NK border. If they wanted to go to NK, they'd have ported there to begin with. That safe point should be by the tree with the NPC almost to Qey hills. Dreadlands should be right outside KC, NOT by the druid/wiz pads. if they wanted to go there, we'd just cast the portal. Make them make sense and we'd use them alot more. If they are not for travel, but for a lifeline out of a dungeon, then make them port you to RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DUNGEON. That way you won't have a problem with people casting this just to clear aggro in the dungeon, make them actally have to do the dungeon again.<P>10)More spells per level with wider resistance types. At most levels we only get one DD, meaning sometimes you have to go down many, many levels to get a spell that will work against a mob's resistance type. Also, those earlier spells are very inefficient mana wise, so you really pay a high cost just to get a spell that will stick. I really don't want to use comparisions to make my point, but this one has to be made. At almost every level, A mage gets multiple pet-types so that he can pick which type of fight he wants. We need a similiar ability. Make them research. replace all Al'kabor spells with DD spells, if file size is an issue, but the simple fact is we need atleast 2 types per spell lvl to choose from. This will allow only going down one spell lvl to get a spell vrs resist.<P>11) Fizzle Rates. Certain spells (Atol's spectral shackles for instance) have a abnormally high fizzle rate making them not only very costly, but unpredictable and therefore not used. Why would one use Atol's when it fizzles 5 times, taking more mana, and allowing the creature to get entirely too close, when you could use bonds of force? Atol's is a great spell that lasts longer and slows the Mob(s) longer, but, with our spellline, we are all about fast damage, not about DoT's. Basically every upgrade to snares/roots that we have are just more mana hunrgy, mariginally more effective for what they do.<P>12)Critical Hit spells. An idea that has been kicking around for a long long time. What I propose is nothing more than just letting us see when the specialization kicks in. something along the lines of UberMoB_01 has been wracked by deadly shards of Ice (normal text same spell color) now with crit cast UberMoB_01 has been Critically hit by deadly shards of Ice (white text along the lines of a crit hit) you still don't have to show damage, but this would go a long way to showing us when a specialization kicks in, allow other party members to see a wizard do something cool,  and just plain increase our class prestige without changing ANYTHING about the way the spell works, damage, or specialization.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To TOOLFreak (and others still asking for '% of hp dd's')...<P>The point with SoV mobs is that number of HP should be the new baseline for how 'tough' that mob is. Not how hard it hits, not resistances and not AE spells it casts - those are 'extras' to be used to make encounters unique (and therefore to make players think about tactics).<P>By wizards requesting a '% of hp' dd you are immediately voiding this way of making mobs tougher. This is NOT a good thing.<P>I agree that SoV mobs with vast hp further shift the balance of power to meleers as they can do sustained damage for very small amounts of indirect mana (that mana being cleric mana). However wizards (and other casters) would be able to do significant damage quickly if the SoV mobs were tuned correctly (i.e. their ridiculous MR was reduced), this IS a worthwhile contribution. Just because wizards are the masters of DD's doesn't mean they should be the most damaging class in the game against ubermobs.<P>Personally I think if ubermobs were designed properly then many encounters would make meleers all but punch bags (can you say AE uberturgur?) the meleers would still be their taking damage but the damage to the ubermob would be done by casters. Sure it may need waves of casters zoning in and out (to med) but why shouldn't some mobs require this sort of tactics (it neatly gets around many LD problems to). A wizard should be able to do in excess of 10000dmg very quickly if mob resistances were lowered to acceptable levels. It's pathetic that a wizard's most powerful spells can't be used on the most powerful mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BALANCE<P>The designers of EQ claim they made the classes with "how they would fit into a group" in mind.<P>So lets break this down:<P>Clerics: required in every group...obvious reasons.<P>Enchanters:  required in every group...obvious reasons.<P>Bards:  not required but very sought after and useful.<P>Druids / shamans: very desired in groups for Dots, heals, sow, nukes, buffs etc....<P>Tanks:  warriors, monks, rogues ...these include hybrids too like sk's, rangers, Pallys, much needed in groups as meat shields, damage dishers, taunters, warriors have disciplines, monks can FD pull dish mass damage, rogues are now very powerful with the damage they dish out and evade, pallys can taunt, heal, buff, rangers can heal, buff, sow,  Sk's can Feign death pull.<P>Necromancers:  Very useful in groups, can mana dump, have fast mana regen, good DoTs, good pets.<P>Magicians: useful in groups, good pets, good damage, useful summoning things like thier mana rods etc. and other useful items, have good damage shields.<P>Now for the Wizard:<BR>Why would a group want a wizard?  What can they do that another more useful class cant?  All they can do is nuke, and this is offset by thier high taunt so they don't nuke very much.  They med and chip away for little shots of 600 at the end of a fight so the mob doesnt ping pong onto them.<P>Noone wants or needs a wizard in thier group when another class is available.  <P>THIS IS UNBALANCED<P>How to fix?  I think there are some great suggestions in these two long threads.  Hopefully Verant is serious and really interested in making the wizard a more balanced, useful and important to groups class. <P>I think they need to ask the question, "why would  group desire a wizard in thier group?"  This is important when considering the question of balance.  If they are supposed to be artillery, then fine, give them some REAL artillery that uses less manna and make them more effective.  Dont give them these piddly little nukes that happen to cast a couple seconds faster then a druids.  A druid can still Dot, nuke, heal, sow, buff... a wizard has high taunt and can't nuke that much anyway in a group situation.<P>Wizards need something...more then any other class needs anything, that much is for certain.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will admit i havent read all the posts, there are a number of ideas of how to fix our class or at least make them more viable to a group, multi group setting.<P>I will give my thoughts, and ideas, again they may just be repeats of other posts.<P>1) A familiar, non combatant pet, that gives a self only or group friendly ability. Is requested that the familiar not be mob agroable. However, certain spells such as ae, ect may indeed kill this. It is expected with something of this nature, that the loss of this pet will have reprucisions of some sort, ie loss of health, or even mana.<P>2)A percentage damage spell (what i believe will be most useful), that costs alot, may have a long recast time ect. But would be useful for the encounters of higher lvl mobs. For balance issiues, i dont think there would be much problem. Considering that casting subsiquent spells would always do far less damage, as well as cause a major agro, insures that the spell line cant be abused. I'd like to see it begin as a lvl 49 spell, and increase at certain lvls. EX: 49 = 2% damage, 55 = 3-5 % damage, 60 = 5-10% damage. Alot of things can be done with it even if it were 10%, it would also be very easy to make this spell where it cant be abused.<P>3)Our normal spells that are already in game during most lvls (not counting lvl 49-50 area) are not really as powerful as they should be. Many classes have the dd ability, and yet they also add alot of extra stuff to a group. As wizards we can add nothing to the group other then dd, for this reason we should do substanialy more damage. We are weak from the onset, more then most, and when we get higher, we simply find we just catch everyone, and are not more powerful at all. In fact since the release of Kunark, many melees have gained the ability to out damage the masters of damage. There is something inherantly wrong with that (imho).<P>4)We need something of use to groups, and this acounts for all lvls, not just lower, nor just high end. Yes at a certain time with proper equip we can solo, but most i believe would more enjoy grouping, but that isnt an option now because we can offer nothing to agroup other then AE dd's. With that said, circumstances must be right to even use that succesfully, or a total party wipe out will be inevitable. I leave this point open for all to think on, what can we recieve that doesnt unbalance us, yet makes us more group friendly?<P>5)Defence.. from the books that come with the game and other sources, Wizards are supposed to be a master of this as well as dd. Yet we recieve no spells similar to Harmshiel "necro", or Divine Aura "cleric". I do not believe this would be unbalancing for us to recieve these line of spells, or at least one of them at an apropriate lvl. (lvl 25 or below) On the same notion of defence, we are a master of magical defence, mana skin gives us that to a very good extent. However i believe stun spells would be more apropriate to our class, being as we already have some. Can the number of stuns be increased on a lvl basis like are skins/Buffs? Again i do not see an unbalancing issiue here, no one is going to mem 8 stuns. Its just not feasable nor is it mana efficient. But it would help us defensivly.<P>These are my opinions, and im sure others can agree with them. Would like to get a responce from others as well as Verant employees.<P>Valgav Gaav, 50 Wizard - Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
