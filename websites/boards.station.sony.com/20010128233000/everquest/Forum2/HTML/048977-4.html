</FONT><HR>Haha these are great. What did I do...<P>Made a dwarf warrior, and ran around BB. Thought I was so badass when I made lvl 4. I ran up the side of the zone and fell for lethal damage. Got a lot of "LOL look at that idiot who just died from falling off the zone wall!".<P>Also at lvl 4 decided I wanted to see east commons. I died. Find myself back in Kaladim, with the 20 min corpse timer ticking. AAAH! I was so scared I was going to lose my corpse. I waited 10 mins for the boat and knew it was over. So I told one of my group members to please drag my body (back when /consent let them loot). I was biting my nails in fear that she would loot and steal my valuable tattered armor. But she was honest, and I still remember her name in thanks. I didn't even know about the bind spell!<P>Dying to brownies in lfay at lvl 7.. another time when I thought I was going to lose my corpse for sure. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Goofs I did with my first character, a halfling cleric:<P>- Put some bonus points in Int, to help me with trade skills. (I played UO before)<BR>- Got lost in Misty Thicket and tried to get my bearing by climbing up the ladder in the tall tower (close to Rivervale). Still lost. Tried to climb back down the ladder. Fell to death.<BR>- Moved from Misty Thicket to West Commons. Got into a fight I couldn't win. Saw non-halfling guards in the distance. Clicked on them while running towards them to see whether they were friendly to me. Arrived barely alive in front of the guard. Guard was still targeted and autoattack still on.<BR>- Continued to try to make money from trade skills and learned smithing in Freeport. (Did I mention I played UO before this?)<BR>- Bought ringmail armor from a vendor.<BR>- Moved to Qeynos for the SSoL quest and started exploring Blackburrow. Hey, there is a hollow tree close to where you come in, I wonder what's in there. Fell into the pit trap there. Landed softly in a lake and was happy. Until I found out that the lake was surrounded by rather unfriendly gnolls and I had no idea how to get back to the entrance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Well the some else soon came along to Investigate and the whole horde with Varsoon went after them well I was sooooo overweight thet I got left far behind and booked as soon as the charm wore off lol the rest all died when thier charm wore off.<P>At level 10 my friends all being 50 gave me a barbed leather whip and I rem thinking can there be a more impressive weapon. Then Running into a guy in qeynos sewers that was wearing full blackened iron armor and had a pgt and a bladed thulien claw- I was thinking wow I will do everything I can to be that cool one day =-)<P>Yeah I looked down the well in Befalled and fell in I think ALOT people have done that.<P>I rem my first trip to guk they came and got and took me to the magi room and some one trained the lord to us and the Magi popped at the same time and everyone said RUN! I stayed thinking I'll just die atleast I won't lose my body somewhere. They all ran taking the magi and lord with them to the zone I was there about a 2 minutes before they came back and killed me if I would only thought about camp to clear agro sigh. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Hehe he said ok but never did it and got to 32 freshly dinged before he saw the errors of his ways. He asked me you should have made me remap it lol.<P>We wanted to see the Ogre city so all went to a friends house and he started an orge while we watched. He logged on and said let me get a better look around and backed up fell off the balcony where he had started and died! He started yelling who starts on a balcony?? While we rolled on floor and couldn't stop laughing for 10 minutes and he just got madder and madder saying that is not funny. <P>Went down into Qeynos sewers hearing, "Run! Run! Shieldstan is loose!". Me thinking can that be a big deal? Well I ran into him near the zone couple hits and I was dead. Kept on zoning in and trying to loot and he kept killing me. Finally a friend said he can't see thru invso. WOW got him to invso me and started to drag the body when poof invso dropped. I made it all the way to the zone out. Hmmm well atleast for that week the sewers weren't crowded but there were a huge pile of bodies next to zone in but I would make my friend log on to invso every day until the next update when he was gone and I thought someone musta had him chase them off to somewhere and I was always scared to run into him around every corner after that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-not knowing that the chat box played an important role, who wants to hear what people say anyway right?<P>-going to Nro with my lvl 7 pally, its dark and get slain by a madman - was in /shout and /ooc for someone to help me find my corpse because some PC was mean and killed me.  Got the corpse and wanted to keep exploring, asked someone to help.  They offered camo, I said I had no room in my inventory for it.  I didn't know you fight other things than monsters.<P>-Thought fishing was a good trade skill, spent many hours and thought I was cool when I finally got a rusty dagger.  Was thinking I could fish all day and make loads of coinage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I remember back about 8 months ago when I was playing with my (now long deleted) necro in Steamfont, killing the skeletons at the Dragon skelly near the Ak'Anon zone.  I was level 9 at the time and was making great xp, when I see a level 10 necro walk up and take on a skelly using his hands.... and win!  The guy was fully twinked with an SMR, Plat Tiara, +int gear and other interesting things that my twinks would love to have...  I strike up conversation and find out that he is a ten year old who's brother is letting him play...  He had no idea about pets and spells.  He had over 1k in cash on him, so I quickly show him where to buy his spells...  later on that day, his brother logged on and sent me tells how I had ruined his fun, since he could no longer watch his brother play a "Necro-Tank"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Sal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The path led right through Kithicor forest, but with my trusty drum I was able to outrun anything Kith threw at me.<P>November 3, 1999...running along the path through Kith (dumb noob that I was had NEVER run a wall anywhere!) - a zombie corporal hits you for 90 damage...I lose my song...then I think a zombie cleric opened up and **poof!** loading, please wait... Only after did I hear about Halloween in Kith...it is still an undead hell - but none of my characters has ever died there again! It was hell getting my bard's corpse back as it was off the beaten track by the time I died...but did and never ran the path again :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048977-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048977&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048977&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
