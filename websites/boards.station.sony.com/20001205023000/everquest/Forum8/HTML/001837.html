I know Halas is the right place for it, but I am still a newbie and have read alot of info that says you shouldn't start until after you've gained several levels.

</FONT><HR>Good question. With my new toons, I pickup a sewing kit as soon as possible (I could afford one at lv 3), and put 1 point into tailoring at my guild. I also buy a stack of cap patterns at this time. When I loot<BR>2 spiderling silks = 1 silk thread (allways succeedes)<BR>2 spider silks = 1 silk swatch (allways succeeds), then you make a raw silk cap. 2 skill checks for the price of 1 =)<BR>3 silk threads = 1 silk cord (I think)<BR>The silk cords can be used to make tailored bags. But I don't know ther recipie.<BR>1 Ruined Wold Pelt + 1 Cap Pattern = cap<P>Etc, you get the picture. As you loot items, make something with them immidiately, as this will save you space in your inventory. SO my inventory has in it a large sewing kit, a stack of patterns, and a stack of silk cord (and a skinning knife when I can get one). Keeps your inventory pretty clear of tradeskill clutter, while giving you the ability to turn a lot of the junk loot you find into skill checks on tailoring.<P>Using this method, I was able to get my skill into the 30s pretty quickly while going about my leveling business. Then I skipped the leather armor steps and went straight to cured silk, as the spider silk is much easier to obtain than making studded leather, or banded. But as you are also planning on becoming a smith, and metal studs are now stackable, go ahead and make the leather armor.<P>Depending on my financial situation at the time, I either sold the armor I'd made to a vendor, or gave it to a newbie. When I couldn't do that, I gave it to a bat in a newbie zone (about half the time, the mob will drop it when killed). <P>Hope this answers your question.<P>Zaros Trainstopper 39th level Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I personally think that anything beyond 26 skill you should wait until you can hunt Crag Spiders in EK (around 18th lev min in a group).  Otherwise you will take absolutely FOREVER to get enough silks to advance rapidly.  Second choice is carrion spiders in EK, then dune tarantulas in Ro.<P>Not sure if any of the new ruined pelt bag recipes will increase you beyond 26, but use them as far as you can.<P>Raw silk isn't too bad, but cured takes a TON of silk to get through, and the heady kiola cost can add up quick with the failures.<P>Of course there's studded, but I think MQ pelts are far too rare to make these viable, and studs are a pain in the rump.<P>Vivid Dreamings, Master Tailor (104)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AnthonyHobbs method is the fastest way to progress that I have found, and a variation can be used in any trade skill. (With smithing,. make metal bits and attempt a toolbox with each success to skill up faster).<P>Practically speaking,. you will level your character alot faster NOT concentrating on the trade skills, but rather using them to maximize your return on low value looted items like ruined pelts and spider(ling) silk as you gain experience. You can spend more time on trade skills after experience slows down at mid level. <BR>Don't count on ever getting rich off the trades,. the game is not designed for that. The trades are fun at first and you get some satisfaction from making your own armour, but you can loot much better stuff than you can make. Trades are good for twinking your secondary characters tho.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I saw this thread after i responded to another so i hope you dont mind a cut/paste after an addition to it...  the recipe for bags/pouches is 1 cord &lt;made with 3 silk threads&gt; and ANY   NON- Ruined pelt.  I used LQ bear, polar, puma&lt;off of snow leopards&gt; etc to make the Bags and dropped them in the newbie area as i succeeded  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> My lvl 52 shammie started it as a lark 2 weeks ago and im now a measly 35 in tailor    BUT  i didnt spend a copper workin the skill so far  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Anyways, here is my previous rambling post...I for one have to agree that Everfrost is a great place to work tailoring. small spideys silks abound ! Heck i didnt wanna buy anythin to work my skill and so far so good.. take silks and make bandages, when those triv take 3 silks and make cords then use all those Non- Ruined &lt;ie polar, puma, LQ and a cord to make bags. and so on then you have the Lg spideys which are found all over to make swatches with etc. Everfrost is a great zone to raise your char, i have started chars all over the world and got them to EverFrost as soon as was feasible because of the abundance of possibilities for all ages in growth.<BR>Silks and the new coding making all types of pelts drop off almost all types of bears was an incredible boost. I sat at 3 igloos in Everfrost one day with my pup&lt; mass killin with pup as long as no one was around &gt; &lt; if any new person showed up i quickly buffed em and helped em out  I netted 7 HQ pelts off of cubs !!!!!!! and Lots of LQ etc pelts to practise with ! Thats in one days playin round. Lucky me my mates tailorin is a bit better then mine and he managed to make a few 10 slot packs for us.<BR>Regardless, Everfrost has my vote for the zone with it all !!!! plus the only campin goin on in this zome is the Ice Giants at Permafrost entrance and sometimes the Icy Orcs.<BR>Spideys both big and small, wolves, all size bears, kittys &lt;snow leopards&gt; all can be found in abundance, especially the spiderlings to start tailoring etc.<BR>I'd like to thank Big V again for increasing the ' critters they can be dropped on ' scale as in the bears, tis very cool that all bear types have the possibility to drop all various pelts. And Kudos for makin it possible for more to start the skill without a cash flow investment , instead being able to use found loot to practise the skill.<BR>/em CHEERS !<BR>Respectfully, <BR>Dracthia SoulBlazer Mystical Wench of The Rathe<P> <BR>All times are PT (US)<BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>In retrospect, I'd start right away with patchwork, then stop. You can make yourself patchwork and sell some to vendors and players while you are still getting xp from the critters with the ruined pelts.<P>I'd not do ANYTHING after that with tailoring until level 20 or so when doing crag spiders in east karana or the spiders in guk. Trying to kill regular spiders to get silk for raw silk is a big waste of time.<P>The levels up to 20 or so could be well spent leveling and raising brewing to later make the kiolas for the cured silk (easy since all ingredients on vendor just about)<P>I say 20 because I wasted TONS of time trying to get silks to make raw silk before I was 20, never adding many points really due to the lack of silk until then anyway. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now.<P>If you are not twinked, the best thing you could possibly buy with your first few coins is a tailoring kit.  Everfrost is the best place for a newbie who can wear armor. Outfit yourself with patchwork while the bears still give you experience, and you will save a bit of that newbie gold.  You can also turn a modest profit (about half a gold per piece) on the armor, which is a few silver more than the ruined pelts would yield unworked.<P>Even as my main gains sufficient wealth to twink his brothers up, I always make the first suit of armor for myself when i start a new character. It makes that new character a bit more self-reliant.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tailoring became a lot easier since they included spiderling silk in the recipies, and Everfrost is a great place for silks and ruined pelts from polar bear cubs.  I would suggest to concentrate mainly on the spiderling silk to build your skill.  Making your own armor is great (all my characters start with Tailoring just to get the patchwork), but pelts don't stack, and to a newbie, 5sp is a lot of money for a pattern.  Besides, Cindi gives patchwork in exchange for polar bear pelts - a nice low level quest.  When you become more financially stable switch to pelts and patterns.<P>Later on (around level 20 or so), get yourself a skinning knife and a file(easy blacksmithing task...FP has the molds and ore for them), then head to Highpass and E.Karana.  Now that studs stack, make a couple stacks of them in Highpass...no mold necessary, just metal bits, water, and the file.  Buy the same number of mask patterns and head down the ramp.  E.K. is a tailor's paradise!  The lions there drop HQ cat pelts with surprising regularity, and the carrion and crag spiders drop spider silk usually 2 - 3 at a time.  Use the skinning knife to lower the HQ pelts you get to MQ, then make studded masks.  Sell them to the vendors in the zone to keep your inventory clear.  HighPass also has everything you need to make heady kiolas, and with all the spiders you're killing, you'll have plenty of swatches for cured silk.  In a couple nights (about 6 hours total) of intensive carrion spider killing, I acquired over 40 swatches for tailoring.  (Plus...carrion spiders drop halfling parts for those of us who like to prepare the more "unusual" dishes in the cookbooks!)  <P>Crestfall</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001837&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001837&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
