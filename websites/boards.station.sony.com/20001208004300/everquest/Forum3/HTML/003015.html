</FONT><HR>Bard songs are having some horrid problems.  I play a 46 bard and have been having a wretchid time of it.  Just wanted to post here so you guys can get it ironed out before it goes live.  A bard starts up a pulsing song, while it's playing it comes up with the message that your song has ended abruptly(like you have been bashed).  However although the jewels pop back in, your song continues to play.  You cannot start another song, nor end the one that is currently playing.  The only way I was able to get the song to end was to click on one of my songs about 30 times, or summon up some water with my singing steel boots.  It is a widespread problem as since my bard was one of the highest levels on the server that was not anon I got a TON of tells from lower levels asking what to do about the problem.  Other than that the new hotkeys etc are working wonderfully. <P>One other small glitch, on one of my computers I kept going linkdead and the only way I could stop the linkdeath from occuring was by saying something.l  I know it sounds freakish, but it was happening to 2 other people as well.  This was happening on my machine with my Geforce video card, but was not happening with my voodoo.  I disabled sound with the nosound file and that did not rectify the problem.<P>Anyways, tell the developers to keep up the good work.  This next patch should blow the folks on the production servers away =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>FWIW, this can happen at seemingly any time. I've had it happen while running place to place with selo's, while sitting, and during combat. Generally took about 30 seconds to a minute for the "Your song ends abruptly" message to come up.<P>Also, if your framerate is poor, you can't seem to start/stop the song on and off fast enough to stop the bugged song. During heavy combat or sitting in the midst of 40 PCs, you must stare at the ground to max framerate so you can cycle the song quickly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this is related or not, but maybe...  Also, I'm on E'Ci, so this is not a Test-only thing...<P>Last night I was running around charm kiting HG's (was waiting on a friend to log in to port me to Kunark).<P>Right in the middle of battle, I THOUGHT I had accidentally deleted one of my memmed songs (ie. I right-clicked it, or so I thought).  But the song icon remained up in the spell icon slots of memmed songs.  So I figured I must have missed and didn't delete it.  So charm fades and I attempt to recharm.  Song ends abruptly.  Try again, same thing.  Tried clicking on it like 30 times rapidly, song will not complete a pulse.<P>So I ran a good distance away and deleted the song and rememmed it.  Works fine now.  Maybe it was just a client/server confusion thing.  Maybe the client thought I had forgotten the song but the server didn't get the message.<P>All in all, it could be dangerous in certain situations, but I've never encountered it before.<P>Olgwinn Pendragun<BR>Bard of 46 Missed Notes (working as intended)<BR>E'Ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Last night I made a bard on test server and played a couple of hours with numerous instances of stuck songs.  I would get the message "Your song ends" but the song would continue playing.  Clicking the song gem did not clear the problem.  The /stopsong command did not clear the problem.  Sometimes I could clear it by repeatedly (like 20 to 30 times) clicking the song gem.  Sometimes I had to camp to clear it.  <P>Also, there were several times when I could not get a song started even after 30 or 40 tries. Clicking on the song gem would result in the message "your song ends" even though no song had been playing.  It was extremely frustrating.  <P>I hope you fix this before going live with it.  I play a level 33 bard on one of the live servers and it would be almost if not completely impossible to play with this type of bug occurring so frequently.<P>Eftov</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have only run into this bug once, but it would seem I'm lucky.<P>I was with a group fighting in the Lake of Ill Omen on the Nameless one night when I found that I couldn't start a song.<P>All my song gems were visible, but when I would hit one, they would only grey out for a second, then they would all come back.<P>Then after a bit I realized that Selo's was still "on"... I was getting the "your feet move faster" message.<P>I cleared the issue by zoning.  Didn't try "spam clicking" and didn't need to camp (though there may be issues like plane raids where camping is a better option than zoning).<P>It seems that what happens is that the client side ends a song, and then the message never makes it to the server.  But since the client thinks the song is off, it only sends the "start" message... and the server knows that's not right and ignores it.  At zone/camp, the song turns off on both sides.  Spam clicking might "trick" the client into sending the "off" message when it thinks the song is already off.<P>Now it would seem that some change on Test has made this situation far more likely.  I have barely started a bard on Test, so I can't comment on that, or the new frequency of the abrupt ending.<P>Hope this helps!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I think it is all summed up well here in another post(below).  This comes down to the new feature that is in place, "Your song ends abruptly".<P>While playing in the ToT I noticed the core song system has changed. There is now a chance on every song pulse, including the first pulse, that the song will end abruptly ("Your song ends abruptly").<BR>Currently this turns off the song on the client, but leaves it on on the server, resulting in the song cycling but the gems are visible. It also causes the well known stuck song bug. We can assume the stuck song part will be fixed before it hits the live servers.<P>What concerns me is the end result of this. Once the bug is fixed, songs will randomly stop. I had songs fail on the first pulse while twisting, after a few pulses, or after a minute. It's quite random.<P>What is the reason for this change? I can't imagine it's an accident, considering there is a new message for when it.<P>Effects of this include:<P>1) During buff cycles I tend to spend time afk. While afk cantana will stop. I don't look forward to having to babysit my level 60 bard for when he suddenly forgets how to sing.<P>2) While travelling I use Selo's Song of Travel. When the song stops, I will lose invis, speed, and I will fall. I can restart the song, but doing so breaks invis, and thus all the other effects. I know there is some confusion within the dev team about bards, and especially about invis, so to clarify, starting ANY song causes ANY invis to break, which in this case, means the entire song and all its effects go away. People say this song is too dangerous now, and I don't fully agree, but I certainly don't see a need to add additional risk. Note that singing regular selo's is not as bad, as regular selo's can be restarted without breaking anything, since invis isn't involved.<P>3) If afk underwater with enduring breath (Tarew's Aquatic Ayre) going, I am likely to be dead when I return.<P>4) Newbies may be saved from dying by their guards when they leave chords of dissonance going. If newbies aren't killed, their numbers will grow until food runs out, and they will starve. They must be killed to thin their numbers, for their own benefit. Stopping songs is inhumane!<P>5) Downtime while self healing with cantana or hymn of restoration will either be longer than normal or will require the bard to sit and watch.<P>6) Bard invis will be far less useful. One of the current advantages is, like rogue hide/sneak, the bard will stay invisible indefinitely unless he/she goes LD. This is not as good as necro/SK invis, who with the easy to get crown in Droga have permanent invis that stays even after LD. I currently use bard invis for the party when we need to rest up in a hostile area, typically when we move into an area with hostile roamers and have to res in place. Since the song would break randomly, the whole party would need to use an invis potion to stay invis whenever this happens. Using single target invis is thus better, since if it fails, only one person needs to use an invis potion, plus that person gets a specific notification about it, which isn't true for the bard song failure.<P>7) I will no longer be able to sing Cassindra's Elegy (+int/+wis) for trade skills while afk.<P>etc.<P>So my question again is this: why was this change made? What is the goal?<P>--Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Never seen this happen on the live servers Absor, not what they are talking about.  They are talking about the song ending abruptly (as it does when bashed) for no reason.  i.e. you are sitting in Qeynos playing Hymn to heal up and all of a sudden your song ends.  This does not happen on live which is why it was so apparent when it happened on test.  I tried it on test last night to be sure and yes, my hymn did drop with absolutely no outside influence.  Only 125 people on the server so lag was not an issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor -<P>The stuck songs are only half the problem, though.  It appears from posts that I've seen from the test server that you are attempting to add code that will cancel songs at arbitrary intervals.  My assumption is that you are trying to do this to prevent Bards from turning on a song like Chorus of Clarity (aka Mana Song) and leaving the keyboard.  Arbitrary song endings would mean that the Bard would have to remain at the keyboard to make sure that the song keeps going.<P>If this is your intent, you all had really better take a long deep breath and think about this very carefully.  You will create a stink the likes of which you have never seen before from Bards if you do something like this.<P>Yes, there are a (much smaller than you think) number of times that Bards can exploit singing a song and leaving the keyboard.  But for the most part, this is NOT an exploit.  It's simple parity with all other classes.<P>Example:<P>Enchanter casts Clarity on all casters in his party, then goes AFK for 30 minutes to smoke a cigarette, or eat lunch, or go to the hardware store.<P>For a Bard to give his party the same advantage, he needs to turn on the Mana Song.  Currently, he can then go AFK for 30 minutes, just like the Enchanter, and do whatever the Enchanter does when he's taking a break.<P>If you modify this code to add early song breaks, the Bard, and ONLY the Bard, will have to sit at his keyboard constantly without any break of any sort in order to maintain his utility in the party.<P>EVERY OTHER CLASS has naturally recurring times when they can take a break.  The Bard, by design, MUST be doing SOMEthing pretty much all the time in order to be useful.  That's the way the songs work.  That does NOT mean that the human beings who PLAY Bards should be punished by chaining them to the keyboard for the entire duration of their playing session.<P>The US Department of Labor tells us that we should walk away from a computer for 5 minutes every half hour or risk any of a long list of varied health complications.  Bards do this by turning on a buff song during downtime and taking a walk.  If you add random song endings to the game, WE CAN'T DO THAT AND REMAIN EFFECTIVE.  We will be the ONLY class that can't do that and remain effective.<P>This is not to mention the fact that early song breaks will render four more of our songs useless:<P>Invisibility.  We want our entire party to become visible simulaneously in some dangerous area and all die?  I don't think so.<P>Levitiation.  We want our entire party to fall to their deaths?  I don't think so.<P>51 travel song.  We want our entire party to become visible AND fall to their deaths?  I don't think so.<P>Underwater breathing.  We have about 30 seconds of leeway here, but otherwise, we want our entire party to drown?  I don't think so.<P>Yes, there are circumstances where you can exploit with a Bard to some limited degree.  But you can do EXACTLY the same thing with any other buffing class.  Log a Shaman on, buff, log him off.  Same difference.  To punish Bards and ONLY Bards would really infuriate me, and I'm sure I would not be alone.<P>Don't do this if that was what you were planning.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My sore fingers pray that this never makes it to the live servers.<P>Bad enough that during battle I am weaving 3 songs, pressing a button twice every 5 secs. This would require me to stay chained to the desk even during downtimes when I want to sing Hymn or Chorus of Clarity.<P>It's nice to be able to sit for 10 mins not doing anything and just rest.<P>If this code is being implemented to keep bards from maxxing out their instrument skills while they're afk for hours at a time, maybe it'd be better to set a max time that a song can be sung instead of just making them randomly cut off. (at least enough time to go to the bathroom, get a drink or something).<P>Just my 2 cents.<P>I'd agree with Kenross' points regarding what this would do to some of our key songs (invis, travel, levitate, enduring breath). It would definitely be a big contribution to ruining the bard class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Have a QA guy try this for an hour or so.<P>Also, theres another problem, which I believe is related to lag.<P>If you are twisting, and happen to start a song the instant after it stops, that song will end abruptly.<P>When I say start, I mean the affect takes place the instant after you get the "whatever fades" msg.<P>This should be easily reproduceable given the right amount of patience.

</FONT><HR>ok here's what i know about the bardic song locking bug as it is on the live servers right now. the bug happens when you start to experience packet loss but continue twisting, if you twist a song while experiencing packet loss your computer says your playing one song, and the server says your playing another so it stops the song on our side but the server doesnt get the stop singing command and since we dont have a casting time to run out on most songs it never gets a song done command while we keep sending the command to start a new song, which it conflicts with since we already are singing one according to it. there are two ways to fix this i have found, to log, or to unmem a spell will send the stop singing command, neither are too doable durring battle.<P>Elentiri Domelina of Tarew Marr<BR> Wandering Minstrel of the 21st Song</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I repeatedly tried to hit other spells from the hotkeys. they would grey and immediatly come back. The whole time I was getting the message your wounds begin to heal.

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor, what do you think about the bard class now?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> to think that was just 10 minutes in our shoes and we're "expected" to do that whenever we're in a group. Its even worse when we try to solo, but i have no need to do that so i dont bother with it. I hope you have gained a bit of respect for our wonderful little class and understand why we're a class for main characters, secondary chars dont get enough attention to be bards.<P>Elentiri Domelina of Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor!<P>Thx for the response!<P>I haven't seen the problem on Live servers at all.  Please note that the "stuck song" bug is not what we're concerned with here.  It's the "your song ends abruptly" that has appeared on test over the last few weeks!<P>Thanks again for catching this!<P>-Skyblaze<BR>Relieved Bard of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem seems to occure when there is a little lag, and the FPS drops right down (mana dump by a number of casters). But on the up side, it can be exploited, get stuck on bellow and you dont have to worry about having to keep re-starting it :P <P>As for this rumor about songs stopping at random, it's STUPED. It will do nothing but severly piss of not only Bards but everyone who enjoys grouping with Bards. If our songs stop at random, make meditate also stop at random! and make pets so they suicide at random! and all other buffs drop at random!<P>I can't see what Varient is trying to achieve here. By forcing bards to remain at the keyboard, people are going to get sick of their Bard and play another class. Is this what Varient wants? to completly remove the Bard class?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't play on test but I've had this bug hit from time to time on live servers, to some extent... I've had the songs stick, but trying to re-sing (or re-cast, as that has happened to my casters as well) doesn't give any message at all while the song gem flashes grey and pretends to be ready to sing something.  Particle effects (in the case of songs like Hymn or Selo's whose particles I can see on me) don't appear to be persistent.  The only ways to solve it appear to be a) mem a new song, any song, which forces a stop to singing, and b) log off and return.  I can't speak for others' experiences, but I suspect that this "your song ends abruptly" message on Test may be a slightly different, if related, issue.<P>  All that said, please fix this before it goes live - I've had times when Shauri's was the only thing between me and a grisly death, and I'd hate to have my bard (primary, of course) out of action for at least one, possibly more patch cycles.<P>Kasreyn, 26th lvl bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a bard on Test very regular and have done the /bug reports many times.  The last one I did was this past Sunday.  I was grouped with a fellow bard and we both have the same problem with this effect (read bug here).  This can happen while sitting AFK, while dealing with a merchant or NPC, while in battle or just moving around (running or swimming).  First the message "Your song ends abruptly.", then the icons are no longer greyed out, then the next message "Your feet move faster" or what ever message appropriate for the song that had been playing.  I tried the spam attack, it did not work for me.  It took either zoning or camping to fix everytime it happened. And it is happening with much more frequency now.  About a month ago, it started happening on rare occasions, then a couple weeks ago, it seemed to speed up.  Now, it is happening in almost every zone.  When it first started it was mostly selo's that got stuck.  Not so bad for me, my bard is only lvl 14 now and 12 or 13 when this started.  The songs I use most are Selo's (lvl 5), Hymn of Restoration, and Anthem de Arms.  This bug does affect these 3 songs for sure as each of them has been "stuck" at many points and in many zones.  My friend is a lvl 7 bard on Test.  She had problems with the same songs except Anthem.  She had the problem with Jonathon's Whistling War Song as well as the other 2 I mentioned.  Same messages, sometimes at the same time (tho not always).  We took to playing different songs, so that we could continue to hunt instead of having to zone each time it happened.  <P>Did not realize so many were having these problems, but I did do at least 2 seperate /bug reports on this problem.  Also, followed each up with a petition.  That last part is just because I am a stickler for details.  I know there are no GMs on to read the petitions.  If any want to check this out, by all means look for Iovely lvl 14 bard on Test.  I will be able to duplicate this bug within one hour max.  It usually starts about a half hour after I begin to play.  While grouped with the other bard, the problem seemed to accelerate very rapidly.  *shudder*  Please make it stop.  It isn't any fun to have to zone all the time, even if I do enjoy traveling.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't say that the songs seem to stop when there is a little lag. From what i have seen it is happening randomly, and mostly when you play a song for an extended period of time. <P>I believe this to be intentional, and so much for anyone not having their Brass skill up to snuff, because now, YOU ARE NOT gonna get it up to snuff, unless you can borrow some 20 points worth of Intelligence items ... I can hear Abashi saying ... what a great idea, that is!<P>Personally, I think that there are other solutions that do not hurt. With Kunark, and it's non-stop critter thing, you can very easily play the Mana song non stop and be fighting whatever in a group. In my opinion, this is only adding to the BULK in the code, and it is un-necessary. Anything that is causing it to stop, nerf or otherwise, is just adding to the amount of communication between the client and the server, and in that sense we are making things more difficult. Whatever happened to that KISS theory, anyway? <P>Almost all other Bard song skills I have no problem with, because they are "usable" while you play. When it comes to the Brass skill, though, it is a much different story, and having the song stop because of its 30 minute timer, or whatever, is not necessary, or rather prudish in my book. A player sitting somewhere playing this song, until his skill top's off at level 18, or again at level 26, or so, is really no big deal.<P>But what this is bringing attention to, more than anything else, is that Bards are discovering the power of the Brass songs like DDD at level 18. And being that with the skill top'd these songs are very strong, it is probably a better idea that we allow the song to stop, than to have the song nerf'd with a secondary resist and destroy it. Already as it is, the song begins to lose effectiveness in the mid twenties, as it becomes fairly obvious that you have to come up with a magical horn to be able to use the songs properly, or they will be resisted way too much. This I saw, quite plainly, at level 35 when I tried to use the DDD and the Horn and it was being resisted 75% of the time. With a magical Horn, this became closer to 15% resists I would say. I am not even sure that we have a mid level Brass instrument that we can get ... they are all high level drops.<P>Absor, Abashi, et al. Just be fair with us, is all we ask. Cosmetic adjustments could really be used in things that make your graphics look bad and outdated. To change some of these little things, is much more of an excuse than it is anything else. If you really want to kill the Bard, just do so, plz, because no one wants to be "secondary" and "submissive" to playing just one song for 25 levels of our career if we ever get there.<P>I just can't figure out why you create a class that can do so many things, and as it grows, instead of these abilities improving, like most spells in this game, they are basically taken away, and not allowed to be used anymore. What's the point? Either allow these abilities to shine, or at least give us a "SPECIALIZE" ability to select one discipline to master, so that we can add a very specific niche, other than a mana song, or a variation on that song later. Is that a lot to ask for?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I too have experienced the bard song bug and did report it accordingly about a month ago. From what I have seen the problem is this:<P>Upon being stunned/bashed you get the message 'your song abruptly ends' however the effect still appears in the main window and indeed still works across the party, however the song gems all become visible again, yet it still registers that there is a song playing so doesn`t let you start another. The only ways I have found to get around this are a) get stunned/bashed again, b)zone or c) camp and rejoin.<P>Hope that helps<P>Vanis Stormsong<BR>22nd Song Bard<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two issues debated in this thread:<BR>1) On test (People noticed during Test of Tactics finals) there apperantly is a new "feature" which can cause your song to end at anytime. This means that we now have to sit and watch for the song pulse messages even when we are not twisting song, but just singing mana song or hymn.<BR>Quite frankly this sucks and I can not belive that it is implemented with intent. I see no reason whatsoever to implement such a thing and hope that it will never reach the live servers.<P>2) Songs getting stuck.<BR>This is another problem and IMO not linked to issue 1 at all. I very rarely see it happen, but it do happen from time to time. Then again my Packet loss is mostly very low, even though I play from Europe, more precisely Denmark. When this bug occurs the only thing that helps for me is key squashing until it goes away. Quite annoying, but since it happens maybe once a month for me its no big issue. I crash back to desktop more oftenly. So fix that instead..<P>Musiker Silverdrum, bard o 42th song, bertox<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=003015&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=003015&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
