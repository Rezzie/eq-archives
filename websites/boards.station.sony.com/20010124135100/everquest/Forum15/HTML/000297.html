</FONT><HR>Everyone knows now that AC is king.  But I wanted to see opinions on 2 important stats for SKs, Str and Dex.  Str for damage and Dex for vampiric embrace/weapon procs/channeling (getting off that fear spell.)<P>I've seen various weapon analysis which suggests that str doesn't have a very large effect on damage output, but wanted to hear what ppl thought on this.  Seems with the heavy hitting 2h weapons we TSK's like to use that Str might be an important factor.  Hitting more often for max damage might not matter much for a Ranger's 6 18 weapon, but when you've got a Reaver at 20 base damage, those 50+ hits are impressive.  I have 4str 2int ears and a 3ac 3str collar where I'm currently sacrificing a lot of AC for Str.<P>Dex seems to be worth acquiring as well, currently have a grotesque mask ac3 7dex as a low ac piece that could be substituted.  But I will have a dex over 100 once I get a lizzie cloak.  Anyone find that to be worth it?  Currently training 1hs with a PGT, in case I ever get my hands on a Wurmslayer, hehe. So Dex helps my proc.<P>Where the difference is only 1 or 2 ac, I tend to go for stats.  e.g bracer of scavenging ac9 5dex 5sta vs darkforge bracer ac11 3dex. But what should I aim for?  Equal atk rating and ac, with 100 dex? Or do y'all swap out gear depending on role (damage dealer vs meat shield, long fights on big mobs like giants vs. ghoul casters in lower Guk.)<P>Currently at level 20 wondering what other SK's of higher level have field tested.<P>Gakek<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Go with AC first.  Str will not make a big improvement in damage output.  In my eyes str is mainly so you are not encumbered.  Dex is also one of the more useless stats in my eyes.  Go for AC first and know when to make sacrifices.  For example I am a DE so I use a TBB instead of a straw spun belt.  I am giving up 2 ac for 15 str.  I think this is a fair trade off for the races with less str.  If I did not have a TBB I would be encumbered more often.<P>Dex is another stat that I am not worried about.  Being a inkie my dex is ok without bonuses.  Basicly you should go for AC above all else for the most part. (soloing is the exception)  Stats don't mean much.  Make sure the stats are above 75 and you will be fine.  (btw DF bracer is ac 9 not 11 and I would go with the scavenging one because you will get a few more hps out of the sta, of course that you may want the DF for the looks)<P>As for swapping out items I normally only do this if I am on a dragon raid where certain saves are important or fighting alot of casters.  If I am not the main tank I might switch to a 2handed weapon to deal more damage if there aren't any casters I need to interupt with a shield.<P><BR>Basicly go for AC, then saves or hitpoints, everything additional is just iceing on the cake.<P>Kaelyna Darkashe<BR>53rd SK of Quellious<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Go ac like all the good sk tell you, they do it for a reason.<P>Erudite, dark elf, human:<BR>Human - best tank<BR>Dark elf - great tank<BR>erudite - week tank<P>Ok why are humans the best sk? well they got decent starting str, stamina and inteligence, the prim statistics for a shadowknight, however there are some other usefull stats like DEX and AGI that help, if you want to use those stats play a dark elf, they are better at it.<P>Dark elf are the king at AGI and DEX for shadowknights wich is good as they have low HP compared to the other shadowknights even human, but this isnt a problem! as your lv15 spell will take that HP difference right down in anything you are fighting or dualing.<P>Erudites do not make good tanks, i would either recomend dumping ALL points into INT and go necro mode, as you are not a tank, even then your int wont be usefull until lv15 when you get dots that are nice, then at 22 you can burn some mana, and again at 30 (doesnt get good to 30) one thing erudite sk MUST do is stay away from banded, with the smithed armour you can go for that nice erudite ringmail and fine steel plate if you desire, or even the Fielf plate, but what ever you do dont get bronze... its to heavy.<P>Trolls and ogres, now these are odd, they have high HP and STR wich makes them take the damage but not take it, i suggest dumping points into agi so you dont get hit less or dump all points into STA for HP or INT so you can cast.<P>Overview:<BR>The races are customisable, human being the most customisable, as you can go in any direction, STR, AGI, DEX, STA, INT as you have such even stats.<BR>Dark elf normally put points into STR to help with armour at low lvs, but to be honest once you get to darkfroge its so easy (get rid of bronze armour its to heavy, darkforge is ligher and the reaver now procs for you) so literaly put as many points into STR that will last you until lv30, spend points elsewhere.<BR>Erudite, this is tricky, you need to build ALL stats but then that makes you just the same if not worse than a dark elf with no unltravision, hide. Suggestion is to put into INT as there aint much else you can do to be honest, except look different.<BR>Trolls and ogre, well go for STA, DEX or AGI, i would recomend either go STA purely for a troll, just to boast an enormose HP or go AGI.. as a ogre you cant be stunned from the front, with agi you should be getting hit and stunned a lot less.<BR>For troll you dont need as many hp as you regen, the more hp the more regen you need to do, maby INT will increase downtime at later lvs? but sice lifetaps seem to be almost % driven at the moment, takes sama mana for a troll with base int as an erudite with 120+ int, thats almost double the int for no difference, but you cant fear as much  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So there we have it, outfit you SK to what race and how you want to play, i wouldnt worrie about damage, my human sk was hitting just under a troll sk with far superior str, but he was a few lvs higher than me, when i caught him up i was doing same damage, but i was tanking a whole lot better than him, getting hit less, had nigher ac.. as i went for ac instead of stats, and thats what counts, if you want to do melee damage then pick warrior and if you want spell damage pick a caster, shadowknight are neigher off these but make damn fine tanks.<P>To play a "tank" you need to take hits, that means have good HP, Good ac and be able to stick it out, the small race sk can get enormour advantages in early lvs due to armour restrictions, and at later lvs they made damn fine tanks, one of the best tanks i have seen was a human sk who put everything into AC, he had enough STR to carry his armour, and beefed melee stats, and had wonderfull INT so he could cast a lot off spells wich saved the group a lot of times instead of wasting them on nerfed spells<P>ALL race sk can be good, just remember you need to tank or you wont get a group, almost every dumb newbie warrior who put str can outdamage you so your damage wont get you into groups.<P>Anyone ever seen a dark elf use vampiric embrace, these guys are the king with human and erudite comeing second, a dark elf friend who hunted cazic in the darkforge race proced like mad, he wa evil to the bone, he proced twice as much as me every fight for the few weeks we were there, and all other dark elfs beat me at procs purely on high dex, however i had better tanks tats so tanked nicer, but with them and a reaver we dont so well, often had 6 man sk group because of lack of healers  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>STR dont mean much, you max your STR/DAMAGE per WEPON/LV quickly, if you have a REAVER under lv 30 then you are maxed in damage, you just get more damage each lv you get after that. When i got mine i was hitting for 40+ by 30 i was hitting for 60+ and around 70+ on green stuff consistantly, the ogres and trolls i saw at best got 2 damage more than me, some as much as 4, wich i dont consider a wise investment for double STR than me, some were totaling 200, where as my base of 90 with self buffs was fine.<P>Channeling, is an odd one, i noticed no difference in any race, get your skill maxed wich is easy and you can do it. Most sk spells are VERY fast or VERY slow (siphon vs fear) so you dont have a choice of when to use them, some spells like spook dead vs fear are better to use, always use spook dead on undead because its faster to cast, not to mention low mana, getting used to my human sk was easyer, i had a few of them one with low int another with high int, the high int helped in groups, i could fear like anything and in some zones i was the master at saving people, unrest included, i mean try fearing half of unrest from the zone repeatidly while 20 plus people zone... its hard when you are a troll, but human and dark elf do it with ease.<P>Play ya sk anyway you want, want a hybrid pick human, want a meat shield pick a troll/ogre, want a caster pick erudite, want a caster/tank pick dark elf, pick the race you like to play then stat them out for how you play, that is the best sk there is full stop.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
