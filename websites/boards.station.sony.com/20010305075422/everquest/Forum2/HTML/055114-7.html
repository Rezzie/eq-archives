</FONT><HR> The problem with making evade lower aggro by a fixed amount, is that the effectiveness of evade will then be in direct relation to the melee output of a rogue. At 60, the amount of decreased aggro would not go up over time. However, with the constant evolution of the game, with bigger, better weapons coming out.. evade's usefullness must decline. <BR> For example, let's say you have decent Kunark weapons. You do x amount of damage. Evade might keep you alive after a backstab. Now you upgrade to common Velious weapons.. you do more damage, but evade stays the same. Now, on high damage rounds it's getting harder to evade. Maybe you evade.. then land a bs and it's right back on you. We haven't even found all the good weapons in Velious yet, let alone another expansion. However, while weapons will constantly inflate, this skill won't.<BR> I suggest then, that there be a base amount of negative aggro, but that it also be affected by the power of the weapon that the rogue is wielding, so that as more powerful weapons come out evade will keep pace. Such a calculation should take into account both the ratio of the weapon, and the pure average (for backstabs).<BR> In my opinion, anything static will run into problems down the road.<P>Dhaevor <BR>Fires of Heaven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a couple points about evade nerfing.  At higher levels, evade is key to making a good group that contains a rogue.  In more cases than not, a rogue in a group that is being attacked will not be able to tank that mob until it is dead from start to finish.  Higher level mobs (dragons/planes/etc) are rogue killers.  Plain and simple if you don't evade, you will die.<P>I have never attacked a mob and evaded successfully to have it jump on another player that hasn't touched it at least once.  Believe me I've tried, especially in the train scenario.<P>Furthermore, VI has insisted on making rogues a weak tank class (AC/HP) to make up for the damage that they do.  Realize that Evade IS our AC/HP. At lvl53 I have 1400 hp roughly with my equipment and most mobs are attacking for 100+ dmg.  With mob ripostles and their normal attacks, a rogue at my level who gets hit sucessfully continously can die in a matter of seconds without evade.<P>We go so quickly to the top of the hate list for the damage that we do, why mess with something that evens that out?<P>I hate to be blunt, but it seems like VI is just looking for things to change instead of brainstorming on real issues to take care of like more involved and challenging quests, not just some 100 hour camp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not going to sift through all those posts (that's your job hehe).  Here's my two cents.<P>Hide/Sneak:<BR>A rogue should NOT be able to be seen by a see-invis spell if he's hidden.  Create a sense hidden spell if need be (that doesn't stack with other invis), but the *one* advantage a rogue has in the game is not being seen, especially in PvP.  Unfortunately every caster can see invis as well as hybrids.  And there are easily obtainable items for people like the Choker of Majdd.  <P>Evade:<BR>Just a note, you mentioned that a succesful evade drops us to the bottom of a hate list, but many times while I'm fighting in a group, a successful evade seems to do nothing to the mob.  Just fyi.<P>Poison:<BR>The poison upgrade was excellent.  I love using my poisons, although I don't think I'd bother in PvE play as the farming is too tedious to waste on mobs.  The only request I'd have is for the poisons to either be stackable OR combined into charges.<P>Pickpocket:<BR>It really should work in PvP.  Not to any extreme, but if you're really good you'd be able to get away with a few gold and if you were not so good the victim would get a message letting them know what you were up to.<P>I love the rogue class.  There is no other one for me.  The hide/sneak thing is my biggest concern.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>Evade barely works and is very arcadish (as is backstab).  Changing how it works makes it a less useful ability and not incredibly better balanced.<P>It IS true that a rogue can escape being beat on, but that is the purpose of Evade.  You're parsing and word splitting as to the 'true purpose' of evade, btw, since it was a player suggestion in the first place (one I and several people made simultaneously).  The sole purpose of Evade IS hate list management.  <P>The rogue generates hate faster than any other class (missed backstabs taunt worse than ones that hit for high damagein my experience).  It is not enough to simply lower the hate by a certain amount but to reset the rogue near the bottom of the hate list.<P>Prior to evade, I would only group with warriors at least 3 levels higher than my rogue.  It took that much more warrior damage and taunt in order to keep monsters relatively under control, and I still ate a lot of heals.  <P>Listen carefully as I yell this:  THE CHAIN CLASS MELEER'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS HATE MANAGEMENT.  Rangers, Rogues, and Shaman and share this problem.  The Rogue solution is arguably superior to Ranger Jolt (should be given to them at 39th level and improved at 55th) and Shaman Root-line of spells.  The hate list management seems to collect misses as more influential as hits (i.e. backstabs that miss seem to more reliably turn monsters than backstabs that hit), seem to direct monsters toward low AC and/or low hit point hatees.  All three indicate that the AI overpunishes the chain classes.<P>In addition, the worst person in the party to have a monster on him/her is the low ac/low hit point person.  That character is hard to keep healed and literally bleeds hit points copmared to higher ac/higher hit people.  <P>(Lest you think I really don't understand this problem, I also have a 35th enchanter who goes into every battle with the same cleric buffs as our tank PLUS shielding PLUS maxed Rune.  You KNOW what Tash-line does, and Tepid Deeds does, and Listless Power, etc.  In order for these spells to be meaningful in combat, they must go off relatively early, and even the best enchanter with high channel gets whacked on more than a little.)<P>I know you asked not to make the evade change the subject of the thread, but the class is pretty much 'ok' (given the relatively poor implementation of rogue skill uses within all  three EQ areas) as is.  The evade skill has already been re-balanced at least once (it was vastly more effective and occurred more frequently when I first got it) and in its current configuration it is powerful but 'ok'.<P>Other nits I have with the Rogue class:  super damage at high levels causes mudflation.  You guys need to model out the damage that various classes can do v. various combat situations.  You need to realistically check your models by assembling test teams that try out the strategies that you use for your models and LOG and compare the results.  The models should work like the clothing models at Land's End:  doesn't look exactly like the real thing, but gives you an impression of how things REALLY work.<P>Although this is a mudflation concern too, it is tremendously annoying to see the highest damage piercers going to any class but Rogues.  I know all the reasons why, but wouldn't it be better to level limit all weapons in a more reasonable way (than the hard caps on two handeds at 10 and 20).  Then you don't have to worry so much when a low level twink swings an awesome weapon.  Use the offense skill to determine max damage in a MUCH smoother curve.<P>I guess I'm at peace with hide/sneak.  With the full invis (undead and living except for see-through-invis creatures) it pays back for slowness and SoW helps.  You have been a little more attentive in level design with the other rogue abilities, but I'm still not thrilled by the relative sparse use of those abilities.<P>As a closing note, our 20th to 21st level mini party (pallie, druid, and bard) grouped with a 31st rogue last night for an item camp (for about an hour).  Ignoring the difference in level for just a moment, it was impressive how much damage the rogue did with relatively weak equipment (sbd and some rapier...max damage on either was about 25...highest backstab I saw was 95).  <P>I also firmly believe that melees/hybrids do too much damage relative to caster classes now.  My pallie wife swings a drakkel forged bastard that can double attack for 90 points at 21st level.  My best DOT does 117 or so over 2 minutes.  My best DD does 112 in 3.5 sec.  She can double attack twice in the 4.5 seconds (ignoring haste) for almost twice as much damage.  Either you need to up caster mana, caster damage efficiency, or seriously consider lowering melee damage efficiency.  It is a major problem and is the root of the epic encounter and post 50 caster problems.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK im not reading all these posts that is your job absor but since i play a 55 rogue i feel the need to make my points known.<P><BR>1.  Quest for souldbound lockpicks - many times rogues can get us into places no one else can but what happens when we all die.......summon corpse time or go buy more lockpicks and then you have 2 lockpicks...no reason for it heh....suggest you put in a quest for post 50 rogue to get souldbound lockpicks<P>2.  Raise pickpocket to lvl 52 MOBs - what we can pick is very limited (cash gems spells) and face it most of my time at this lvl is spent fighting 50+ MOBs so i cant pickpocket anything.<P>3.  The only time the trade off in Hp and AC that a rogue makes pays off is when he/she has a Ragebringer or better.  To be honost i was not looking forward to playing my rogue at higher lvls until this was put in.  However some rogues will never obtain this epic weapon.  Basically there needs to be more high damage piercers with longer delays that will increase the normal backstab damage but slow down piercing damage.<P>4.  Hide/sneak while zoning - Personally i dont see it happening.  It does not seem like the code would allow it.  Would be nice but i dont see it happening.<P>5.  Close the hit point gap some - ok come on heh rogues have about the same hitpoints as a druid.  No we arent warriors and yes we get a lot of cool stuff in return but a lvl 55 rogue with 115 stamina should be able to get 3k hp with aegolism on without a LOT of effort.  I normally wear 2 velium fire opal rings for ac and 130 extra hit points and that sits me unbuffed at 1730 hit points and 2830 with aegolism.  Most warriors lvl 55+ can hit 4000 hitpoints without much extra effort.  1170 hitpoints is not a trade off its a downright sacrafice. Heh i cant even run for the zone a lot of times with even a moderate chance of making it.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that the Rogue class is pretty well balanced.  The only thing that I would like to see added are more traps and locks for lower level rogues.  Perhaps these could be added to the lesser used dungeons to give them new and unexpected challenges.  We picked this class because we want to be able to do these kinds of things and be useful to group, so don't be afraid to put the stuff in there.<P>I would also just like to add that when making changes/additions to the class, please try to stay in the spirit of the class.  In my opinion, we do not want to be tanks.  We fight dirty, steal, and hide from danger.  The penalty for these traits is that we will lose a straight head to head fight.  Don't be afraid to give us powerful backstabs and then evade combat, because if we fail and get busted....then we are in serious trouble.<P>  I think the tracking idea is good too...seems very rogueish me.<P>To sum up, now that most people feel that this is a balanced class, you can now work on making class more distinct from the others and fine tune under used abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<BR>Poison: too much time used for little effectiveness. my skill is 183 and took alittle over 3kpp to get there. farming/buying and making the vials with pottery to reduce cost in half for vials.<BR> Many different ways to work it. Charged/stackable poison. Reduced cost on vials/suspensions. Increased effects on poisons. Most are best used PvP.<P>Apply: reduce apply time based on skill level<BR>Using poison: Done a couple tests. May have just been the random factor but a warrior same level with 120mr and 15pr resisted 5 poison attempts. Cleric same level with 95pr and 20mr resisted 1 attempt. <BR>IS POISON checking against MR? or PR? needs checking.<P>Backstab: 51+ is good to go. pre51 needs alittle work. Figure level minimum for 10-35. One and a half times level or 2times level for 36-50. This will partly increase rogue group usefulness at mid-level.<BR>Parry: small upgrade<BR>Riposte: fine<BR>Dodge: small upgrade<BR>HP: small upgrade<BR>AC: small upgrade<P>small upgrade: got to offset the nerf of evade even though it doesn't work properly. "u have moved" etc...<P>Rogues are very good for CR....if we are not seen.<BR>Hide/sneak working through zone and LD would help.<BR>Increased speed pre50 would help as well.<P>Masters of throwing: tomatoes<BR>  Need to either upgrade damage of thowing weapons and range or make it so that your skill in throwing is the factor that increases dmg and range. Every 20points of skill is 1point bonus damage. Also added prior to calculation for crit and deadlystrike. Every 20points of skill is also 10 extra feet of range for weapon. That way at 200skill you'll get +10dmg and +100feet.<P>PickLocks: fine, more doors/add chests/boxes.<BR>Sense/Disarm Traps: sense to 50yards.<BR>PickPockets: have secondary loot cache equal to the loot on mob. not major change but can help alittle towards grouping and cost of poison/pottery etc...<BR>Ravenscale: no drop  nuff said<P>I played a rogue to 24 then quit when I realized they sucked really bad. That was when BS had no minimum, poison hardly worked, no traps, etc...<BR>Started a wiz. Leveled some then started a new rogue.<BR>New rogue is 48. Wiz is 42. Love them both. Both high on list of damage dealing. Funny how my wiz at 42 can solo blue mobs and my rogue at that level couldn't. Balanced huh?<BR>Balance is not possible. Classes have a set role in the scheme of things. And Verant is still scheming.<BR>BTW I do appreciate the work that Verant has put into the game though. <P>Thank you, <BR>Orvis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rogues are balanced, btu a few tweaks woudl be nice.<P>My only major concern involves throwing weapons.<BR>Rogues are supposed to use throwing, but you will never see a high lvl rogue usign any ranged weapon but a bow. Thsi si simply due to the range and stackability(or rarity) of the current rogue weapons. <P>A few changes which could be looked at:<BR>1) Make skipping stones stackable. It makes absolutly no sense to me that you can carry around a stack of throwing boulders (35wgt - usually drop as 4-5 at a time) but cant have a handfull of skipping stones (uncommon drop - as singles)(0.5wgt).<P>2) Make hafling throwing knives either purchasable, or smithable (using the Halfling cultural forge, of course). These are nice weapons, but are way too time consuming to acquire. Heck, at least cut back on the amount of garbage Sir Morgan hands back to you, to increase your chances of getting these.<P>3) Turmoil Warts. They are rare drops in the Plane of Fear, and are a decent throwing weapon. However, due to their rarity, and expendability, are rarely used. I have been saving them for over a year and have less than 20. Propose these drop as a stack of 4-5, to actually get an amount that will make these usable as a weapon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey all.  Just a couple of things about rogues...<P>1) Multiple poison charges <P>     I won't say "stackable" because there are many ways to implement this.  What needs to be done is that poisons need to have more then one use or be able to be combined at a moments notice.  A couple of other ideas I've seen bandied about that I really like for poison usage include:<P>- high apply skill resulting in more "charges" per poison vial and less time to apply (it currently isn't feasible to use more then one charge of poison per encounter).  As your apply skill goes up, it takes you less poison to poison the blade: effectively increasing the charges on the poison to those with high apply.  <P>- Also, combining poisons with ranged weapons to produce an unstackable single shot poisoned ranged weapon.  Perhaps make the requirement throwing weapons only (which will also reduce the usage of bows by rogues).  <P>- Further, the idea of manufactured drinkable poisons with innocent names and no visible proc creates a number of interesting PvP implementations ("Hey Bob!  I just dinged.  Wanna drink??")  <P>- Finally, suspensions can only be bought off of merchants.  It would be nice to make this relatively self-sufficient for rogues to use perhaps by brewing a suspension, pottery-ing the vials and make-poison-ing the poisons together.<P>2) Hide / Sneak<P>     It's been said before: allow this to remain active across zone boundaries.<P>3) Pickpockets<P>     The utility of this skill is limited and usually negative.  Perhaps it would be interesting to allow rogues to pick items from vendors?  This would reduce the negative perception of rogues fishing through the pockets of a common mob while enhancing the utility of the skill.  Can't afford that loaf of bread?  Try picking the mob.  Implementation ideas include a pick priority list wherein the items go from least valuable to most valuable with a percentage bonus based on the skill level.  Basically, higher level rogues with higher level PP skill are able to pick more valuable items off of merchants.  They already kill younger rogues instantly (and many older rogues as well) whenever a pick fails so why not let the reward be worth the risk?  Besides, who else is it worthwhile to pick that won't betray your groupmates?  As well, by implementing a pick priority list there is a very good chance that a vendor will keep "dropping" (the results of a good pick) one of their unlimited resources.  Further, make it have a large initial skill requirement (like many of the locked doors) so that it doesn't become a viable money twink (unless you want to pick 200 loaves of bread to sell back at 1sp a piece).<P>4) Items<P>     Rogues need more diverse throwing items.  It's been said before and I'll say it again.<P>     Besides all the other neat Rogue equipment ideas I thought I'd throw this one out:<P>     - A rogue-only mask that allows you to see through hidden walls as if the illusion just didn't exist (so we see those pit traps as holes in the floor rather then peering intently at every inch of wall/floor to find the teltale inconsistencies). <P>Just about everything else about the class is quite good.  There was a point in time when Rogues were the masters of useless skills but as you guys come out with more expansions, the utility of these skills increased to the point of viability.  Thank you.  As well, Rogues require relatively skilled players to master (since we have to BS, evade, PP, H/S and whatnot at the right times and places to avoid instant death) and are naturally rich in roleplaying opportunity.<BR>It takes time and energy to level a rogue (without twinking them or P/L'ing them, of course) and the skills learned are unique.<P>Thanks for the time and the enjoyment.<P>Thlinto Ratscar<BR>"Time is Life's currency."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just to add another voice to the reasoning...<P>My Rogue is only level 18, but there are several things that I have noticed already.<P>1.  Evade does not send a monster running across the zone chasing a target that it "naturally" aggro'd on.  For example, if I am fighting an Iksar Manslayer in LOIO solo, and somebody runs by (happens all the time since I still fight by the mill) and I evade, the manslayer does not go running off to beat on the player who ran by.  A suggestion (since it seems you do think it's broken) is to have evade drop you on aggro to a point below anything that is applying direct damage to the monster (i.e. any tanks, a pet, or even an over-blasting wizzy) but keep the aggro above racial hate.<P><BR>2. Hide/sneak through zone!  I just died to this today (lost 18 dangit, got it back though) when I zoned from ill omen to FV, somebody had trained a goblin warlord there.  Thanks to hide/sneak dropping on zone, I was dead before the zone finished loading on my computer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.<P>3. Even though I don't have the skill yet, please do something about Instill doubt.  From what I have read and seen from grouping with rogues with my other characters, ID almost never works, and when it does, the rogue has no way to take advantage of it anyway, thanks to the kick being on the same refresh as backstab.  Please remove the kick check and just have the skill/Magic resistance check and either grey out the Backstab button until it can be used or move the kick off of the backstab refresh table.<P><BR>4. Poisons.  While a great idea, the whole fact that I will have to drop so much time and money, just to make low level poisons, makes the skill not worth it.  Lower the prices off of the NPC's,  make the components buyable off of NPC's (still leave them droppable off of green monsters, and make the prices somewhat costly, for those higher level players who don't want to farm greenies but have the cash to spare).  Also, for a trade skill, making poison is completely worthless since there is no way to make money (only people that can use them are rogues who can make their own) from it.  Please allow other classes to apply poison in a limited form.<P><BR>5.  pick pocket - It seems that nobody is sure whether pick pocket comes from the MOB's loot table, or if it comes from a seperate loot table - I have heard both arguments.  If need be, make pick pocket loot coin only (except for the epic quest piece of course) and have it come from a seperate table, that would be lost to players who would normally kill and loot the monster.<P><BR>6. Backstabs - damage is fine, don't change it either way.  People gripe that 55+ players are double backstabbing for huge amounts.  So what, we rogues have to put up with being second string most of our life, it's nice to be able to look forward to "coming into our own" at 55+.<P>7. Sneak speed - I tend to agree with other people on this, please make sneak speed enhancements based on your skill level, not character level.  Say at 150 give a 5% increase, another 5% at 175, 10% at 200 and so on and so forth until you reach full speed at max skill level. (this makes a lot more sense than a 50 rogue who sneaks at snail pace, then suddenly dings 51 and improves vastly)<P>That's about it.  So far I love my little halfling rogue.  He's not an easy class to play, considering I'm always having to yell at group members to stay on one side of the monster (one side, ONE SIDE!!!  I actually have this hotkeyed) and I get turned into mincemeat by even conns while my warrior at this level was killing evens to yellows with no problems, but overall I love the class, I love watching my my backstab damage progress (hit 75 damage today, woot) and I love the fact that I have so many great skills at my disposal.<P><BR>Miggenwin, 18th rogue of Bertoxx<P>&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the rogue class is balanced for the most part as it is. With the changes to evade you plan to make we will be slightly more usefull than the rangers a few months ago.<P>As it stands now evade can be impossible to use in high lag zones or when multiple mobs are beating on you. With the damage output a rogue can deal and the low AC and HP we will die without the evade skill as it is. Rouges will no longer be able to pull for groups without enchanters making monks and warriors even more vauluable along with the clerics to heal them. Currently for a rouge to be effective we need someone to tank for us, we only do our high damage to the rear of the mob so you will also make a few tanking classes with lower taunt skills less wanted in groups with rogues. The changes to evade might bring us back to the days pre Kunark where rogues were broken and almost unplayable. Please do not change evade.<P>Also the poison skill is nearly worthless except in the fact that it is a great money sink. I spent over 150 plat to raise my skill 9 points, when I went to use the poison I failed the apply, over 9plat down the drain because of the excessive cost on the vials and suspension. Yes I could use the poison to kill the mob but it costs me more for the poison than I will ever get back out of anything I kill, unless I tried to solo giants all day. Remove vials to make it like alchemy and remove the apply check or make the apply skill be able to apply poison faster as the skill goes up so it can be used in combat. Also make the apply like bind wound, you croutch down and stand when you are done. Poisons are just to expensive for a level 20 main character to even try and master. To reduce the cost we can learn pottery but this is painfull due to most rogues lack of int and charisma, makes it expensive and difficult to learn trade skills.<P>Let us sneak across zone lines and also have sneak  and illusions last through LD. As it stands enchanters, rogues, and bards can travel in places they would normally be KOS with illusions from masks or spells. If we go LD from internet problems which do happen a lot, we die when we log back in. There are zones that when you reapear on the other side maobs are waiting to kill you, and there is a delay from when your character apears and you have control of it. I was one left inside the tower of frozen shadow by my wonderfull group, snuck out without a problem but when I zoned out I reappeared and died imeadiately from a shadow guardian, I was full health when I zoned out and nearly dead after I got controll of the character.<P>I personaly think there are more important problems with the game that should come before class balance. Bigest problem being LD, it afects every class and group. During battles a key member goes LD can mean a group will die, with the old way they could rejoin the group almost imediatly now we have to wait for it to save and log us out.<P>Also if you change the evade skill please remove or give us new weapons that do not proc. The proc on weapons almost negates the use of the evade skill since it does not refresh fast enough for us to evade for a BS and the taunt of a weapon proc.<P>Lync</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I playb two rogues, 17th and 14th (different servers) so I can't comment on how balanced they are mid to high level.<P>However, I do see rogue as a very effective class already. I play rogues because it allows me to do and see things that I have no access to with my other characters over twice the level.<P>The one glaring problem is that sneak/hide breaks when you disconnect, camp or zone. This means that what should be a safe activity becomes a meaninglessly dangerous one. For example, I sneak/hid all the way across Iceclad last night with my 14th rogue, but I couldn't go into the Tower of Frozen Shadow because I knew that I would be visible when I zoned back out, right into the arms of the shadow guardians.<P>Now, I can assimilate that - maybe it really isn't possible to remain hidden when being ported by that magical device. But the same cannot be said of, say, crossing the artificial zone border in the pass from Qeynos Hills to West Karana, on either side of which can be tough opponents (Guard Nash/Werewolf). Even less so could any case be made for me losing my hidden status when I lose my connection or camp. My casters don't have this problem.<P>I also can't see why I can't pickpocket anything that carries money. If a sabretooth can find somewhere to keep 7 silver, surely a rogue can find a way to take it from him?<P>And as everyone has said, poison needs to stack.<P>However, even if you make no changes to rogues other than the proposed change to Evade, I believe the class will still be a pleasure to play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>wow, where to start?<P>1)POISON<BR>      a)To expensive for the effects, it cost me about 500pp to go from skill 83 to 95<BR>      b)Put in an item like the shaman potion bag so we can make ourt posions with charges<BR>      <BR>2)EVADE- My rogue is only 46 so I can't speak for post 50s but it worked well up until about lvl 41 and now it just sux. I was in Ocean of Tears camping the Ancient Cyclops with some friends. We were fighting a Cyclops and I evaded, it was still on me, with out attacking at all and them taunting it still took me 3 more successful evades before it turned from me. I have the same problems in alot of places.<P>3)SNEAK/HIDE<BR>        a)Make it faster as your skill increases, we are WAY to slow at higher lvls.<BR>        b)Let it stay up when crossing zonelines and let us do it underwater<BR>        c) At higher lvls ALOT of mobs see invis, let our skill go against a factor they have to se if the can see us or if we can hide. example= Kael Drakkal King area, all the mobs there see invis and start KOS so only way to get a corpse from there is the rare and expensive summon corpse, Let high (45+) rogues have a chance to go in there unseen. This change would let somethings more exciting rather then undoable for us Rogues.<P>3)DISARM- fun skill but useless for anything other then a duel.<P>4)INSTILL DOUBT- I like it, would like to see it have a greater then 1 in 12 success rate with a 200 skill though.<P>5)SAFE FALL- I like the flying idea some people had but since it won't happen how about rasing safefall cap. personally I just like to fall of stuff.<P>6)BACKSTAB- if it ain't broke don't fix it!!<P>7)THROWN WEAPONS- Love them but please give us extended range, I haven't used a bow for 46lvls but am getting tempted to just becouse of the range, please don't make me.<P>8)PICK LOCKS<BR>        a)Put in more things then just doors please, we like the challenge.<BR>        b)Put in a quest for MAGIC lock picks so we can pick our way into places like sebilis or Howling Stones, and make these either souldbound or NOT lore so we can get 2 for Corpse recovery.<P>9)PICK POCKETS- take away the mob lvl cap, we should be that damn good.<P>10)STALKING(A rogue tracking)- Put in a tracking for us that works in doors and allows us to know the /loc of an outdoor mob we have targeted. The out door location will let us scout up ahead, target a roaming mob and let our group (or groups on raids) when the mob is close to them and to be careful. With the changes made to Hybrids on test (I know thses are tests not deffinently going live) this should be worth testing also, becouse you just out balanced Hybrids in my personal oppinion.<P>11)Evade continued- If you do change it (nerfing it as you said) please raise our deffensive skill/skills deffense/dodge/parry/riposte and/or raise our HPs to make up for the increased pound we will be taking.<P>Thanx for taking the Time to read my post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello, Absor.<P>Welcome to the tidal wave of wants, needs, and insecurities that is rogues.  I've only skimmed the messages so far -- in one way or another, I've read most of them before.  <P>Sorry you haven't done your research on us -- as you can see, we are mighty defensive about our abilities, with much historical justification. As you probably have figured out by now, we were the class that needed the most fixing out of the box, since the Vision (tm) of rogues got jettisoned at the last moment, but not replaced with anything until a year or so later.  Sense traps & disarm traps are part of our legacy as a result.<P>I think if there is an underlying theme of Rogue requests for "balance," it is this: We are, essentially, a skills-only class, like our brother warriors and monks. Spells are easy to add to the game, skills are not. Our skills are all we have.  You can say "what about this weapon or armor" or whatever, but the world of items is too chaotic to really say we are balanced or not based on items available.<P>Yes, we are very good at melee damage. We excel in that perhaps because we have little else we excel in. We can backstab.  We can evade.  We can hide & sneak.  We can pickpocket, but it is generally inadvisable. We can pick locks once in a blue moon. We can make poisons, which is fun, but expensive and not for everyone.<P>Technically, we can instill doubt, but with 3 checks to fail (skill check, to hit check, fear spell resist check), and fear being a generally hazardous tactic, using instill doubt is more like playing the lottery than having a skill.  My rogue is 43rd level, has a skill of 192, and a 93 CHA, and I succeed fairly rarely.  About half the time would be great. <P>And we can throw things for criticals.  Have you tried using range 50-70 damage 5 throwing weapons?  If I am that close to the monster, why am I not in melee if I am going to do perhaps 5 points of damage?  If I am pulling, with my moderate AC and anemic hp, why am I not shooting with a bow at 5 times the range?  I can't turn and run fast enough from the monster if I am in range of my thrown weapon - they are already pounding me.  <P>So you see, compared to most other classes, we lack considerable diversity.  This is what we do, this is what we've always done. <P>Most of the "we need this, we need that" arguments you will read are based around two points: (1) we are a niche group, so we want to be as good at our niche as possible, and (2) we'd like more diversity in what we do, please, especially if our niche role is going to be reduced.  <P>I love being a rogue, but I wish something fresh and new would turn up from time to time in our skills. I understand that new spells are easy to add and that new skills aren't.  That doesn't mean that we don't like to get new abilities and see fresh ideas added to our class. Please warmly consider any suggestions for rogue - hell, for melees - that add some more flavor to our classes.  They don't have to be damage-based, just something interesting.  Short duration see invis with sense traps - that sort of thing.<P>I can continue this line of argument - I really have a lot to say about it - but you are probably already battered with our posts.  Absor, if you read this and feel like continuing the discussion, please post, I'll check back from time to time.<P>-- Auspice<P>p.s. bug fix - could we click off the illusion on the mask of deception?  I am stuck with it until I zone right now.  Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've read alot of really good ideas here, and am glad to see that there are enough REAL Rogues out there (not these lame hobby twink-boiz and twink-grlz) posting who have some sense of the history our class had to go thru to finally get some respect on Norrath.<P>That said, I want to highlight and support some of the ideas I liked and throw a couple of my own in the ring:<P>1) Backstab Stun Chance - I think it's a good idea, and would help to stop those annoying caster MOBs from chain healing... afraid tho that with the Evade Nerf impending, a stun component added to backstab would make it problematical to get the MOB off us in time.<P>2) Stackable/Cheaper/Longer Lasting Poison - PLEASE!!!  Poison is the one nifty neato really exciting singular ability Rogues have and it's so expensive, time consuming, and unwieldy in its current form that alot of Rogues never take it up or give up on it entirely.  Here's my suggestions for making poison use more viable:<BR>a) Make vials of poison stack - NO EXCUSES VERANT!  You can give the shaman stackable potions, you can give us stackable poison!<BR>b) Make poison last longer than one hit - this may be a way to get around the stackable issue.  Instead of stacking posion, make poison be an "aura" that activates and procs on the first hit, then lasts for a time (60 seconds or more based upon apply skill?) during which time the Rogue has a diminshed chance of procing the poison again - kinda like SK's Vampiric Embrace.<BR>c) Make Poison Reagents cheaper - only uber-twinked rogues can afford to make and use poison in it's current form - the cost versus reward for these one shot little "poison spells" is laughable except for incredibly low-level posions.  When we see the huge amount of hit points you give MOBs at upper levels, almost all the damage venoms become a joke to use, thereby limiting the number of reasonably useful poisons at high levels.<P>And I gotta say it:<P>PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU NERF EVADE, VERANT!<P>This skill saved Rogues from becoming the only class on Norrath to become extinct thru lack of players.  You nerf Evade too much and we could go right back to the bad old days when Rogues were a joke in melee and unwelcome in groups.  PLEASE DON'T DO THAT TO US!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Been playing a human rogue since the release date of the game.  He's nearly 41st level now.  I play lots of characters so they all level kinda slowly.  Here goes...<P><BR>  I agree with the mentioned change/reversion of the evade skill.  Right now, it behaves so erratically at the beginning of combat that I'm afraid if I use it too early the target will aggro on a caster/healer who hasn't done anything but med yet.<P>  As we get more powerful, we all know that people start turning off "other's hits" in the chat filter.  I think it should be changed such that backstab hits show up like warrior criticals do rather than looking like regular damage messages.  A lot of the groups I fight in don't realise see the big hits I connect with cause it's lost in the battle spam.  This would be a small, hopefully easy, change that would make us rogues much happier.<P>  Sneak/hide and illusions NEED to be made so they work through zoning/camping.  Zoning is more important here, but link-death comes to mind making the camping request important too.  Please!<P>  IMHO, a successful pickpocket shouldn't break sneak/hide.<P>  Can throwing ranges (maximum and minimum) be looked at?  I think the minimum could be moved in closer to the target a little bit and the maximum moved out a bit.  Also, and this may already be fixed, a ranged attack that fails because of bad range to target shouldn't disable the ranged attack button.  The button should be available immediately for another try.<P><BR>  That's about all I can think of to contribute right now.  More later, perhaps...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the proposed change to evade:<P>At first I thought this sounded reasonable and even now I can concede that some fix to evade may be necessary, but this proposed "fix" will kill us. Literally.<P>For those of us who regular group with hybrids, we will have to "modify [our] damage output" to do LESS damage than our tank. What good are we then?<P>Does that mean I can never group with a lower level tank? A 35 pally or SK may well NEVER be able to taunt off my 37 rogue, even with a successful evade.<P>All I ask: Please test out different aggro percentages with different group configurations.<P>Regarding Hide/Sneak across zones.  I understand this can't be coded.  Fine.  Perhaps there is a way to prevent mobs from killing us before we even get the "you have entered" message, let alone see what is hitting me.  When I first zoned into Grobb I took over 240 hp of damage before my client even zoned it... Altogether 750hp when all I did was step in and *immediately* step back out. Is there some kind of check that can be made to make sure my client has finished zoning?<P>I love my rogue.  The biggest problems I have with the class are sneak being dreadfully slow and the lack of usefulness of our key skills... pick lock, pick pocket, traps, poison.  I have 2 backpacks full of poison components that are not actually worth the time to combine.  I haven't used pick pocket in 5 levels... I've yet to see a single trap and locked doors are not even an issue before the 50+ game.<P>Thanks for listening,<BR>Roche.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Figure I'll have my 2 pence worth.<P>Mid level weapons quested and bought - Most rogues seem to complete the Redemption Quest (Burning Rapier) in their early to mid 20s then its a 30 level wait till you get to have a stab (pun intended) at doing the Epic provided you have enough high level friends to help out. How about a mid level quest for a nice piercer upgrade a 12/24 or similar. Also in general there seems to be a real lack of option for main hand piercers unless you have an awful lot of money to spend. It seems that every mid 30s to mid 40s rogue in the game has a Slime Coated Harpoon 10/25 which on Fennin costs 2k, yet if you wanna upgrade to the next main hand which most people agree to be a Trak Tooth you're looking at 8k plus. I appreciate EQ has a player led economy that differs greatly across servers but my warrior friend has had a Wurmslayer for a little while which is best damage/delay ratio 1hs bar the warrior epic (I believe) and costs 4-5k on Fennin, I can't hold up my end of the "Most powerful damage dealer" when I am out-equipped this way.<P>Evade - I don't envy you being the one to announce this. All I ask is please please take into account the problems we experience with evade when adjusting this. Like most people posting here I often get the evade success message without the mob turning. Lag can ruin the timing of evade so not being able to evade while moving can cause a real problem. As long as its looked at with an even hand I'm not gonna whine about necessary changes but fix the stuff that doesn't work well at the same time and I'll be happy.<P>Sneak/Hide Speed - Ramp it up from 30 or 40, throw us a bone at mid levels.<P>Sneak/Hide through zoning/LD/etc - Personally I see this as a must have especially with the disconnect problems recently (but thats another story).<P>Poison - Make em stackable and useful and I'll be there. In their current guise I only touched them as a guildie wanted some dyes made and once I could do that reliably the pestle and mortar were shelved.<P>Pickpocket loot - Seperate money pool would be a nice encouragement to use the skill.<P>Escape method - Yep we have one, it ain't very nice and it won't get you invited back into a group but there is the "evade onto another group member and run while they die" method, which works especially well with casters I'm told. Now obviously thats a really antisocial thing to do and as EQ is a social game I'd recommend not doing it especially as Rogue's (and apparently Rouge's) have the soloing skills of a chocolate teapot. A short duration speed discipline would have done me a lot more good than a +3 resistance or not being feared for a few seconds, alternatively how about if we manage to get beyond a certain range a hide removes us from the hate list or makes the mob stand scratching its head for 10 seconds wondering where we are and then come back after us. I don't want complete impunity just gimme a few seconds and they'll never catch me :o)<P>In general the rogue has gone from being unplayable to being one of the better balanced classes. As long as we keep our mastery of melee damage (and at mid levels I really do feel this means more weapons available) I'm happy.<P>Borbas Badgerbane<BR>Britannic Knights<BR>45th Level Rogue - Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oki <BR>Safe fall: This skill needs to be upped alot or revamped should almost be like falling with levitate on. if it is not like that it is pretty useless skill. <BR>Now yes i agree at high levels a rogue does great damage but until you reach the 50th lvl + rogues dont do enough to be wanted in a group. Since rogues can rarely solo they need to be grouped yet you never see anyone in any zone /ooc group looking for rogue. <BR>I think there damage needs to be increase maybe adding more attack points other wise the rogue is only as good as his weapons. If not there damage then add more ac to them make there agility points upped so the more agility the more ac they have and not this 1 agility = 1 ac it needs to be higher then that.<BR>Sneak/hide works great but alot of the new zones and old zones have mobs that can see thru it i think they should not to be able to seen at all<P>Poisons= need stackable start rogues out at 100 make poison or let them train higher in it they are rogues after all.<P>Disc's= there needs to be one after every level 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 each need a new one.<BR>this gives something for rogues to work for. like the spell users every level they look forward to something new and some of the mellee types as well it could be a simple disc as climb walls (which all rogues should be able to do) or say invul for 30 seconds or something like that.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aerlorn-I'm not asking for a PvP change, but a rogue change.  It doesn't make sense that a see-invis spell would see a hidden rogue.  They're not invisible.  As for hiding after backstab, notice you used a warrior in the example.  That's about the only class aside from monk or another rogue that we have a *chance* of remaining unseen around.  ...and I'm not the only one who feels this way.<P>I forgot to mention Hide/Sneak speed.  It's stupid that the skill level doesn't increase with the ability.  We need a speed increase earlier than 50+.

</FONT><HR>It may be too late to join in but here is my 2 coppers on Rogues.<P>First off Rogues do unholy damage - without poison.  I've read some things that seem to indicate rogues do upwards of twice the damage of any other melee class.<P>I'm all for that obviously but with that power have to come some debits.<P>I see the rogue as being a competitor for a group slot with a wizard or a monk. The three classes mentioned are really there to do damage.  The monk can FD which is useful in pulling situations and helpful when things go to pot - the wizard can evac the party.  The rogue can scout.  Overall the wizard is hampered by long downtimes to med which costs the party time, as well as needing healing.  Still the lure of a full getaway is really something a party is attracted to.<P>Rogues also carry some stigma regarding picking pockets and disarm.<P>In general rogues are less desireable perhaps than wizards and monks. Scouting doesn't have that big a use in sit and pull type hunts (which sadly is the way 95%  of the players play).<P>Evade is tricky. On person earlier mentioned needing two or three evades and not attacking at all to get clear on an encounter.<P>I think that's pretty much life for a wizard or other DD caster - you have to pick and choose when to blast.  For a rogue losing evade is going to make them work more like a caster in terms of tactics - passing up backstabs for a while in order to keep lower on the hate list (rogue dual wielding does a lot of damage just on it's own).<P>If you do this and it has the effect I see there will be a lot of people upset by it.  However, there are things which could make the rogue a more versatile and interesting class that don't require we have as much immunity to damage.<P>the suggestion regarding using 1hb in the primary hand is really interesting.  Allow the attack to do damage as normal but instead of backstab damage on a successful BS do a stun.  It fits the class, it has a tactical use and it would sacrifice damage potential for flexibility. I really like that idea.<P>I agree that poisoning is a pain - having the ability to make some poisons just through buying the ingredients rather than farming snakes or something would be great for players like me who have only limited time to play each week. I don't have 5-6 hours to spend on mind-numbingly dull snake killing.  It does encourage folks to sell these things to rogues but that's not that easy to come by.<P>Anyway that is a bit more minor but I think some ease of use would be nice.<P>Allowing poisons to be applied to another person's weaponry would be an interesting idea.  I think it would be nice to allow some poisons to be sold on a weapon ("selling fine steel dagger with paralyzing poisoning 50 plat") with perhaps 2 or 3 increasingly weak charges.  Just a thought but if you restricted the types of weapons which could be poisoned and the types of poison you'd have a little market rogues could exploit in order to pay for poisoning training. plus it makes sense - the skill goes into making and applying the poison - not sticking it in something.<P>I like the sneak/hide sticking on a zone - that would be nice.<P>The last thing I'll mention is the idea of the rogue as spy.  There are masks out there I know but in general these don't affect faction correct ( i have one of these masks on my bard but none on my rogue). Perhaps for a rogue there might be some faction advantage or perhaps for the rogue the sneak skill could come with a faction adjustment.  This would mean that by sneaking and sacficing speed the rogue might be raised a little bit  on faction in order to allow him to infiltrate an otherwise too dangerous area - where a bard in a mask couldn't go.<P>Clearly I haven't thought that one through but in general I think if you gave rogues a bit more on the sneaking/spying end (wow I'd love to track but you know, the fact that i'd love it so much means to me it's probably imbalancing), the chance to share some debuffs or dots or whatever via poison with the party (in some limited way), and a chance to take a sap to the back of some caster's head and interrupt him, you might well help the rogue be more useful and desireable to a group even though he or she is doing less damage.<P>thanks for listening</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at). In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list. Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically. This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs. But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list. Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function.<P>ok ya know if this was true i could have soloed to 55 np at all.......it dont happen <P>evade is used as it is to either save my life or to decide who the MOB is aggroed on.  Redicing its effectiveness will be a serious NERF to the entire rogue class because the more we are aggro the less we backstab and we all know that backstabs make up 25+% of our total damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another suggestion along the side of tracking, how about give us a 'locate corpse' skill, similar to the necro/bard/sk ability - we are doing half of the CR at high levels anyways and this would help alleviate downtime by speeding up CR.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi, Absor !<P>First of all, thankyou, for the Rogue is the reason i bought and play EverQuest, after trying it at my girlfriend's - i really think this is the most complex and interestng class in the game.<P>This being said, of course, i have a couple of suggestions, that will probably sound as a repeat now the thread is already long started.<P>- Archery / Throwing - due to the lack of range / damage, the only throwing weapon that could be worth *buying* would be the only one non-stackable, the Throwing Axe. I've read about Javelin people can make with Smithing, that are stackable, but so far, no one bothered selling me any, and with my 65 Wis / 75 Int combo, and ate mastering pottery for vials, i'm not really ready to make them myself. So, please, if you could make more interesting throwing weapons stackable that would make our lives easier - i don't want to give up my crits and deadly cuz of a bad range that makes the mob aggroing me before i get in close enough range.<P>- Poison - I have loved farming the items from lvl 1 to 20, getting experience at that time, but nw they are green, not only do they seem to be more rare, but it is also a pain to run all accross Norrath for only a couple of poisons. If you could make some more recipes that would be bought-only items, that would be great !<BR>And as everyone above me - PLEASE ! (it is a desperation cry ;o) make them stacable / multi-use... With all the farming and provisions already filling our bags, we don't know where to put the poisons...<P>- POttery - Rogues are kinda forced to master pottery, for the POison making. That's fine - it allowed me on the other hand to discover the Baking skill which is pretty fun so far. But as Smithing, Jewelry and Tailoring have seen their already nice and profitable trades improved and specialized, pottery is capping at 188... I've read about the dieties project, and that would be really nice to complete it with some Rogue specific tricks - as some have cultural armor, , Enchanters have enchanted jewelry and cleric, imbuing stones... I don't really have spoecific ideas, since i see no real hope in the development of that thing, but if it is the case, i'll work on it ;o) (ah ! poisonned discs or darts !)<P>- Sense / Disarm Traps - Even if people say here and there that we can fine some, according to the level the skills are given it is pretty pointless... Either skip the skills and give us some improvement elsewhere, or add real traps ;o) besides, in dungeons, it would make teen / young rogues more welcome than 'Oh ! Another uber-looter / Cash taker' ;-o<P>That being said, i'm only 22, so i'm sure that I are in advance with all that the Brothers of the Shadows said ;o)<P>But these are only minor clouds in the trully amazing landscape offered to our kind ;o)<P>~Janusbis Rubyheart<BR>"Honey, my back is itching, can you help me please ?'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, let's get the good stuff out of the way.  Hide/sneak on ld and zoning would be very nice.  Better range on stackable throwing weapons as a class ability or simply on the items themself.  Stackable poisons would be really great, but IMO not 100% necessary.<P>Now, on to the evade change.  Because Verant has deemed rogues to be battle oriented since they do not want to/can't implement our soft skills, Evade has become our class defining skill.  Without it, we are either horrible mana sinks for the healers or we have to do less damage than our main tank.  I know you aren't talking about removing evade, but if you break evade to the point that we aren't able to keep mobs on the tanks at least an overwhelming majority of the time, or to the point that regardless of haste items we still can only backstab every 10 seconds because evade is needed to ever turn the mob off of us, you will have some extremely dissatisfied customers.  I've played for almost 2 years now, and have never played any class but a rogue past 40.  I don't want to play any class but a rogue.  So if rogues cease to be an interesting class, if all we do is backstab once, get pounded on, and then die, I'll be cancelling my account.  Again, you haven't said anything yet that makes me feel you will destroy rogues.  But when you start working with evade, be sure you get it right.  If you go to far with it, I doubt I'd be around another 6 months for you to admit your mistake and fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055114&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055114&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
