</FONT><HR>Verant as a company seems to make decisions that are simple difficult to understand.  But the post-Kunark decision to focus high end content to a tiny elite is perhaps the most strange.<P>Let's just work from the numbers.<P>In Kunark there was Veeshan's Peak.  A zone which most players will never see.  To even get there requires a guild organisation beyond most *players* although it is feasible for those who work at everquest.<P>This wasn't *too* bad.  If you just wanted to say "I've been there" there is a long term possibility of getting the key and entering the zone - of course getting out is another matter...<P>At the time this was 1 zone amongts 50+.  Still a significant proportion of content but not unbearably so.<P>Then comes Velious.  15 or so new zones of which 2 are replicas (in terms of feasible access - PoM and Sleeper's Tomb) of Veeshan's Peak.  Fully 13% of the content of an expansion that 7,500 people per server will be expected to buy and its tailored for a tiny minority of players.<P>How many players?<P>Well these zones are genuinely limited to a very few elite guilds - usually one per server maximum, which have a specific demographic - full time players.  Judging by my knowledge of various servers and the sizes of these very few guilds, it appears that there are only 50 to 100 players per server who will *ever* see these zones.<P>That's between 0.5% and 1% of the entire player base!<P>Getting 13% of the expansion (and now 4% of the entire game content) not *even* geared specifically for them (zones such as Temple of Veeshan you can *enter* but don't even *think* about trying to play there) but can only be *entered* by a tiny minority of the player base.<P>Verant!  What is the reason for this?  There is *lots* of content that the average level 60 cannot encounter in the *other* zones.  Without committing more time than most have the very top end encounters are already restricted.  But you add to that entire zones which cannot be entered by most players?<P>And is there content for those who are beating the *rest* of these zones?<P>No!<P>There is *nothing* between the Shroom King level mobs and the Dain level mobs.  A huge gap where the *majority* of 55+ players play and yet there is no content designed for them.<P>You go straight from the single group encounter to the 4 to 6 group raids.  Nothing in the middle.<P>But there is a simple solution.  End the over-delivery of content for this tiny elite and retune the high end game so that the majority of high end players can participate.  Remove the reliance on 4 to 6 group raids and rebalance these encounters for the *average* Guild of 10 to 18 55+ players.<P>When the tiny elite leave (as they are threatening to do) they will not dent your income.  When *we*, the majority, leave it *will*.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another point as an addition :-<P>The guilds that are capable of attempting these kinds of events are composed of a large number of very committed online gamers.<P>As new games are released (ignoring the 'vaporware' arguments et al) these are the players who will look to attain the same online status as they now hold in EQ.  This will cause a migration of the top guilds to new games in order to secure there 'uber' status.<P>Will the developers tone down the difficulty of these zones when the only players capable of using them have left ?? has Verant ever made the game easier ?<P>It would be a sad situation when 3 or 4 zones in the whole game are inaccessable to everyone and many more are just to deadly to attempt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm inclined to agree with this post, in that some of the high end content is perhaps too high for a sustainable playerbase.  The second post illustrates the danger of madly dedicated players leaving, and being amongst the few who are able to enter the zones.<P>Fundamentally, I think the high high high level zones are not a bad concept, you just don't want very many of them.<P>That said - I'm not in a position to talk about it really.  Only my monk has been to Velious, and he's 33rd.  Of course, exploration is a breeze with a monk :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I ask what is the percent of players on each server that has achieved 55+...<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>That's harder to quantify.  Its relatively trivial to discern the numbers who are in the tiny elite who can expect to do VP, ST, ToV, PoM but harder to establish the sixe of the rest of the post 55 brigade.<P>Certainly on older servers, the bulk of the players appear to have at least one character in the 45 to 55 bracket with at least 200 to 300 in the 55 to 60 group.<P>Its not like it was at 50 where there was a secondary peak on the distribution curve at 50 - the difficulty of levelling post 51 means that this peak at max level is much, much smaller.<P>But what is your assertion?  That there are more people in FoH/AL/LoS than there are in all the other guilds with 10 to 18 people in the post 54 level range?<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>Seems like you are upset that uber levels are created for uber guilds, yet you want semi-uber levels created for the few 55+ players per server... What percent of the user base would *that* satisfy?<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>Analyse it logically.  Verant are the only people who know the numbers.  But I can assure you from any limited knowledge of the game you would see that there are a lot more people in this "hole" without challenge than there are capable of contemplating the elite game.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>*cough* - what makes you think the median is anywhere near what you are suggesting? 50+ is definitely *NOT* the median... You too are on the fringe, and asking them to ingore the far reaches of the fringe is just like asking them to ingore you completely...<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>I play most of the game with a group of 10 to 18 people levels 52 to 60.  There is *no* challenge in the game at this level range.  I see *dozens* of other guilds out there on our server in very similar positions.<P>There is no possibility of such a guild arraying versus a Dain or Tormax yet there is no challenge in the rest of Velious, let alone the newbie grounds of Kunark.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>Dollars to Donuts, the Median is somewhere near 30th level, if not lower...<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>We aren't discussing the Median (which on older servers appears to be around 45 to 55) we are discussing content at the high end.<P>As the majority of high end players are not members of uber-guilds killing and not even likely to *enter* these 3 zones, let alone play in them, then the content delivery is broken.<P>Verant need to wisen up and quit catering for this tiny elite with such a huge comparative proportion of the content and start creating more content to those people for whom the sub-Elite game is too easy but find that the requirements to participate in those encounters are beyond the effort of time and bother they are wishing to place in a *game*.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Whether or not you agree with the exact statistics or not, the original poster's point is still valid.  For an expansion that was marketed for higher level players there is really very little content for a six person group in Velious.  I have no problem with the Boss Mob of the zone being a raid quality encounter, but to have multiple zones where the entire zone is a raid level environment seems inconsistent in a game where a single group is the primary focus.  Certainly I think there are other problems with the SoV expansion, but this is one of the biggest.  <P>Well that is just my humble opinion, as always your mileage may vary.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I am kind of amazed at myself for saying this, Eduin is exactly right.<P>Veeshan's Peak is a great idea.  So is the Sleeper's Tomb.  But why in the world did VI think that a CASTER in a 50+ plus zone should be in the 850-per-hit-and-quad-attacks range?  (Velketor). I can understand that FoH, AL and Da'Kor might get bored and leave, if they only had two zones to themselves.  So LET them.  Most of the "uberguilds" are around 40-60 people, judging by member lists and websites.  This is not a huge loss to VI, even if ALL of the uber-guilds get bored and leave.  Out of 300,000 subscribers, that's a tiny percentage.<P>Leave ST for the ubers.  Don't touch VP.  I'll never see either zone, and it really doesn't bother me.  But what DOES bother me is that I paid for an expansion, and the only thing I go to Velious to do is work on a couple of minor quests, because anything at my level requires 3 or more groups.  <P>The Temple of Veeshan is a great example -- this is a zone designed for groups to hunt mostly for quest armor pieces. If you're on Dragon faction, you hunt in the Halls of Testing.  If you're on Giant faction, you hunt just about anything.  Yet if you enter with less than two 55+ groups, you won't be hunting ANYTHING but a necro to summon corpses.  This is so foolish when compared to hunting in Kael for the Dorf armor, or just going up to the PoG; hunting in BOTH of these places can be done with a single high-level group. (Though doing Kael (arena area) with only one group is difficult, and I die alot pulling.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) <P>The point, before I sidetrack myself any farther, is that there needs to be MORE content for a group of 55+ people, and LESS content for super-high level raids.  Zone bosses make sense to be raid-level mobs.  Yard trash that hits in the 200+ range and drops nothing does not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Your thesis is flawed, eduin-<P>1) Anyone can go to veeshans peak that wants to do whats necessary to get there. Theres no magic barrier preventing you from killing trakanon and completing the rest of the quest. For that matter no one is preventing you from getting to PoM/Sleepers tomb, but you have to do whats necessary to get there.<P>2) Most high level guilds dont spend 16 hours a day organizing a raid. They spend 1 or 2 hours getting where they are going ( depending where that is) for 24-40 people attending to arive, then spend anywhere from 1-6 hours doing the event. Total time : 8 hours. And thats overshooting it probably for MOST encounters.<P>3) There is content between the Dain and Shroom king. Severilous/Gorenaire/Talendor/Trakanon are right in that area. If you wanted to get real picky you could throw a few vp dragons in there too, since some of them are easier than the Dain.<P>I understand your argument - i disagree. Most of the game is geared for people level 20-40, not 55-60. Asserting that the 4% of all zones in EQ for HIGH level players is too much is being jelous or stupid, or maybe both.<P>Valia D`Buh<BR>Chon Durtfeet<BR>Legacy of Steel<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to agree with Eduin to the extent that I believe the focus on raid level encounters is EQ's biggest design flaw. Because the game requires massive, coordinated effort to defeat Verant's super mobs, it gives rise to things like uberguilds. Personally I believe the game should have been tailored to what 1 group could do with 6 and the truely 'epic' encounters would be 2 groups 3 at the MOST (things like ToV, VP, Derakor, etc.). And it is my assertion that a majority of people feel the same way I do (folks I have talked to at the 55+ level on my server).<P>Velious nailed home this point for me and is the main reason I stopped playing (other was PvP general lameness =p).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What I found interesting was the bubble at the low end.  Seems to support the idea the EQ is in fact growing.  Yet there is a huge number of player at the end of the games life-cycle.

</FONT><HR>Verant does seem to be heavily catering to the Uberguild type of high level player.  This is a valid point, if you are high level and not part of some monster guild your opportunities are very limited and places to go very limited.  This is not because of hatred of small guilds but because of Verant's desire for high level enounters to require an army of players with crack tactical method to even hope to attempt.<P>This is rediculous, its a grouping game, not a mass hordes game.

Regardless of whether the zone is usefull to other players or not.<P>P.S.: One could also argue that, in time, the number of people above level 55-60 will snowball due to regular level progession of even casual players. When a large number of casual players exist at the high levels, these zones (VP, ToV, etc.) will no longer be the realm of the Uber guilds only. The strategies for how to fight in these zones will be well documented and any guild with enough people will have the ability to "do" them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The content requires a level of commitment, organization, and accumulation that pretty much limits that content to what is known as an "Uberguild", because most people who play this game do NOT wish to invest 8-12 hours of continuous attention to the game, nor do they wish to get involved in anything where you have to negotiate the actions of 40 players.<P>2) Most high level guilds dont spend 16 hours a day organizing a raid. They spend 1 or 2 hours getting where they are going ( depending where that is) for 24-40 people attending to arive, then spend anywhere from 1-6 hours doing the event. Total time : 8 hours. And thats overshooting it probably for MOST encounters.<P>******************3) There is content between the Dain and Shroom king. Severilous/Gorenaire/Talendor/Trakanon are right in that area. If you wanted to get real picky you could throw a few vp dragons in there too, since some of them are easier than the Dain.**********<P><BR>The point isn't that there is NO content for "casual" players 55-60, but rather that in RELATION to the content prepared for Uberguild consumption 55-60, the casual 55-60 content is not in proportion to the population.  More "uber" content is prepared for  the 55-60 players than "casual" content is prepared.<P>Casual meaning, 1-2 groups and 2-3 hours of total time investment.<P>**************I understand your argument - i disagree. Most of the game is geared for people level 20-40, not 55-60. Asserting that the 4% of all zones in EQ for HIGH level players is too much is being jelous or stupid, or maybe both.****************<P>I think the point is that the Vellious expansion introduced a CONSIDERABLE amount of Uber Raid content, and very little high end casual content.  I think that it also reasonable to think that Verant is overly interested in providing and tweaking this content when so much of what they change, talk about, and nerf really ONLY has to do with Uber Raid encounters.<P>I not only agree with the poster, I'll go further.  The BEST content in the game should NOT be limited to that which requires Uber-raids.  There SHOULD be content that can only be taken down by an Uber-raid, but this should NOT be the BEST content.<P>Verant simply needs to develop mini-zone alternate playspace coding technology, so that a zone can be tuned to be maximally hard for a single group, instead of the possibility of simply being overwhelmed by sheer numbers in an Uber-raid.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More troublesome is that nerfs have been put in because a tiny minority of players like those in FoH find some uber encounters easy.  How did they decide after 2 YEARS that CH was overpowered?  Apparently some people found uber encounters easy.  I didn't know any of those people.  I don't know if they existed on my server at all (rodcet nife).  From everything i've heard from players I talk to in the game, killing ANY dragon or pulling off a good plane raid was an accomplishment to be proud of.  Often on such raids the party was wiped.  That was pre-heal nerf.  They're trying to tell us that for 2 years healing was overpowered and thus high end encounters were too easy.  Huh?  /boggle<BR>All of us who have played awhile probably know of countless high end raids that completely bombed.  But because FoH can go in and slaughter these mobs/zones easily now, everyone gets nerfed.  That's just dumb.  Velious was made to give those guilds something harder to do.  Let them do it.  If they find Nagy, Vox, or even Trak easy now, what of it?  Guilds like FoH are a tiny, tiny percentage of the population.  If you make something really hard for them, you've made it impossible for everyone else.  Leave them their uber zones like VP and ST, that's great, but don't penalize everyone for their success.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't disagree with your assertion about content being tailored to a small population, but there's a few things I don't think you're exactly right on.<P>First, suggesting they retune these zones isn't an entirely realistic use of their time. It might take them just as much time to retune it, eliminating content for uberguilds while creating content for smaller and less accomplished guilds, as creating entirely new content for the latter group.<P>As to there being nothing between the shroom-king and 4 group encounters, I would think plenty of Velious encounters would fit this category. Plane of Growth, Western Wastes, Velketor's Labyrinth, Siren's Grotto, Dragon Necropolis... tons of stuff for small raids to do. Maybe not as much content as you'd like, but it exists. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think if you are bringing up stuff about level 1-50 players or level 1-50 zones, you are missing the whole point. <P>Eduin is taking about the level 51-60 zones, and how most of it is gear towards encounters that require 24 or more people to accomplish. Guess what? Some us of don't _like_ raids. To me, it's a lot of waiting around, and the actual fighting, when it finally occurs, is nothing more than an experience in low framerate, and high packet loss. <P>I am also not interested in joining guilds with the kind of make up it takes to do those encounters. My guild has about 20 people above level 45, and I like it that way. We will not ever likely be able to kill Trakanon, but I am not really interested in that. I like getting together with my friends, usually in one group, but 2-3 can be fun as well, and play that way. Any more is not fun for me.<P>If that is what you like, that's fine. There SHOULD be content for those elite guilds which sport 50-100 55+ players, with plenty of warriors, clerics, enchanters, etc. <P>What I think Eduin is saying is that there is too much content geared for those guilds, and too little geared for guilds who would prefer simple grouping or small (2-3 group) raids. I agree. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
