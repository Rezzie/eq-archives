</FONT><HR>I've been waiting for this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Kael Drakkel:<P>As I understand velious, people were meant to pick a side and go with it.  Fine.  I picked giants and i'm not sorry about it, but I do think you give people who side with the giants a bit of the shaft.  Thurgadin has merchants selling every possible confection known to man.  Shaman can get all their herbs here, enchanters all metals and gems, tailors can get all patterns, ect.... Admitedly i don't have king faction, but I can't even buy bandages in Kael.  There are no merchants who sell fletching components, althought-- joy of joys -- there is one guy behind the throne room who sells 2 dmg 50 range arrows.  I just think that kael needs to be better equipt with merchants.  And while you are at it, throw in a forge, brewery and whatnot.  I feel that, even though kael is a zone people hunt in, it's a city.  It should come with all the things that any city has.  It should at the very least be able to buy fletching supplies and bandages.  Bandages would be huge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Unsure about Velious right now. I like some of it..<P>First off, where are the Ranger and Pally armors? You have goofy quests for TUNARE worshippers, which most people are NOT. The quests in this zone are for like 0.00005% of the game.. What the heck? <P>Mobs have too many HPs. You should never have broke the 32k limit.. Mobs now require you to have a totally decked out Uberguild to win, which is about 0.00000000000000000000000001% of the games players.. Why bother? Most of Velious seems catered to revolve around whether or not FoH can beat something with a group of 6 people. That flat out sucks. <P>People like to group, you should have made more of these dungeons 'doable' for a single group of 6 people to go through.. But instead you made Velk, Sleepers, Veeshans Temple, Western Wastes, Sirans Grotto all Uberguild-Only zones.<P>Suck! That's all that needs to be said. <P>The game was meant to be fun. People aren't having any fun unless they're in an uberguild. People get to 60 .. Find out their local server Uberguild doesnt need them and they start over or quit.. Pretty dumb. You need to make it fun for the non-Ubers. Make more zones for single groups, and not ones that require 6 full groups and 5 res's per player per fight.. Thats just dumb and gimpy.<P>Where's the sense of accomplishment when you've been res'd 5 times in a SINGLE fight just because some lame mob has 200k hit points and this is the only way it can be done? Sure, if the zone could handle more than 30 people in a zone without everyone going LD it might be possible, but it isn't.<P>You know better than this. <P>Or at least you SHOULD.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As I said once before, and a lot of other people have said before.  MoBs in Velious con lower than Kunark and the original land and yet they are harder to kill and give less exp than equally conning MoBs.  <P>Iceclad:  Portal is to dangerous, Ocean is to empty.  Really a lot of empty space.  <P>Great Divide - Great zone, but wurms and giants are underconned.  Bears and wurms con equal, yet I can solo bears with 2 bubbles of mana or less and shardwurms take most of my mana to kill.  Pathing problem at the tunnels are a problem, pets get lost under the world.  When Liching, the coldain wolfs instantly con, even though I am aimably with the Coldain.  Might want to change so lich doesnt completely ruin your faction maybe just dropp it from aimably to indifferent or dubious, at least outside the cities.  <P>East Wastes - Same problem as above, underconned MoBs, and things are concentrated in areas.  Doubling the number of griffons in another part of the zone would make it a bit more interesting.  However these griffons con equal to the mainland ones yet they are much much harder. <P><BR>Only lvl 42 so I cant speak to much on the other zones, Crystal Caverns is the only one I have partially explored and it seemed fine</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Best way I know of to sum it up is to quote from a message of the day posted shortly after Kunark released: <P> "Its always a good idea to bind on the same continent that you fight on."  <P> Now here's an expansion that prevents melees from doing that without traveling through 3 huge lvl 30+ zones first. <P> Since playability for a large portion of the player base was ignored at its most basic level in this expansion, really moot to even begin to classify the other problems in depth. <P> Nothing new there, of course.  Kunark was a good start to hindering enjoyment.  "Oh sorry, YOU have to bind in Overthere, and YOU have to bind in Firiona Vie... what, you wanted to adventure together? LOL, Hard Cheese, schmuck, but thanks for the cash... Oh, and you'll be happy to know that you can't fight in several of the dungeons your friends do because of faction booby traps we inserted in the game, isn't that a hoot?  *We* thought so, and we are gaming gods..." <P> Which is the main point.  Why ask, since you got what you wanted ($$$)?  If you gave a fetid dingo's kidney about playability for users, you would not keep throwing roadblocks to friends playing together like the faction dead-ending and binding jokes in Velious and the VS faction practical joke you installed in Kunark. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Skyshrine:<P>This zone would be fun, but the loot is really bad.  As in the things that drop there are not useful to people who are level 30.  This is not an exaggeration.  For instance, a 50hp/50mana 2HB caster staff.  Level 30's already have steins and such that are better for them.  And this is a typical item that's in Skyshrine off of level 50-63+ mobs.  It's really a HUGE and beautiful zone, it's a terrible shame that it is not worth "doing" (the first part of the zone, up to the courtyard is properly itemized, but past that it's just a LOT of wasted space -- you have a dungeon here that's literally 10 times bigger than Lower Guk, and nobody will go there because it's full of ubermobs that drop loot worse than what's in Lower Guk!).  I believe it is as hard as Plane of Growth, but there are simply no rewards for it.  My suggestion: move some items out of other zones (WWL, Necropolis) into here to make it worth doing.  I realize it is supposed to be a "city" zone for dragons, but so is Kael, and item drops off of giants in Kael are pretty uber.  We've killed everything as far as the dragon and mostly gotten just poop in Skyshrine.  We found nothing that makes us want to go back, ever.<P>Plane of Growth:<P>Okay, so the armor here is uber, perhaps that's all we can expect, but it's still a difficult zone, it would be nice if there was SOME experience to be made here.  In two solid weeks of going to PoG every night and being in a group that gets most of the kills every night, I gained 1 blue bubble in level 56.  1 bubble per 2 weeks makes this possibly the worst XP zone in the game.<P>Kael:<P>More quests!  I keep seeing all these uber dragon and dwarf quests.  I went with giant faction, and so far it appears that the best loot in Kael is gotten by killing the giants, not questing for them.  Yes, I've seen the armor quests, but it's nearly identical to what drops in PoG, and anyway I have yet to hear of anyone ever finding out where the main quest componet drops.  Most of the Kael quests seem aimed at level 30-40's, whereas a number of the dragon/dwarf quests yield items that are uber for people in their 50's.<P>My main beef about Velious is still Skyshrine.  Such a great zone for people in their 50's, and it should be an obvious place to hunt for giant quests, but there's just nothing there.  Huge, huge place full of high level hard hitters that drop worthless trinkets and aren't worth much XP.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why doesn't kael have more vendors and trade skill equipment (forges etc)? I know several people who for roleplaying reasons would want to go with giant faction, but can't bring themselves to do it because of access to tradeskill items. for example, orge/troll/iksar shamans who want access to an alternate source of potion materials.<P>Also, is Thurgadin properly itemized?

</FONT><HR>I love SOV. The experience is outstanding as I have seen it. The faction building is a bit tuff (took 28hrs of giant killing to build Claws faction) but other than that not bad. The creatures are great, loots are great, and the graphics rock! I expecially like the forest scheme in Wakening lands! (good break from all that snow)<BR>My only problem is Wuoshi. This dragon LIVES at the ring in WL. I have spent 28hrs + building faction with him and the inhabitants of SkyShrine (I am amiable to both now). My problem with Wuoshi is that he kills whoever ports into WL rings (even when amiable as I am). This happend to me the other night and I was very disappointed to say the least. My porter was also amiable and due to my fast pc/dsl connection, I popped in rings before her. Wuoshi rooted then blasted me to death from outside the rings. The GM on the quellous server told me they could not res me as this was working as intended. He told me that a characters image pops before the faction loads and that Wuoshi did not know I was amiable to him  The porter poped as I died and Wuoshi left her alone (good for her I guess). I have talked to numerous people after this happend and found this to be true in all cases (whoever pops 1st ie fastest connection gets to die at the hands of wuoshi while the remainder of the group (if not KOS) goes unharmed. <P>I think a fix to this would be to move wuoshi away from the rings or slow his aggro time so that peoples faction can get loaded before he decides to attack. I don't know if this would be a fix, but I do know that with all the current trying to get people to use underused areas, this ring will go by the wayside as people with amiable faction are not willing to die/lose xp from a dragon with whom is supposed to like you.<P>Other than this one problem, I love SOV and it is my new home until something better comes along  (Only wish I could find some of the new quest armor items....they seem to be tooo rare ie. the gems/corroded stuff)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to contest some of the things that were said about Kael, my opinion is a bit different:<P>Kael Drakkel:<BR>I love the fact that this zone is so tank dependant.  When you fill a zone full of hard hitting high HP giants, there's really no better strategy then to have a group with a very tough tank and some damage dealing melees (rogue and monk).  A proper group of mid to high 50s can get back into the areas behind the Arena for some slaying of 55+ giants for the more frequent corroded or other quest armor drops.  It's not impossible, it's very challenging and I very much enjoy hunting there.  I worked very hard there and to show for it I have my first 2 Champion's armor pieces and Defiance.  Risk vs Reward works well here.<P>As for the Dragon zones and faction:<BR>I love this too.  I like the fact that you have Wuoshi right near the portal, it is after all a "dragon portal."  He's obviously guarding it and if you don't like a dragon governing the land, either make friends with it or kill it.  People who aren't KOS to Dragons basically have built themselves a gateway to Wakening Lands, Skyshrine, and Cobalt Scar.  Quests in Western Wastes are also being discovered too and I'll bet the faction will pay off there as well. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here we go,<P>  I didn't spend the time reading the last 2 pages of discussion.  So some may already have been duplicated sorry for that.<P>  Thurgadin?? The Dwarven city....<P>1) The fire noise is loud, especially with the echo.  I pretty much have to mute the system while in the city.<BR>2) Hmmm...spells, oh yeah go to cleric area and by spells....hmm problem is this is a 30th and higher area, but the spells that I can buy are 1st thru 19th level spells except for the new spell.  Does this mean that the dwarves at those levels can wander out and adventure in the surrounding zone?  I would rather no spells be sold than low level spells that can be bought by levels who can't make it there and adventure.<P>Zones in general....Large, very large...this is cool, but for thoses of us who have to run, non-sowed, it takes a long time to cross a zone, sometimes it is not worth the run...especially if you have to run back to freeport for food, water, and spells.<P> The creatures in general.....they eat a lot of steroids don't they?  How many HP's do cougars need....also how resistent is the stuff in these zones.  I especially like to go mana empty and watch most of the spells bounce off a blue creature, while I stand there and become panther fodder.<P> I like the zones and the idea behind them; however, I don't go to kunark because the zones are far from safe areas, supplies run low and you have a long run to get them.  I know that this was made to make it more of a challenge, which is cool....but if I have to spend 2 hours of RL time to have 30 minutes of gameplay fun, I tend to wonder if I should just give up altogether and find another hobby. I love the game, but I am sitting in front of a computer many hours running from zone to zone.  I think you should look into how you can provide better travel time vs. real time....although I think that is nearly impossible.<P>  You guys are doing a pretty good job considering how many people you have out here who all want different things.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I read several posts concerning Kael vs. Thurgadin. I do know that most mobs in Icewell keep (the dwarves I am talking about) drop some darn nice stuff compared to the giants. I believe I have figured out the reason for this. I am guessing that 75% of the people on the boards side with the stumpymen, and Verant knew this was going to happen. With that knowledge they gave the dorfs better loot compared to the giants in order to make everything equal for people no matter what race they side with. I side with the giants, and it is almost impossible to get a dwarf group together in icewell, and anywhere else dwarves are found..<P>btw, if you are on bertoxx and want to kill dwarves in icewell send me a tell, my name is Dudjol hehe.<P>Bye all... Oh yeah, Velious zones are great, and I can't wait to be the first to kill wuoshi on my server considering none of the high level guilds are pro giant...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have gone to SoV several times now. My opinion boils down to a simple few words "uber guilds playground". I've tried soloing n grouping here, mobs take twice the amount of mana or dmg that Kunark beasties do for the same amount of exp. Constantly getting attack by greenies and using the same amount if not more mana to kill them then same cons in other lands. The only time we made any headway was in a "8" group raid to the Giant city arena area. After 6 hours one piece of quest arms fell. 5 groups bowed out and the rest of us couldn't hold the area and had to evac out. I haven't been back since and when asked to port I tell people I dont have the expansion. Bravo Verant you have created a land where only the uber guilds can go and survive and get uber gear(like VP only on a grander scale). I for one will never again (sadly) buy another expansion. I will just play until Antonica and Kunark bores me to tears then go find something else to do in the form of another on-line game. IMHO these lands were created with the mindset of players dieing thereby slowing leveling thereby paying more to play more to level more so they can die more and pay more to play more to level more etc etc etc. I haven't been to PoM and can not fight in PoG because I'm a druid that doesnt want to screw up his faction. But from what I've heard of PoM you wont be seeing this zone used much other then by the uber guild. Much like The Hole and VP it will become a relatively unused zone because even the uber guilds will tire of it, leaving it totally empty. Go ahead add a zone modifier to it like you did to The Hole that lasted what one week before it went back to a relatively unused zone again it wont matter. Making a mob uber hard kill and with the mindset of killing as many player as possible isnt fun(my channeling is maxed but cant even get one cast of with something I should be killing in seconds). I'm sorry I bought this expansion because the graphics are very nice but it is so unbalanced that I feel cheated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, I find it funny how many people posted that they loved Plane of Growth.  Me personally I think it is the worst idea ever for an expansion.  It was obviously just randomly tossed in so that people could get uber lewts and keep playing the game.  So what if people spent months working on a Trakanon or Venril Sathir strat to finish their Kunark armors, so what if people spent months working towards getting their Fiery Defender.  Lets just toss a zone in that can be done EASILY with 6-12 people and let them get loot better than anything else in the game so far.  *** is that?  Add to that the fact that it doesnt drop anything for Paladins/druid/ranger AND the quests are only for people who worship a certain god.

</FONT><HR>Okay here goes:<BR>(I'm avoinding mentioning specific quests/npcs that have been mentioned elsewhere in need of fixes)<P>Iceclad - Solo/Single Group/maybe more for Lodizal - well done for the most part, but lots of wasted space. You could put some stuff in the water and on the icebergs. Lodizal -- smaller version of the Wuoshi problem -- he can summon and gets wounded badly enough to be able to summon by NPCs --&gt; result is instant death for any PC that wanders nearby since PCs almost always are vaulted to the top of the aggro list. <P>Tower of Frozen Shadow - single group/raid - Nice zone, just make the keys work like the port keys -so you only need the highest. <P>Eastern Wastes - Solo/Single Group (raid for some quests)- Great zone - lots of interaction, risk and excitement. You could probably again toss stuff in the water.<P>Crystal Caves - Single Group -- too high of a level range among the critters -- I'd say make the orcs a little tougher. Major issues with the Coldain -- seems like there should be lots of quests, but impossible to get answers. <P>Great Divide - Solo/Single Group -  Good zone as well no major issues<P>Velketors - Single group/raid - too great a level range - between the spiders/gargoyles being too low level and the difficulty of the dungeon this will become as useless as permafrost. (IE only visited when a raid comes to kill the boss mob.)<BR>Has some very good hunting for 51-55th, but they are too hard for anything short of a raid to get to. <P>Thurgadin - friendly to dwarves - too few quests compared to Kael. Seems to be too easy to kill dwarves and/or pass through if KoS. <P>Icewell Keep - Single Group/Raid - topside with Dwarves is way too easy for the rewards and compared to Giants, Dain has died multiple times on most servers already and large parts of the keep are camped/farmed frequently. Basement/Dungeon is too difficult for level -- this is where they velious uber mob syndrome starts kicking in -- extremely magic resistant mobs/with tons of HPs/that hit like a freight train --&gt; most of the stuff down here fights a good 5+ levels tougher than it is. (Example sebilite juggs of 57-58th level are easier kills than a 52nd level avalanche golem -- very very wrong.)<P>Kael Drakkel - single group/raid - nice layout, giants are way too tough for their cons. If they are going to fight like that then they should con higher. Armor for quests is way too rare. Loot in general is nowheres near as good as what can be found in skyshrine/icewell. <P>Wakening Lands - Single group/raid for Wuoshi - Very nice zone except for WUOSHI --&gt; Here is the problem again: it is his aggro radius coupled with summon ability and the fact that he is KoS to giants. He aggros from across the zone - fine NP I can outrun him, on the way to me he fights a giant - gets whacked down 10% and instantly summons me. That is the problem -- unless you can find a way of making him not able to summon until you have attacked him  his aggro range needs to be turned way down. <P>Plane of Growth - single group/raid - Make the faction hits more far reaching - like every druid/follower of Tunare in the game. This place is way too easy for the rewards and has already been camped/farmed 24/7 on many servers. <P>Skyshrine - single group/raid - nice place - seems mostly okay<P>Cobalt Scar - solo/single group - nice - but largely a waste of a zone. It isn't big enough -- it only supports a few groups at a time. Drakes breath aoe is too big - pulls half the othmir off the beach unless you are extremely carefull. wyverns are too wimpy for level, bulthar are fun - but the rewards for killing them are too small.<BR>Othmir quest for ulthork tusks/bulthar trunks may be broken - investigate. <P>Sirens Grotto --&gt; Never made it into here or past as the place is a death trap. Requires either succor or a full 55th+ raid to get through. You need to seriously tone down the difficulty for the zone to get used at all. <P>Western Wastes, Dragon Necropolis, Veeshans Temple, Plane of Mischief -- thanks tons for puting these totally out of the reach of most players, not a brilliant move on your part. Even those 51st+ have a nearly impossible time even getting to these places - let alone doing anything there. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is why I tend to stay away from Velious nowadays...<P>Me, 40 warrior, and my friend, 38 druid, were pulling to that huge bridge in the Eastern Wastes. We were killing snow cougars and mammoths without too much trouble - most of them conned blue to me, some were yellow. Then, we came across a different kind of animal, a manticore I believe it was called. It conned blue to both of us so we decided to wax it since we had being killing things that had conned yellow to both of us. <P>So the battle begins... <P>He roots and snares the thing while I proceed to lay the smackdown. After a while I notice that my hit points are slowly going down but the manticore's are not. My friend is spending most of his mana re-rooting and re-snaring this thing and healing me, and throwing in the occasional nuke when mana permitted. This process went on for over 20 minutes, and I was double hitting this thing for 90ish most of the time and he just was not dying. Finally, the mana ran dry, the root and snare wore off, my SOW dropped and that thing owned me!!! We ended up killing each other actually (me and the manticore), but without all of the heals it could have easily killed me 5 or 6 times over.<P>So, why did this thing con blue to a 40 warrior and a 38 druid when it was obviously WAY more powerful than either of us?!<P>Another reason I do not go to Velious is lag. Everything is fine in any other zone, but as soon as I get to Velious I get MAD lag. And corpse runs across zones that make East Karana look small get real old real fast. At least make it so that everyone can bind to that huge bridge. Maybe even put an outpost type thing there like the one on the bridge from North to South Karana.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't been there much, but I'd like to make a comment about PoG:<P>I don't roleplay much, but I roleplay enough that I don't want to go to PoG.  I certainly don't want to kill stuff there.  And, excruciating boredom aside, I don't really want to sit there doing nothing while my guild gets stuff for me.  That's like being opposed to drug dealers in real life but, if my drug-dealing brother-in-law feels like giving me a Porsche, what the heck.  It's wrong.<P>Now, I wouldn't mind if there were some other equivalently difficult way to get comparable armor.  But there isn't.  The drop rate on corroded is vastly less than the drop rate on PoG armor, and then you have to go get the 3 stones as well.  Plus, you have to do a quest turn-in, which has, so far, failed 1 out of the 3 times my guild has tried it, for no apparent reason (and, of course, no reimbursement from Verant).<P>Basically, this zone penalizes people for staying true to roleplaying considerations.  And it penalizes the classes whose stuff doesn't drop there.<P>It wasn't well thought out.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think enough has been said about the SG zone. If you want to make a zone which requires multiple groups for crawling, at least don't make the zone-in area instant death.<P>Velk's Lab? poorly thought out. You go through huge numbers of green mobs to reach the named. The named are very tough but the main problem is lag. Reduce the polygon count, do something. If you place a mob in an area knowing it will require 4+ groups at least address the lag issues you know are going to result.<P>In general you did a good job on the outdoor zones and a poor one on the dungeons. The mobs are way too tough, which is fine, except that the risk vs reward is not balanced.<P>I would like to once again bring up the fact that you keep making the same item mistakes over and over. Jboots, rubicite have tought you nothing. Why do you insist on creating hotly contested rare spawns? There is no reason for this. Create the time sink in the trigger instead if you must have one.

</FONT><HR>Ok, i've fought in a few of the more common zones, here's my info.<P>Great Divide:<BR>The exp from the wurms is awful.  I guess maybe becuase they drop spells and other rare items, but still, if it cons the same as another creature, the exp should be similiar.  This ties with the drakkel dire wolves, the exp off them is great! Even with the same group from the wurms to the wolves, the exp on the wolves is better, and the faction is handy.  But, the wolves don't drop much, black steel wrap (lore though, so once ya get one yer done), and the skins.  Give em some coin for crying out loud!  The tizmak, good exp too! Great at lvl 30, but again, no coin! They do have weapons and armor that sells for a few pp each, but comeone! If they talk, they should have money!  The kodiaks, get a little rough, didn't spend too much time there.  The giants are miss conned, It is blue, i know it says blue, just like the wolves, BUT he hits much harder and can't be stunned. This area seems to be a good group area, large or small depending on what your killing.<P>Thurgadin:<BR>Just recently started hunting here, in the mines.  I just gotta say i love it in there! Easy spawns, guards will sometimes help you if you need it, and there is coin on the bats and goo! (but no coin on wolfs or tizmaks??) Makes up for the no weapons, but great EXP soloing in there.  Went from half a blue into 38 to a full blue in 39 in one day or soloing.  But the pathing down there is a little messed up, sometimes they will swim the little water, and sometimes they just appear underneath you and start biting.  The rails look solid enough, but you can't walk on them. Probably so people wouldn't get stuck in them, but if i see something, i think i can walk on it, it'd be better to just take them out.<P>WakeningLands:<BR>Ahh gotta love that! First time i killed a tigerraptor i loved it!  Haven't killed anything else except tigerosaurous but i love the zone layout, most deffinately a small group spawn there.<P>EasternWastes:<BR>Gotta con EVERYTHING!  Somethings are green, then BAM! you hit his bigger brother who is red.  Just gotta watch your step and make sure you con everything.  Best done in a group with a druid or shaman, for sow.  (I'm still waiting to run into a lvl 50 snowbunny)<P>Just gotta say i like SOV alot!  Fastest lvling i've done in a while and a lot less laggy than kunark!  Wakening Lands is my favorite!  Hunting down raptors in a true woodland zone is much fun! Just need to add the coin that those lvl of monsters should have.  It really stinks spending an entire lvl killing stuff and getting maybe a total of 20pp..

</FONT><HR>No idea if this was covered already, I haven't the patience to read all 7 pages =P But the thing thats been irking me is how all the uber mobs(Dain, Yel, Zland, etc) are totally immune to non-lures. I can understand why lures were needed in kunark when mobs were restricted to 32k hp.. But if you can give them as much as you want, why do you need to totally invalidate the nukes of all the (non-wizard)casting classes? Currently as a druid all I seem to do on raids is fizzle my SH while trying to heal someone. Dropping resists rates on all the uber stuff would make the game more fun for alot of people, heh.

</FONT><HR>VI,<P>I play a 49 Wizard on Veeshan.<P>In all honesty - I truly love this expansion for the beauty of it. The new graphics, waterfall, slippery ice, etc: make it a very interesting place to be. <P>I could list things zone by zone, but pretty much everything has been covered.<P>To me, Velious is nothing but an UBER playground on my server. It's always fun to watch FoH and all their hordes run through Wakening Lands decked out in the finest that EQ has to offer. My heart does a pitter-patter knowing that for a moment - I was in THEIR sandbox, before I have to head back to my own place on the server.<P>My guild is small and the people are incredible, but for the amount of energy and time and effort involved to get multiple guilds together to take on a zone, the risk versus reward is simply lacking. The drops are so few and far between, that if anything does drop, the lottery ensues and folks end up leaving and heading back to the old lands. Exp is marginal and for the time invested - you can do much, much better elsewhere.<P>As for me? Well - I am just after my portals. Maybe I can make some money being a taxi there. The UBERs pay well and it seems that I am a second class citizen as a taxi driver. I know my place - second class citizenship all the way!<P>As far as role playing, story lines, etc - I cannot even get a decent group because everyone knows that Wizards are useless in this new land. Since the NPC's got updated and the players did not, I am in effect "baggage". If I do manage to get a spell to land throughout my mana bar - I "dance on my tip toes..."<P>The extra HP's and high magical resistances jsut mean that it is not a place for me. I can understand why melee classes like it. They feel more valuable now. And they should. But if they are complaining about a lack of porting people, hmm....  I wonder why?<P>There is better loot in this expansion for my class, as Kunark seemed to be devoted to melee. I really do not mind, but as it stands now - I will never see any of this loot due to the lack of resources available to me. I simply do not have enough friends and UBER contacts to be able to pull anything together multiples times (now remember the drop rate) in order to be rewarded with something nice.<P>Pick a zone - you name it. If a green hits me hard, I have nothing to save me. High resists even effect the Root and Stun series. I have to flee like a little girl with my JBoots to the zone.<P>If I port to Velious - I am charging a TON of money due to the risk facter - my risk of life plus the cost of the Regeants (12pp) to cover my shielding spell. Melee players - be prepared to pay dearly for your ports.

</FONT><HR>I really want to like SoV. I really, really do. I can tell that a lot of effort and hard work went into creating this expansion, and that I appreciate. But to be honest, right now I am frustrated and, now understanding some of the details of SoV beyond "oooh it's pretty", I can't help but frankly be offended that you would actually release an expansion designed primarily around one specific, extreme style of pla<P>Let me give a little background. I play a level 56 wizard. I'm in a planes-capable, but maybe not "uber" guild. I would consider myself "above average" as far as how casual my play is, considering that to even get to 55+ takes quite a bit of dedication that a "casual" player may never achieve. Now, that being said, I fully expect that I WILL NEVER SEE 70% OF THE CONTENT OF SOV. That is just a plain fact. And that, to me, is offensive.<P>The reasons why? Let me count them.<P>First a foremost, the mobs you have created here are so completely out of whack with your own con and risk/reward system. <P>I can count ON ONE HAND the places in the entire expansion that a single group of 55+ can hunt for experience, and now that you've removed the Oracle of Ry`Gorr from Eastern Wastes, there are exactly zero places that I can solo. Now, I understand you are trying to encourage group play, but why are you trying to FORCE HUGE MULTI-GROUP play down our throats? I was hoping for more dungeons like Seb or Karnor's where a well-balanced group of 55+ could hunt for decent xp, decent (perhaps not godlike) loot, and in general just have fun. This is THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what you have provided. Now everything either cons green and gives no experience (despite the fact that most of it will easily kill me) or, if it does give experience, requires large multi-group raids to kill. Oh and what's more, if those groups aren't equipped with the best gear (which you have probably nerfed for "balance" issues anyway) and comprised of the absolute perfect balance, then the entire raid will be slaughtered. All this so one or two people can get some piece of loot. This is fun?<P>Second, while I believe the faction system has good intentions, it too serves to limit in the extreme how much of SoV's content I can experience. In addition, the implementation is terrible.<P>Being a wizard, I killed a lot of giants to increase my Claws faction (read: not be KOS) so I could use the dragon circles. Then, of course, I find out that a good 30-40% of the expansion are places for groups to HUNT DRAGONS. So in order to actually use my class abilities safely (teleportation) I have to cut myself off from 30% of the expansion? Never mind the fact that the wizard port spells are sold on a Skyshrine vendor. I feel sorry for those wizards who side with giants.<P>Yes some areas of the expansion could be more difficult without the proper faction, but it should be an inconvenience, not an outright exclusion of entire areas.<P>Third, and this is related to my first post, are the miscons, and lack of experience-giving mobs for the very audience you are trying to cater to. This is perhaps the most offensive aspect of the entire expansion, and one that has me considering my days in EQ numbered.<P>You wanted to make the expansion more challenging, that's understood. But the way you accomplished this was to take low-level (and this green-conning) mobs and give them damage, hit points, abilities and resistances equivalent to mobs many levels higher. So in effect, even though these mobs are more dangerous and more difficult to kill, we get less reward for them. How is this risk vs reward? Please, explain this to me. And this is referring to the standard wandering mobs (most of which are highly aggressive). This isn't even considering mobs like Lodizal, perhaps the biggest green-conning joke in the game. Why not throw the entire con system out the window? Heck why not throw the entire experience system out the window, since at least in SoV, it seems designed to make sure those of us whom the expansion was designed for (55+) get as LITTLE experience as possible.<P>What it comes down to, is for all intents and purposes, you cheated. Instead of making more content for high levels (which is what I was expecting) you decided to change the rules, tilting the field WELL in favor of the game monsters and environment. Meaning that the majority of the content that you so painstakingly crafted will probably never be experienced by the vast majority of your customers. Is that REALLY what you wanted out of this?<P>Think about that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Wow boy have i been waiting for this thread though i'm prolly not going to be as complete as i'd like to be in my assesment.  Ok some back ground before I start this.   First of all I play on a server where there are 3 "uber" guilds for the most part (in that I mean guilds that have fought and killed most every boss type mob in the old worlds ie trak, vs, gods, etc.) <P>My guild is the smallest of these 3 and on a typical night we have about 20 people on (30 for posted raids).  90% of the guild is 55+.   We typically do things in small groups....before sov we could adventure and have lots of fun in every dungeon with 1 group...which worked really well cause we had a break from when we decided to "raid".  We could kill the boss mobs because we are very organized and work really well together.  Our motive has always been to kill the biggest mobs with the fewest people and the best strategy. <P>I understand that SoV was supposed to provide a challenge to the extremely high lvl crowd, which i belive my guild fits into, but you completely overshot the difficulty vs fun model on this.  <P>Point 1) Mobs that do 3 times the damage and have 3 times the hps do not equal 3 times the fun.<P>The main mechanic i've seen for upping the challenge in SoV is giving mobs ungodly hps and having them hit extremely hard (lets use the boss mobs in Velkator's Labrynth as an example).<P>mini boss: Lord Djlongname -- this is a great boss type mob he's well guarded and requires a good strat to kill with our usual crew ( 3 groups). He hits very hard but his hps mean that we can kill him with this small group.  This encounter is widely declared the most fun everybody has had in a long time...hurrah!  <P>Boss : Velk the sorcerer-  Ok so we take our same group down to the big guy to play with him a bit.  Well Velk hits for quad 850's and has some ungodly amount of hps, he chewed up a warrior using defensive disc in 10-12 secs.  to make a long story short we have to have a 10-15 min fight with this huge mob (as opposed to like 5 min tops on kunark and old world mobs) which will always end up being a war of attrition.  That just doesn't strike me as a lot of fun....when you can completely command an entire fight and then since its gone on for so long that the monster has run out of mana (which you'd think would be a good thing) he super melee's yer whole posse to death. That isn't much fun and from what i've seen this is what "normal" boss mobs all over vellious are like.  That means two things we need to do, either plan a strategy that involves everyone dying multiple times or recruit more people (which brings me to  my next point).<P>Point 2:  There are a finite number of lvl 55+ people on a server (and they all can't be in my guild)<P>I certainly understand that there are guilds out there that can accomplish every task set before them in sov and on our server pretty much all of the biggest and baddest mobs have been killed by one guild.  But they did this in part by recruiting just a ton of extra people for their guild.  They took their very skilled core player base then padded it with pretty much every extra body they could find that was 55+.  Well its pretty obvious that every guild on the server can't do this because there just aren't enough people to go around.  Plus as i'm sure it is with many other guilds member ship in our guild is NOT based on yer phat vp lewt gathering ability, its based on how well you get along with the people already in the guild.  That's always been the biggest strength of most guilds a tight bond of friendship and we're not willing to compromise that to try to kill a stubborn mob.<P>Point 3) Faction isn't Fun<P>Ok first off I think that faction is a noble idea and from an rp'er perspective it makes it possible to do "good" and "bad" deeds.  But as far as I can tell in SoV its only purpose is to anger people and generally annoy them.  First off there just aren't that many compelling reasons to keep dwarf or giant faction that high (or any faction really).  As far as I can tell there is very little unique gear that comes out of the cities that is quest only.  The armor quests produce very similar results across the board....killing mobs usually gives what you quest for if you don't have good faction.....the only issue with faction i see is that it makes it harder to run through kael and ss to get deeper into sov.  Dragon faction lets you explore veeshan's temple in a different way and from what I read lets you get to PoM....but no where have i even heard of people saying that they had more fun because of the new factions.  <P>Point 4) Twink gear is not a good reward for a lvl 60.<P>The loot tables in sov totally ruin the economy.  Basically from what i've seen unless yer killing really really hard stuff (2+ groups of 60's) all yer gonna get for the effort is bank clutter/stuff you'll destroy.  And all of it is basically a reworked version of an old item.  Well the problem is when you have 2 items with very similar stats is that they both drop in price a ton...when every single item that drops in a 50+ dungeon that's tradeable is comprable or worse than items that drop in lvl 20-30 lvl dungeons you have issues.  All trading in the mid range equipment area has been totally messed up by the loot distribution in sov.  Too many items are "a sov yak" "a sov diamondine earring" "a sov crafted bp"....yada yada.  For me it means i just destroy about 70% of my loot before i leave the dungeon.  the only difference between sov and the old world equivalent is the look which really has just face value after about a month of release.<P>Point 5)  Pathing is the single most important thing to make sure is good in a zone.<P>i'd just like to ask that you guys don't even bother opening zones that the pathing isn't working in.  Velk's has really good pathing it feels finished.  Sirens grotto has even worse pathing than chardok and the hole (which is unfooking beliveably bad).  Its great when the "challenge" of an already difficult zone is augmented by the fact that mobs will warp themselves to the nearest body of water while you're fighting them on land and this will cause mobs in every surrounding room to destroy you nearly instantly.  If you insist on releasing the zones "as is" have the decency to warn the gms so they can have some clue of what's going on rather than ending up with a big "that's the way its supposed to be" argument when a group gets killed because 15 mobs decide to warp in from the room above for no particular reason.<P>Summary<P>Wow i wrote alot and i still missed some points.  Well if anybody from vi actually reads this and thinks it was at all useful email me at cbartlo@hotmail.com and i'll give ya some more detailed stuff.  But i'd like to end on this note.<P>I really think that most challenges of the  55+ lvl crowd should be targeted for around 2-4 groups tops because that's a size that folks can accomplish without a ton of pre-planning.  Even the folks that play this game 10 hours a day have schedules to keep and that means that every guild can never have every member available to them for a big encounter.  A 3 group target would give folks the flexibility to do these things as pick up raids and allow guilds with less levels and people do them as full on 30 people raids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Velious is well-nigh perfect. Please, dear gods, do not tone this place down because of people who would be happy with a lever in the wall that you pull for experience.<P>General Commentary:<P>I love the amount of quests you have. Nearly everything is for a quest. Figuring these out have been some of the highlights of my times in Velious. I especially think the shawl quest in Thurgadin, and the armor quests in both Skyshrine and Thurgadin are ingenious. The armor that comes out the other side is wonderful, and the time it takes to get it makes it all worthwhile. I love gathering the different gems!<P>Wuoshi is perfect right where she is. I've thought so since the day she first ran me over. This little bit of spice added into the Wakening Lands is great amounts of fun and challenge. I still remember the excitement of watching a brave troll ShadowKnight train her carefully away from his party, feigning skillfully each step of the way. And have I noted that those sentient suits are some of the spiffiest-looking mobs about?<P>The layout/dragon circle save points are a fantastic change. I love the challenge of fighting my way through to new places. I've only gotten as far as Cobalt Scar, and I can't wait to see the rest.<P>Faction! Gods, whoever came up with the factions here may have been a genious. I've had more fun raising factions with the different groups here than I have in a long time. The day I accidentally ran into Wuoshi and she didn't eat me was so exciting for me. Now if only Yelinak didn't hate me....<P>Velious is beautiful. The look, the feel, the design, it does my Barbarian heart good. I don't gain experience as fast here as I might parking my keister in Lower Guk, but strangely, I'm very loathe to leave the place. Skyshrine may be the most amazing zone I've ever had the pleasure to explore.<P>Specifics:<P>Dropped spells, while a fantastic idea that I approve of, can be a real frustration. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that, unless they're in your guild, players are often a selfish lot, and I don't fancy being scalped for spells. Perhaps they could be a bit more common as drops, or even sold for an exhorbitant price at vendors. I guarantee, it would be easier than selling my firstborn to someone else.<P>Plane of Growth: this place is supposed to be amazingly easy and have fantastic loot. Unfortunately, I'll never know about the loot, because I don't wish to attack denizens of Tunare. This means I will never see my Spirt Weaver's armor. You should be able to quest for these items as well as kill for them...I'd go through any number of hoops. (If you can indeed quest for this armor or get comparable equipment elsewhere and I just haven't found it yet, please ignore this paragraph.)<P>Thurgadin is a wonderful city. Seeing the king having court is great! Finally, some interactivity from the NPCs. And this hub of trade skills is really a boon.<P>Mob difficulty is excellent. This place is a real challenge. Unfortunately, it will likely not see as much use as Lower Guk or Sebilis, which are the experience levers of the game (IMHO). I don't want you to change the mob difficulty in Velious...I'd rather see you jack up the difficulty in the old world dungeons.<P>Honestly, I think that Velious is what all zones and areas should be. It is challenging but not unfairly so. It is complex and interactive. It has a rich, detailed storyline behind it. It's beautiful. It has a little something for everyone (except of course the people who want everything easy and RIGHT NOW). It seems very well balanced. I would be heartbroken if you changed very much at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a concurring opinion that your mud-inflation sucks pretty bad and I wish you would hire some people who know RPG's in order to work on your RPG.<P>Couple of points in particular...<P>Sirens Grotto - duh. I could go off on some rant here, but im just too dumbfounded by your development team to put words to it.<P>All Zones Beyond Grotto - shrug, dunno.. havent seen em. Nice loot apparently for the uber guilds you are coding for. (Note to company - Lets spend half a year coding zones for 1% of our population)<P>PoM - what brief flash of ignorance put this in the back of a level 60 dungeon when you can reach every other Plane easily? Why do you feel the need to screw Paladins, Rangers, and Druids? (this assumes that is where our armor drops) If you ever actually finish making the zone you have been saying "was in the game and working" maybe we will find out.<P>Wakening Lands - big large sucky zone no one hunts in. Lots of monsters roaming around pointlessly. Just connect the PoG to the exit of Kael and youll save us all alot of time and free up some of your computers memory.<P>Cobalt Scar - shrug, great for druids to kite wyverns. Otherwise - nothing worth seeing... move along.....<P>Crystal Caverns - my god, who made this zone? Give that man a raise and make him head of zone creation. A nicely laid out zone, that you can "DO!" Space between monsters and fun winding tunnels make this one of the best zones ever. Who actually came up with the concept of having monsters who are simular level scattered in the zone without the RED mobs peppered in to kill your party? What a freakin' concept! Best dungeon in the game IMHO.<P>Eastern Wastes - Ive enjoyed it. I just stay away from super monsters who have too may HP and drop not loot at all. What a waste of coding time. I like the Coldain Ring quest. Very nice overall.<P>Final notes...<P>Perhaps when you release a new expansion, and claim how proud you are of your team for putting it out so quick.... ummm.. maybe have it actually finished?<P>I would dare say your company is considered about as trustworthy as a lawyer.<P>Partial quests, non-working quests, totally missing quests, non-finished zones (PoM in particular). Your company should concentrate on Quality instead of non-working Quantity.<P>-----------<BR>Im 54th level now. And i really love how everything green can kill me much easier now, than when i was level 5. No EXP for you!<BR>-----------<P>C<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's a few...<P>Velektor's Labyrinth<P>Kudos for the innovation but, unfortunately, the ice bridges lose their novely quickly and most CoH past them to get to the top.<P>Kael Drakkal<P>Not bad as a city but feels to dungeony. Since most start on dwarf faction and since giants give good dragon faction you have assured that this will be nothing but a killing zone. King Tormax is FAR too hard, however. Dain Frostreaver is slain every time he spawns but Tormax has yet to be slain due to his insane damage (quad hits for 800?!?!). Please adjust him down some.<P>Wakening Lands<P>Not bad as a zone but, like Trak's Teeth, nothing more than a dangerous zone to run through thanks to Wuoshi and her insane AE radius. If you can see Wuoshi you're dead. I'm not kidding. Worse, even if you have good faction if someone with bad faction comes by (ie uses the WL TP) then you get hit with her AE and get onto her hate list. Fix the AE/hate list problem.<P>Cobolt Scar<P>Better design but too many creatures crammed together. Worse, many can cast AE spells. Better separation of mobs would help. Otherwise, pretty good.<P>Sirens Grotto<P>The main problem here is too many highly resistant mobs clustered together. Worse, the sirens can charm you despite high resist gear. Most just succor through to get to WW and if you move the succor point all you'll do is ensure that WW and the points beyond are unused because nobody is willing to risk corpse loss in this zone. Either redo the mobs so that the zone is doable or it will remain unused.<P>Western Wastes<P>Veeshan's Peak lite? Lots of dragons here with a few quests.  Only point to the zone is killing dragons, tho. Maybe some more variety?<P>Dragon Necropolis<P>Truly a testament to good zone design. Looks like someone spent a LOT of time detailing the zone. Major kudos for a job well done on the looks. Only really bad part is the spiders in the entrance are very hard to split and resistant to mes. Perhaps spreading them around some would help.<P>Veeshan's Temple<P>Again, this is either a "slaughter for letwz" or "quest like crazy" zone. 3 guesses as to which option people take... Building faction with the dragons is hard to do. Hence why PoM took so long to find. Perhaps make the PoM entrance easier to get to?<P>Plane of Growth<P>I'm sure everyone who has been to PoF or PoH would like to thank you for making a zone with reduced pathing problems. That was a major drawback to the old planes.<P>Where my problem lies is in the design of the high end mobs...<P>For whatever reason, you have placed a spell called Silence into the game. It prevents casters and casting armors from being used for 15 minutes. Both Ali the Elder and Tunare cast it. Tunare is rumored to be able to hit the entire zone with it. The spell is unresistable.<P>You have repeatedly talked of game balance. The attempts to make all people valuable and, up until now, that has pretty much been the case. But Silence gets rid of 7 classes instantly and drastically reduces 4 more. With this, you have ensured that casters will never be used against these 2 mobs. I cannot begin to tell you how unfair this is to casters. Where is the effect to eliminate all meleeing for 15 minutes?<P>Furthermore, this makes Tunare all but invincible and Ali the Elder the harest doable encounter in the game. Do you want unkillable mobs like this? And why does the spell last 15 minutes?<P>Please take Silence out of the game or reduce its effectiveness. Otherwise you may find half of EQ upset...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My view of the zones I've been in:<P>Iceclad: Great zone for the mid levels, decent loot, some fun quests.  Ocean end is bare, could be a great lower lvl swimming mob area.<P>E. Wastes: Love this zone, exciting to cross, but not impossible, Orc fort is fun, good quests, extemely varied mobs.<P>Crystal Caverns: The perfect dungeon, not too closely spaced mobs, good fight for level, good loot for level, varied mobs, town (though cant raise faction  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> ).  Good pathing, whoever designed this dungeon needs a raise.<P>Great Divide: A wonderful outdoor zone with mobs ranging from mid level to high level, good loot including spells, with some really nice rare drops.<P>Kael Drakkal: I love fighting here, it's intense, but manageable, with some good random loot, but, it's nearly impossible to get into and fight in the area that drops the stuff for the Thurgadin quests.<P>Velk: I love the design here, lots of possibility, but some of the mobs are absolutely infuriating, and the some of the drops dumbfounding.  I was looking through a list of drops, and was thinking of getting a set of crystal chitin armor for my ranger (even with the high weight), and then I saw the BP, 14ac???<P>Thurgadin/Icewell: Fell in love with this town at first, the constant activity, the armor quests, the Dungeon.  Then I found out that the armor quests are nearly impossible, and the dungeon has pretty crapy drops.  To top it off, while the armor quests seem to be mirrored in Kael, for those who choose giant faction, there are a lot of really awesome quests in Kael, that have no match in Thurgadin, leaving those who chose dwarf faction SOL.  I got lucky my first few days in GD, and got to loot Vuuldeen's tail, I jumped for joy when I found out it was for a nice bow quest.  My heart fell when I found out the quest was in Kael, on Giant faction, but undaunted I went in search of a similar quest in Thurg.  I went NPC to NPC in both Thurg A and Icewell, and the only thing I can find that might possibly be a bow quest is the crossbow wielding guy in the room by the bridge at the entrance, but unfortunately the quest doesn't seem to go anywhere.  Where is my dwarven faction bow? Theres lots of examples like that one. Is my only option to get several groups together to raid down to the bow guy and kill him?  I mean the way things are now, trying to raise giant faction isn't feasible for me anymore.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow: Love the design, and variation in level design, the key thing isn't too bad, but please for the love of God, make each consecutive key replace the last, and make them Soul Bound.<P>Overall:  As you can see I've only been to a few of the zones available there.  I like the idea as a whole.  The dangerous portals are infuriating, WL being just plain insane.  The quest inequality between Kael and Thurg is just sad.  The under con mobs are stupid. Otherwise, a great place with some good ideas.  The quests that do work, like the ring quests, are wonderful.  Oh, and whats with mobs poofing?<P>Calador Stormblood<BR>46th Ranger of Tarew Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>SoV, where to begin?<P>Well, I purchased Sov on the day of release.  Couldn't wait to go there!  I think I was there for about a week or two before I figured out that almost all of it is for large guilds only.<P>It's bad enough that the "Uber" guilds have Venril Sathir, Trakanon and all of Veeshan's Peak to themselves and kill VS and Trak within 20 minutes of them spawning each time on my server but do they really need a whole expansion just for them?<P>I mean, if it would get them to leave some of the Kunark big spawns to the regular players then I'd be all for it but no dice.  Only about three guilds ever get a shot at VS or Trakanon on my server, not there are no others who could take him out.  It's just that they have the spawn times down pat and kill them immediately.  I've seen rangers that /con green to me with full Kunark armor because these guild farm them so much they all have twinks of each class with full sets of kunark armor.  It's enough to make you barf.  Sorry, this is not Velious related, back to SoV.<P>I don't expect I'll be back to Velious anytime in the near future.  What's the point?  The green mobs can kill me, repeatedly for no xp.<P>I think perhaps you should have put a warning label on the Velious box: "If your not in a guild that can put together 3+ well balanced groups on a regular basis only 20% of this expansion will be usable to you".  Yeah, I know, it's sarcastic but true none the less.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>TO DANG HARD.<P>I wish I never bought the expansion, for me it was a waste of money.  I didn't realize that most of the content added was designed for raid type encounters.  I almost exclusively adventure in a single group and even that is not always a full group it is often a group of 3-4 people.  I'm finding the entire game un-enjoyable since I hit the upper 40's almost level 50 now.  I am completely limited by my play style.  There just aren't enough places designed for single groups of level 50+ people to go hunt... everything seems like it takes 2-3 groups to do.  I don't have enough time to play the game to put together those types of groups to go do something... especialy when you do manage to get together only to find out the spot you want to go play is camped by some other guild.  It has taken me two years to hit level 49... now I'm wondering why the heck I ever wanted to hit level 50  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Ah well maybe Shadowbane will be better...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Abashi   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I really like all the Velious zones I have visited, and have been to all except Temple of Veeshan, PoG, PoM, and Sleeper's Tomb.<P>&gt;Siren's Grotto -- Well like everyone else says, it's *ahem* quite a challenge.  If hunting Othmirs makes this zone passable, those otters are going down!  The funniest thing about Grotto: takes a few dragon raiding parties or high level wiz to get from CS to WW, but a lowly 15 druid with camo can get from WW to CS without problems, except for taking about 150 in fall damage.  <P>&gt;Dragon Necropolis -- Why are all the ratmen singly throwing themselves into the small pool of fire on the upper e side?  Me no understand.  There must be a roleplaying reason behind it, which I aim to find out.  It would be kool if the traps were not set off when you had lev or dmf on, but usually when you are in this zone your party is big enough to handle the traps.  Usually...<P>&gt;Western Wastes -- One rule.  When fighting Dragons, pull to northeastern corner, because they gate to that corner when low.  Otherwise it may be time to camp and relog.  Pirate ship run aground was a neat idea, and a nice safe spot in a zone of wanderers.<P>&gt;Cobalt Scars -- I'm fascinated by this zone.  When I first ran through it, I said to myself, "That's it??"  But there are many quests given here and involving this zone, which makes it a very interesting place.  Othmir are very likeable, perhaps even mascot material.  The whole zone just grows on you.  If it was melee bindable +bank npc I would practically live in Cobalt Scars.<P>&gt;Wakening Lands -- Makes my comp lag a little, like Warsliks Woods did.  I would like to see some Lumberjacks sent in, but the overall ambiance of the zone probably wouldn't be as rich if it were changed.  Pretty zone.  Wuoshi?  As the name suggests, a Wario/Luigi/Yoshi hybrid, but hits as hard as Bowser.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&gt;Crystal Caverns -- Ornate, intricate, Large.  Intriguing place for a city.  Just plain amazing zone.<P>&gt;Velketor's Labyrinth -- Deathtrap lol.  And I love it.<P>&gt;Kael Drakken -- A plentiful supply of giants to kael - er, I mean keel.<P>Those are the ones that come to mind for now, Velious really turned out to be an excellent expansion.  An explorer's paradise.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, one more thing that sucks about Velious:<P>Faction in Skyshrine<P>(in particular, there should be easier ways to increase your faction, at least from your starting faction point--I'm not saying if you screw your faction totally, you should be able to easily become non-kos)<P>I remember Verant changed the faction hits to have significant negative hits to faction for killing something, as opposed to positive increases for quests or other mobs that give positive faction, but maybe the vast difference in faction hits needs to be looked at.<P>I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but I've killed approximately 3 things with bad dragon/skyshrine faction in skyshrine (due to them aggroing on me when I was trying to get my key to CS).  Needless to say, I believe I was kos in Skyshrine to start with.<P>I've killed 150+ giants/wolves for positive dwarf and dragon faction.  I'm amiable to dwarves, when I believed I was dubious to start.  I'm still kos in skyshrine and am beginning to wonder if I can ever become non-kos there.  Do they hate necros or something?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love Velious, except for one major gripe.<P>The only way to the other side of Velious is through the city zone of Kael Drakkel.  However, as a tailor needing the Velium temper, I've sided with the dwarves.  As a Cleric that hunts with a Warrior and Paladin, we have no way to get to the other side of the city zone to where more mobs of our level reside.  There's no way around this city either.  *Very* frustrating.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So far I have only explored 4 zones. Enough to know that unless experience means little and loot means everthing forget about coming here. I was soloing here with my level 46 SK. Outfitted with mid-level Dreadscale and a Mithril Two-Hander. It took all I had to solo level 35ish giants that hit for 94 and had 2400HP. Sarnak Knights are far easier to kill and around the same level. Spent far more time in groups and killed low blues getting experience at an insanely slow rate.<P>The con system post 30 is really bad and now you basically made it useless. Most of Velious seems to be designed for planes level multi-group hunting. Only the Uber guilds will ever get to see more than half of Velious. In addition to all of this it now seems that warriors, rogues, and clerics will have an even greater lock on raids.<P>Now you just need to make a new continent where the hunting is more in line with Kunark/Antonica and those who are not in one of the Uber guilds can hunt and get decent items.<P>Velious Rating: 10 thumbs down</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From the few zones I'll tried, I've been disappointed with the exp.  Magic resistances are a big part of this.  I usually group with a 50 wiz and me being a 52 cleric, which makes the areas we can adventure in - well, we haven't found one yet.  I've lost count on the number of times green mobs have killed us, even when spells would stick (root), they don't hold like they did.  I can chunk it up to bad luck, but after a couple months of trying SOV,,,,we have given up.<P>FYI: the zones we have been in - iceclad,eastern waste, great divide, icewell keep, crystal carverns, Thurgadin. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052707-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052707&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052707&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
