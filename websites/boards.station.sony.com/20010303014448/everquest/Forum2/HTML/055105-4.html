</FONT><HR>It's really funny to me to see people come to this thread and openly admit that they suck at playing a Bard and expect changes based on that.<P>Examples:<BR>----------------<BR>|Plundar Posted|<BR>7)Make instrument switching more doable. I don't use hot keys for my songs, so I really don't see how I can switch instruments. How about a hot key for switching instruments?<BR>----------------<BR>Plundar openly admits not using the interface correctly, yet wants some kind of compensation for it?  Sorry, but that need is based on lack of skill, not on lack of balance for the class.  I have absolutely no problems with this since they added the drop filter.<P>-----------------<BR>|Sapper06 Posted|<BR>-----------------<BR>I die a LOT doing my job. If you can logically, from a RP, game mechanics, or gameplay perspective, explain why a wizard can bind and I cant, then by al means, go ahead and explain away. Otherwise, you raise you issues, I'll raise mine, and Absor will decide what to bring to the tuning meetings. Thanks for trying to tell me what the balance issues are for MY character you egotistical jugheads.<BR>-----------------<BR>I play a Bard and I don't die a lot. You aren't very skilled if you die so much.  Not to mention the run song gets us back to our corpse much faster than any other class.  Buy some drums, put them in the bank, and bind next to the bank.  Only pure casting classes can bind. Those are the rules of the game, from a RULES OF THE GAME perspective.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>You're basically saying that just because you want to be able to have an ability that has been SPECIFICALLY LIMITED to one type of class, that you should get it because you lack skill at playing your class so much so that not being able to bind yourself is a real problem for you.  We're egotistical jugheads because we are better players than you?  I guess that is the perspective from somebody on the bottom who has a chip on their shoulder about being a poor player.<P>Just two of a few examples. Personally, I haven't seen much new stuff on any of these threads lately. I think all that needs to be said has been said. I am eager to see what Absor has to share with us next week.  For the record, I am also opposed to the 20th level mana song.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor - since you posted a reply after my piece, if you took some offense to my wording, I should apologize since that was not my intentions.<P>Reading further, the idea of having a "Block" is interesting.  Perhaps instead of hitting for one or both weapons, assuming dual wielding, we bards cross our weapons over each other and block the blow.  So while we are not taking damage, we are not offering damage either.  From a role playing perspective (*listens to the laughing), a bard would be almost casual about the affair, possibly smirking mischievously at our opponent ("Nah nah, you missed me!!!")<P>For the binding issue, with each city having a tavern (I believe), a bard only drink is available for a higher price.  With alcohol consumption being the norm, drinking this drink within that zone grants a bind - a link to our off-time activities if you may.  For example, with Freeport having "Tassel's Tavern", I would buy the drink there, stumble outside, consume it, and be bound to that tavern.  Thus if I ran to East Commons and then drunk it, I would then still be bound at that tavern since it was the original purchasing place.  So it is not the drink itself that binds, but the purchase.<P>Others have mentioned other desires, issues, and thoughts so instead of repeating, I'll let them talk for me.<P>My opinions, of course.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Axlrose - Bristlebane Bastard Bard...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards suck ever since the game started. I seriously don't know why I kept playing my bard to 60. Actually bards are pretty well balanced at level 1 with all other classes cause basically at level 1 every class sucks. Bards can't solo, they can't melee, and can't cast. Bards are only wanted because of mana song and if someone needs you to run them from point A to point B. What is a bard really? I'm still wondering what VI thinks a bard is. We're suppose to be melee but not all that great and we're suppose to be castors but we're only really there to play manasong.<P>Our songs are nothing but a slap in the face. For instance Lullaby never worked, it gets resisted 90% of the time, Selo's constant chain used to be good because it actually rooted a mob now it still runs around snared, the haste songs don't do much cause a shaman or enchanter gives better haste, slow songs suck cause it doesn't slow anything it just basically gets in the way when a enchanter or shaman tries to slow it. Then there is that wonderful charisma song that I don't ever hear of any bard uses. Those Velious songs please just take them away. They're useless. I tried using both songs on a frog wizard in Guk to test them out and it seemed to not even take any mana from the mob. <P>Bards from Beta rocked. They had double attack why was that taken away? Once a bard pasts level 50 most songs are just there to take up space in the book. It's bad enough we have to sit there for a minute just to mem a song. 80% of the songs are useless from 1-50. Only songs that are worth anything are the resist songs for big raids and of course the traveling songs. Bards at high level need to depend on there melee to actually do any sort of damage. They can't really crowd control much because song of twilight is single target that lasts for a whopping 18 seconds if your lucky and Lullaby doesn't work. Our charm sucks cause you can't charm anything past 51. Bards just straight out suck except for playing resist, travel and manasong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Forgot about the disciplines you guys added. Whoever thought of those please take them away. Out of all 4 disciplines only 1 is good the level 55 discipline. A bard atlevel 60 would either have all of the best instruments or there epic why would we need a discipline that last 15 seconds to sing perfect when we can just switch to a instrument? <P>Class specific armor. The Kunark armor effects blows chunks except for the Breast Plate, bracer and maybe the gloves. 100 hp heal isn't bad. But come on pulling food out of your croch, water out of your feet, invigorate from the arms (uhhh I thought that's why bards would play Cantana so stamina doesn't go down), and a stupid eye from a helm is pretty bad. Then the effect on the BP from plane of growth is hillarious. Selo's song of travel? That has got to be the worst effect possible even worst than pulling food out of my croch. Why would a bard use that effect when that song is most likely already memorized? And that effect when used lasts a big fat 10 seconds and you lose the effect if you hit, get hit, or sing something else. That effect is useless. <P>You guys upped the defense. Well that's good except that bards hardly ever get beat on because they can't do enough damage to save there lives. The only time I ever get hit is when everyone else dies. Really bards are not even close to being equal to any class. They're just in the game to be there that's about it.<P>Mercedez (Virtuoso) Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Steevin:  Who the hell are you?  Have you ever grouped with me?  Apparently not.  Are you so mentally weak and emotionally immature that you have to attack others to make your point?  Well, I can make some negative inferences about your background and playing style from your ignorant comments about mine, but I wont.  I will, however, defend myself, and refute your remarks.<BR>  I do not suck at playing my character.  I die a lot becuase I am usually taking the rear of the formation to insure that everyone is in radius of my run song.  I die a lot becuase I am usually taunting the MOB off the caster who was medding in the middle if the fight.  I die a lot because I dont run away first in a fight, I dont train the mob to another group to kill, and I dont leave my group to die while I run to saftey all alone.  I die because in a fight, I am doing what I can for the group, and thus pissing the mob off.<P>If I have a good group, I dont die a lot.  A few weak links in a group usually means I die.  You know as well as I, that when the group loses control, for whatever reason, the Mobs go for the Bard first. <BR>Binding may not be a balance issue at the post 50, or even post 40 ranges, when Evacs and group ports are the normal way of dealing with bad situations.  But at lower levels, Bards are prety much out there flapping.  Yeah, we get around a little quicker with Selo's.  But most other classes dont make thier living being number one on the aggro list of the bad guys either.  But the bottom line is, if a Bard is DOING his JOB, he (or she) will be one of the first to die if things get out of control.  Unless you are a simply bellowing and meleeing, you are gonna be twisting stuff that puts you waaay up on the aggro list of the targets.<BR>Bottom line is I dont suck, I made some silly mistakes way earlier in my bard career, but learned.  Yes, I do have a spare drum in the bank to support CR, and have since my low teen days.   I dont die NEARLY as much a I used to, but I still die first in my group usually. I can usually take solace in the fact that I bought time for the rest of the party to run to safety.<P>Kaevin, I think I answered your question here too.  Binding might not be a balance issue at the Endgame.  But pre 40, it would certainly help the Bard to get cycled back into the fight quicker, and does balance him with the other classes. <BR>Basically, we have a little of every class in us, some more then others.  But the only thing we inherit from our casting roots is our low HP and ability to use a form of magic.  Other then saying that "its not a blance issue" you havent explained WHY its not a balance issue. <BR> I could just as easily say your wanting songs to stack is a wish list issue.  But I would be an idiot if I did that, cause I dont determine what is wish list or balance, and what will go in front of the tuning team, Absor does.<BR>Im sorry for my angry comments here, but I really take issue with Steevin infering that I cant play my character well.  I challenge him to log onto the Quellious server and find ONE person who would say that I suck.  I get more positive comments on the way I play my Bard then I do any other of my characters, and and I have never had anyone complain about me doing my job. (except for a minor ghoul to the Derv camp training incident months ago in WC.  To those I killed, Sorry, It hasnt happend again.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>&gt;=Balance=&lt;<P>Q:  Why arent there as many Bards in the game as any other class?<P>A:  Effectiveness is limited. Bards cant do as much melee damage as any other melee/hybrid class. Bard songs dont do as much damage as any of the caster/hybrid classes. <P>Q:  Are Bards Usefull in a group setting?<P>A:  Because any other class can do what a Bard does and do it ten times as well, Bards are not the first choice for any given group. From the descriptions about the class 'vision' TM, I would have expected Bards to be all about grouping. In reality, Bards are mor focused towards kiting, and soloing. My Bard can solo more effectivly than my warrior, rogue, monk, enchanter, druid or shaman of the same or higher level. <P>Q:  What would help make Bards more balanced with other classes?<P>A:  1) Increase the effectivness of songs. <BR>    2) Limit some of the songs to group only, forcing Bards to become more group oriented. <BR>    3) Add more songs that are focused on supporting groups as opposed to soloing. Increase the effectivness depending upon how many people are in the group. <BR>    4) Focus Bards more on debuffing mobs. Enchanters are probably the key class in this area, but they are lacking in several areas such as reducing AC by a good amount or decreasing spell casting times.<P>These are my suggestions from my point of view. Bards are not easy to play, you constantly have to switch through songs, and never really get any time to just sit down and rest. At the same time, they are very powerful, albiet slow, soloers. Personally, I dont think that the vision was to have a soloable class in the Bard but rather a party dependant or supportive class. To this regard, I would recomend nerfing the bard class by romoving some of its soloability.<P>As for some bugs, I know this is about class balancing but...<P>1) Fizzles (Missed Notes) - As a bard I have seen a recent increase in the number of miss notes I play. Even for songs far below my level the fizzle rate is 15% - 25% of the time. I dont think this is correct, but perhaps someone could take a look at it?<P>2) Songs taking effect. I will avoid the songs that effect mobs and will focus on the ones that effect the group or soloing bard. Acel often takes effect just after the bard or party slows down, at these times the bard speeds up and then gets a second message that they slow down. There are a few other songs that do this, I would appreciate it if someone could take a look at it.<P>3) This may not be a bug but... When fighting my bard can be forced to stop singing by a Mob even without getting stunned. Essentially, you begin to play a song and the mob attacks you, (not bash) and you take X amount of damage and your song blinks out. You then must restart it. I have seen this happen a lot of the time. I would like to know if this is by design or by accident.<P>Thank You<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Concerning<P>I thought I was the Queen of Agro (Shaman) but I see I'm wrong.  It seems odd that bards should be targeted if they aren't playing a song, or have just logged in.<P>One thing I found in Kunark, is certain zone spots are bugged.  The hillside behind the FG camp is a good example.  If you are on the hill Frogloks, etc will aggro on you from about 10,000 feet, but if sitting on the flat, this does not happen.  Of course this is virtual space, so some kind of distance warpage does to occur, and is related to Class, esp healers, Bard, Shaman, Druid and Cleric to a lesser degree (maybe?!) <P>Sebille, 49 Shaman Ayonae </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just to qualify my previous statements.<P>Bards from 1 - 32 can solo very well. As well as any other class and in some cases better. I have no experience post 32.<P>Dungeons: I never play my bard in dungeons. I do not believe that they are very effective in dungeons which obviously decreses their balance compared to other classes. Unless of course its the vision TM that bards are more out door oriented.<P>Pulling: Bards are good at pulling, but because they are more focused on restoring mana and HP, they rarly are asked to pull.<P>Bards are not balanced which I believe is why very few people play them. At the same time, Bards are complex pre 32. Post 32 they are mana hoses.<P>I strongly recomend giving Bards more usability. 3 songs max, song effectivness is usually 10-20 levels below the bards current level.<P>Restrictions on Bards: <P>1) Must use instruments in some cases in order to have an effect. Other wise, instruments are recomended in order to get the best effect from various songs. <P>2) Song effects have a very short duration limiting most song effects to 3 pulses or 15 seconds. <P>3) DDs are very weak until upper levels. The highest DD available is comparable to a Mages 24th level spell, but takes more mana. <P>4) Songs can be interupted just the same as any other spell. <P>5) The effects from the songs are extremly weak compared to other classes.<P>OK I hope that clears it up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sapper06,<P>Allowing songs (hastes/slows) to stack correctly with chanters and shammys is indeed a balance issue.<P>Bards have been told over and over again that we were designed as a grouping class from the ground up.  Our strengths come from allowing the groups we are in to perform better or above their normal level.<P>If this is true, then some of our most powerful songs (or what could be our most powerful songs) are rendered useless in the situations (namely grouping) where they should be most valuable.  Add an enchanter or a shammy to any group a bard is in and you remove portion of what a bard should be able to do.  <P>I do not think we are useless in groups that contain a chanter and a shaman, and i would hope that the chanters and shammy's that i group with (quite regularly i might add)dont think im extra baggage as well.<P>Still, because of this stacking issue we are indeed weakend quite a lot when we join and enchanter or shammy group.  This is a balance issue.  One class, or 2 in this case, should not be able to make another classes abilities obsolete, especially when that class is supposed to excell at making groups better.<P>Therefore shaman and chanter abilities un-balance the bard class in situations where they are grouped together.<P>As for saying that giving Bards bind would help balance them....what does it balance us against?  How does it add anything to the core design idea of a Bard (ie improving groups).  It doesnt.  It would be a nice feature, sure..but a balance issue....i just dont agree.  Im pretty sure I've seen Absor say as much, and if there were not hundres of posts on this i could probably dig it out.<P>I guess I was wrong for telling people to stop asking for something they want, i would just hate to see a good idea get lost because a ton of people are asking for something that just is not gonna happen without some form of miracle.<P>Kaid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After reviewing the entirety of the posts again... hey, it only took a few hours! I've noticed that the bards are falling out into roughly two groups (setting aside the exceptional individuals who have some of the more bizarre points of view):<P>1) the "more-melee" group, and the<BR>2) better songs group<P>I respectfully submit that BOTH groups should be satisfied, since bards are a class that can be played in different fashions, with little noticeable benefit of one path over the other, and that should continue.<P>Where they agree:<P>Both sides seem to agree on a reduction of conflicts between songs and spells. Overwrite issues, and stacking issues need to be looked at carefully. Buffing and debuffing effects should also be carefully reconsidered, since they are currently both incompatible with spells, and lower in effect. Considering the fact that a long-lasting spell is preferable to 99% of the players than a constantly maintained song, all non-damage combat-related songs should either stack seamlessly or be significantly better than the like spells.<P>Both sides also seem to agree that utility songs, which do NOTHING to affect experience potential need to have durations and ranges adjusted. Levitate, and invisibility especially need major adjustments (isn't it enough that one person deciding to cast a spell, loot, or anything else will get an entire invisible party killed, do we have to deal with a 10 foot effect radius, too?)<BR>And would it be "unbalancing" for levitate to last about as long as water breathing?<P>These two points are almost universally recognized by bards as needing work, mostly to enhance a bard's usefulness to groups. Less bard-caused snafus during combat, and fewer bard-lag created deaths in travel.<P>Where they differ:<P>Melee effectiveness... some bards want more melee at all levels. However the most convincing argument is for melee abilities at the stratospheric levels, due to the facts that: parties are itemed and spelled to their buff caps already, so without melee damage or worthwhile song damage, bards are reduced to manasong. Further, many of the target creatures are virtually immune to magic, making even spells ineffective, and rendering a bard practically useless.<P>Now, I would personally rather have better damage songs, and maybe even some new "creative" songs that would affect combat, but the melee-bards have just as much right to play their way. <P>So... I would suggest, rather than simply increase melee abilities across the board for bards, add a serious version of the Whistling Warsong to the upper-level bard. Make it work while playing only, as a self-only song which allows no twisting with only minimal visual effects. It should enhance combat skills to a rewarding level for the 50+ bard, while making it impossible to actually use other songs while playing it. In effect, hit that song, and you're a weak to moderate melee class for a few moments.<P>This simple addition would allow the post-50 melee bards to be useful, without creating an unbalancing effect. Whereas simply increasing melee abilities might introduce complications with song effects.<P>As for the Song-based bards: scale up song effectiveness and damage to rise at a rate comparable to other classes. If a bard's damage potential at level 10, while grouped with another class is 45% (for example) of the group damage, then that same bard at level 55 grouped with that same class should STILL BE 45%. No class should lose effectiveness as they rise, but ours apparently does.<P>---------------------<P>I've tried to summarize and encapsulate the major issues without going into too many specifics. Mostly, because our problems are larger than a song or two, here or there. They are across the board and need to be approached as such. <P>Very few of us want to be the ultimate solo class, and none of the balancing changes should affect our current solo abilities (showy, effective, yet ultimately way too risky and/or slow to be a serious advancement technique). However, our group abilities should be exceptional, not overshadowed by every caster class and hybrid in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am not sure many of you play _with_ bards in your groups, so do not realize what you can and can't do in comparison to other classes.<P>High level game may still be a problem; however, I have found that a bard, played _well_ (not very many of these out there, most bards are morons), is the most powerful group class in the game.<P>At level 30 in Cazic Throne Room, a group with a bard, cleric, shadowknight, warrior, and a wizard, took the whole area within the spawn time of the area (upper TR too), and the cleric didn't heal. Period. Didn't heal at all. Ask an enchanter to do that.<P>I pick a bard over an enchanter almost any day. why? because if you ake your random Enchanter_001 from any zone in the game and they are 90% likely to exhibit these characteristics/thoughts:<P>1. I am a moron.<P>2. I can crowd control.<P>3. I am a group god.<P>4. It is your job to get this mob off me, because I am the crowd control god.<P>5. It is your fault that we died, because you didn't venerate your god correctly.<P>However a bard can do the same things, with the same or greater effect (when added together) and doesn't complain.  Not all bards mind you, on average I would say that for every good bard there exists 10 good enchanters...why? Because the bard class is the most difficult class in the game to play; Its almost a fact that if you don't have an I.Q. of 130, the dexterity of a master guitar player, and a near perfect internet connection you aren't playing the class to its best possible level.  Enchanter is tough, but not that tough.<P>To make the bard class more balanced, they need to decrease the difficulty level of the class to a level that more people can attain...and make their AE mez work again :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How's the measurement of a bard's melee skills? What will be the result if a high end equipped bard melee only with a enchanter's pet of same level (the enchanter not the pet)? This can show that bards aren't meleers at all in mid to high levels.<P>What's the purpose of the 15th level song? Please restore it to what it was or make it have a mem blur effect instead of mezz... At least it will become useful. I really preffer making them less resistible since it affects one mob only for a minimum period of time unlike enchanter's which lasts much longer and add another song with mem blur effect to save casters' necks.<P>Restore snare song to the effect it had and make bard haste songs add to others haste spells.<P>Charm songs also need to be revised they must be less resisted, since the bard cannot sing any other song while charming and remove the mana consumption.<P>Terrible side effects with high level songs make them unusable.. Selo's Song of the March has invisibility component if one mob sees the player all other effects (sow and levitate) also wears off. Songs with damage absorption components also falls into that case and wear all effects off when the insignificant damage absorption effect wears off in a single blow (really what was the purpose of that? 20 hp at most comparable to 200+hp lost per mob's blow???)<P>The high level songs really need to balance the fact that high level melee type have almost every significant stat for his class, AC maxed out and resistances raised to a level that many bards songs really don't contribute at all.  <P>Why bards cannot use bows??? Was VI unable to code that if a bard is using a bow he couldn't use an instrument? BTW is the additional effects on the songs using an instrument really balanced with the fact that the bard isn't going to use weapons? <P>I hate the mana battery role.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mersedez,<P>umm, sorry bud, but I'd have to say you don't know your class very well.<P>Lullaby USED to work very well even at high levels (back when it really did work, 'high level' was 40-50), it wasn't until a year after release there was a stealth nerf put in on it that made it check twice for resist's, which made the song useless.<P>Chain works very well, it's still the best snare in the game except for one SMALL problem, and that's that it has a chance to resist each tick.  It still snare's movement higher than other snare spells, and it still slows melee movement and doesn't seem to inhibit shaman slows.<P>Bards are VERY well balanced throughout the 1-50 game.  They can melee and deal an ok amount of damage, and even to a degree solo up 'til about 15, depending on the items they have available to them and their playing strategy.  From 15-30 is more or less our testing ground.  If you think it's unfair that our class is so difficult to play from 15-30, try investigating other classes.<P>Enchanters can barely do anything 'til around 20.<P>Monks can't take damage and are always getting aggroed because of the damage they can deal, so until they get feigndeath, they don't pull, and their groups move slowly because the healer is always running low on mana.<P>Wizards can't take damage well at all, and are nearly forced to solo throughout most of their levels these days unless they have already made friends, because for some odd reason their seen as useless.<P>You name a class (excepting 3 i can think of, warrior, druid, and necro), and I can point out a point in their character lifetime when they have a very hard time.<P>So anyways, back to bards.  15-30 is very difficult for bards.  This is roughly the range at which people who never will be good enough quit the game.  People who will be good enough fight their way through it, and tweakers get PLed through it or have good enough equipment that they can push through it and consequently never learn diddly squat about playing a bard.<P>from 30-40 you have a fair array of songs available to you, including snares, mesmerize (pixie strike rules now that it's been fixed), charm (godlike for crowd control), mana song (boo!), and 2 chants that when used with a drum, can deal pretty large amount of damage, not to mention dropping magic and fire resist's for the casters in your group.<P>From 40-50 you gain tons of new abilities, including being able to do a mana free dispell, another chant (at 47 with only 3 chants and a nostrolo tambourine, i deal in excess of 1200 damage a minute, with my naggy drum I'm doing in excess of 1400 damage a minute ... when I twist those 3 songs with denon's with my mcvaxius horn, i'm exceeding 1600 a minute), a really awesome regen song at 47 that stacks with level 7 regen, a song that is a mana free rune at 49, a nice dot + slow at 48, and I don't remember what at 50.<P>Up UNTIL 50, bards kick ass.  Post 50, I totally agree with you that we're very unbalanced.  But any bard who has problems until 50 with groups, and even a short time after 50 either doesn't know their class, or isn't educating those they play with about their class.  Because of my educating those around me, they let me do what I feel is best, because they trust my judgement.  If I find my songs are resisting too much, I switch to more supportive songs (haste, str, ac, mana, health, whatever).<P>Anyways, I figured your statements about the bard class sucking their entire life deserved a response, since a level 60 bard should have learned for themselves just how good a bard can be ... if their puppeteer knows what their doing.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I remember derailing many an orc train in Oasis or taming groups of Sarnaks in Lake of Ill Omen with ease with Lullaby.<P>My favorite story is when I was in Cazic Thule as a young bard, I was grouped with someone who's main character was a bard. Anyway, I commented that I would lullaby for Crowd Control if needed and the other player started telling me what an idiot I was since Lullaby was broken. Whelp ... the first overpull, I stopped 4 lizzies in their tracks and we easily  killed them one at a time.

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;But the bottom line is, if a Bard is DOING his JOB, he (or she) will be one of the first to die if things get out of control.&gt;&gt;<P>This is very true. Often, If my group is in trouble, I'll fire up one of my super aggro-AoE songs, or, these days, start charming and mezzing left and right, and tell everyone to get the hell out of there. Assuming they obey me, I'm left with a bunch of mobs ticked off at me, the HP of a pure caster/priest type, and probably not enough AC to offset that.

Each of these levels would count double for increase bard effects. (i.e. a level 42 bard's effects would be upped to a current lvl 45th bard's effectiveness.)<P><BR>Problem 2)  <BR>Useless with Enchanters<P>Make the Ervaj series singing.  As coded they are pretty useless... as a 5% haste sung so a bard can melee, they might see use if a bard is in a group where many of his other abilities as present via other casters.<P><BR>3) <BR>Bards Roll on Raids<P>Increase the effectiveness of the mana drain songs, and maybe split the effect of the AE mana drain among party members.<P>This supplements our 'anti-caster' roll (via resistances), and our 'mana battery' roll.  <P>A necro might drain hp...lich it too mana...and twitch a caster.  We might be the mana-&gt;mana analog, with the same efficiency.<P><BR>Problem 4)<BR>Low levels mana song overlooked<P>Add a low-level mana song (ala test) to fix the oversight from when breeze was added.  Not really a 'problem', but nice anyway.<P><BR>Problem 5)  <BR>Too much twisting<P>Make the 34th level catana equal in effect to the 32 mana song, the jig, and the healing song... with a duration of 1 tick (i.e. untwistable), still require a lute. It should still stack with anothe bard playing mana song.<P>This will eliminate some downtime twisting; rather than require it. While its a "NERF", because it lowers our effectiveness, i think its a nerf most bards will appreciate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hrmm.... actually, I think that bards are VERY well balanced if you play them right.  Sure, our songs aren't as effective as a caster's spell, but they were never meant to be.  When's the last time you saw a chanter running around at a hundred mph in plate mail? =)  Stronger songs would give us too high an advantage, though it would be nice to have at least some stacking with haste songs.  If a song would only stack another 10% of it's normal effectiveness that would be good enough and give us a bigger role in the group even when there are a lot of buffers.<P>I think that melee damage should be upped a bit.  At level 15 I was lucky enough to get icetooth's claws, but still had trouble killing a level 14 monster.  It's even worse now.  At 28, I couldn't ever dream of killing a blue con.  With only 610 or so base HP, kiting becomes the only option.  With Bellow only doing 13-14 damage per hit, and Chain being resisted a lot or wearing off after only 2 or 3 seconds, kiting becomes a MAJOR chore.  The AoE fear song it too risky to use while kiting, unless you're absolutely certain that there are no other monsters around.<P>The level 20 mana song that's now on test is a joke.  First off it doesn't help the bard at all, and second it only helps casters.  A better haste song would be a helluva lot better at 20... unless, of course, the songs were made to scale better.<P>Since I play on Rallos Zek, I have views on the PvP relations of the bard... plainly put, the only thing we can really do is run.  If I'm attacked by a warrior, the only thing I can do it kite... and trying to drain all that HP is like trying to drink an ocean through a straw.  Casters have their way with me, now that Selo no longer breaks snare/root.  The only thing that can save me is our shadowstep song, but if I don't have it memmed at the time, the only thing I can do if pray that I bag in time.  Unless you want bards on PvP servers to always have a spell slot that's wasted on a song that normally never gets any use, Selo will have to be made to break snare/root again.  People will complain that this will make Bards invincible to attack, but that's far from the truth... Bards are very fragile in PvP, seeing as most spells interupt our songs.  I don't even bother trying to defend myself against people that con blue to me, I just run like hell.  It's that bad.<P>What I would LOVE, though, is the blasted drum and flute animations.  I don't care if you leave us alone and don't change anything at all, as long as those finally get included )<P>Spiritraven Wyndwood</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm always puzzled when people talk about not being able to solo as a bard beyond 15, or how hard kiting is at 30 with Bellow's, etc.<P>Charmkite. Just charmkite. I made a good deal of my way through 35 charmkiting in OT before finding a great group spot. It's actually fairly rare for me to make better xp in a group than I do charmkiting, & I certainly make better plat (since it's all mine!). Now, as I'm approaching the level cap for the 27 charm, this may change soon; but I still would imagine that it'll remain a viable alternative with the 39 charm when I can't find a group (just won't be as steady on xp, since I'll have to stop when the mana runs out).<P>Heck, I often trikite -- get 1 pet, have it fight something else, & run around those 2 in a circle with the next victim chasing behind me until it's its turn to die or be charmed.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> And my risk of death is pretty close to zero, since I'm outdoors & on Selo's -- I have to zone sometimes, but I can't recall the last time I died soloing.

</FONT><HR>When I sing the invis song as my bard, if one of my teamates fights an NPC - any NPC aggroed on him can see ME while invisible even if I have not changed,moved or blinked. These NPC's that can now see me promptly decide to kick my booty and I have a horn to fight with. Is there a coding issue involved? I figure it isnt the desired effect. Just because the dudes get mad at me for pulsing invis song on my team doesnt mean that they should be able to use "the force" to direct their anger at the source.<P>I suppose the answer will end up being "its a coding issue" because invisible seems to be just a temporary faction adjustment, and any dude mad at you wont be indifferent.<P>Hrm, well... I want to emphasize the fact that I totally understand WHY mobs aggro on a bard that is singing the invis song. I am suggesting a change. I think invisible should be invisible. If I am invisible, and the mob does NOT have see invis. They are out of luck. It should not erase aggro, but it should protect you from them autofollowing you or finding you in the first place. I am not really addressing times when I get in battle and then invis and try to run, that has abuse issues. I am speaking of the bard song because I am invisible singing this song..and my group member is to fast and gets out of range of song. He then gets jumped... gropu catches up and pulse goes on the aggrod player... and I get jumped. I know WHY I get jumped, but it makes no sense that they can just autofind where you are. They should say... "I HATE that Landracer.. where is that fool!" When I become visible sure.... they should wallup me. Ill get a spanking then. This is a very fair suggestion to be addressed, I can only see coding issues get in the way of fixing this.<P>Solution: Make the invis bard song effect NOT register as a buff. The pure invis song doesnt help in battle for those engaged, and it would fix the bug im talking about. No aggro and no attacking of the invisible bard.<P>Landracer Bard 29 - Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Desbarolis said:<P>"But any bard who has problems until 50 with groups, and even a short time after 50 either doesn't know their class, or isn't educating those they play with about their class."<P>I am going to have to disagree with you here... no offense intended.<P>Some groups work well with a bard, others most definitely do not. It seems to have very little to do with "educating" them, and very much to do with which classes are with you at the time. <P>Say you like to use a haste song... and it is useless due to another haste song which is more powerful, as they all are. Perhaps you have been charming "adds" and having them fight for your side, only to have them immediately mesmerized by the local enchanter, freezing your charmed creature to attack you at a later time, and making your charm song less than useless. Perhaps you play Fulfils to reduce magic resistance, and it is meaningless due to Tashan spells. Maybe you like to play Binding or Chains to slow attacks, but find that they're overwriting snares, or interfering with slow spells.<P>Maybe, just maybe, you don't want to spend your entire career puzzling out which of your songs is safe to use whenever a new person joins your hunting group... <P>It might even be a possibility that you don't want to deal with "educating" the newest caster in the group as to what will conflict, because honestly, most of the ones I've met do not care what the bard does, as long as they do not mess up their plans for the combat.<P>And just possibly... some of us don't think it's appropriate that the "magic school" of singing is both the weakest comparing song for spell, and the one that causes the most conflicts between different classes.<P>Yeah... right now, we're the best class to have in a group... unless there is an enchanter... or a shaman... or a druid... etc.<P>Give me two monks and a paladin, though, and we'll all get along just fine.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I dont see any in character reasons why the music would soak into the walls and not create the speed aura. I understand Spirit of Wolf, I have a Druid... you can only summon the spirit of wolf in the wild. Bards get ganged up on easily, and mobility is one of the largest bonuses they have. I feel bards are very balanced and useful. If people dont like being 'one hit wonders'... group with some warriors, or go kite some guards or something. Myself I am interested in contributing as much as I can to make things as efficient as possible.

</FONT><HR>One idea that could help deal with the lack of mid level instruments in the game is to create a trade skill to make instruments. Maybe bard only too. This would be a excellent way to aquire more instruments while adding to the game. <P>Another idea that may work to off set the needed increase in bard attack and defense: a skill such as "dance of blades" - while in effect it raises your ac, atttack, agi for example. It could work very much like sneak in that at low levels it is hard to start and keep going, but at higher levels it is more effective and lasts longer. This could be expanded to have 3 different dances. One for each type of weapon - a dance of knives for peircing and a dance of clubs(or something else) for blunt weapons. The kicker of these would be that they each give different benefits while being used (such as varying levels of attack and ac, maybe dex or str or sta), though could only be used if fighting with the appropriate type of weapon in the main hand. Thus duel wielding with 2 types of weapons would complicat it.<P>Along with the other posts I agree that bards need to be more effective along every line. They are definately low on HP, and could use more Ac. I know that often even with a warrior I still end up taking a good bit of damage at 27 because twisting 3 songs adds soo much to the mobs aggro.<BR> <BR>As well, the aggro of songs needs to be turned down. Putting a very small buff on the party should not pull the creature off the tank who is outdamaging me by double.<P>The resists on songs definately needs to be lowered. the snare song is resisted much more than 50% of the time. And other songs are consistently resisted by blue mobs, even ones such as denons discord, or the 21 slow song. his may be do to a non-super twinked chr - only 101, but we bards shouldnt have to depend on our chr to play a song.<P>One thing that I've seen pointed out alot is that if you can play a bard well enough they arn't as bad. But that only means the best players can make do. Im sure there are a number of people out there who dont or cant play a bard to the max potential due to hardware, connection or lack of skill. thess three things should not be what makes or break a class. Now i like the idea of how challenging and difficult bards are to play, but if they are so high ont he diffulculty scale to play, shoudlnt the payback reflect this? <P>All in all, it seems that my effectivness in a group is slipping more and more with every level. i cant approach the damage in combat that either the tanks or casters can do. And healers and buffers look upon me more and more as someone to save them a bit of mana to blast with, but doesnt really contribute. <P>thanks for listening and please consider what I said. <BR>PS i really would like you to look into the idea of an instrument making skill<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR> I would like to direct all those people asking for better songs and effects to the following information i am about to post.<P> 1) Bards "are" effective in the 50+ range when fighting "Normal" monsters. Your songs can still have a fair chance of sticking on monsters due to the levels you can reach.<P> 2) When you reached the cap for levels (60), and the monster is level 63+ (Boss monsters up to level 65 i think). You will not get anything to stick. You have lost your "offensive song power" against these monsters.<P> 2a) To test this yourself, get in a group and find someone higher level to verify for you that the monster your group is about to attack is 5 levels above your own. Then go kill it with your group, use your songs, and see how much you are resisted. (only do this with monsters if you are level 50+, so a 55th level monster like Venril Sathir comes to mind). You will see that you do not contribute much damage in this battle. It goes down hill even faster when the monsters are 60+.<P> 3) When asking for haste stacking, you need to know that the Cap on haste is somewhere close to 75% haste. The enchanter epic gives 66% haste. And any level 60 characters seriously planning to fight a boss monster in velious will be wearing a 20%+ haste item. So stacking haste will do nothing in this area unless the haste cap is removed, or haste stacking is not limited by the "item+spell/song effect" cap.<P> --------------------<P> Knowing the above, you will soon realize that the best way to balance our class(IMO),. for  "epic encounters" at high levels, is to allow bards to melee better.<P> a) It will give us a chance at a place in the High level "epic encounters". As it stands now, raid leaders don't think "Manasong" is enough to warrent taking a bard. Since the casting after buff up is marginal, and a Enchanter with an epic will buff.. haste.. and clarity enough for the entire raid. "Fill the bard's spot with another Damage melee" is what you hear as you get turned down.<P> b) In situations where melee or songs can "both" be used, melee will become a "real" option. ALL of our songs that give a "big" bonus to us, use an instrument. Of the singing haste songs we have, even with them, we cant melee better than using a good all instrument song twist. (If you have high end weapons, then match the songs with high end instruments and you are still out-damaged with a "good" song twist.)<P> c) When you add in resists rates on songs and the miss notes, you will see that adding melee ability is very needed for the bard class Post 50 to gain a foothold it the higher levels, and allow more ways to play the class. (That is a good thing when balanced and tuned correctly.)<P> Thanks for your time and a chance to address "balance" in a game and class that i love.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>This post is going to be about my impressions of the haste stacking issue as it relates to bards in general.<P>First of all, I have had a BLAST leveling my bard up to her current level of 53.  I also have a 55 wizard that hasn't dinged in months becuase I'm just having too much fun with the bard.<P>Now, about haste stacking.  I believe that I have a fairly good grasp of the abilities of bards.. where they are useful, what they can enhance, etc.  I have NOT, however, spent time running numerical analysis of the enhancements provided by bards.  I am in this game to have FUN, not be picky about the details which I had just assumed were true via simple logic.<P>A quick example of such an assumption.  A cleric casts Resist Magic on me, an icon shows up on my buff list and my MR increases by a fixed amount.  I vocalize Guardian Rhythms, another icon shows up on my buff list in addition to the cleric buff and my MR increases again by a fixed amount.  The assumption that I had been making all along about haste was following the same train of thought.  An enchanter casts Swift like the Wind on me, an icon shows up on my buff list and it seems that I start hitting faster.  I then vocalize McVaxius Berzerker Crescendo (using this as an example instead of Verses of Victory so the other stat bonuses VoV affords aren't considered), another icon appears on my buff list in addition to the enchanter buff, and it kind of feels like I start hitting faster.  It's logical.. 1 + 1 = 2.<P>I recently acquired Melody of Ervaj (level 50 Velious song) and visited www.eqsongs.com just to figure out what it does exactly as everyone kept telling me it was a mana drain, which it isn't.  That's when I stumbled upon an analysis and explanation of the haste system as it relates to bards and the stacking of haste songs.<P>For reference:<BR>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html<P>After reading through this, I'm shocked.<P>I had always thought of my level of usefulness as something that didn't change.  Even if a group had an enchanter or shaman, they always wanted a bard for the extra mana and extra haste.  Now I find out that half of this usefulness has only been there in a small part due to a very strange haste stacking system?<P>I truly hope this can be changed somehow (1 + 1 != 1.5).  I'm not going to present options for this change, I'm sure they has been sufficiently covered in the rest of this very long thread.  I just wanted to add my point of view and opinion.  Thanks for listening.<P>Ailare, 53rd Minstrel<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have never been to level 50 or even particularly close with any character, so I will not pretend to know what changes bards need in that area. However I want to bring up a few issues that I think need to be changed:<P>A) The bug with restarting a song the same moment it ends causing it to not take effect is NOT rare at all. It usually happens to me at least once every RL hour of playing and in certain situations it becomes very problematic.<P>B) The charm and mez songs I have now are resisted far too often, even with a wind instrument in hand and a 100+ CHA. I recently had a blue mob resist 14 straight CHA songs with a wind instrument and a CHA of 109. And no it wasn't above the lvl cap for the song.<P>C) Maybe its just me, but the Lullaby song started to stink for me the exact same time I first memmed it. I once was trying to help plevel a friend a bit so I could group with him, and was trying to mez mobs so he could cast on them. Lullaby was resisted OVER half the time, even though all the mobs were green to me and I was holding a string instrument.<P>D) There is another bug that happens relatively often, and that a song that I was playing will get 'stuck'. It will simply continue playing of its own accord, and I can't make it stop. The only way to stop it is to have something stun you or camp. <P>E) Finally, why do all our targeted songs refuse to cycle by themselves and have to be reclicked after every single pulse? This makes it almost impossible to use charm in the middle of a large battle as I have to spend all my time trying to keep the song going and the mob doing what i want it to do. I dont think changing these songs to self-cycling would unbalance anything, just make life a bit easier for bards in terms of less carpal tunnel syndrome...<P>Ok, that's more than enough out of me, I'll let the higher lvl bards adress the actual gameplay issues.<P>- Masakari Yakikorosu<BR>Bard of 33 songs<BR>MT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What can I say,the defensive skills added on the test server are nice but too little a little too late.I keep hearing talk about balancing classes when little if anything is being done.<BR>At 33 I am finding it hard to level.Just yesterday I was grouped with a druid,ranger,paladin,enchanter and a shaman in the overthere.Every few minutes I started getting complaints in downtime to turn my mana song off because the chanter couldnt cast clarity.Then after I did, people started asking me why I wasn't playing the mana song.When we were fighting I was twisting 4 songs as best I could,(mana song, anthem , hymn and psalm of cooling though only 3 showed up during my twists)when all the casters start nagging me to play the mana song.The shaman asked me to just play the mana song and melee because his buffs were better and he needed my song to stack with clarity so he could continue to cast his dot and still have mana for buffs.So it seems I was relegated to mana battery during the whole time we were grouped.All the time I spent lvling,I kept hearing that the mana song would be a blessing that would give me more opportunities,Had I known that being a bard past 32 was just going relegate me to mana battery,I would have chosen another class. there are several things that keep us from being a balanced class <BR>1.we dont have any offensive skills <BR>2.we dont have any real defensive skills<BR>3.our songs don't stack well with other classes' buffs<BR>4.Soloing as a bard is a long painful process<BR>5.grouping as a bard is a long painful process<BR>6.we dont have much hp for a class thats able to wear plate armor(really whats the point gving us lambent when we have so few hp?)<BR>7.we cant really dodge or defend our selves well<BR>(whats with giving us parry and riposte at such high lvls and capping them at 75?)<BR>8.why do we have lockpicking skills? (so we can raid befallen or najena maybe?)<BR>9.It seems that our class suffers from a lack of comittment from Verant<BR>10.our buffs are less efficient than/with other classes' buffs<BR>11.our songs don't last long enough to really make a difference unless twisted back in at the right time wich requires good timing(nearly impossible with all the packet loss in some zones)<BR>12.everything MOB us more than anyother class<BR>13.every solo fight is painfully close no matter how many songs we play<BR>14.We shouldnt have to use mana at all<BR>15.Our melee isnt on par with any of the other classes<P>Dear verant before you say nerf in a bard thread ask yourselves, what is there to nerf?<BR>instead of finding ways to make our class less powerful you should make us even with the other classes.I see druids quad kiting with nukes and dots and you want to talk about balance?<BR>If you really want to balance a class, go pick on druids.they are way too powerful.<P>We deserve more hitpoints<BR>We deserve better offensive skills<BR>We deserve better song stackability <BR>we deserve buffs that are as good as what other classes have to offer<BR>We deserve longer song duration<BR>We deserve better defensive skills<BR>We deserve to have defensive skills cap at adecent level<BR>We deserve to have a real place in a group and community<BR>We are an underappreciated misfit class, where at higher lvls I hear we are uselss.<BR>A bard LFG is usually Lfg for a long time,and when he does find a group he is the designated mana battery(how is that fun?)<BR>Maybe this isnt D&D but from my experience bards are way more balanced in the D&d series.<P>If you cant find a way to make our class a real asset to a group or a fun class to solo with,<BR>just do away with us<P>It doesent seem like you care much for us anyway<P><BR>Bah I'm getting tired<BR>besides you wont listen to what we have to say anyway<P>Kerrios Trainmaker <BR>33 bard Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My bard is now in the low 40s with greater than 100 days played. So far, although difficult, the class seems to be holding out in terms of a Bard allways being able to contribute to the group. At times the reason for this is that the bard has made some other class less than utilised.<P>However I still see the problem of a 'jack of all trades' and 'king of none' In a strong high level group, with skilled players, what does the bard class do? Bard pay a high penlty for there Groupiness -- if you don't like kiting then there are many levels where the bard MUST group otherwise they have to become less a bard and more a poor warrior -- and it seems very strange that it is continuely reported that a high-level we are not a major requirement in groups.<P>I would also like to point out to Verant that twisting songs is often dependant on the quality of a persons connection to the server, something which i believe to be very wrong. Anyone without a fast speed connection should serious NOT develop a bard character as there main. This connection unbalance is really overlooked.<P>I would like to suggest that we get some new special ability than makes us valuable. <P>Any new skill should have the following chracteristics:-<P>(1) Low twisting requirement -- see above<BR>(2) Be active<BR>Bards can become very passive, reducing demage and increasing OTHER peps damage to such an extent that other members of the group have little idea of there contribution, until there corpsed that is  -- btw, why in a high mellee group when given the choice to heal a physical fighter and a bard both on low health do clerics heal the fighter, doh!, the fighter can at least back off, but if the bard backs off ....<P>With this i mind i would like to sugguest the following high level songs;<P>(1) Freeze time<BR>When played freezes in position all chars and mobs for say 30/60 seconds, no damage may be subsequent done to the group or any mob during the freeze -- will help with lag etc and allow more tactics to be thought out ie more group thinking/talking, -- such a song would of course have a high mana cost taking 30 to 60 minitues to be repeatable. A big massive slow up slow very similar to lag but NOT lag would also be worth it.<P>(2) Death Song<BR>Bard dies, killing nearest 6 mobs, but no one gets any experience for such kills, and named mob would be invurable to the song, no exp rez allowed for the bard.<P>Actually you could allow all bard songs to stack with other spells BUT bards are denied exp rezzes.<BR>Maybe unbalancing not sure. I would trade this.<P>(3) A Pet Song<BR>Bard can charm any non-named mob, who remains charmed for the life of the bard. Mana cost may be high, or if the pet dies the bard dies?!<P><BR>These suggest may be unbalancing, but i think would add to bard skills in a way that most bards would like.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sure these points have probably been brought up already. <P>Mana Drain - Song is not on my playlist. I have experimented with it for a few levels, and have found that mobs will get off just as many spells in combat as if I did not play it. Mind you, this is in varying group compositions, too. Including a group with absolutely no casters. Either the drain is just too weak period, or the damage ability of other classes negate the usefulness of this song. I like the idea posted earlier about giving this song a sort of "Lifetap effect" by taking the mana drained from the mob and distributing a portion of that directly back to the casters in the group.<P>Drum animation (or lack thereof)- Come on, it's long overdue. Throw us a bone, please  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Song Stacking - I think the arguments posted above pretty much nail this request on the head. At lower levels, we have something in our song list that makes every class appreciate us in some way. At higher levels, every class appreciates us because we can help the cleric meditate faster (not that having a cleric love you is a bad thing, mind you. Everyone usually bends to the wishes of their cleric when they tell the group "Get Bard!", hehe). But our role, in my opinion, is to play our songs for the benefit of the entire group. <P>Thanks for listening, and I hope that the changes that have occured on Test are not the final conclusion on what it takes to make a bard balanced. I hope this is still a work in progress.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since the Haste bug was fixed, I believe it would not be unbalancing and would contribute to the role a Bard could play in the group if the haste song could stack with Haste spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, here's my 2 cents worth from a lowly Bard of 50 songs. First, I could care less if you make haste stack or not. It's just not worth it in most cases, and especially if you have an Enchanter around, since they bring people to their maximum haste cap immediately if they are wearing any sort of haste item. (FBSS, etc)<P>What I would like is for you to seriously re-read Thott's articles that have been mentioned numerous times, and from there make educated decisions on what you can improve the Bard with without unbalancing things. Here's my short list, although I still think Thott has pointed out some very real issues for Bards overall.<P>1. Give us a single target slow spell, that doesn't snare the mob. Our slows are pathetic at higher levels. A song that dedicates 33% of our time (1 out of 3 twists) for, say, a 50% slow at level 50 cannot be that unreasonable. <P>2. We are part Rogue, correct? We get sneak, hide, Safe Fall, duel wield, etc. Why not give us a low skill capped backstab skill to help our melee damage? I realize we will never get double attack, and nor should we. Cap it at 50, or whatever is reasonable.<P>3. Take away the defensive skill upgrade you just gave us and put it back at 230. (or wherever it was) Then up our dodge, parry, and riposte skill a bit. I'm not talking 200 each, but where they stand now can't help us much. <P>4. Our DoT songs post 50 do not increase enough, pure and simple. I believe Thott has pointed this out very well, and will let his study speak for itself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Oh, and if I read one more post for a Bard asking for the Drum animation to be fixed, I'm going to flip out. Please keep your posts here to BALANCING issues. Does not having a drum animation suck? Yes. I would LOVE to have one also. However, does it hinder the ability to play your class? Hardly.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played just about every class in everquest and the bard is my favorite to date because it is the only hybird class that has a truely unique line of songs (spells).<P>That said here are some things I have noticed where the bard is weakest in songs:<P>1.) DD, is extremely weak at ever lvl, yes we are a hybird class but this is even weaker then what other hybird classes have.<P>2.) Charm, this does not last long enough to be of any more use than a taunt. If thats the case just give bards taunt it would be more useful then dropping a song just to use charm that does the same thing. If this lasted half the duration of what it does for a enchanter this would be a great song to use.<P>3.) Mez, same thing as above nowhere near long enough to be useful make it half the time of a enchanter and you might actually see it used.<P>4.) Instruments, would it be so hard to put in some weapons for bards that simulated a instrument. example: Sword of the Runner, increases your run rate similar to the MM drums. Or another that did brass ect.. Its not very practical to think your group is going to let you hang out with your horn and not using your sword.<P>5.) Bards have a good mix of songs similar to alot of the classes, they also have alot of traveling type of songs making a bard one of the best for traveling, why not some type of group gate song? I see nothing but positives for having another class that can do this. Maybe it should be something that gates you to a towns Pub? Or make it random on the continent so it doesnt compete with the other group gaters. Its just odd not to see it in a class that does so well in getting around.<P>I agree with most posts here to fix what we currently have either in dmg or duration, just to add the length of duration to all the songs so we dont twist every 3 secs would be a huge help to us bards.<P>Enigmas Revenge<BR>30 Bard<BR>Lanys<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My thoughts for balancing bards. Some have been said I am sure  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bards up to 50... Balanced pretty well  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I don't have much to comment on specifically for those levels  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Bards post 50: <BR>In a normal group, enchanter and shaman is prefered for the group functions of slow / crowd control usually. Bards can step in for enchanters in many places, and are prefered in some camps (specific: Sebilis uzo/necrosis/gang/d1) since we have better mana regen for the casters, and do crowd control very well on 3 or less mobs, and can switch to weapons and do _some_ melee dmg when it fits  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bards are not doing good at replacing shamans :/. Our slow songs aren't that effective, and cannot be used as slow songs. A group needs a shaman or enchanter for slows, bards just cannot do it. The only use I have found for slow songs, is AE slow on pulls with several mobs, to get them off the chanter till he has them mez'ed, and has time to slow the first mob you are fighting. Other than that, the slow component is pretty useless. A enchanter and bard together that can play though, is an effective combination.<P>In a group with enchanter and shaman... this better be AoE group, or bards are less usefull than any other class you could possibly add. A way to correct this would be to look at our target specific slow-snare song. The current problem with this song is that it has premature breaks. A bard cannot be relied on to snare. We can snare pretty well most of the time, but in places where mobs must be snared bards cannot do the job... root is much more effective. That root and snare now stacks has gone quite some way towards correcting this, but the way to correct it would imho be to remove the premature break on the snare songs. Alternatively, give bards a snare song that has no slow component, and doesn't break early, if that is a problem <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>When a bard song is activated (3 sec after singing), and it just went out, it _often_ gives no effect. This bug is common, happens every time I play several times. It's just annoying  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Bards resist songs: They rock, but... we have a resist fire-cold, and resist disease-poison. Any chance for a debuff disease-poison song? This is not really something that needs to be fixed but just a nice thing to actually have. <P>Bards don't do much melee dmg  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I don't care that much about this. but I have one problem though... I cannot taunt :/ Up to 50, bards usually have the opposite problem, that we taunt too much... over 50... well, I cannot aggro a mob beating up the cleric  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I used to do charm to do this, but mobs are now over the lvl cap. Also, as a bard I cannot do any sort of cc in places like Kael due to the low lvl limit. Could the lvl cap on charm be up'ed to 55 instead ? If too unbalancing, is it any way to code it so we can only charm giants over lvl 50, not other mobs? <P>The Lute from Maestro... no drop. Other instruments, dropable. Design? what is the reason? Is there a chance to either make all instruments no drop, or none? I currently miss only this one, cause poh is pharmland and no challenge, and I had no luck on the 30 or so times I've been there, and it rotted a few times I wasn't around  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> If all instruments was no drop, I see the sense, but as it is, I don't <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Quite a few twinks have all the same instruments I have when they start playing, since the bard instrument drops is usually leftovers and banked when dragons drop.<P>The Defense upgrade, if it goes live, I like: Since bards are defensive, it makes sense to give us higher ac. Not that I can aggro much at all, but for the situations that requires it it's nice, and ... well, at least it justifies how little dmg we do with weapons  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The level 57 speed song: Can you remove the speed component so it would stack with other songs? Atm I see no reason what so ever to use this song, there are always better songs to use.<P>SoW and Selo: Any chance of stacking? (just a wish)<P>Cantana and C2: Atm they stack, but songs have to be stopped for c2 to be cast, same with group regen. Can they just stack? I am sick of hearing 'song off, group regen inc' and 'song off, c2 incoming'  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Aebriol / Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055105-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055105&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055105&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
