</FONT><HR>You can read the previous thread <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">HERE</A>:    <P>Author      Topic:   Enchanter Talk  <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 01-26-2001 11:24 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Unfortunately, as will probably be the case from here out, I just don't have time to do any research before starting this post. I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters… <BR>Again, the usual reminder. I am primarily looking for balance concerns here. But I am certainly willing to put bugs on the list. Also, though I really do understand the fact that you want to emphasize and back up statements by others, please, please try to keep the repeat information to a minimum. I'm finding that by page three or four on these threads I'm rereading the same suggestions by people that start their posts with "I didn't read this thread, so I don't know if this had been said…" I don't want to stifle any creativity. But I have to admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing good new ideas late in threads when they are buried among things that others have covered several times before.<P>So, please, let's hear what you think is unbalanced or broken about enchanters. Here are the few things that I had already jotted down:<P>Gift of Brilliance: When compared to similar buffs by Clerics and Shamans this spell doesn’t seem good enough. Sure, it will see use, but it could be a better spell. Quick comparison:<P>Aeogolism (60th level Cleric spell): Adds 1,100 to max hit points and 54 to AC for a single target. Lasts 2.5 hours. Costs 750 mana.<BR>Focus of the Spirit (60th level Shaman spell): Adds 405 hit points, 67 strength and 60 dexterity for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 500 mana.<BR>Gift of Brilliance (50th level Enchanter spell): Adds 150 mana and grants a mana regeneration rate increase of 2 points per tick for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 450 mana.<P>The Shaman and Cleric spells essentially replace other buffs. Gift of Brilliance stacks with Clarity II. It might be nice to have the mana regeneration be 2 points greater than Clarity II and NOT stack with it so that enchanters could use it to save a slot. And perhaps rather than increasing the mana bonus, give it an intelligence bonus. But perhaps at this level enchanters just don't need any more intelligence boosts…<P>Illusions drop when zoning: Is there a gameplay reason behind the fact that illusions drop when you zone? If not, can we make it so they do not?<P>More Illusions: I think it’s a good idea to dig through the list of current global characters and see if there are a few more illusions that we can give to enchanters.<P>I know there are more issues…<P>Alan<p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>I have been playing in Vellious recently, and I am quite disappointed that I can't seem to play my crowd control role the same way as the other continents. This would not be quite so bad, but I have not other role in a group, other than as a buffer. Is there some game reason that the Magic Resists are so high there? It even seems like the 'consider' value of the mobs there is innacurate. The other night, a con blue to a level 45, almost took out an entire group. Strange.<P>Vellious is  land of giants, and giants cant me mezzed (for whatever reason). Combine that with high magic resists on many other mobs, and for the most part ( and I admit not all the time), I am reduced to clarity, garou, and celerity. Boring and frustrating to say the least.<P>Hoggle of Ak'Anon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally after playing an enchanter for 60 levels and 2 expansions I've seen teh class go through ALOT of changes. First no one wanted to group with enchanters, now no one wants to group without them.<P>In my opinion the class IS BALANCED. Sure we have mez and charm (which breaks after 2 seconds most of the time) but our offensive skills are by far the worst in all of norrath. It's the trade off and most enchanters are happy with it, since we all know offense may win battles but defence wins wars  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now thats not to say the class is perfect, it would be nice to do more then buff 80% of the time. And charm should NOT have be used as crowd control (dictate).<P>Basically the spells i see that need improvement are:<P>Dictate: 5 minute recast for 48 second charm...to me this is a substitute for the /kill spells otehr casters get..but for 750mana can it either last 96seconds or drop the recast to 3 minutes..as it is it's taking almost 2-2 1/2 bubs of mana to cast, so it can't really be chain cast since the mob aggro's you to death once it breaks..perhaps add a memblur to it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Gift of Brilliance/Insight/Magic : These were a joke right? 450mana for gift of brilliance for a measly 150mana + 2 point mana regen as a lvl 60 spell?!? How aboout it costing 450mana and buff 400mana and give 5point mana regen? It's not really worth casting in it's current state cause at lvl 60 an extra 150mana isn't gonna amount to much and that 2 point mana a tic is also insubstancial<P>Since i have my epic hasting isn't really an issue, but how about a group augment for those who don't have thier epic  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Dyn's Dizzing Line of spells jsut gets me dizzy thinking about it...they are completely useless. they should all be like Largo's Lamention (lvl 55 single target stun)<P>Theft of Thought: greatest spell ever invented since the conception of Snare<P>Rapture: Can basically mez any mob lvl 59 and under with a 24 second duration/recast..since it is our last mez spell, can we make it so it mez's giants? it's also a heavy mana spell and can only hold one target at a time<P>Glamour of Kintaz: nice spell but high mana for short duration makes it no-so-good<P>Charm (all charms) should havea minimum duration of 10 seconds at least...it's jsut frustrating to cast charm, type /pet back off /pet kill and charm already be broken  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Bedlam: don't touch it, don't make it stack with str buffs, LEAVE IT ALONE  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Illusions: &lt;giggle&gt; do i really have to go into this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> just any globla model, throw into a scroll for us to scribe and we'll stop bugging you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> JUST KIDDING! but one or 2 new ones post 50 would be nice..doesn't matter what they are  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>And let us use Illusion:wolf inside since it don't haev the speed modifier or faction anymore.<P>Lull Line of spells: i think we all know these never worked as they should..perhaps if they didn't aggro when they were resisted?<P>Just in summary, I've come to accept the fact that the majority of my time is done buffing and preping, Enchanters ARE a defensive class, pacifists even, we trade off teh uber crowd control/buffing ability for having little to no offensive ability and that is how we are balanced  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Philly Honeyblunt<BR>Phantasmist of Fennin Ro<P>PS. This is all off the top of my head but with 150+days played as a chanter i hope this helps  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mywil is my enchanter and main(pallie is registered so dont freak all )<BR>I'd like to see the mem blur line wipe agro list on 50 +. I'll never forget when i finally got the 55 mem blur, was in sebilis, i casted and agro,hmmm.. didn't like that, i don't even use it anymore.<BR>    As far as more illusions, maybe illusion giant. I don't think we have any illusions Giants can get along with.<BR>     My main problem with the Enchanter class is, Why are Enchaters allowed to pick a religion if it seriously handicaps our class specific abillity (illusions). Many classes are restricted to certain religions or none at all, what if a rogue has a religion, can a npc with conflicting religion see him when he if in stealth?, i dont think so. But if an Enchanter has a religion ( yes i have one)certain npc attack even in thier form. The 1st time i went into Neriak, illusion DE, Sk's attacked and killed me, i reported it as a bug, a GM tells me after a bit of conversation"Certain npc will feal your religious aura when you are near them and attack, but don't worry, most of your quest npc will not be effected". He was right at the time so i didn't really complain. But now its different. <BR>     So above all i'd like to see once and for all enchanters be stripped of thier religions and be agnostic by default.Maybe a quest to change it even would be nice.<BR>     As for the non mezzable mobs, a better root even at a higher level would do the trick. This way we can still crowd control by just adjusting our tactics alittle.<BR>     Pets: maybe a real nice pet at level 60,kinda on the lines of the necro 60 pet,i'm not saying i want a spec pet,but a pet with some htpts would be nice, maybe make it a hard quest, and its image in the form of its casters with a kinda transparent look to it. well thats my 2cp ) happy hunting all</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi everyone.<P>This thread is so incredibly long that I must admit to not having read it all.  If I'm repeating someone forgive me.<P>I'm posting to ask this simple question: What gives so many people that Enchaters are overpowered?  Do those people actually play them or just watch us in action and think we're awesome?<P>Most players seem to equate power with soloing ability.  Do enchanters solo well?  No.  We have no snare of any kind, so we cannot kite.  Our pet is such a wimp (at upper levels) that he can't tank even the lowest blue without major help from us.  We have two methods to solo with, root-n-nuke and charm.  Both are extremely unreliable and really only amount to emergency techniques.<P>I think that one of the components of "power" in EQ is survivability.  When the situation gets out of control, who is going to die?  We have no FD.  We have very little armor.  We have very few HPs.  What we do have in abundance is the attention of large numbers of monsters.  Allow me to share a favorite quote from Caster's Realm: "Also Bards, at least at the higher levels,  are usually the second to die after the Enchanter."<P>So is power the ability to kill monsters?  If you think so, then enchanters are one of the weakest classes out there.  We have a few nukes which we use to help out with when we have extra mana.<P>Is power about the uber raids?  How many enchanters do you need to take down that uber mob?  In the final encounter all we are generally good for is buffing.  You need a few enchanters to help break into the final encounter in most cases, but you really only ever need a few.  How many warriors to you bring with you?  Would a ratio of 4 warriors to 1 enchanter be enough?<P>We have an easier time finding groups than some classes.  Really that depends on where you are and your luck.  Each group really only needs one enchanter, and if you aren't in a dungeon, they don't need you at all.  The other night, I bailed out of Lower Guk because there was already another enchanter LFGing in there.  That poor guy had been waiting for an hour before I got there.<P>We have no SoW and no TP so when it comes to travelling, we are a beggar class just like most.  We do have both Invis and Invis to Undead.  I'd say considering our lack of ability to defend ourselves, this is a good balance.  You need somebody to run in and drag your corpse?  No rogue around?  Sure, I'll do it, and when the invis breaks at the wrong time and those three blues jump me, I'll die for my effort and not complain.<P>In truth, enchanters are not powerful at all.  What we have instead, is the ability to make others more powerful.  This is truly a beautiful thing.  We generally don't do any damage ourselves.  Instead we haste buff the tanks to increase their damage, and clarity the casters to increase their damage.<P>Where enchanters really shine is by increasing the group's output through crowd-control.  Basically, we can reduce the damage coming in, therefore taking the load off the healers.  By doing this, the group is able to kill more monsters per hour than without us.  It also can turn a total loss into a winning battle.  This is also what gets us killed.<P>Why do we do this job?  Is it for all the "power" we have?  No way.  It's because it's fun.  We run around getting in the monsters' faces, sorting out the bedlam.  We balance the control of the situation on the edge of a knife, and yes, the good enchanters make it look easy.  Let me tell you, this is not an easy job.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And I think the best way to do this without giving a brand new spell to us is to tweak the GIFT line (since people are complaining about them already) so that instead of increasing the base pool, it gives 100-150 mana a cast along with the normal +1 or +2 mana regen.<P><BR>Ver</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First, Kudos to all the enchanters posting!  Most of the threads were well thought out, clearly stated, and offered several viable alternatives.  This just supports my contention that those that choose the hard life of an enchanter are truly dedicated to the class!<P>Second, thank you Verant and all the employees for creating a game that so many people feel so strongly about.  It isn't always easy to make people emotional about such a small thing as a computer game.<P>Now for my comments.<P>When you are making changes for 'balance' keep in mind the people who actually contribute the most to your bottom line:  The part-timers.  These are the people who pay the same amount per month, but use the least percentage of resources and time. i.e. Those who pay the highest price/minute of play. (And no, I don't mean ignore the hard-cores)<P>As a part-timer, I know that it is unlikely I will ever get to level 50.  I know I can't spend 8 hours or more camping a spawn for a really cool item, and I can accept that.  And being an enchanter, I know that I will spend a great deal of my life trying to find a group that needs me for a few hours.  I knew that going in, and so I'm OK with that.<P>What I'm not OK with is the fact that since the day the game went public, enchanter's have been made harder to play, and less fun.  I remember the early days when a pair of enchanter's could go anywhere and do anything.  I'm glad that's been toned down, but now it is difficult for an enchanter to do anything but buff.<P>Here are some things I'd like to see addressed:<BR>- Enchanters are resisted by everything!  I group with some necros from time to time and know a couple of them are part-timers.  They quickly outpace me -- not due to the time invested, or the risk taken, but due to the fact they can fight white and yellow mobs solo, and red in group.  Enchanters get resisted so much that fighting blues solo is difficult, and fighting reds in groups is nearly impossible! Solution:  Reduce some of the teribbly high resist rates.<P>- Enchanters die more than any other class.  Every thing we throw has a higher taunt than even clerics doing in battle heals.  Once a mob is on us, it is only with great luck that we can get it off us before we are slaughtered.  We have no HP and no AC, so we can't withstand punishment for long. Solution:  Lower the taunt of the mega-taunt spells.<P>- Add group faction boost.  Many times, I have wanted to aid a newbie or friend in an area where they are KOS, but though I can adjust faction towards myself, I cannot adjust the faction of those in my group.  Would that be unbalancing?  I don't know, but its always seemed like something the class should be able to do.<P>- Fix lull series.  Everyone knows this is far too dangerous to ever use the way it is.<P>- Add illusions for fun.  Please find a way to add 'illusion copy target'.  It doesn't have to have any benefit (including faction), but it would greatly enchance the fun of being an enchanter.  If it needs to be restricted to non-undead, that's fine too.  And it wouldn't unbalance the game in any way.<P>If you can't do any of those things, then perhaps you can change some of the outdoor zones to have more single targets at more levels.  Then a part time enchanter like me can still play the game, and still solo slowly toward the decent levels.  I may never get 'uber' status, but please don't make it so I have to change class in order to enjoy the few precious hours I can get online.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know you will be dead-set against my suggestions, Absor, but I'll make them anyway.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Here is the short-list:<P>1. Illusions should persist when zoning *and* when logging.<P>2. Add Illusion Will-o-wisp:<BR>   Increase to AC<BR>   Lightsource<BR>   Increase movement (j-boots)<BR>   Faction: will-o-wisp<P>3. Add Illusion Pet<BR>   This would give the enchanter the same appearance as his pet, which would have the side effect for most enchanters to appear as two hovering steins.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Not really useful but certainly amusing.<P>Here are the longer explanations:<P>#1 It is an all too common problem that an enchanter will enter a city, adopt an illusion and then go link dead while venturing in that city. In other words, a non-game related event caused a character to become trapped in an untenable situation. If the illusion could survive logging, then you would have less petitions, and less angry players out there.<P>#2 I know you hate the blending of classes, etc., etc. but take a moment to see the other side of the view: although class differentiation encourages grouping, which in turn makes the game more interesting, adding variety to a class also makes the game more interesting. It is a balance, not black and white, I'm sure you will agree. I think self-only spells go a long way to adding variety without blending the classes to the point of greyness. That's my rebuttal to not adding one increased movement illusion.<P>In terms of faction, why can't there be one class that can travel through the zones (albeit non-planar) without getting the smack laid down on them. Enchanters is another must-group class. Anything that makes it easier for said enchanter to move from zone to zone looking for a group will only add to the game, not subtract from it.<P>Perhaps a way to balance this spell is make it castable in outdoor/non-dungeon zones only.<P>#3 Self-explanatory.<P>Thanks as always for your attention, Absor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 59 enchanter with 138 days played. Although a lot of excellent posts have been made, I want to make sure that the key issues that affect me aren't lost amidst the many comments regarding illusions, the uselessness of the lull line, etc.<P>The greatest joy in playing an enchanter for me is in our crowd control abilities.<P>Without a good group behind them, the enchanter is arguably one of the weakest classes. With a good group they can make the impossible possible, resulting in misguided calls to nerf enchanters. People see that enchanters are almost mandatory for high level dungeon crawls and infer that as a class we are overpowered. They don't stop to think that that power is offset by many factors. We are nearly superfluous in outdoor encounters. We are often the first to die when things go wrong. We alone among int casters have to focus on two primary stats, not one. Most of our spells are extreme taunts, so we also have to pay attention to AC and use several of our precious spell slots for 'survival' spells such as stuns and rune. We have to manage our mana pool more closely than most, as it's our job to keep everyone alive when the worst possible things happen at the worst possible times.<P>Disturbingly, Verant apparently sees a group with an enchanter surviving encounters they did not expect and their first reaction is to nerf the enchanter. They artificially tag mobs as unmezzable. They increase a mobs mr to the point where the only thing an enchanter can get to stick is a tash. They set level caps on mezzes without any way for an enchanter to know a mobs level until they have blown mana (and agroed the mob) by casting a lower mez that won't take. They make the same mez spell from different level enchanters not stack to increase the difficulty of raids. At times it seems that Verant regrets having created the enchanter class to begin with.<P>In my opinion, the 'nerf stick' has already swung too far. For me, the following steps would go a long way to rebalancing the class:<P>1) If a target cannot be mezzed with a particular spell, have it say so when the cast is attempted. Don't blow the mana. Don't agro the mob. Don't have the failed attempt keep the correct mez spell from sticking. The same could be applied to charm.<P>2) Don't use the arbitrary application of the giant/unmezzable flags and extremely high mr as a way to increase an encounters difficulty. Surely there must be some other way for Verant to accomplish this goal without singling out the enchanter class. I was chatting in the Eastern Wastes with a lower level guild mate the other day when an orc emissary unexpectedly jumped us. Out of the many spells I cast during the encounter, only tash stuck. My guild mate died and I had to run to the zone with a very very green mob chasing me. Where is the balance in that?<P>3) Allow the same spell from different level enchanters to overwrite each other. Dazzle freezes a mob for 96 seconds regardless of whether it was cast by a level 49 enchanter or a level 60 one. What reason is there to keep the 49 enchanter from taking over crowd control on a mob initially mezzed by the level 60?<P>These are the crucial issues for me. A great many other valid points have been clearly and lucidly made by my fellow enchanters, but if only the above three points were addressed I'd feel a good measure of the balance to the enchanter class would be restored.<P>Kwraz Kameron<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, I think our class is basically balanced. I've reached lv 51 now, and only see a few gaps that need adressing.<P>I will go through the spell list in chunks, and point out the things I consider issues with the spells or lines of spells. These are mainly tuning / tweaking issues.<P>Lull series of spells. These spells cause monsters to attack you more often than they prevent the mob from aggroing. I have heard a rumor that this was adressed recently, if so excelent, I may actually find a use for the spells. Currently they are at the back of my spellbook.<P>Reclaim energy. This spell when cast at lower levels makes no impact on your mana (the cost of the spell vs amount returned seems to have no impact on the blue bar). I never use this spell.<P>Sentinel. This spell could have been so much, but unfortunately is very annoying to players nearby. Casting this spell also requires you target yourself to cast (note to self, check this), why not just make it a self only spell? Also, could you change it so that the information reported only came to the caster of the spell, instead of spamming everyone within range, it would be more group friendly. Same goes for it's audible component, which drowns out all the other sounds anyone around might want to hear. Also, it seems as if the spell stops reporting information after a while too, well before the spell wears off. Not sure if this is because the mobs around me stop moving, or what *shrug*. It would be usefull if the spell did not report your own movements, or those of your pet. I would love to use this spell more, (can we say, enchanter wannabe trackers?) if only it didn't spam everyone nearby.<P>Illusion Iksar. Nice spell. I was finally able to obtain this lv 20 spell at lv 39 with group of 3 (cleric, druid, me). The mobs you have to kill are the appropriate level for a group of lv 20's to take, but getting through the lv 35 mobs to get to the lv 20 mobs is a bit tough / unrewarding. Oh, and since you've added that wandering iksar necro NPC, I won't travel through FV zone anymore at lv 51! (I run through, invisible, as fast as I can). So, good luck on anyone trying to get this spell now.<P>Charm line (Information taken from Casters Realm website)<BR>Spell		TTC	LvCap<BR>Lv 16 Charm	2.4	25<BR>Lv 24 Beguile	3.5	39<BR>Lv 39 Cajoling 	5.5	45<BR>Lv 49 Allure	6	50<BR>Lv 53 Boltrans 	4	53/51<BR>Lv 60 Dictate	5	58<BR>The TTC for Cajoling Wispers and Allure is too high. I did not realize how much the TTC had gone up with my new spells till I tried to use Cajoling for the first time. I had a mob aggroed on me, I ran till I was out of the spells range, and begun to cast on the mob the instant it entered spell range. The mob came up to me and whacked me before the spell was ready to go off. There is a sharp spike in the TTC on those 2 spells in consideration of the spells that come before and after them. Please reduce the TTC on these 2 spells to 4. As they are these spells require the luck of a recovered spell as opposed to skill of the player in the situations where they are most usefull. <BR>Level caps. Spreadsheet them in terms of casters level vs difference in mobs level. There are spikes and gaps present. Make the overlap of the charm cap level larger please. I see no reason why a lv 22-23 chanter cannot charm a red, when a lv 24 through 36 ones can. Also, there is a gap in lvs 46, 47, and 48 where a chanter cannot even tell by the con if he can charm the target (only low blues). When they get to 49, they can once again charm some yellows. Mobs who are of a higher level than the chanter already will resist a great deal, I see no reason to add an extra limitation to the chanter. Yes, charming a tough mob can be an awesome asset, but it's also a huge risk if that mob who's 5 levels higher than you suddenly breaks charm. Please allow the 6 level limit on spells to be the only limit on this line by making the level cap overlap 5 levels. So, a lv 23 enchanter could not charm a lv 29 mob because it is 6 levels higher than him, he could attempt it on lv 28 mobs. To charm the lv 29 mob, he would have to use his new lv 24 spell with the higher mana cost and higher TTC. (well, okay, I see the need to limit it starting at lv 49 spells due to EPIC and NPC mobs, but I do not see the need before then)					<BR>Modified Spell	TTC	LvCap<BR>Lv 16 Charm	2.4	28<BR>Lv 24 Beguile	3.5	43<BR>Lv 39 Cajoling  4	48<BR>Lv 49 Allure	4	50<BR>Lv 53 Boltrans 	4	53/51<BR>Lv 60 Dictate	5	58<BR>Note, my intent here is not to make the spell more powerfull, my intent is to make it more consistent across the lifespan of the enchanter. Now I realize my suggestion makes it somewhat more powerfull, but this was the best solution I could come up with. <P>Illusions, lv 24 plus.<BR>It seems to me, that all the previous spells had faction adjustements to various groups (races). From 24 on thogh, it just seems as if most of the spells only change  faction rarely, if at all. For instance, illusion skeleton doesn't help in befallen, unrest or against decaying skeletons. =( Some players have requested more illusions, I simply want my illusions to have more faction impacts. I'd like to go through najena as an elemental unmolested.<P>Recast time on lv 49 mez. Lower it. I still use the lower level Entrance with the lower duration because the recast time is so much better. I only use dazzle when on a raid and the higher level enchanters need to overwrite my mez's.<P>Zaros Trainstopper, 51st lv Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well there are a lot of Enchanter Issues i'd like to discuss not just balance issues, but I guess i'll go a little at a time.<BR>One issue i've seen lately is Verants views on Enchanters getting more or less illusions because of faction. Wasn't this the purpose of illusions? didn't we get the different race illusions to be safe when traveling into towns? wasn't enchanter's being able to safely enter towns using their illusions a ability that enchanters should have been giving from the beginning? Like the faction with elementals in Najena, I could travel in there safely but I'd have to be careful because there were some things that still aggroed.<BR>I don't see why Verant is opposed to enchanter's being able to travel safely, (if u can call it that) because there are many mobs in the same zone that do not carry the same faction and will attack. Another thing i've been wondering is if Verant's just been lazy lately, They say "it's too hard", we are paying millions of dollars here, they have the best programmers, whats so hard about it? and if it is indeed difficult they should atleast try because anything is possible when dealing with fantasy. As for faction taking too long to program with, didn't everquest in the beginning take a long time? or are they saying they just threw it all together? They should start working on Enchanter's illusions and the factions, give us illusion target and make us kos to everything for all I care, Though I do agree Illusion target would be uber if everything became indifferent, they should make the illusion let us travel safely in some area's but not all, like in high lvl area's the mobs could all be auto kos because they don't fall for the illusion or can smell you, but in other area's like a goblin camp, they couldn't tell the difference because of their lack of intelligence. It can't be too hard to set zones to auto kos to certian illusions can it?<BR>I guess what i'm tryin to say is<BR>- Give us Illusion Target<BR>- If faction is a problem make it all KoS or stop complaining and work on it so that faction won't be a problem when using the illusion.<BR>-I also wish verant to rethink why they gave enchanter's illusions in the first place, From beta they always said it was to let enchanter's travel where other's cannot Am i incorrect here?<BR>-I'd also like verant to realize how much they are being payed and try and get them to get out of their hot tubs and start doing difficult things to program instead of easy things to do like copying spells and givin it to another class.<P>The Wanderer<BR>*May The Wanderer's Protect You*<BR>52 Enchanter Rallos Zek Vagabon Dreamweaver<BR>*Champion of the Test of Mystics (Pvp Caster)<BR>33 Rogue Rallos Zek Kaws Dreamweaver<BR>*Don't turn your back*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Absor, please explain something to me...<P>You start out this thread with the following statement:<P>"Unfortunately, as will probably be the case from here out, I just don't have time to do any research<BR>                          before starting this post. I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters… "<P>Ok, then after candidly admitting you don't know much about enchanters, you follow up with this little jewel:<P><BR>                           "Keep in mind that there is nobody that knows anything about EverQuest that doesn't worry that<BR>                           enchanters are already overpowered, even those that play enchanters. This applies to a few other classes<BR>                           as well. So keep in mind that by taking a careful look at this class, I may very well be prompted to suggest<BR>                           a reduction in the power of something. This is just as important as the increase in power of things to<BR>                           maintain a balance. I'm not telling you that this is my intent, just letting you know that it could happen."<P>Can you tell me how, in light of your lack of "research," you've come to the extraordinary conclusion that enchanters are widely viewed as "overpowered"?<P>Let's consider a few things:<P>1-Enchanters have probably the lowest grade casting damage of any of the pure caster classes.<P>2-We are usually the first of the casters to die in any group because of the high taunt factor of our spells.<P>3-Our spells are virtually all magic based. In a place like Velious, this makes us pretty much useless except for buffing.<P>4-We have the lowest hitpoint total, on average, of all the casting classes.<P>5-We are the only casting class whose spell effectiveness relies on TWO stats: intelligence and charisma.<P>Now, I'm not going to argue that we have our strengths. Mesmerize is pretty much our bread and butter and, along with clarity, is the main reason we're so much in demand. I can only conclude that your opinion about our being "overpowered" is based on the mesmerize line of spells.<P>Well, let me tell you something, if you nerf our mesmerize line I, along with a lot of other enchanters, are going to either hold a mass revolt or just give up on the game altogether. That's because you'd be striking us in the very heart of what we do--and what many of us have trained ourselves to do very, very well. Cripple our crowd control abilities and what exactly do you leave us? Buffs, and that's about it. And even there we're limited. Clarity and haste are our strongpoints. Everything else we do, other classes do better.<P>Another thing I'm curious about. Why did you pick us out as being overpowered, and not mention anything when you introduced the Necro and Druid talk. Paraphrasing you, there isn't anypone who plays EQ on a regular basis who doesn't know for AN ABSOLUTE FACT that if any classes are overpowered in EQ, these are the ones.<P>Let's look at Necros. Here's some of the abilities they get:<BR>Mesemerize (undead)<BR>Pets (commandable and strong)<BR>Dead Man Floating (levitate, see invisible, enduring breath)<BR>Clarity (In the form of Liche)<BR>Heal (lifetap)<BR>Snare (Darken)<BR>Resurrection (what a laugh that they get this, btw, even if it does require a player sacrifice.)<BR>Corpse Recovery<BR>Fear<BR>Root<BR>Charm (undead)<BR>Feign Death!<BR>Illusion (undead)<BR>Killer DOTs<P>Look careful at the above list: what you're really looking at is a class that combines the best of an enchanter and druid. All they're missing is SOW and enchant metals.<P>I'm not saying you should nerf necros. I am saying it's ridiculuous for you to wave your finger at us enchanters and call us overpowered, with a class like necromancer running around.<P>Maybe if you defined "overpowered" a little better I might understand. Absent that, I'm befuddled. And I think you'd better do a lot more "research" before you make silly statements like that again.<P>Ramon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Like many EQ newbies, I chose a religion for my enchanter when I created him. As a result, most of my illusions are now useless and I have died over 12 times to my religion -- I'm sick and tired of one mouse click consistently ruining my gameplay.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I personally disagree with the way religions work for enchanters (and to some extent, all classes). Currently, NPC's can see through illusions and see the character's religion. This means that if you choose a 'good' religion (such as Tunare or Mithaniel Marr), your character is automatically unable to enter any evil cities and vice versa if you choose an 'evil' religion.<P>In a strict cost-benefit analysis, the benefits of choosing a religion include:<BR>* Limited faction boosts to one religious facility (ie Temple of Life in Qeynos)<BR>* The ability to use a very limited array (and very useless) of imbued items.<P>The costs include:<BR>* Global faction declines in evil(or good) cities.<BR>* Unrepairable faction (they hate you too much to be able to easily repair, esp. with evil factions)<BR>* Useless Illusion spells (Ill. DE is almost useless if you chose Tunare or another good aligned god)<BR>*The inability to finish the Epic quest if you choose a religion opposed to the Bloodsabres<BR>* Dying, Dying, Dying... You get the picture.<P>It doesn't make sense that an entire character can be destroyed because a person clicked on a religion when they were creating their character.<P>I think one (or several) changes should be implemented to correct this.<P>* Automatically turn the character's religion to Agnostic after casting an illusion (thus ignoring the religion while the Illusion is up)<BR>* Create an illusion Agnostic spell which switches the character's religion to agnostic and is stackable with other illusions.<BR>* Create a quest which permanently changes your religion to agnostic.<BR>* Create a line of very powerful religious items or spells (other than the lousy tradeskill items) to offset the disadvantages of choosing a religion.<BR>* Or failing all that, change the difficulty level for an enchanter from Moderate difficultly to Very Difficult if a player chooses a religion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For the most part Enchanters are nicely balanced.  With that said there are some changes I would love to see.<P>1)  Lull/Soothe line of spells - This line of spells is possibly broken.  Did the designers actually intend it to have both a high resist rate, and agro the mobs when resisted?  I understand that allowing for harmony like pulling in dungeons could be overpowered.  However in their current form they are almost useless.  I would always prefer to "Lull" a camp of mobs with AE mez over Lull.  Some work needs to be done to make this line useful.  Additional note:  Not to step on druids toes, but why do druids get an unresistable outdoor lull spell when the enchanter is stuck with this useless line?<P>2) Weakness/Disempower lines - These spells seem to have little to no impact on a mobs combat performance.  Especially at higher levels.  They do however work great in duels (against someone that doesnt have 100+ MR ).  Was this the intention?  I understand that making this work better on mobs could be unbalancing for PvP, but there should be some way of at least making these useful.  I mean the enchanter IS supposed to be the master of debuffing.  Yet here we have 2 lines of spells that are never used by enchanters in any situation.  That just seems wrong to me.<P>3) WTYH, DDD - These two spells were made largely useless a long time ago.  They break way too easily.  How about making them single target stuns?  Perhaps WTYH could be a .5 casting time single target 1 or 2 second stun with 12 or 18 second refresh and DDD could be a 2.0 casting time single target 4 second stun?  <P>4) Religion - Either give religious enchanters a worthwhile reason for having a religion or dont let mobs see through illusions for religios purposes.<P>5)  Mez spells - After 50 we get 2 mez spells.  Both are very short duration and very high mana.  In addition the first one GoK offers only the simple benefit of being able to mez higher level mobs.  This to me seems like a major downgrade.  It should either cost less mana, last longer, resist less, or mez giant class mobs.  Rapture at 59 should work on anything but a god class mob.  At 55+ enchanters in many cases are relegated to buffer role.  Is this the intention of the designers?  If so at least enchanters should be able to debuff (with noticable effect )high level mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Enchanter Pets - To limit their liability wihtout increasing there power could you please consider giving us the ability to kill our pets with the "/pet get lost" command.<P>Targetting Issues - anything you might be able to come up with that could help enchanters select the correct mob in a stack would be very helpful.  Perhaps a /targetenemy command that popped up a tracking like list to select a mob from.  I know this might be a pipe dream ... but it would really be nice.<P>Memblur - Our first mem-blur spell is great, but it never really gets satisfactory upgrades.  Please look at these spells and decide if relaibly wipeing the hale list on higer level mobs is really unbalancing.<P>Tree Ilusion/ Minor Illusion - why don't these have more sucessful faction adjustments vs just about everything.  I realize that these are relatively low level spells ... but it has never made sence to me that a dark elf guard would attack a tree because of it's religon.<P>Lull Line - this is so rarely useful to us because it is generally accepted that enchanters don't pull.  While I have little doubt that monks would find these spells usefull as is, for enchanters to use these spells requires that they be more reliable.<P>Str Debuffs - Could these be changed to something that reduces Max damage, perhaps 5 points of STR could equal 1 point subtracted from max damage?<P>More items still need to be added that use the Thicken Mana line to create.<P>Boon of the Garou - If this was not intended to be a particularly effective spell, but just to add a fun spell to play with, you did a great job.  There do seem to be indications however that you intended this to be an effective spell, in which case you missed the mark.  The cost of a spell slot is too great for the benifits this spell provides.<P>Buffs - Anything that would reduce the number of times  have to cast these would be appreciated.  Raising costs and durations for any buff series except the rune series would be greatly appreciated.  Group buffs are wonderful.<P>Thanks for taking the time to read all these posts ...

To do this we risk our butts in every battle.  We earn and deserve every shred of this "power".  We have had nothing handed to us and have been smacked around an refused most things we ask for.  It has been that way for a while.  <P>Let me ask a question, how are we too powerful?  <BR>Our power lies in others, we have to have a group to augment and protect us before we have any power.  We need groups as bad as groups need us.  So what people object to is that we reduce their downtime?  They object that we can save their hineys with a mem blur or charm?  They object because we can sacrifice ourselves to buy that last few minutes a group needs to evac?<P>We are among the first to die if any thing goes bad. Not only that but we are constantly in danger when looking for a group..ever tried playing with a group that has even one single person that doesnt know how to play with an enchanter?  The result...death for the enchanter.<P>I say all of this because I do not like Absors tone that enchanters might need a nerf to balance them.  If you think our powers are to great...fine..reduce our risk in accordance to how you reduce our powers.  I don't think there is another single class that gets their butt handed to them as often as we do.  You may as well implement standard enchanter equipment as a robe with a bullseye on it.  If you think playing an enchanter is all smiles and giggles...TRY IT.  You will learn many interesting and unique ways to die horribly, and surprise surprise, most of them won't be your fault.  But thems the breaks.<P>Now, with that said here are some things that need to be looked at.<P>Resist rates in Velious...oh my lord, this is bad.  Tashan does nothing here, its like slapping at a tank with a hanky.  I just can't get my spells to stick with any kind of predictability.  Granted I don't have Uber eqiupment, but i'm not wearing rags either..how bout some help here?<P>Enchanting Items.   Yes I know you've heard this alot Absor, but I really can't feel pity for you since we've been asking for them for TWO YEARS!  <P>The mana tap line of spells.  This is a great implementation and adds some spice to the enchanters life.  I think this line should have been implemented like the Necro's life tap dot.  Throughout our whole career with it being upgraded all along.<P><BR>Matriach</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
