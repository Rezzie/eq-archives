</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;"Nothing seems to match up to the cards per sae .. but you can see many of the NPC's on the Link I gave above to judge for yourself. Also there are some named "NUMBER" npc ... 0,1,2,3 in chest room, 8 and 9 in garden and "86" in sideways pool room. For some reason I thought I also saw 7 somewhere, not sure."<P>86 could be interesting. I believe 86'ing something is a military term that means to "get rid of it". My father is an ex Vietnam vet and I remember as a kid asking what I should do with [x].<P>If the answer was "86 it" it meant chuck it away.<P>Dunno if this helps..<P>Afa<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My first suggestion is getting someone up there that can speak Thieves Cant.  You mentioned getting killed and then Rezzed back there.  Maybe next time that happens, you can learn TC before you get Rezzed back?  (I'm thinking of a disscussion that changes languages every responce now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> )<P>Also, it looks like you are thinking that this zone may have something to do with out-of-character topics.  (I don't know, I have no real idea what they say up there)  Most of the time that kind of stuff is said in EQ, it's via /shout or /ooc or /auction.  Have you tried those?  If they respond to something like that, you still won't hear them unless you are within /say distance, so you could easily miss it...<P>Has anyone tried HEALING spells on anything up there?  Or buff type spells?<P>Anyone ever try training to BB the puppet he's asking about (if you can)?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some very good ideas .. 8-)<P>Thanks. The pause I had to move to 20, but it works great and will save me a ton of time testing words and phrases. I have not tried to heal any NPC's but will tomorrow. Also I think the Thieves Cant was tried on all NPC's with Itzlegend guild on thier last raid .. but I will check to make sure. <P>Begging doesnt seem to have any effect on the main NPC's, but I will continue this as well.<P>Im up to "L" counting backwards from "Z" to "A" on a test of words using say to the Fenj NPC. I have 87,850 total words Im trying ... taken 3 days straight so far .. Im about half way through the words I added to my socials. So far only "yes" and "no" ellicit a response .. but Im hoping to get something ...<P>I will learn thieves cant next time I die .. just to try that direction as well.<P>Thanks again .. I will post when anything works 8-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The puppet he's missing is Cazic Thule.

The quest you mentioned above about the realm of heroes i doubt is related, because its new.<P>Fenj i doubt has a quest, considering if you look at his text it works like this.<P>Hail Fenj<BR>Fenj says, do you have something for me?<BR>Yes<BR>Then give it to me!<BR>Give what<BR>Give what you took from me!<P>If you replace yes with No he'll say, THEN DIE!

People suggested asking about kings court due to it being BB's prefferance as stated in the manual. No leads there.<P><BR>Basicly what i think its coming down to is we're either going to have to kill the numbered mobs in a special order, give them cards in a special order or talk to them in a special order.<P>Im not sure, i rebound today and i doubt we'll be going back to PoM unless we get word that its fixed due to the amount of effort it takes, so good luck.<P>Sepnir the Gnome of Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My guess how this will work out right now.<P>Some mob must be given cards in a special order. This will spawn the cazic thule puppet, when the puppet spawns, bristlebane will stay instead of leaving and will then proceed to give you a quest, when you then talk to npc's around the zone with special lines, they will repop in new forms most likely, and will continue the quest. <P>Atleast thats a guess, btw whats your guilds url iron....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think Irontaail would allready have solved it, if it could be done by the honorable monk.<P>Of course I would like to be able to participate in the exploring myself too, but...<P>How about making the PoM stage 1, or whatever the place should be called where Irontaail is adventuring at the moment, accessable by anyone? Then if the 'real' plane is somehow revieled via a quest (or the entrance whatever), then have it have the usual level restrictions etc.<P>Give the adventurers (and those who love quest and puzzles) chance work this one out together. <BR>Please?<P>Good luck Irontail!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the info Sepnir-Gnome-Monk,<P>Im glad you were able to get the puppet strings to BB. Bummer, I was sort of hoping that one would have worked. It sounded like a real good thought.<P>Im not to confident on the giving the cards in a numbered order, but always trying to keep an open mind. The reason is that NORMALLY, if an npc can use something, he will eat it ... ie if you give an NPC water, a no-drop item, a sword and a quest item that he can use in any form ... then kill im you'll find the water and sword on him. NPC's eat any part of a quest item you you give them that they can use and any no-drop items. This also means that is you give them someone else's quest item that they will not eat it, unless it's no-drop. Since we've given all the cards we could find to every numbered NPC in the zone (hehe .. I forgot about number "5") and they dont eat them ... it means that they cant use them at all. Even if it were ment to b a number sequece ... who ever the first number was would have eaten at least 1 card.<P>Sepnir-Gnome-Monk did you try giving cards to BB? btw how did you get BB to hang around long enough to trade with him? or did you just hand in fast and he despawned?<P>You mentioned that every room was accesable? .. did you get in behind the other doors from the main hall (other then the east one) or the door at the begining of the castle where the 2 skunk gaurds are?<P>Thanks again,<P>Im very happy to share information and glad to see others who have gotten here also do so 8-)<P>Sepnir-Gnome-Monk a few ppl were asking me how many times it took you guys to get up there the second time? I didnt have an answer if you wanted to answer that. Also the method we are using now is a monk and rez stick, dragging a COH Mage body. The cast rez on the mage and then drag him does not seem to work for us, the mage gets rezzed to where the spell was cast, not where his body was dragged? Also we took the right side of the wall route ... what route in ToV did your team take?<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sepnir-Gnome-Monk  ... also what 2 pictures did you find that move? what room was it? I ran back into all the rooms I could think of that matched your description and didnt find any moving? Im thinking I know them, but Ive been concentrating so much on Fenj, I ran back to verify and didnt find them. Are you talking about the main treasure chest room with the 4 doors? the hall past the "my right hand" guy? or the treasure room behind that? or the theatre?<P>Oh well .. I always try to follow up on leads, and this sounded new .. hehe. Also I have not been able to verify, but I think there might be a level between the floors and the maze down below. As you fall you sometimes get stuck on a lip and it almost appears as though there might b a door or passageway somehow between floors .. but alas I tried for 4 hours one night to find it and I no longer have lev .. haha. So I still have to transverse that huge maze everytime ... even with Itsledgend's map .. it takes a few minutes. 8-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really wish I could be in the plane to check it out.  I envy you and also sympathize with what frustration I know you must feel.<P>A couple of suggestions:<P>Has someone cast identify on the cards?  If so, what did you get?<P>Did you try having a rogue pickpocket the sphinx who asks about stuff that was stolen?<P>Have you looked for any kind of container with a 'combine' button?  If the cards are indeed like 'words' maybe they combine to make something if you have the right container.<P>Good luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Im of the hopes that it is a container type quest given by the Sphinx, that we just have not figured out how to activate yet. Even though I think that PoM is self contained as far as quests go, and I believe that PoM was working b4 the latest patch as Ester seemed to elude to, I am going to get every type of gem I can think of and hand it into the Fenj ... sort of along the lines of what "Quickfingers" did.<P>As far as Identify ... I dont have the spell as a monk, but I was told by others that they were identified simply as thier named implied ... ie Red Squire=Red Squire.<P>The Sphinx is also to high lvl to PP, the group from Lanys tried it and also on Bristlebane as well, with the same result that the lvl of the NPC was to high 8-( </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>after readin gall this and the thread on the sfaehouse i have come up with 3 ideas that you may or may not have tried ....<P>1) somewhere on thsi thread there was talk of rules of kings court wehre u had to have kings in the corners etc ... I would say give king cards to the ones in the corners  or whatver that thread implied you have probably already tried this (like all 4 kinsg to one guy in the corner or 1 king card to the guy in each croner athe frouth card casues *something* to happen)<BR>((**please read the rules agin im just kind of remmebreing from teh thread not sure it was on like page2 of this thread****))<P>2) have you tried the pharse "maybe" as an answer to the sphinx who asked if you took something from it ? <P>3) giove a card to the 86 mob then do an "inventory" of the mobs in the zone did any despawn ? or maybe if the 86 mob has a card on it when the puppets spawn one of them will not spawn or something will change ... just a guess ... seems like you can always kill 86 later to get the cards back<P><BR>hope one of these helps you have put in alot of time and would be nice to see you rewarded in some way ... good luck </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This can be done by killing lots and lots of either giants or dorfs ... but dont kill any dragons on that faction. The good news is that if you get good faction, you can test it by conning Wushi in Waking Lands ... but be warned not to get close as she will kill even lvl 60's very fast.

</FONT><HR>I am currently in PoM on Terris-Thule, and have been exploring for the last week or so. I still cannot get past the door at the end of the hallway where Life/Willy roam. One of these days...<P>The placement of the numbered NPCs is just quite odd. You have Zero One Two Three in the main room, blue to 59. Five is a trap-like thing near Chuckles which you cannot target. 86 is in the side-ways pool room, yellow to 59. Eight and Nine in Garden, blue. 22 at the end of Small-Large, the most oddly placed number of them all, yellow to 59.<P>22 is extremely odd and sticks out in my mind. There are multiple mirrored sections, going from Rivervale/Ak'Anon size to Kael sized. Same NPCs in all the sections, except at the very end we see 22.<P>I've wondered if the cards are given values, and you must give the cards in a way so that they add up to the NPC you give them to. It would be reasonable with everything but 86. <P>Another thing I noted after the server up was the halflings in the main room. The first time I saw the room, it was empty aside from the Treasure Chest and 0, 1, 2, 3. Then I set off exploring, 45 minutes later the room was full of halflings in front of Bristlebane's pictures. Now after the server went down, they are gone again.<P>Also of note, you say Bristlebane only stays up for five or so seconds... On Terris he is up for at least 10 seconds, I'm easily able to ask/give him things. I'd toss cards around like candy, however our Paladin left out of frustration the first day. Two mages, wizard and druid and myself, a warrior, I'm very reluctant to attack anything. The casters are bound up there, however I am not and fully geared. We're just holding on to the few cards we got a week ago, hoping the few of us up there can figure something out without randomly turning cards in.<P>I see very few choices at this point as to what this zone is for:<P>VI has confirmed more or less the cards are intentional drops and used for something<P>Potential quest mobs: <BR>Numbers<BR>Bristlebane<BR>Stallions<BR>Ferjeneror<BR>Puppets (? I've yet to find them on Terris after a week and about 70 hours in the zone...)<P>The apes are somewhat curious, but I doubt quest related. The ogre (Donk) is somewhat odd... Dubious to myself. Halflings in theatre are amiable, Bit/Mizer Chest in courtyard scowl, Chestnut (Believe it's Chestnut) is Dubious, the three halflings with bows apprehensive... About the only factions I recall off the top of my head.<P>I'd narrow it down to numbers and Ferjeneror. The numbers are quite an oddity throughout the zone. Five is bugged/a trap/non-existant... Maybe it means something? Any card games where fives are special? 22 is one over black jack... So, so frustrating when you miss so much while up there, even worse without a cleric/paladin/res stick. Hopefully we will find something eventually.<P>I'll try asking Bristlebane a few things about card games/stolen item and whatnot in thieves cant. Warrior, but I managed to get Thieves Cant up to excellent somehow.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Good luck Irontaail, you certainly have dedicated a large amount of time to solving this puzzle.<P>Coladar Shirlmanson<BR>Warrior of the 59th Blade, Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I might be mistaken about the 5 seconds .. I didnt time it .. it could be ten seconds.<P>Im glad to hear confirmation about the Thieves Cant trials ... I was looking for someone to say yes they confirmed they tried it.<P>The puppets spawn just behind the curtain, behind Chuckles the great, the dancing rat on stage at about 8am every game day and despawn at about 9:15 am when Bristlebane does. Ive seen pictures of the puppets out in the forest, but not sure how ppl got them there. If you are fighting one they disappear at the appropriate time. I have not tried to have someone charm them, maybe that is how ppl got them to stay.<P>Has anyone else tried fishing?<P>Many ppl always ask me how to get there, alas I was not the one who actually did the ToV run to the lil house, so if someone who actually did the run wants to post exactly what thier route was, Im sure ppl would appreciate it ... if not I'll get the guy who did our run or Itzlegend to post his path up.<P>Also an interesting note about Donk and 86. They both only hit for 1-4 damage .... Im not sure what this suggests, but most other NPC's in the zone hit for about what you would expect of blu-red NPCs, except Bristlebane .. who although he had est 500k hp, only hit for 150's if I remember correct.<P>Also I didnt count the number 5 as an NPC, cause I dont think he exists .. when he hits you his actuall damage seems to add to 5 .. ie. hits you for 1 and then 4, then 2 and 3, then 5 and no second attack. He also does not seem to b targetable, per sae .. again others may have differing opionions on this .. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a post from Cassiel from Triton on our guild board ... Im sure he wont mind me coping it to here, as it also has some interesting ideas ...<P>*******<P>We got a good thing going on the EQ Boards with PoM. People from a few different servers are putting their 2 cents in. There's also a major campaign going on the Lanys server. They seem to be spending quite a bit of time in PoM trying to solve the puzzles.<P>Whether or not we can believe what Esther says, by all accounts, PoM is indeed finished.<P>It's a puzzle zone and can't be solved by one person alone. Well maybe it could be.... but nonetheless, I think we need to get more people up there to take a whack at it.<P>Here's a couple things I thought of:<P>1. Maybe there is an invisible mob that you can trade with? In Kael there is a mob called something like 'a supplies storehouse'. You have to blow it up by giving it a bag of sulfur and herbs. You can't see it, only way to know it's there is by having the bags in your hand and clicking on the area it's in.<P>2. Maybe there's something on the ground that was missed?<P>3. Maybe you need more than one person to unlock parts of the zone? I heard that some of the paintings are moveable.<P>4. Maybe the Tunarean Courts quest is a stepping stone? I'm beginning to doubt this more and more personally.... but it's something at least.<P>Regardless, I'd love to be able to get in there and take a crack at this zone. Perhaps Irontail, you need a fresh pair of eyes to try things.<P>I'm definately not going to give up on this and could use all the help I can. We gotta get in here and solve this thing!!!<P>Oh yeah, one more thing. Esther gave a little bit away in one of her responses.....<P>She said that she made sure the zone was working properly and it took a whole night to go through it.<P>To me it sounds like it's a big puzzle and each part has to be unlocked to get to the next one.<P>I'm also almost certain that a rogue is needed here. At some point, if not most of the points.<P>*****<P>Thanks Cassiel ... I just thought your ideas were worth noting to the PoM ppl, to spark some more testing 8-)<P>Oh and someone asked where the best place is to see what has been tried and where the best PoM thread is ... hehe. It's right here. I added all the links a few posts ago as to the NPC's and the Safehouse posts as well, including maps, etc.<P>8-)<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056688&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056688&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
