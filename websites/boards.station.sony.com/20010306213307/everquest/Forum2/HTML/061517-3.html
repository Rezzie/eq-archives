</FONT><HR>Straithlin.. they would get away with it in a court of law.<P>Why?<P>Because they have the RULES wrtiiin in thier CONTRCT/Terms and Conditions... remember everytime you load up EQ and there's that anyone window that you have to click the AGREE button?<P>Do that and you AGREE to uphold the policies described.. you see so many of us take FRAUD as everyday life and AGREE to contracts wothout EVER reading them.. under the belief that they will not apply to us..<BR>Or that we won't get caught.<P>PC software is SO easily Hackable and to Copy. Hardly ANY ppl BUY games any more or software.. I'd say 45% of the worlds population running Win98 only have licences because they're a Business and NEED one.<P>The rest of us will quite easily COPY Win98 for our freind, and think nothing of it.<P>In a similar fasion will enter agreements, someone in a shop shows you a higher-purchase aggreement and puts X's where you should sign... what do you do?<P>Sit for 1 hour 23 minutse 45 seconds readin the 10 pages and collating the date to see how it can benefit you?<P>NO... you sign and say fine.<P>SAME HERE... you click AGREE without EVER reading it, or believeing that you only have to click it to get into the game.<P>WRONG.. you have stated that you will abide by the RULE OF CONDUCT.<P>As Tyron states your account is monitored flagged and then reviewed.<BR>Now YOU say that the wishy-washy GM 'threat' was just an excuse... however as we discussed on the other TWO threads.. that you haven't read... we don't know what else hapend... we BELIEVE that FURTHER TRANSGRETIONS took place.... Colla never told us about any E-Mails or posted them.<P>Most of us can see the LOG.. but Colla posted it..<BR>Most of us can see his attitude.. and Colla posted that.<BR>What if that's the BEST bit?<BR>What about the other E-Mails.. the GM suspended him for 7-10 Days.<BR>If Colla had sat back and had a wank in that time.. he could have come back to Rodcet Nife a week later - No Questions ASKED.<BR>Why then did someone decide to BAN him... AGAIN on the OTHER thread he says he got told to stop E-Mail SPAMMING. Did he send just a few E-Mails like he says?<BR>I (ME-MHO etc.) that he then mailed verant with abuse, allegations, threats of lawsuits, told Sony that thier mother was a hamster and that thier father smelt of elderberries... THEN they decided.<P>then...<P>an verant employee says, 'Hey you remember that twat that worked in admissions?'<BR>a verant employee says, 'What that idiot who  kept buying new Gerbils evey week and always walked around scrathing his rectum?'<BR>an verant employee says, 'Yeah that twat.. well he said that we smell!'<BR>a verant employee says, 'Tell him to stop spamming and give him a warning'<BR>an verant employee says, 'Oh.. it says here that he's had warnings and he's been banned before'<BR>a verant employee says, 'hmm... what's the first line of his first E-Mail read?'<BR>an verant employee says, 'erm...

It's his job, and I'm very glad that the ppl at Verant are THAT commited and won't be bribed, threatened or corrupted by ANYONE. They have the rules, it's upto US to abide by them... click AGREE and you have no excuse to run amok... nor can you start to complain that they should'nt exist as WE pay for it.... if you don't like the terms, go play another game... unfortunately... as I said... we are not accostomed to terms being enforced... we get away with things ALL the time and nobody bats an eye lid...<P>so when someone does actually DO THIER JOB correctly, loads of you all scream and si there with'Err? what's going on there?' look slapped all over your Chevy Chases. Corruption is rife in your culture and mine and we don't like it when the RULES catch us.<P>So if you want to avoid the RULES... don't AGREE that you will follow them...

</FONT><HR>&gt; I'd answer that he's saying he will Personally<BR>&gt; take the matter to a higher level in an attempt <BR>&gt; to reprimand the GM in question for not doing <BR>&gt; his job.

The customer is alays wrong, or at least thats what you tell the customer. Then behind closed doors you tell the CS rep or Tech rep how they should have handled the situation differently, for the future. Unless its something SOOOOO far out there that no matter what perspective you look at it from, you cant see how the CS or Tech rep was right, they'll back that person up 100%, in public. <BR>Just my opinion, just what it looks like to me, but who knows, I might be smoking hampster food.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another point:<P>The player clearly stated that the rules shouldn't be in place at all, and that he/she was justified in cheating. While it (according to the information provided) was not intentionally a scam, it turned into one. If i give you 5.3k for an item.. you have an OBLIGATION to get me that item. "What if someone else picked it up?" No one else did. What if the game glitched and erased his item and gave you yours back but not his money? YOU STILL OWE HIM THE ITEM.<BR>TANGENT&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>What if the roles were reversed? I believe you would go to great lengths to regain the item.. all the while shouting "foul play".<BR>TANGENT&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Basically you as much as admitted that you would break the rules so long as you were not caught at it or penalized. You deserve a banning no matter the circumstances. End of story.<P>H.C.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1.  When I sell something, as soon as they complete the trade, my committment is complete.  If he does not have the sense to clear a spot it is his fault.  If you dont have an empty slot when doing an epic step, they dont refund your epic peices.<P>2.  If i find a wurmslayer laying on the ground, it it mine????  Yep<P>3.  Would I take that course of action?  no, but not everyone is as wonderful as me *grins cheesily*<P>4.  That was not a threat.  I guess your masculinity was threatened, so you said you have no idea who you are dealing with, but that is not a threat.  A threat as part of it's definition has to have a compelling reason to be believed.  If I say I am gonna nuke Russia, that is not a threat according to the definition.<P>5.  Was it stupid?  he already admitted it was, but if they ban him for being dumb, they have to ban the guy that dropped the wurmslayer for being dumb.<P>Keabler<BR>53 Pathfinder<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, let me retype what I just said so you can understand what I meant Weesheewuz.<P><BR>- - -<BR>And besides, I don't want to have a moron in my group JUST BECAUSE he says he has a Wurmslayer.<BR>- - -<P><BR>With this, I give you an example.<P>This person offers to group with me for a couple of levels. He says he is having a hard time killing mobs fast enough. We are the same level -- let's say 18. He says he has two fighting batons he just recently acquired and adds he's in full crescent. He's a monk btw, both of us are.<P>So, I say sure. And asks him to pull something while I heal up after the last fight I was doing solo.<P>I get up, and I see him fighting a high red.. I of course do /assist. The battle was going on for like 3 minutes and I ask him why he pulls such a red, and he says, I have two batons, we can take it.<P><BR>Funilly enough, he just recently acquired the batons and pretty much sucked at 1hblunt...<P><BR>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ...<P><BR>That's what I mean. Just because someone like 'Jumlace' has a very good weapon and you think to yourself "oh, he must be pretty good to acquire such an item" doesn't mean he knows the deal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Being that this is the court of public opinion, guilty until proven innocent of vice versa doesn't really apply. The guy had already established himself as being dishonest, so I have no inclination to believe much of what he had to say. Since much of the log transcript is unflattering, it may indeed be true. That doesn't mean anything else is. We don't know that he really warned the Jumlace to have a free inventory slot. Jumlace may have made an honest mistake, and simply not have known that Wurmslayer wouldn't fit in a bag. In no case are the actions of Colla. Taking the Wurmslayer was quite simply dishonest. That was strike one. (Giving him the benefit of the doubt and assuming he had no previous strikes against him.)<P>Colla then exhibited disdain for the actions of the GM. In true courtrooms, a judge will consider the remorse (or lack thereof) of the defendent in sentencing. That's strike two.<P>Now as the situation wore on, Colla made statements which can be reasonably considered veiled threats. Not threats of bodily harm, but nevertheless, his statements can be construed as threatening to the welfare of the GM. He followed these threats up with only slightly veiled insult directed at said GM. Strike Three.<P>The suspension in my opinion, was clearly justified. We have no account as to what communication there was prior to the actual banning, so it's not really fair to comment on it. If I were a betting man, I'd say it was a similar exchange to that with the GM in game. In which case I'd say the banning was completely justified.<P>On a final note, there is the possibility that the entire series of events is completely fabricated, and even that no such players as Colla, Jumlace or the GM exist at all, outside of some account holders imagination.<P>On a real life note, I'd like to see a case like this go to court. I can only imagine the amusement of watching some pompous jerk be slapped with a contempt of court charge for filing a frivolous lawsuit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
