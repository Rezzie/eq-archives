So now they can both track AND see invis.<P>Give rogues a tracking skill or make "hide" different from "invisible".

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<P>I would want to play PvP on a server that is free for all PvP (like Rallos Zek) but COIN only loot.<P>Would this be possible?<P>Also I think that melees are disadvantaged even in coin only loot system PvP because of binding. If a melee and caster engage in PvP, the melee can have to run up to 4 zones to get his corpse, as opposed to the casters' one. If this were equalized I would love to play PvP</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>here's an idea for rallos, even though i play on vallon. how about every 10 levels you gain the ability to make one of your invantory slots unlootable. by level 60 you have 6 slots you can make immune to looting, but by that time it won't be such an issue because of all the no drop armor available. make the spots redefinable too. like... /noloot1 chest /noloot2 head etc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If Absor is still reading this far down...<P>My point of view is as a melee (56 warrior) on Rallos.<P>From the melee point of view the problems in EQ PvP are LOS and lag exploits. With those fixed I wouldn't have a problem removing the DD damage nerf (especially if coupled to a 51% to loot rule). Unresistable DoTs are a major problem with egg shaped pumice gone from the game. The cast time is too long for classes with 0 channeling.<P>LOS exploits- you don't need LOS to cast on players and players can't home in on you like mobs can. Nuff said.<P>Lag exploits- others have mentioned this, it's especially bad in regards to the z-axis, but basically it is nigh impossible to hit someone running directly away from you and very easy to lose someone by exploiting lag. As far as melee combat is concerned a few potential ways to address the problem would be to increase the range you can melee from and/or loosen the LOS restrictions for when you can't see your target. Alternately (or in tandem) you could make melee attaacks work similarly to the way archery does now, in that if you attack a target that you can't hit you don't loose the attack for the cycle. So on the server side you do all the checking for range and LOS, then you check if the delay requirement of the weapon has passed, and if that all checks out then the attack occurs. So basically you don't have to time your auto-attack and you wouldn't waste sequences trying to guess when you are or aren't in range. That's do a lot for melee vs caster fights.<P>/wave Gsam and Aurore<P>Oh and Arkons the only class that gets a significant buff to any resist is warriors and that is to magic and is +1 per 2 levels (+30 at level 60). The other classes get like flat +8 or 10 to random resists- not going to factor into any high resist situations very heavily.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Give us a break Absor.<P>This is way too little way too late.<P>Go talk to Abashi.  We gave him enough input on this topic to fill the Library of Congress.  We also gave it to him 3 or 4 times over, because he always seemed to convieniently forget everything and play dumb(AFTER deleting the threads or the board dedicated to PvP).<P>BTW, nothing you do now could ever remove the disdain I have for Verant, due to the treatment of the PvP community up to this point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since the implementation of 'no loot' on the Teams-PVP servers, casters such as wizards, mages, enchanters, and shaman have been severly nerfed.  This happened due to players wearing their expensive resist gear that they normally wouldn't, had it been a loot server.<P>Please consider changing casters spell damage back to 100% again on the PVP servers.  This change was made to the PVP servers BEFORE the no  loot patch was put in, and it has no place anymore on them.  With players having no fear of equipment loss, many have over 100 resist in key areas, making it hard, if not impossible for them to be killed by the spell casters mentioned above.<P>Speaking of resists, another order would be to make necromancer spells such as splurt and druid spells such as winged death resistable.  Nothing is worse than having to fight a druid or necromancer who casts winged death or splurt on you, then runs away until you dispell it, then repeats the process.  It is a really irritating experience when you unload your all your mana on an even fight necromancer who just keeps chain castings his 99.9% UNRESISTABLE life taps on you.  Make spells such as these have a resist check like they should.<P>Last but not least, for the love of god, hard code the team-PVP servers.  These servers were originally intended to be every team by itself.  People came from other servers with this notion, and that is the way they servers are set up to be played.  Now they are anything but.  As stated in numerous other posts by many other players, invulnerable healing is the biggest exploit that needs to be addressed.  If the servers were hard coded so you could not buff/group/guild with members of the other teams, this would solve the problem.<P>Thanks for your time and please take into consideration some of these changes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry for double post. Just noticed a couple things I missed.<P>8 level limit. Yes, only lower levels complain, but that is because lower levels cannot kill someone 8 levels above them. Once a person gets to post 50 (usually before) they make other characters anyway. Who plays a level 60 and stays on that character?<BR>solution : Make the PK go just like the blue cons go. <BR>1-8 = 2 levels +/-<BR>9-16 = 3 levels +/-<BR>17-24 = 4 levels +/-<BR>25-34 = 5 levels +/-<BR>35-44 = 6 levels +/-<BR>45-53 = 7 levels +/-<BR>54-60 = 8 levels +/-<P>Teams + classes.<BR>The evil team not only has no rangers to track, but also has no bards, druids (no big loss), or paladins.<BR>And this is NOT made up by having three races that have shaman compared to only barbs being shaman either.<BR>I play a DE because my friend IC and IRL all play evil. Otherwise, my main lineup would be lighty just because of the classes. With this being a PvE server, just the fact that lighties get more classes negates the ability to role-play the server basis.<BR>Lighties do quests easier because they have rangers to track that rare wandering spawn (Hasten bootstrutter for one), and Dark Elves have to enlist the help of a lightie (against server basis) or wander around for an unrealistically longer amount of time looking for the spawns.<BR>LoH can make a huge difference in a fight. Especially PvP fights. So a lightie group could instantly have the advantange with a bard's healing and buff songs, plus LoH and the DD's, DoTs, healing, pets, and damage shields of a druid. For the evil team to effectively make up for one druid, we need a mage, and a cleric in the group. That's 2 to 1. And a shaman does not, in any way, make up for a druid. There are still the damage shields and DDs and snares to make up for. Not to mention invis...<P>In essence, because of the way the server is, the evil races are at a severe disadvantage just because of the PvE aspect. Since that isn't going to be changed any time soon due to coding, I suggest introducing new classes to both the light and dark teams. This would not only fix this problem, but would also give great opportunity for new quests.<P>Couple last ditch ideas on location...<BR>DE bards .. The Warrior guild has merchants on top floor that are useless in all regards. They can be relocated without harm. Put the bards up there.<BR>DE paladins - Cleric guild. There are a couple empty rooms. Namely the one across from the coffin merchant...<BR>DE druids - Clear out the bottom floor of the library. Throw those merchants where the belong, in the caster guild in commons.<BR>Iksar rangers - Sorry, don't play Kunark until I upgrade this computer. No ideas here.<BR>Troll Clerics - Y'know the first turn in Grobb, with the three merchants? Kick them out, put them down from the weapons store, and put the druids in there. Their WIS is high enough to play shaman...<BR>Ogre rogues - Compress the shaman guild just a bit, and put the rogues in there. As it stands, the only difference between ogre and trolls are stats, regen, and stun resist. Barb rogues with yer uber strength, meet the ogre idiots with their uber strength.<BR>Wood Elf shaman - Near POD lift there is an old INN, that is accompanied by all the other merchants and few other inns. Put the shaman in there. Give them shaman on that side of the continent.<BR>High Elf necromancer - Can't say where to put them. I hate playing a High Elf being that white. Blech.<BR>Never played a gnome or any other shorty. Dunno if there are Gnome SKs, but considering they have necros, why not SKs? And it's not any more ridiculous than a gnome warrior or half elf rogue. No idea on placement. Hate that puny city.<P>Yes, I am partial on the Evils, but that's because they need the most classes. EQ was based on group participation, faction, and graphics, not on PvP. So why not give us one programmer to focus only on PvP to at least make the aspect viable. Given, it wasn't intended in the beginning, but it has become an integral part of EQ to many of us (at least 5k of us).<BR>Throw me a frickin' bone here, Verant. =)<P>Vallon Zek person.<BR>Names in above post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I would first like to say that much of the core issues that need to be addressed for Team-PvP servers do not need to be addressed for Rallos-Zek.  You should probably have created two distinct threads to discuss the different issues unique to each.  Each population has its own ideas about what is acceptable from a PvP standpoint - which is ok.  But, just don't lump them together.<P>My issues are related strictly to Team PvP servers (My main is on Vallon-Zek):<P>1.  Cross-teaming, faction and healing problems.  Faction on the team PvP server starts on the Good vs. Evil standpoint, and immediately throws off the idea of pure team play.  Team faction should be set up from the start just as it is for the dark team, *between* the light teams, i.e. as an elf I should not be able to walk into Kaladim; a dwarf should not be able to walk freely into Felwithe; a human Ak'Anon etc.  This may be a problem from the questing standpoint - but how does the dark team get around the problem now, and would that be any different for the light teams?  People would be less likely to cuss you out because you killed thier dwarf friend (as both of you are elfs) and the conflicts would be resovable via PvP instead of /petition in most cases.<P>Related to this is the current ability to cross-team heal.  This has been used by players who come to the server and want to play Good vs. Evil, against the basic premise of the 4-team server.  Some have taken it to grief levels - I have seen a level 8 gnome being healed by a level 55 wood elf druid cutting down young elfs in the newbie areas at Kelethin and Felwithe.  All of the people(elfs) I could gather that were in the 8 level range of the gnome were not able to kill him - and we were not able to attack the wood-elf traitor because of the team structure.  The gnome was essentially immortal, and frustrated many low level players who experienced this for the first time.  Elimenate this loop-hole to make the team servers function as intended.<P>2.  The GMs need to have a more consistent view of the rules of the Team PvP server.  Issues that are currently handled on an informal basis such as 'loot and scoot' (LnS), 'bind rushing', corpse run etiquette, proper uses of /ooc and /shout etc. need to be solidified and published for the team server populations, and *firmly* acted upon when violated.  This will elimenate much of the argumentation and /petition'ing that goes on now.  This will make the already swamped GMs job managable, and the level of customer service better from the customer's standpoint.<P>3.  There are many PvPers who would prefer to play a Good vs. Evil game.  For these players I would recommend another server (or conversion of one of the team servers) to a 2 team server.  This server would be coin loot.  So that we end up with 1 pure PvP server with 1 item loot(Rallos-Zek), a 4 team PvP server, and a 2 team PvP server.  I would allow /move between the 4 team and the 2 team servers if one of our current 4 team servers is converted.  No /move allowed if the new 2 team server is not a conversion from a 4 team server.<P>I feel that if these items were addressed, PvP on team servers would be a much more enjoyable experience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>Sorry for posting again!<P>...But another point I've read about...uber guards!I heard that solution of making em like level 5 or something so high levels don't kill them for exp.  <BR>Becauseause these guards are uber and do take the fun out of raiding cities.  (And you SURE don't want to be near one if you are in pvp...less you are running away..and even then a person can range gank you).<P>A change to dot might be unfair.<P>As a necromancer I can tell you we have no other way of really killing people but with our dots (and it takes a long time at that) because ignite bones is uber resisted and does less than 2 bubbles of hp damage on a 50+ *caster*.  Yes lifetap is nice, but won't cut the cake when it takes six seconds to cast 66% dmg of a low damage high mana spell (even with the low casting one you get at 54)  Pets are fun but 1 root or 1 snare does em in and they do 66% dmg.<P>  Splurt in pvp does 1200 dmg, but it takes 1 minute and half (officially a lifetime if you ever been in a pvp situation other than tot). <P> And well, there is no other way of putting it...winged death is a nasty nasty dot makes splurt look like crap  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  But!  Despite such uber spells as winged death it can be canceled which makes it balanced methinks (I've been killed by winged death many times due to forgeting to cancel it).  Even with the removal of the uber pumice you can cancel it quite easily (splurt or winged death).  BUT, the time factor in pvp is a must, your enemy will be very dead in the minute and a half it takes splurt to work regardless, although winged death is pretty quick (30 sec?), unless he/she runs away or gates away from you.  Also, splurt increases damage as it goes on (I think never self tested it.. only on others) which means in pvp it is less effective then people think since as I said people are dead quite quickly or run away and can cancel.<P>Also remember my uber 49 necro pet hits YOU for 33 points of damage!

</FONT><HR>I am not even gonna read the 5 pages of issues above me and i am just gonna post some usefull points of mine own.<P>1.) Crossteaming is ruining the high level game on TZ because of Pandemonium... ( a bluebie team that cross teams now so that they can do some of the harder stuff in the game, AND they activly pVp more often then most other  guilds. And i can applaude them for that. But most ppl would rather play Light Vs dark on TZ like me. <BR>2.) BUT who was the first guild to take down trak for the first time? Pandemonium so it is working congrats to them. YEA we wo are not x teaming dont have the organization to kill high uber mobs like trak (btw it was the dark team that killed trak)<BR>3.) I dont want teams hardcoded in. Why? Cause i have a IRL friend that i group with very often who is a wood elf, and i am a erudite, and it would ruin my game if i cant do a thing with him any more, maybe if the person is on my friends list and grouped with me THEN i should be able to buff and heal him. AND if i am killing a dark cause i am so uber at killing  LOL and some higher level mob comes along and starts beating on him as well i can do 3 things <BR>let him die and get exp'd,<BR>Heal him and temporarily become his friend cause exp deaths suck even if it is a darkie/enemy<BR>Let the mob work him down and then cast my 501 cleric dd on him to take the kill shot and finish him off, so that he doesnt get experienced.<P>So there are times when cross teaming can be nessesary, and there are times when it ruins other peoples fun, like when you get out of range healers, or cross teaming.<P>The best option i can think of is only being able to heal or buff when you are grouped with the person and have gotten party experience at least once in any zone. This prevents (eek) powerleveling which is something i would do to help my friends, cause i dont get exp in blackburrow at lvl 45, it also prevents cross teaming until you have killed something and you have to be in the same exp range to do it too.<P>Volred Akratos 45th Cleric<BR>Tallon Zek - PvP'r<BR>Rip the System</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You can have maxed sv fire or cold and a lure will still do full damage, not exactly a balanced system for pvp.<P>For all the complaints about Necro and Druid dots, at least if I'm ready I can for no mana just pumice a 400 mana dot off or run away.

</FONT><HR>PLEASE, review the loot rules on team servers. PKers bring NO money with them and have no chance for loss while the unsuspecting victims have nothing to gain and all their money to lose. Much like when item loot was in, the Pkers themselves are exposed to no risk.<P>A proposed solution would be to perhaps have a SET amount of money on a corpse which is extracted from the bank account. Perhaps 5 silver per level is automatically set on your corpse when PKd to be looted by whomever killed you. That way, a broke level 10 would still only lose 5 gold and a level 50 only loses 2.5 pp. This way everyone has something to lose in every PvP situation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The biggest issue right now on VZ is immortal healing and buffing. What is supposed to be done about a lvl 50 human druid, thorning and healing a lvl 25 elf against a pure team human guild? It's ridiculous, but it's not against the rules so it will be done. Even if there were rules against it gm's would never be there in time to issue a warning. I think members of opposing teams should not be allowed to heal or buff eachother, it's a 4-team server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please do NOT change TZ to GvE (or LvD). This is supposed to be a 4 teams server. It has been that way since I created my first character on TZ almost a year ago. I have seen some of the suggestions of some of the xteamers who wants to change this server to GvE (or light vs dark). I do not think it is fair for me (who has made has made friends and respected enemies on this server) to move to another server because people do not like to play Team vs Team. <P>In case people haven't noticed, on the server selection screen, Tallon Zek has a "Teams" tag, not a "xteamer', "GvE, or "LvD".<P>Now onto the few PvP concerns:<BR>- Delvling is a definate problem. There should be some sort of limit on how much a person can delevel. <BR>- Invulnerable healers (me being a human attacking an elf and a barbarian healing the elf).

</FONT><HR>Why not allow players to make a coveted piece of equpment "no drop"? I'm not suggesting a simple keystroke to do this but perhaps a vendor that would somehow "bind" the object to you making it unlootable or like amror that can be imbued have a spell designed for high level enchanters to be able to provide this service at a cost of an expensive gem.<BR>This process would not be considered by the player lighly. The item would become permanently no drop and therefore could never be traded.<BR>Players on RZ who like item loot would still have an opportunity to loot items while "defensive" PvP players would be offered some solution to actually protect their most coveted gear that they have worked so hard to acquire but ironically, usually have bagged.<BR>An example. Let's say a player had a pair of GEB's, an expensive and not easily attained item, but not no drop. This player could decide to make this item no drop using some sort of system I've suggested above but would probably not do the same thing to "protect" something like, let's say. a Forest Loop.<BR>Doing something like this would put the onus on the player to do something themselves instead of the much more drastic measure of making RZ coin only (which I prefer).<BR>Surely you must admit that the constant mantra of "risk vs reward" that we are constantly reminded of is seriously out of wack with ganking spire/circle/zone pkers. Why doesn't this mantra apply to those players?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, whatever you decide to do about PvP, make sure that you even up the odds between the muderers and the "sheep".  Uber-pk guilds have a clear advantage due to the fact that they are willing to murder when they have a 10 to 1 advantage, they run around in high level resist gear murdering people who are in AC gear trying to fight mobs, and so on.  Basically, it isnt a fair situation because you have one side of the server trying to play PvP the way it is intended(which is a balance of PvE and PvP), and the other side of the server are grief players who seek only to murder, steal items, and cause general grief.  IF ANYTHING is done to Rallos, make it so that revenge against aggressors is more attainable.  Finally, do something about delevelling, and ban the players who consistently violate rules that are already in place but that the GMs are unwilling to consistently enforce.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to start a big round of applause for Absor responding to this post after 5 pages of lengthy reading, bravo.<P>A lot of great stuff here. My concerns, which I listed on the first page of this post, are in regards to cross team benefical spell casting on Vallon/Tallon Zek. There are new design models for this being implemented in Dark Age of Camelot, and it seems there is a large fan base for it too. I only hope that if you do revamp the three servers, that at least one of them gets hard coded teams and no beneficial spell casting across teams. <P>Thanks again for listening Absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>1.) Bring back pumice in some form, buy-able from vendors for same price, replacing the nerfed stuff. I think EVERYONE on the servers believes this is a good idea, and I have NO idea why it was ever changed. It completely unbalanced pvp for melees, err moreso even. Even if it's self only.<P>2.) Unresistable spells! These spells are nearly completely unresistable in pvp. Although I play a druid a lot, here's a list I know of.<P>Swarm series. Has anyone ever resisted winged death? I had an mr of 255 once and didn't resist it from a equal level druid. Not to mention it does half of my health unbuffed at level 54.<P>Lifetap series. same, sk's and necros can hit you with lifetap over and over again with nearly no chance of resist.<P>Splurt. Bane of Death series. Another group of dots that are nearly unresistable. Seriously affecting pvp balance. I've heard of ONE person resisting splurt. That's out of maybe 1000 casts.<P>That's all the unresistable spells I can think of, I'm sure others can list more.<P><BR>Melee disadvantage. The biggest disadvantage Melee'ers have is range. We are incapable of doing damage at range, save for throwing weapons and bows, which are nearly useless. I've run around a zone for nearly an hour trying to kill a druid at low health. She ran to her little hearts content, knowing that she would never be hit. How to fix this? I have a few suggestions.<P>Increase the melee range. You just patched a fix for melee range versus mobs, so I now can safely assume (ack bad word), that you can change it rather easily. Lag is the true problem in these instances, but this is a nice idea. If I could swing twice as far (let mobs swing twice as far as well, wouldn't hurt a thing), then I could hit that druid using lag against me. or any class for that matter. I know I can't be struck down in melee while running, I don't like that, as my main is a warrior. <P>Z axis problems. If a person were to run on top of a hill in south ro (happens very often here), and stand there, I would see them run for a good 2-3 seconds, until I am hit by their spell they were trying to cast. Or maybe they just turned aroudn and walked the other direction completely. If you could fix this problem, it would make PvP much easier to handle in hilly zones like south ro, dreadlands, oasis, lavastorm.<P>In relation to this z axis problem -<BR>The levitating killer. A wizard can be lev'd above me and hit me with all the spells he wants. Is this right? Please let us melee a much higher distance in the z axis, or let us ignore it altogether, it doesn't seem at first glance to have any side-effects on PvE. Also, let bows/throwing weapons, either ignore the z axis, or be allowed to have a MUCH higher angle of usability. As it stands, about 5 degrees is the most you can shoot upward/downward. <P>&lt;insert various illegal act&gt; camping.<BR>Corpse camping, teleport camping, bind camping, zone camping. Sure camping is a part of the game, but not this kind =). A simple SIMPLE fix for these problems, or the majority. Allow after zoning and respawn (which is usually zoning anyways, right?), to have an invulnerability until you MOVE. You can sit, med, mem spells, camp, pick your nose or what have you, but the second you move, you're free game. This would fix the majority of problems of camping, save corpse camping. For this:<P>Corpse camping. This would be a much harder coding problem, more than likely. I can think of several ideas though, although I have no way of telling which would be easier, or if any are viable at all.<P>1.) At a certain range from your corpse you are given that invulnerability, like DA and the invulnerability I discussed above. Within this range, you can loot your corpse, move a LITTLE, but nothing else. As soon as you finish looting your corpse the first time, you lose that invulnerability. This prevents people from leaving 'safe zones' spewn about zones, forcing them to loot to avoid exploitation. <P>2.) Corpse invlun to pvp in entire zone with corpse. Same as above, but allow it to be in the entire zone (to pvp ONLY), with the same way of disabling this invulnerability. This could make raiding difficult at times, and could foreseebly be exploited at times, as the first one. <P>3.) Timer on damage taking/giving to a specific person. If you do pvp damage to a specificly named person, you cannot hit them again, and they cannot hit you again, until they loot their corpse, or a specific timer is over. This is less exploitable, i think, although I can think of a few variations (clerics healing while timer is not up) that would ruin it.<P>Suggestions very helpful for my ideas here to STOP the worst part of the pvp server.<P>lvl 1-5 pvp. This is just crazy. Not only do our own newbies kill each other rampantly, preventing any soul from learning the game on our server. But, other server players join our server JUST to pk newbies, to relieve stress. A suggestion fix for this problem:<P>Prevent pvp altogether at these levels, just like experience loss. When you ding to level 5, you are red flagged and capable of killing and being killed. This wouldn't be a complete fix, but worthwhile nonetheless.<P>Delevelers:<BR>Prevent skills from being used after delevel. Dual weilding level 5's? Please fix this. Remove skills gained by leveling. This is a newcoming plague of the server, and hopefully an easy fix.<P>/consider:<BR>Please add a flag to pvp server's consider, letting us know when someone is in range. Perhaps <BR>"Achazael looks at you with hostility - What would you like your tombstone to say?". and if out of range "Achazael looks at you peacefully - What would you like your tombstone to say?". A simple fix like this would be fine, or maybe a simple recolor code for in range leveled players. Orange for red and in range, Light blue for blue and in range.<P>Sadly, I've never ventured more than a dozen levels on the team servers, because of coin loot only. PLEASE DO NOT TURN RALLOS INTO COIN LOOT. I wish I could input into their problems, but I'm certain they will voice their concerns. My post dealt with pvp as a whole, and hopefully gave some insight into our problems. I've played PvP since release, and EQ since Beta 3, and have been looking forward to this post for a long long time =).

</FONT><HR>Man oh man some of you are stubborn. If you aren't going to say anything productive, don't post at all. Absor, I really hope those other posts don't influence you(the negative ones anyhow). Well, currently I'm speaking on the behalf of rogues, quite a few of them.<P>Our biggest problem: Pumice.<BR>Not only us, but any other meleer out there. We have no defense to spells like root and snare, or dr00ds and shaman's SoW other than alot of Magic Resist. That still doesn't help us fix their SoWs. Current nerfed pumice isn't worth crap other than casting things off you AFTER battle. The situation is much different than PvE, and I understand that, but just because the majority is PvE you're gonna ignore 3 entire servers? Thats what, at least 10,000 subscribers? Here are some solutions.:<BR>1) Self-Only Old School Pumice(Instacast, 3 buff)<BR>2) One-Buff canceling instacast all people.<BR>3) 3 buff with a much short cast time, perhaps 1 or 2.<BR>    But I, and many others feel the PvP community is suffering from Pumice as it is, and it must be changed. Not like the coding is difficult as upon a time it was implemented.<BR>    Now, for evade, it's not as urgent at all as Pumice, but it would be great. Our hide skills are totally useless in PvP other than sneaking up on people. Any smart opponent will cast a long range spell to knock you out of it or either pull out a ranged weapon. Unpreventable. I do not recommend you make it so they lose target of us. But do the obvious:<BR>"You can not see the target."<BR>Or whatever. It's fact. You can't see us. The game should make it that way. Hide as it currently is kills the whole point of hide. If someone has see invis on, sure, knock me out of invis. But if they don't, they're gonna get it.<P>   Short-range PC only tracking would also be great for Role-Playing reasons, but it is definately not one of our biggest concerns - at all.<P>My 25cp.

</FONT><HR>Okay<BR>Splurt isnt life drain dot, my mistake<P>Egg-shaped pumice is way too exploitable to be let back into the game.<P>Magical DoTs should be removed, regardless of location, as a first priority when nullify is casted on you.  Anyone is screwed with these on them, without an empty buff spot.<P>Adarae, I can get into planes and get carmine gear.  The point is, is people walk around in full planar gear at great efficiency level, but have no risk to themselves.  Melees like Reefman, can come loot their corpse, attack again at 80% efficiency, and lose nothing when they die and come again and again and again and again.  It just like being naked, because they hold no risk to themselves, BUT they do it at 80% efficiency as opposed to 20% efficiency without planar gear.  With casters, they can keep coming back for more, with good resist and INT from planar gear, and never leave.  Why would they leave? There is no risk involved for them if they die.  <P>For people in my guild who wear the BEST PvP gear in EQ, we go out there and risk tons of PP worth of gear, and you risk what???  You risk your pumice stone if you have one?  Your pp??? where is the risk invovled for the people who get no drop?   ill tell you where it is, it doesnt exsist.  There is no risk for a person in full no drop attacking a person in full drop, and they only have to sacrifice 20% efficiency to have absolutely no risk involved in an encounter.  <P>Who cares if there are more naked people on RZ if they make no drop droppable?  I sure don't when naked they are at 10-20% effciency, if they wanna come attack bagged let them, they wont be much of a challenge.<P>Once again remove 66% dmg nerf in PvP on DDs, there isnt any reason for it 50+.<BR>Like someone else said, by making a 66% dmg nerf on DDs you consequently made healing spells 34% more powerful.<P>Check out the resist checks, they just don't seem to work out right.  <BR>And if they do work right, is HP a factor in calculation?  Or would there be something else effecting caster resists since they consitantly resist lower then any other class?<P>and Raffine, I made one mistake in my 400 pg novel of a post, that one mistake which i corrected makes my entire post "blareingly innacurate" ?   I think you need to calm down a bit.  I didn't know that calling splurt a life drain dot was going to make you so angry I apologize.  IN the future please try to have a little consideration for those of us who don't play necros and therefore arent nearly as learned as you are about the class okay? <P>Arkons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>first off, i don't believe Verant wants to "fix" pvp, (we just get this post every month or two, so we will be quiet) but there are some very simple ways to make productive steps.<P>Make rules and post em.  (won't happen, but would be nice)(things in writting interfer with the Vision (tm))<P>Now that the PvP servers seem to be mature, do some homework and set the teams in STONE. (the homework being a short study of server makeup during prime time hours) Decide on GvE, 4 team free for all, Religion, I don't care.  (ack, verant doing homework on PvP, now my head is hurting from laughing so much)<P>No cross team beneficial healing/buffing.  Race traitors?  Fine, make that a GM event, leave the players out of it.  (where the next gen of PvP games is gonna leave Verant in the dust is this one)<P>Verant is a large corporation that makes big bucks from monthly fees.  It is easy to realize that they will make more money with some sweet talk and keeping most of the small monthly fees PvP brings in, than Verant will to actually spend a nickel and FIX PvP and keep ALL the small amount of monthly fees PvP brings in.<P>If you want to be fixed by Verant, chose one of their hobbies, i.e. Necro or Druid.  Those of us on PvP are to jaded after all this time to believe what they say.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Arkons is probably in one of the uber pk guilds I mention in my above post.  Giving uber-pk guilds even more advantages than they already have is not going to balance PvP.  He already admits wearing the best PvP gear, how can someone who is minding their own business in the best PvE gear they have do anything about it when the murderers come knocking to interrupt their camp? <P>Above, Arkons suggested that there be a loot and leave policy.  This would be the uber-pk guild's heaven if that ever came to be, because they would charge in with their blue diamond resist gear and it would be 15 of them murdering 6 ppl (and ALL individuals they encounter)trying to gain experience somewhere, and the grief PK guilds would have be in heaven running around kicking people out of zones, and talking in their I OWN JOO! and dewdspeak or whatever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sad but true Chieftan...Absors last 5 page, month long old post I kept alive till the thread was closed because a few people were trying to keep it alive so Absor would respond. I don't know honestly if he is here again to still the old pot, or to really do some PVP homework and get some positive stuff rolling here. Its a bit late on the 8 ball, and there are entire games focusing on bringing us what we want in the future. So is it worth it to Verant to try and hold onto the 6-10K people the Zeks bring in to EQ? For I think games like Shadowbane and Dark Age of Camelot will not only grab those 10K, but a large number of people tired of the PVE settup. I hope for the best, but I've been saying that about Vallon for too long now, I guess once again only time will tell.<P>My 2 cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Teams Viewpoint:<P>1. This is the most important: no more immortal/OOR healing or buffing. If you cannot damage someone not on your team or in your level range, then you cannot heal or buff them either. If you cannot gain experience grouped with someone, you should not be able to buff or heal them.<P>Related to this is faction. If you are not going to remove crossteam healing or buffing, then everyone who assisted in causing someone's death should take the faction hit. Also, when you kill a half elf, the message is "your faction with friends of half elves has gotten worse" and it is affecting human faction. This is a bug. Fix it.<P>Dueling and/or fighting in the arena should not affect faction.<P>2. LOS casting. Another PC should not be able to cast on me through walls, floors, ceilings, etc.<P>3. Bindrushing. Some very good points given here. I like the solutions where a person comes back SEVERELY hindered or where they are ported back to the default bind point if killed in pvp. Another idea given was your corpse is ported with you. The only problem with this is the rights to loot your kill. I suggest automatically giving the coin the person is carrying to the person that got the killing blow. <P>Oh, and if a person destroys their coin once they are engaged in pvp battle, that amount should be taken from their bank account.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4. Talking about looting your kills segues into ninjalooting. The only person who should be able to loot a PC is the person that got the killing blow. Period.<P>5. Deleveling.<P>6. Adopt loot and scoot and code it in. Without item loot the RISK for losing is losing rights to a zone or camp. If you LOSE for any reason in a PvP encounter you SCOOT. <P>7. I do NOT favor turning the team servers into two teams against each other. That's way too blue server, which is how it is now. I agree with many of the points people make about the teams set up being flawed, but having only one foe to worry about is too simplistic. IF Verant decides to make the teams server not based on race, at the very least divide it so that there are THREE teams. "Good" vs. "Evil" is pretty cheesy, but if that's what people want, OK, just throw in another team to make it interesting. Just don't call them "neutral" because to be "neutral" means staying out of conflict. <P>8. GMS/Guides should know PvP. It should be REQUIRED that they spend time on a pvp server actually playing the game. GMs/Guides should all share the same opinion on what zone camping is, for example, and when a person is exploiting the zones and is open to attack for doing so. The GMs/Guides should all know without a doubt if it is legal to PvP in a bank (I think it should be on Teams servers). They should all know what corpse camping means and what it does NOT mean. They should also know that is NOT harassment for attacking someone who refuses to concede a zone/camp despite being woefully outmatched. The PNP clearly states that conflicts are decided via PvP means. That means if I can defeat you, then I win the conflict, and I get to enjoy the fruits of the victory. Loot and Scoot!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'm very pleased that this issue is being brought to attention, as I exclusively play on PvP servers.  <P>Not to beat a dead horse, but the single biggest problem that I really want to see addressed is the ability to crossteam on the PvP team servers.  Invulnerable healing has got to stop.  While most people on TZ, quite honestly, are nice, good winners and good losers, there are some elements that quite frankly couldn't give a flying f*** about anybody else.  And some will go out of their way to ruin your day in as many ways as they can until you log off.<P>Now I'm not just talking about a little skirmish that raises bad blood.  For the most part, I'm a firm believe in "might makes right" in PvP.  However, there are a few exceptions.  The two at the top of that list would be EXP Killing and Invulnerable Healing.  EXP Killing is impossible to police for the most part, but Invul Healing is well within reach.<P>Hardcode the teams.<P>I say again, I beg you down on my knees...<P>HARDCODE THE TEAMS.<P><BR>Yes, there are some guilds and some relationships that have sprung up over time that are crossteamed (on a PvP team server) and it would break a few alliances... but it would fix a world full of problems that have me and several other players cursing nightly.  New characters can be created, new alliances can be formed.  The integrity of the server is what counts.<P>1)  You cannot group with anyone not on your team.<P>2)  You cannot heal anyone not on your team.<P>Every team is well-rounded enough so there isn't one team that won't have access to a core class, such as enchanters, clerics or warriors.  It can be done.  Change the servers!<P>Thanks for your time.<P>-Slade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059914&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059914&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
