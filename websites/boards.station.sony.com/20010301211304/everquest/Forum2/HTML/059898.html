</FONT><HR>The one announced change for enchanters was to reduce the casting time for Visions of Grandeure.  Ok...who came up with this one?  I'm not terribly upset....but I have this comical image of them taking about 4 hours in a group to come up with it.<P>Why is it so funny?<P>1.  Level 60 spell.  That right there means its not going to effect many players....and the ones it does are likely the closest to quitting the game as they have "been there" and "done that"<P>2.  It's a combat buff.  Dunno about you all, but I cast these BEFORE my group enters combat.  Lowering casting time of a stun, or mez, or any other chanter spell the chanter might use DURING combat would be nice.  Lowering the casting time on a spell you cast beforehand?  Just dont get it.<P><BR>Like I said...I'm not mad....just amused and confused.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I, for one am certainly not going to complain. <P>Perhaps somewhere, someone, deep inside the innermost cloisters of the Temple of Vision, realized that the enchanter class may be more balanced than the lesser clergy believed. They certainly couldn't give much of anything to enchanters, without running the risk of angering The God 'VI the mighty', but reducing their abilities would tip the balance towards the other side and give the Goddes 'Nerf the merciless', the upper hand. <P>We will just have to sit back and see. The show isnt over until the Troll Ogress sings!<P>Hoggle of Ak'Anon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not casting time.  Recast time.<P>It had a recast time of 18 seconds.  Think how annoying that would be.<P>Now, you will notice, enchanters don't think they are broken.  They like their class.  The big issue they have is that at high levels they can't affect anything.  This isn't a simple change, like shuffling spells or casting times.  Our casting times are fine.  Our mana costs are fine.  What enchanters seem to universally want:<P>A&gt; Class-specific equipment we like.  AC HPs INT and CHA we like.  What we get is INT and CHA.  At high levels, enchanters tend not to wear enchanter equipment and rather find mix & match stuff that maxes all 4 stats...<P>B&gt; Being able to effect mobs.  Some mobs we can't affect, we understand.  Entire zones of such mobs?  Continents?  Level-ranges? (high-level SoV content)  Such mobs being indistinguishable until they start beating on us (The Hole)?<P>C&gt; Minor fixes to make some spells less annoying, or to aid grouping.  Like single-target mez's from two different enchanters of two different levels overwriting each other.  single overwriting multi is probably too powerful...  But, as it stands, unless two enchanters are the same level using the same mez, grouping is hell.<P>D&gt; Random fixes to some spell lines.  Some spell lines are useless (lull).  Some spell lines don't seem to upgrade (mem blur).  Some spell lines don't cross-overwrite correctly (group clarity and clarity).  Group clarity comes 2 levels before it becomes obsolete.  Highest level AC buff ... is the same as 2nd highest, with a higher mana cost.  And that L 60 spell having an 18 second recast time makes mass-buffing annoying.  And Boon of Garou being nearly impossible to keep up, no safety margin.<P>E&gt; Illusions.  Lots of enchanters love these toys.  I do, personally.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Others think talking about them gets in the way of talking about important stuff.<P>F&gt; Agnosticness.  Non agnostic enchanters is just playing the game at a higher difficulty setting.  You lose the enchanters ability to travel to any city, and gain absolutely nothing.  And our quests assume we are agnostic.  So, either have illusions mask faith, or have a mask faith spell.<P>G&gt; Enchanting weapons.  No rush, just no backing off.<P>H&gt; Stupid pets.  I like having a stupid pet, makes us clearly different than other classes, but it can be annoying, and makes them worse than useless in groups.  But some people are asking for one or two upgrades here (like have pet attack what we /attack).<P>As you can see, none of the above is a simple fix.  Hybrid changes - well, they tweeked spell levels, spell costs, and casting time.  Mages?  Random pet-only buffs.  Shamans/Druids?  Some new healing spells.  All easy stuff.<P>Enchanters are a good class, there are just a few issues to iron out - like, SoV MR/noMez, and other random tweaks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They also reduced the aggro on the tash line. Beyond that enchanters are a balanced class. The only real problem is that thw whole Velious continent is not balanced for magic resistance.

And our quests assume we are agnostic. So, either have illusions mask faith, or have a mask faith spell.<P>===<P>I AGREE! I started playing before I knew that Agnost was the only was the only real way to go being an enchanter, and am suffering for it now. I am KoSed in areas on religion, even if I am of the same race as the guards. Neriak comes to mind. So do Qeynos sewers. And Oggok Cracknek guild. I'm well past the point it would be "easy" to get back to, so rerolling my character is out of the question - and undesirable anyway.<P>If spells can so easily effect faction (Aliance line, as well as the illusions in general), then why shouldn't a spell be able to alter religion? Even if the alter is simply to agnost, it is better then being the only Mith Marr enchanter on my server. I made a terrible mistake by attempting to roleplay my character - its something I will probably never try again, since apparently this game is made to actively discourage it.<P>Gamanen Darkensoul, Enchanter Level 30<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Still remember the time I did nothing but tash the steel golum in CT and it was on me till dead with everyone beating on it.<P>As mentioned...Velious is our biggest issue now.  We can do NOTHING there due to all our spells being magic based. Even if it is something hugely different than crowd control (not a clue what) give us some usefullness in the fight.   <P>As an asside, the MR thing with anything high level kills us.  It has been noted that most ubermobs have one weakpoint that the player needs to discover.  Perhaps it is because ALL classes have magic based spells of one sort or other that magic is NEVER the weakpoint.

</FONT><HR>I agree that Enchanters are pretty much balanced as they are with a few minor adjustments needed - mostly fixing broken spells. The Tash change should be great but I don't see it helping in SoV. I still couldn't cast there even after using Tashania.<P>What scares me is the coming patches for Enchanters. Verant announced that Clerics would be nerfed and they did it in this patch. Verant also said that Enchanters should be nerfed and I guess we have that coming in the next patch.<P>Only time will tell.

In Sol A, Ill Omen(goblin cave, and Wandering) I was able to previous to this patch hit with a few debuffs once the tank landed a few blows with a mage damage shield and only get hit once. Now the critter runs at me after casting one debuff. Now I am a pet class so I can have a couple more taunters so I can survive a debuff only encounter.

</FONT><HR>Very perceptive, Qhue.  It is exactly like when they Uberized newbie guards because they were being killed easily for nice cash and xp. They tried to tell us the change was to improve the game, in that less levels 1 to 3 players would die (because the guards would be there to save them from the scarey rats). I like that we are playing such a dynamic and evolving game, but it insults me when they affect change to limit a certain player strategy and present the change to us as a gift.  Like the change with the Giants in the Arena.. flat out honesty there.

It's an admission that the game HAS in fact taken a downturn, and they ARE currently working on additional fixes to try and bring it back in line.  I work in this field, with large-scale internet and web-based applications, and I understand that sometimes there are so many changes that you have to carry them forward in stages, otherwise it becomes difficult to isolate and fix problems that slip into production.  However, we never take code that we KNOW is broken and put it in production, knowing that three weeks from now we'll patch it and (hopefully) fix it.<P>I continue to be amazed by the (apparent lack of) Quality Assurance at Verant.  I applaud them for all they've done so far, but only because I can't believe they've bungled it all along the way and it still is a success.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The lowering of tash aggro is nowhere near that important to enchanters (and from what I tested last night it didn't lower much).<P>90% of the aggro people see associated with Tash comes from whipping multiple mezz's and debuffs on the same mob.  Tash don't get me wrong is a pretty strong taunt.  But with the reduced effectiveness of taunt I will die just as much.  Pop a mob that has been mezzed, slowed, crippled, etc. and it is going to gank the enchanter.<P>The major thing of course is 90% of the mobs in SOV are immune to magic.  Guess what no friggen point casting tash on them.  Every ubermob in the game just about is MR immune.  Why is it some mobs are strong resist vs fire but weak resist vs cold; but, all uber mobs are basically immune to magic.<P>Enchanters had ZERO balance issues up until ROK level 54+.  That was where Verant decided to make everyone start using Glamour/Rapture on mobs.  Then changed to making no mezz's work period in 90% of SOV.  You have changed the game environment for us so much that the class is totally destroyed now aside from casting C2 and haste.  This just becomes another of the 1000 posts I have read on the topic, though these get glossed over in favor of a post which agrees with your misguided ideals about class balance.<P>The problem isn't rebalancing the classes.  Its fixing it so people can play in the POS expansion you guys made.  Had you been consistent in world creation none of these conversations would be going on now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only reason they made this change was because FOH and other uber guilds were using tash on uber mobs. The warriors would use a weapon that would proc tash. That uber mob would now be 100% agro on that one warrior for at least 90% of the battle. Cast 2 tashs, and he will be 100% agro on that uber mob. <P>Makes for an easy kill.
