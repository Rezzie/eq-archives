</FONT><HR>Wow I am impressed by the quality of some of our replies! Keep it up, attacking Verant doesn't make them more friendly to our cause (Con an agro'd mob sometime :).<P>  (1) I'm becoming more interested in the concept of giving the higher level stat buffs some added little twist, please refer to some of the previous posts to see some well thought out ideas.<P>  (2) I like the idea one poster had about fixing alchemy, perhaps to keep it from becoming a twink tool you could scale their effects by the level of the character receiving the buff? <P>  (3) Alchemy again:  Why concentrate so much on stat alchemy?  Perhaps it was easier to code with the existing spell effects, but what about some truly unique situational ones?   <BR>       -- Like feet of stability (great on ice while it lasts, no slipping)<BR>       -- earth attachment (can't lev or be tossed in the air while it lasts)<BR>       -- Potion of cannabilsm (not a mod-rod equiv but convert a fixed amount of HP to mana for the caster who has it)<P>   (3)  Increase our defense a bit... or give us a evade skill.  I don't agree totally with the description of our ability to melee (post level 35 anyway, heh my cleric char post 50 can out-melee my shaman and he has the dragon hammer).  By increasing our defense a bit I might survive the role the post 50 shaman has been relegated to of mob SLOWING.  I was thinking of when we camped the JUGGS the other night.  On the initial slow and root parking of the pull the cleric in our group had to be on his toes, knowing that I would get beaten up severely getting it SLOWED and the extras parked (our enchanter was busy too btw).  I died 3 times anyway that camp.... he had to keep the others alive also.<P>-- Regards,  Sharden of Karana soon to be 57 shaman<P>  (4) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's me again :grins:<P>Alrite - wanted to make a point clear (and I hope most agree with me). We're not complaining that shaman suck, we're not saying the shaman class is a bad class, cause quite frankly if we thought so we'd all reroll right now as druids or necros and only be missing our pet series of spells lol..<P>Shamen are very good at keeping groups alive, and the buffs are good finishing touches, as weak as they may be. The *best* groups I've ever been in, and this has been my main point all along, are groups with NO other casters, just me and 5 tanks. Think I'm crazy? Who could ask more than to be able to sit back, relax, and watch yer 5 tanks pull in mobs, and all ya gotta do is lay on quickness on yer tanks now and then, maybe cast a greater heal? You act as the healer, you act as the chanter, and if necessary you can frenzy, and go in and play tank class a bit (though it's better if you don't..). <P>When a druid is introduced, I'm cut back to slowing and quickening... when a chanter joins? I'm pointless.<P>Shamen are good general classes... we're the class that's viewed as "those OTHER guys" lol. We're the last picked if there's any kind of variety to be selected from, but if we are the only alternative, we can hold out alrite because we can act as pretty much every utility class.<P>Shamen are 2nd (or maybe even 3rd) rate healers, 2nd rate buffers, 2nd rate DoT'ers all their careers (Necros get our dot's before we do on occasion!), and 2nd rate debuffers. We're slightly better than equal to druids when it comes down to melee, but we're FAR behind the clerics and hybrids from what i've seen, judging from Defense skills and armor selection.<P>What it comes down to is we're just plain not needed in any grouping situation unless there are No other casters around! I was kicked out of a group a month back because a necro and a mage decided their _PETS_ would take less exp than I would and be more useful! And low and behold... they were right lol, but still... What kind of balance is that?<P>I was kicked out a group last night because we weren't taking enough damage to warrant the extra healer, and we had an enchanter that could slow.. We had a mage with a pet, and the pet does more dmg than I do with my DoT's and doesn't need to Med during downtime lol. (and it regens faster to boot).<P>We're a class that isn't needed. Thats the only balance issue with shaman that needs to be fixed... we need to be needed!<P>Trouvon Aracksus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Though i believe the decision has long been made as to what changes will be made to the classes i'll still post my comments.<BR> From level 51-53 shamans receive no offensive spell increases.We primarily receive poison-disease buffs and debuffs (all useless) and stamina and agility buffs.Stat buffs as stated by absor are shamans  defining characteristic but the exact effect has been documented for each buff by a number of people on these threads.<P> Number one,getting a 50 agility buff is not plus 50 agility but plus 10 we already had a 40.The plus 10 agility as has been shown gives us a plus 4 AC increase over the previous spell.If you gave any class a spell past 50 that only gave a boost of 4 AC whoever got it would be furious but as a tack on its supposed to be class defining.Nonsense.<P> You gave us a post 50 stamina spell,same thing it does not give us 125 hp's it gives us a 20 hp buff over previous spell.<P> Can you imagine the screaming clerics would be doing if you kept giving them heal increases of 20 each time they got a new heal?<P> Poison and disease buffs?Keep them they are garbage,same for the debuffs i see no effect and no longer use any of them.<P> Alan will point out we get 2 of the best DOTS in the game at 56 and 59.Nope,its taken me 6 months to go from 50 to 54 and i'm nearly stopped.Progress is so slow at this point i'll probably never make 56 and if i do i cant solo dragons so i'll never get the spells.<P> Druids get a brand new stacking DOT at 52 and a 1300 at 53 both vendor bought.Necro's get 3 DOTS minimum 1100,a dd and a new pet by level 53,Mage's get a high damage AOE,a new dd and new pets also by 53.All other caster classes also get at least one offensive spell by that level,even the hybids i believe but im not checking all the classes.All except shamans.Why? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It's in fact an AC penalty because Verant has failed to go back and update half the armor in the game for Iksar.  But really it's much more than just an AC pentalty because some of that armor has right-clickable effects.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>How long ago was RoK released?

</FONT><HR>Most people here appear content with shaman being a buffer, healer and debuffer. I'm not. I wan't my shaman to do damage as well. Once upon a time when I started my shaman, it was appearent that shamans were decent, if not spectacular, damage dealers, and that we could compare favourably with druids. So I imagined that this was how things were supposed to be. Then along comes the Kunark expansion and shamans get four lousy damage spell upgrades (two of which are impossible for most people to acquire) and a pet that is actually worse than the one we had before, because it costs far more but performs the same. Meanwhile, our little brother-class druids get more damage spells than shamans and clerics put together, far more powerful upgrades than shamans get (due to improved stackability - druid DOTs used to be almost impossible to resist but unstackable, now they are just impossible to resist) and nukes that put them closer to wizards in reality than they ever were before. To add insult to injury, while shaman damage spells are harder to acquire than the Spear of Fate, druids can waltz into a store and buy all theirs. <P>Personally, I think that the shaman class would be a total and utter piece of unplayable junk class that would have become extinct by now if it weren't for a few good items we can acquire, namely the JBB, the spear and the regen tunic. It's those items that save the shaman class from total ruin, because the pathetic level 50+ spell list sure doesn't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not playing my level 54 Shaman anymore but have some input on making more fun.<P>Shaman are supposed to be the master of combat enhancements.  How about a 15 second buff to cast on tanks that makes them go berzerk?  Increases in attack, strength, speed and decreases in agility (affecting armor class negatively).  This could be upgrades to the fleeting fury and burst of strength spell lines.  Upgrades at 24, 34, 44, 54 and 60.  At 60 this spell would grant +100 to attack, strength and give +70% speed with a large minus to agility (and possibly dex).  Would really look cool to have a red flame around the target also while bezerk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I brought up the threads with my guild and several groups last night.<P>Just to present a little bit of a different perspective, all of the tanks I asked seemed to genuinely think my buffs were awesome (all of them, even stat buffs).  So even if they don't actually do anything, the fact that the people I cast them on feel like they're important is enough for me.<P>I also finally got level 53 last night, and have not fizzled on Superior Healing yet.

</FONT><HR>As a L 56 shaman on Mithaniel marr ive just topped playing my character, except to earn cash for my twink (SK).  Frankly there is no point continuing.  Why?  Well because as a shaman my offensive capability has not increased since L 49. Dont believe me :<P>Turgurs - I slow a little better than 49 (10% maybe)<BR>DOTs - still have good old Envenomed Bolt and Bane of Nife is frankly impossible to aquire despite being a CORE ability spell.  Disease DOTS are irrelevant and never cast because of their slow duration.<BR>Cannibalise - well yes III is much better except it fizzles 4 of 5 times at 56. <BR>Heal - yes Superior is nice, but dont expect to live long with me healing thats for emergencies only.  Frankly I dont wont heal spells for shaman beyond SH - thats the cleric job.  Fizzle rate - see Cann III.<BR>Pet - well all that needs to be said has.  All I want is a pet commensurate with my level and equivalent to what I had at 34-49.<BR>Buffs - useless except for Talisman (caster dont wont), Shroud (doesnt stack/overwritten), Celerity (never used because enchanters are better)<P>But no point complaining unless one has a solution:<P>King of buffs u say - try these:<P>1. Undebuffable Resists - better than other classes, used for raids<BR>2. Attack buffs - both to ATK and maible ones that grant special procs on weapons<BR>3. Group SOW (Scale is useless)<BR>4. Group Regrowth<P>Other changes:<BR>5. Pet - the attack poodle cant cut it - i think thats clear! (micro upgrade was a mega placebo)<BR>6. DD - our DD at 650 is out of sync with other classes as per pre 50.  No justification for this pls fix.<BR>7. DOTs - Bane is fine.  No one has it for love or money.  Should be purchased its a core ability.  Disease never uses and wont be unless time reduced.<BR>8. Alchemy - all u do is create useless potions to raide you skills - remove the negative effects. More potions like Gates to each major city.  At 300pp a pop minimum you wont be putting druids and wizards out of business believe me.<P>Right now my friends are doing things like trying to organise Hole raids for me to complete my Epic, things to motivate me.  There are not many plus 50 shaman left and for good reason.<P>RIGHT NOW at 56 there is not ONE spell to look forward to up to 60.  Not one, and I will not play a class whose entire role is to cast ONE spell for the rest of their career - TURGURS.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll keep this pretty simple because all the things needed to fix the shaman class are right before your eyes, we been saying them for the last 4 pages . <P>I did however want to add a few things. I wasnt aware that druuids were able to buy their level 50 + spells, that is completely wrong. We have far less efective spells past 50, and yet we have to hope and pray we find someone selling them or get insanely lucky. And we all know that when verent judges our class they assume every shaman has those 50+spells. Yeah we may be "close" to being balanced if we were able to have all those level 50 spells , but fact is few to none do.<P>This is my biggest beef of all!<P>Why is it that the great game of everquest has been made into a "use this class or you wont get groups" type of game. I havent had alot of probs getting groups myself as a shaman,but thats often because i usually group with friends, why did you make a game that allows certain classes to Immediately get groups while others struggle forever to find someone to kill with (and probably kill less effectively because you are in the party compared to the big 5 classes). I'll use karnors a cleric can find a group in karnors within a single shout at 44 or even 39, as a 49 shaman i struggle to get a group if a friend isnt in there already. same is true for hybrids, sk's paladins are only substitutes for the warrior and would be dropped like a foraged dagger if the oppurtunity to get a warrior instead arose.<P>Having to be a certain class to get groups isnt right or fair! if half the players that made these "tweener" classes knew what troubles they would have when they made them, do you really think they would make them again? I know i would have made a druid or cleric if i had known what things were like, druids arent "greatly stronger" but at least i could have levelled much faster and teleported when i needed to. <P>When i hear class balancing i think being wanted in a group is the effects balancing should have, but i just dont see that happening. Is giving sk's and pally's more defense suddenly gonna make people say hey, lets get that sk over a warrior, or a better heal for shamans thats only 17 levels behind a cleric instead of 19, are shamans suddenly gonna be wanted in a group more? <P>Can anyone explain a good reason why certain classes are supposed to have the LOCK on groups, I hear posts saying that while giving out better heals to the minorities , Clerics usefullness will never be infringed upon, well i say why not! Even if we had celestial healing and their highest numeric heal, do you think even in that circumstance we will be chosen over a cleric is group? clerics get a natural heal bonus, resurection and complete heal, and top quality hp and ac buffs, They are NEVER gonna be overlooked because a shaman can heal better? I that situation it MAY maker us be able to get a group though. The difference between warrior , monk rogue, and the hybrids sk, pally ranger, is fairly marginal till the very high end game when those spells of theirs arent that effecive, which i think is perfectly fair. You simply wont see " no we dont want you , we are waiting for a warrior" , see the point but with druids and more so shamans that is the case, i would like to see a marginal difference in effectiveness, so much so that it wouldnt matter to greatly which you had, clerics would clearly be better, but shamans would be a viable replacement , albiet without the nice healing perks and such.<P>I am not silly i know that would never happen, but for the life of me i dont know why it wouldnt, that seems only fair to me. Is it too much to want to have each class wanted and not constantly be compared to the big 5. As far as my knowledge goes i dont think this is ever an issue with the intelligence classes is it? I cant think of a certain int class being completely chosen over the others, with exception of enchanter, but thats a utility class moreso than a high damage int caster?<P>And i guess i didnt keep that very short huh, oh well.<P>Shrazkil 49 shaman,<BR>Piccoro 44 monk,<BR>guides of norrath , bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Death_walker I would just like to coment on some of your suggests as I think your going in the right direction for shaman.<P>"1. Fix stat buffs"<P>Some really great suggestions in there value might be a little high but sometime that should be looked at for the lower levels (where they may actually be used).  And I totally agree with the removal of group buffs after 50 buffs really are meant for the tanks in the group (way would the cleric/wizard etc want a STR buff?) and in a group of 6 really how many tanks do you have?<P>"2. Fix our pet"<P>Yes our pets do need fixing but you idea that at level 59 we would be able to summon a 52-54 pet, that is way to over powering.  We should be able to at least summon some that is just blue to us (low forties would be my guess)  but there is a major problem when my 34 pet was better than a SK 39 pet but an Sk's last pet can kill my last pet, why would an SK (tank already) need a better pet then a shammie (partial tank) -Sorry SK's don't want to get your pets nerfed just stating a point.<P>"No point 3 in your post."<P>"4. Alchemy is broken. Below are a few ideas on how to fix it."<P>Now I'm not even going to start on this topic since it is beyond broken (useless) and I don't really think it is part of balancing our class.<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ups and Downs for Playing a Iskar Shaman<BR>Ups:  Regen and ac<BR>Downs:  Armor is some of the worse in game, almost all right click items are not usable by the Iskar, the JBB for one is a great item for any shaman exept Iksar.  At least give us a quest bracer with something of an effect.  The JBB isn't even a quest at least you could do is make a lvl 40 quest for the Iksar involving right click items.   <BR>Yes we get natrual regen but you offer a BP that is a simple drop and gives our regen ability to anyone.  <BR>The exp patch didnt effect the Iksar shamens at all it actually made it worse now the rangers and paladins take most of the exp in a group. <BR>At 32 I grouped for 3 hours with a paladin and a SK and got 1 bubble of exp. And no I didnt die<BR>3 HOURS = 1 Bubble!!!!!!<BR>You need to reexamine the exp.<BR>or at least offer lotion to the Iksar so the screw wont hurt so much on the next patch <P><BR>Thanks <BR>HARDBACK SOLDIER<BR>32 Iksar Shaman Mith Marr  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just hit 60th...and had my first experience of Avatar and Torpor<P>Avatar - NEEDS REVAMPING!!!! It's hmm RUBBISH!!!! is the only way to desribe it without getting a warning, 15 plat for a buff that can fade before the pull reaches us! 325 mana! doesn't stack properly... How about a straight 200 att/defence buff  longer duration like 1 hour...something along the lines of a clerics symbol line which requires a stone to cast?<P>Torpor - Nice spell, pity about it being GROUP ONLY!!! (So much for multigroup raids...which are becoming all so common... time to either lift the restriction or allow groups to combine together for exps and buffing... like we asked for millions of times.)  Also the Stacking with dots needs to be looked at... Clerics complained about CE not stacking... I dropped in a request for Torpor to be fixed at same time... Clerics fixed Shamans passed over :-(<P>Ludovic 60 CT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Etc. All the same.<P> Heals... if a cleric or a druid i won´t heal but i am leader of the group and i said that.<P> <BR> I think shamans are great in pair with a warrior, we can do many things. But if there are on a group with a cleric, druid, warrior, rogue and necromancer. Me, the Shaman, the leader of the group... i finished pulling mobs while the warrior regens, better have a rest warrior than a useless shaman.

</FONT><HR>No offense, but not all shamans are content with buffing newbies and twinking melees (which is the only thing we are really good at, btw). When I signed up to be a shaman I wanted to be a feared witchdoctor, a bringer of plagues, diseases, and curses, as well as the one able to cure such ailments. I wanted to kick ass and take names, and that was the class I got. Do you remember the days of old? Everquest before the expansions? Oh, shaman was a great class! We were MASTERS of slows, resistance debuffs and DOTs, we had a pet that, while not exactly a monster, could perform decently given some support. We were extremely close to necromancers in soloing power, and we packed a punch in PvP combat like few others. Then along comes Kunark and tragedy strikes. My shaman is now a shell of her former self, a monument of great things past. Sure, you can play her, sure, she's not useless, but the greatness is gone. People used to cheer when a shaman showed up, used to be amazed at what we brought to a group, used to marvel at our power and versatility. Not any more. We aren't masters of anything now. We don't bring anything unique to a group. Every single one of our masteries have been handed out like candy to others, and our essential abilities have not been upgraded properly. Once, we were a real presence in a group - now, we are grease to make the real classes do their job a little better, a filler to bring along if there are no real classes to fill a spot. Shaman went from one of the best, if not THE best class in Everquest, all things considered, to a distinctly average class easily replaced by others and almost never perfect for any job. Before Kunark, I never even considered another class, that was how good shamans were. Now, not a day goes by without me wanting to play one of the real classes instead, instead of this mediocre relic.<P>Many, many of my shaman friends and colleagues on my server have either quit entirely or started over as more a more useful and powerful class. Why? The lost identity of the shaman class (due to the pimping away of shaman abilities to everyone and their little sister) and the lack of any incentive to keep playing one (the lameness of the spell list, the difficulty of acquiring the spells, the diminished attractiveness of our abilities, and - on our server - the weakness of the post-50 shaman in PvP combat).<P>I don't know if the shaman class can be fixed. Somehow I doubt it. It might be too late. Perhaps our destiny to decline into mediocricy was sealed the day Kunark was released. Or perhaps I'm just a pesimist given Verant's track record when it comes to shaman concerns. We'll see. I'm not holding my breath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057511&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057511&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
