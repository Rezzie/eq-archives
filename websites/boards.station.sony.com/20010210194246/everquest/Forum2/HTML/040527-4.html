</FONT><HR>Absor, you wrote:<BR>"As I've said, yes, there are technical reasons to prevent target illusion (formerly called copycat in this thread) from functioning without a change to faction. And that's not the only reason for not implementing it (because, yes, with a ton of work any technical challenge can be beaten). It's also just kinda silly to have an illusion that doesn't actually convince anyone that you are the new form…<P>But don't let that distract you. Just accept that there are technical reasons that faction is linked to body form, and that changing that would be a huge effort and might cause a bazzillion other problems."<P>My question is regarding the undead illusions.  I don't see skeletons and zombies and mummies walking around killing each other so obviously they have at least dubious faction with each other.  Yet when I cast illusion skeleton all undead still attack me even though they don't attack each other.  How is this different than giving enchanters a mimic illusion to become anything in the zone and not get a faction change?<P>Thanks,<BR>Wolf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or &gt;she might very easily be able to travel anywhere &gt;with no risk.<BR>I dont think that was the intent of what he was saying about the spell. He kind of wants the thing like that random pet spell. It just pulls a model of a mob that already exists in the zone.<BR>We already have illusion of just about ever race and a line of spells to make anyone friendly to us, I dont think that it would make us able to travel anywhere that we cant already.<BR>Also we already have illusion werewolf and spirt wolf so I dont buy your explanation.<P>&gt;My personal opinion is that enchanters shouldn't &gt;have any undead illusions, that should all be &gt;left to the necros and their type.<P>How come we have a line of skeleton illusions? They are undead.<P>&gt;Again, my personal opinion would have it so that &gt;only druids and shamans were get nature-type &gt;transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique &gt;factor with them, and not giving it to &gt;enchanters.<P>Then how come we have illusion tree, illusion werewolf and spirt wolf?<P>&gt;I agree, that spreading abilities out to too many &gt;classes dulls the class lines, and that's a bad &gt;thing in a class-based roleplaying game.<P>Then how come you are giving away the things, that make the enchanter unique, to other classes? Mez line shared by bard and others, illusion shared by several classes. Bards get a clarity type song. <P>&gt;There is no policy about not upgrading &gt;enchanters. I think you are doing yourself a &gt;disservice by believing that there is.<P>It sure seems like it to me also.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ya know, I never read this board but there is one thing in this flame that I kinda like. It's the idea of Illusion Pet that really seems neat. Perhaps as a level 54 spell, the final level in which we are called illusionists, we would get a spell that once we charm an enemie (or or own animation) we can illusion ourselves into that enemie. <P>From a roleplaying standpoint this would definately make us the masters of illusions, also it's definately not very mana efficient due to the having to cast a charm first, and also it would be very fun. Even if they wouldn't put any gained faction associated with this spell I would have great fun with it, as would many other people. The files would be in the zones we're using the illusions in, so no more global files would be needed.<P>Just my two cents but it sounds like a very interesting idea.<P>Abcnai, 54 Illusionist </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abcnai<P>Just have to offer my support to your idea, that is one of the best I have heard, a mimic charmed mob spell would be great, Of course not mana effecient but would be fun. I know I would personally be very pleased with this, I think this is something that the eq team should looks at.

</FONT><HR>I have not read the entire thread. But I did read the entire initial message and response from Alan. Could the entire reason for no new global models be that the new summonings and transformation were already planned and in place in the global model prior to the asking of this question. And the answer could have been justified in this manner already. Course some one could have told you this if it were the case.<P>Not taking any sides here.

</FONT><HR>I am always intrigued by player's arguments involving EQ. Enchanters are feeling that they are having their toes stepped on because Necromancers, masters of the undead, get a new undead form.<P>Wouldn't giving Illusion:Spectre then be stepping on the necromancer's toes? I feel letting the Necromancers have the undead forms and the Druids and Shaman types have the animal forms is good design.<P>That said, the ideas of Illusion:Genderbender, and Illusion:Animation are great, easily implemented ideas. <P>Enchanters have a strong role in the game. The Illusions they already have give great functionality already (probably more than I agree with). Asking for more effects is silly. These are Illusions! Illusions should confer no effects such as strength or regeneration. Druids get attack buffs and SoW from Wolf Form because they /turn into/ wolves. An enchanter would just /look/ like a wolf.<P>The effect of the Illusion in the Necromancer mana conversion line is not really an illusion, note the message (in skeleton form, I haven't seen the spectre form yet) that states 'the skin peels from (Necromancer's) bones'. And the attendant loss of hit points.<P>In short, be happy with what you have. Several people on the dev team have made it evidant that they regret giving /any/ bonus beyond the form change to Illusions. Keep begging for more and more and you may find yourself with less.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I find it terribly amusing that she's complaining about mage PETS being better illusionists than an illusionist CLASS.  Mage PETS are also better melee based damage dealers than melee based damage dealing CLASSES.<P> Warriors and monks have had to deal with watching mage pets outdamage them with one hand tied behind their back (Literally before that patch when they went ahead and started using both hands and REALLY outdamaging us). Rogues can compete when they've got the mob's back to them. <P>We're told that the fact that we're human and don't use crappy pet AI makes our classes valid since a pet is more likely to do something stupid like run off and make a train.  It's nice to know that a melee class's main edge over one class's spell is the fact that we're less likely to run off and make a train.<P>Quaid<BR>53 monk Rodcet</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a little insight on my "illusion pet" theory again in where i mentioned charming the mob before you can illusion yourself into them. If it may cause some faction problems with those zones in which faction doesn't drop when killing the monsters there, such as maybe Cobalt Scar and a few other zones or cities. Perhaps just fix this like you did with levitate and sky, just make it not castable in the zone.<P><BR>Abcnai</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have only read the posts by Absor thus far, and don't have the time at the moment to do more than scan the entire (lengthy) discussion.<P>I just had a possible idea concerning illusions:<BR>There is already code in the game to prevent you from casting spells based on zone properties. Thus far, it has been stated that illusion spells could only be cast with the global models. If this is due to the fact that the non-global models wouldn't be available in certain zones, then why not do a quick check when the spell is cast to determine if the model is available? The specifics of this code would of course depend on how the zone data, global file data, and spell casting process is coded, but it's just an idea...<P>Then you could have a spell "Illusion: Moss Snake" and if the moss snake model isn't in that zone, it gives you the "You may not cast that spell here" message (similar to the you may not cast that spell indoors for Druids). That way you could keep the spell from being a faction abuse by only creating specific illusion spells, and you would use existing models without using up precious space in the global file.<P>Just an idea... and I hope that this hasn't been proposed already.<P>Good luck in you efforts enchanters!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok.  I'm a bit confused.  <P>Absor, you call the Druid spell, 'Form of the Hunter', a "transformation".  Cast this spell and you not only look like a wolf, you move faster, attack better, and see better.  <P>With the Shaman spell, 'Form of the Great Bear', makes you look like a bear, increases wisdom, increases strength, and increases dexterity.  <P>The Necromancer spell, 'Arch Lich', makes you look like a spectre, gain mana faster, and lose hitpoints.  <P>The Enchanter spell, 'Illusion Werewolf', increases strength, makes you look like a werewolf, makes you attack better, and gives you faction with werewolves.<P>All these spells are similar in nature but different in stats.  They all make you look like something and they all give you stat increases that may be attributed with what you change into.  The only main differences I see are the fact that the Enchanter spell is being referred to as an "Illusion" and the others are referred to as "Transfomations".<P>Could you clear this up for me please?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I may be repeating what someone else has said, because I haven't read every page of comments; and I may be flamed for "siding with Verant," BUT:<P>(1) I'm positive that the "lag" reason for Enchanters not getting Spectre illusions came long before Necromancers got Spectre pets. I believe Gordon anwered this issue a month or two back.<P>(2) "Monster Summoning" is a spell in the genre of Conjuration/Summoning. Therefore, a Conjurer/Summoner - or, as EQ calls the class, a Magician - should get the spell.<P>And as for an Enchanter "Illusion Copycat," here's an idea: give some (SOME) high-level creatures the ability to "see through illusion," much as giants, driders, etc. see invisible. That way, the spell "illusion copycat" could be made available, but creatures could react and attack when someone "really shouldn't be going somewhere." ...Another thought is to make the spell like invisibility: sure, they can walk around and go anywhere, no problem. But if they try to hand in that quest item...and - oops! It's running out, and I'm standing right next to Lord Nagafen. :-D</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor said:<BR>"Well, the problem here is that everyone (especially in this thread) uses the term illusion very loosely. A necro is becoming undead when he does his magic. A druid is actually turning into a wolf when he does his. The problem is that the game uses essentially the same mechanics for those transformations as it does for illusions. If you really think about it, the way to distinguish illusions from transformations would be to make the illusions completely… illusionary. There would be no real component at all to the spell: no haste, not regen… just a faction change and a new look. And, actually, I think that was the original intent with illusions (going purely on my memories from beta – no official information here…), but it was changed because they were not useful enough as a way to change your looks."<P>Basically, he is agreeing with you Strive. The illusions should only be for looks/faction, and that was the original intent. The reason they were given useful components was to make them more useful in the game, and not just "back of the book" spells. As illusions, they shouldn't change stats at all, but they do change them as a bonus to enchanters. I am glad for enchanters that the stat bonuses are there, but in all honesty they shouldn't be. The spells for druids, shamans, and necros are transformations, and have always been intended to offer stat bonuses as well. Be happy that the enchanters got bonuses to go along with their illusions, but don't demand that enchanters deserve all the transformations just because their illusions carry bonuses.<P><BR>Just clarifying  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Once again, good luck in getting more illusions guys!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>Consider 2 things in giving ENC a "copycat" spell, besudes the facts that it makes some logical sense for the class, and would be fun for many.<P>1. Appearance/race is only one factor in faction, there are deed-related factions, and deity factions, that could keep ENC from being able to go anywhere with the copycat spell.<P>2. Even if you STILL have an issue from the race factions, why not consider giving them the spell with no faction adjustements, just for fun? The explanation could be that "copycat" is a less exacting way of casting an illusion that loses the benefit of any faction chages.

</FONT><HR>I have read the entire thread to this point. I believe that Baelish (aka CastersRealm) made some excellent points.<BR>You are all just asking for some additional illusions so you can change shape and amaze your friends. In fact you state very clearly that you don't want faction or any other types of changes to be included under the illusion spells. Why is this? Shouldn't illusions grant the user the ability to do some recon for the groups? (by providing faction). Why make the illusion KOS to all mobs in the zone? This mentality may be fine for low level encounters but at high level it's just a bunch of cheap parlor tricks with no real use.<BR>If Verant is open to the idea of allowing us to use some additional illusions in zones, we should (at least for high levels.. say 44+ or 50+) be granted some favorable faction as well. I suppose there is the possibility of abuse but maybe Verant can devise some way to avoid it. Their arguement that it would allow an enchanter to bypass certain encounters doesn't make sense. Yes it would but what's wrong with that? What's the point to illusions if they don't benefit us beyond the neat look? I would suggest that we encourage Verant to give us some additional illusions (such as the mentioned Copycat type) _and_ provide the factions involved with that race allowing us to be of greater use for scouting or enabling us to slip past areas to join a group deep in enemy territory.<P>Synge Drakesphyre Wizard<BR>Synge Drakmynd Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, Verant made part of the Enchanter name Illusionist.  Also, chanters have been nicknamed *Master of Illusions* but the right to change into models in the global file is limited for to enchanters but expanded for other classes.  I don't understand why enchanters can't make themselves look like a bear or a spectre if shamans and necros can turn into one.  The nature and undead thing is BS because enchanters can turn into wolves and skeletons so that responce won't work.  Enchanters can turn into a tree, a chair, a stump, a run, a lamp etc etc etc, turning into a bear or spectre would be no harder for them.  <P>    'Illusion : Copycat wah wah wah people will exploit it.'  As a programer I don't buy that.  When I turn into a barbarian, Halas still hates me, when I turn into an Ogre, Oggok still hates me.  I still have the bad part of my faction attached to whatever base faction I get for the illusion.  Why not just take the faction change out all together for a 'copycat' illusion??  Yeah I can change into a kobold in SolB but they still hate me anyway.  This would take away from the socializing with npc part of roleplaying but it would add more fun and allow other area's of role playing for the enchanters(especially in PC to PC contact, which if I'm not mistaken, is a major part of this game).  Don't say you can't do it because they're lying if they tell you that.  <P>Sidenote(Wolf Illusion used to be beta neutral faction and taken out of dungeons because it was too powerful and whiney druids and rangers complained they couldn't use it inside.  Now its not beta neutral but enchanters don't get SoW from it and still can't use it inside.)  <P>   Too many polygons for Spectre Illusion is BS too.  What about all the mages and necros running around that can make pets into them or change into it themselves?  One necro can add two spectre models at the same time to a zone now but enchanters can't have the ability for one?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have quoted here some of Silh's original comments and some of Absor's responses, with my own added at appropriate places. I have snipped those I'm not commenting on, I hope it doesn't come across out of context. Of course, I don't expect a response since only the original post seems to get noticed, so maybe I'll start a new thread later.<P>Absor:"Let me guess on these now, and I'll try to get more detailed answers for you later."<P>Me: Thankyou. Please remember to get back to us.<P>Absor: "Illusion gender, I don't know why that couldn't be done."<P>Me: Well, it has been suggested, and even responded to. If there is no "party line" you are aware of, please consider this, among other things, a petition for Illusion: Gender.<P>Absor: "I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of the things that determines how NPCs react to you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or she might very easily be able to travel anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that we want. "<P>Me: Race is _one of the things_ as you say, which influences reaction. Remember there is still reputation and religion parts to faction, and I'm sure there would be some way to negate any race-related faction issues in a creature. It seems you have simply put a skin over a standard pet for the mage illusion, and not copied all aspects of the creature when Monster Summoning is used. You also mentioned that this code was specially made for this spell. Is that so unreasonable to ask for illusions too, if need be?<P>Absor: "I'd never heard the idea of Illusion Pet. It's interesting, though I wonder how odd you'd look… "<P>Me: I can tell you how you'd look - like a shadowed man. Try giving a shadowed man armor or other weapons, I'm sure this would be the result. In fact, Illusion: Shadow might be a better name for it than Illusion: Animation or Illusion: Pet. This has been responded to officially before, too - I think by Abashi. He told us the special name this model is known by, and some reason I can't remember for it being unfeasible (right up there with why Illusion: Spectre is unfeasible. "oops")<P>Absor: "Some room and a lot of room are two different things. I imagine there will always be some room for things like that. The trick is how we use it, and would we rather give one class a new illusion, or create a whole new race? And, well, you got the new illusion, so I can't see the complaint… At that time there was 'room' for one more global (or ten more, or whatever, but one more that the programmers felt that they could spare for this use – remember, video memory does more than just store character art), and it was used for the new race. I see nothing wrong with that."<P>Me: Okay, and neither do I. But once there is a model in the globals file, is there any reason why we can't get an illusion for it? this question comes up again later.<P>Silh: "At this point, we, enchanters were quite confident over the fact that you were giving us in the near future a spectre illusion. There was this time no technical issues, since the model was already in the global file. Second big surprise : you chose NOT to give us the illusion. Reason behind ? You told us there was another technical issue (sigh) : the spectre model has too many polygons and enchanters running everywhere in spectre illusion could create lag."<P>Absor: "I've never heard that…<BR>"My personal opinion is that enchanters shouldn't have any undead illusions, that should all be left to the necros and their type. But I've never heard anyone say that spectres cause lag… I'll ask about that."<P>Me: Well, if you read through three or four hundred posts here, I'm sure you'll see about a hundred of us who HAVE heard of that. If you think we shouldn't have undead illusions, what does that say about our existing Illusion: Skeleton and Illusion: Drybone spells? It seems your personal opinion here is not in line with The Vision (tm) so could you please find out a second opinion on Illusion: Spectre?<P>Absor: "Actually, I think the bear was already global, but I don't know, I'll find out.<P>Me: I said it would return. If it is global, why not throw us a bone? but I've never seen a bear in Lower Guk.<P>Absor: "Again, my personal opinion would have it so that only druids and shamans were to get nature-type transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique factor with them, and not giving it to enchanters. Again, that's my personal feeling on it. I'll see if I can get an official response for you on the reasons why. But don't discount the whole uniqueness thing, it's important."<P>Me: Okay, borderline class-envy comment here. DAMN RIGHT uniqueness is important! That's our complaint! WE ARE ILLUSIONISTS, but you seem to be giving this unique skill to druids, shamans, and necros, with a nod to magicians, while we get nothing. This is not a nerf, and we lose no skills, and we don't go backwards objectively, but we LOSE OUR UNIQUENESS!<P>Absor: "I don't know how to respond to that. I doubt that I can change your feelings about this. All I can say is that nothing was done with the intent of making you, or any enchanter player for that matter, feel unhappy."<P>Me: Go back and read three hundred posts on the subject. Now repeat after me: Oops.<P><BR>from his next post:<BR>Absor: "Well, the problem here is that everyone (especially in this thread) uses the term illusion very loosely.

We get no speed increase, remember? while the Druids do, even the Wolf Pack. So there appears to be mechanics already in place to change the effects on an illusion.<P>enough for now. We still have no answer on the main point. Why the changes of tune, and different reasons given for the same thing, then turning around and actually giving Illusion: Spectre (by another name) to someone else?

</FONT><HR>Absor, please do NOT consider removing invisibility or invis undead from Enchanters and replacing it with a mob illusion.  I enjoy several benefits to my invis spells that I would not enjoy with a self only illusion buff.<P>First and foremost, as an enchanter with a deity (Tunare) I get killed a lot in my illusion forms because I can't hide my religion.  From a roleplaying perspective, I don't understand why this is; if I am the master of messing with people's minds certainly I should be able to fool them into thinking I follow their deity.  From a game balance perspective I understand it is to keep enchanters from being the only class in the game to be completely safe from faction-related death (they removed our scouting ability a long time ago guys and they aren't going to give it back).  So in situations where I know the creatures sense deities I rely on invisibility.  Without it, I would never have gotten any of my spells out of Neriak, or made it through other dangerous areas where invis is a must.<P>In my personal experience, having chosen a deity and thus rendering many of my illusions worthless (aside from the stats or bonuses) I know that there is a LOT to being an enchanter aside from the illusions.  The people who seem to think it is the one and only reason to play an enchanter are way off base.  Illusions don't do squat to help a party, our mez/buffs/etc do - I would rather have functional abilities than party favors to impress my friends.  If they never made another illusion for me, but addressed the high level play issues that Baelish outlined, I'd be happy.  <P>The fact that other classes can now transform into a couple of new forms that we can't, and that one class now can summon a monster to fight for them (with the name "Vebekn", etc over his head, which if anyone pays attention labels it as a pet, not a charmed creature so it doesn't threaten the "impress the newb" factor of seeing a camp of mobs suddenly start fighting each other) does not mean they threaten our status as illusionists at all.  The day I see a druid change himself into an iksar and go running into the heart of the iksar city and then with a wave of his hand turn into a dark elf to do another quest, then wave again, werewolf .. then I'll get a little peeved.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, why don't my illusion spells cover up my religion?  I was dumb enough to believe that there would be some roleplaying aspect to my beliefs when I created Leirra.  There is not ONE quest/item/ability that I can find dedicated to Erolissi Marr (heck, Erollisi or Erolissi it is not even spelled consistently).  All it does is keep me from being able to go into Neriak/Grobb/Callibus like my less faithful bretheren.<P>Where is the protection of my diety?  If not, why doesn't my illusion cover it?  Why doesn't illusion: undead *at least* give invis to undead.  You argued that enchanter illusions were simply alterations of appearance....why do they fail to alter appearances adequately? <P>Now you might argue benevolence/alliance, but that won't work either.  Having NEVER injured my Dark Elf faction in any way (no not even crushbone), I was still KoS even with benevolence.  Further, there is that trick where you have more than one faction up in the city, and they all work together.<P>You Appear<BR>Everyone in Neriak Begins to cast a spell<P>You offerred some religion specific stuff---for Tunare's CLERICS.  <P>So, how about Illusion: Agnostic that stacks with other Illusions?<BR>Illusion: Gender was a good idea. Make it stack.<BR>Illusion: Bear (looks like bear, but isn't change into bear...like spirit wolf)<BR>Illusion: other faces (I dislike some of my alt faces)<BR>Illusion: Armor (Who wouldn't want to look like they were wearing platemail sometimes?)<BR>Illusion: Spectre ...when our image is shifted out of focus and obscured in shadows, what DO we look like?  And I still fail to understand why we were told enchanters could not become spectres due to polygon counts, but Necros can because they actually TRANSFORM into undead.  Enchanters may be arguing semantics, but it doesn't change the fact thatargument we were given was.... inaccurate.<P>A master of illusions SHOULD be able to go most places unnoticed.  That is the whole point of creating illusions in the first place!  With corpse dragging now giving you insta-KoS, that should be less of an issue.  <P>Finally, as for Verant playing every class...<BR>If this is the case, why did it take so long to find out about alchemy?  Dual wielding?  Didn't know why bards expected their low-level mez to work after 30 (i.e. that other level 1 spells DO work on level 50 mobs)? Or any of a whole host of issues that you HAVE acknowledged is valid?  <P>You suggested that the original poster was implying that you played 'class favorites,' and that the implication was false because VI employees plays every class in equal numbers.<BR>All I can say is that if the VI staff does this, they are not playing the same game I am.  I think EVERYONE on my server over level 10 knows the Pegasus cloak is no-drop :P<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Castersrealm (Baelish) did a great job explaining why we are starting to get fed up.<P>The fact there are even MORE non-mezzables, MORE things above the charm cap of Boltran's, and more magic-immune mobs in velious then in Kunark which was already more then Norrath proper....it's killing us.<P>Now I don't know how you can really fix the damage already done to crowd control in velious and somewhat in kunark. And I can't even begin to think of how to compensate us...it's such a huge nerf but it only hits us half the time. But you have to recognize the nerf occured. If you guys need counseling to help repair the damage done to the balance teams ego's by admitting a mistake I'll see what I can do to arrange that ;-)<P>Crowd Control is THE defining role of an enchanter. Sure we have lots of side roles, but you really nerfed crowd control which is our main role in Kunark and then again in Velious not directly through spells so much (albeit you did somewhat with the lvl 54 cap on pre-50 mez and the new charm cap ending at 52). But instead you subtly nerfed it by tweaking the mix of mobs with each new expansion/dungeon. Slowly adding more and more mobs that can not be controlled by us.<P>No more entire zones of giants, dragons, or otherwise non-mezzable beings. Not until you make zones where heal doesn't work etc...nerf everyone the same.<P>Quick note on pets: You lower our pets dex, made it not duel weild like the rest, gave it less hp/ac, not benefit from slow delay weapons. Now we have to get hit to engage the pet, at 56 I can't do that. OK, so I got charm...it's capped at 52...I can't do that where I'm at. So I guess I should just use the weak pet anyway? No because then it wakes up mobs I want to sit still using mez and gets me killed...that's if the mobs aren't 54+ and unmezzable. See the problem? The entire pet line both charm and animations is becoming less and less useful over time.<P>Then you refused to even give us new illussions post 44 and call us illussionists/phantasmists. Ouch, a second attack..but with a reason...not enough space. Oh what's this? more space? New excuse: causes lag..oh what? Doesn't cause lag you can give it to other classes? Please guys...make up your minds. Your really frustrating us enchanters by feeding us those false excuses.<P>And cities of merchants I can't get to indifferent with collaboration + any illussion when I'm only a few mob kills from Non-KoS already? That has to be fixed. That arsenal of spells is intended to compensate for a high elf to wander in oggok and do it well enough to make friends while they are mortal enemies. Yet in velious someone who is borderline on acceptance can't be swayed hardly at all? Grrr...<P>As for illussions...enchanters need to go in just about anywhere...enchanters should be the best scouts, right up there with rogues.  Could you somehow perhaps give us some form of "imitate" spell that essentially works like sneak? You can fool some mobs but once in a while your strange accent or behavior is a dead giveaway. Just like sometimes a rogue steps on a twig or a mob has a good sense of smell/hearing or whatever. It has to be on par with sneaks efectivness...everyone has invisibility we should have better then invis.<P>Eye is in the global file..I'll say it the 4th time ;-) I was thinking more about how to use it.<BR>Illussion: eye<BR>Level 51<BR>Levitate<BR>See Invis<BR>Ultravision<BR>Duration: Until you zone or cancel<BR>(it's rather non-impact)<P>Perhaps make it non-KoS...but drop if you cast or /corpse? I mean I could use cast sight on mobs to chain scout. Or I could send in a rogue sneaking.<P>Sure maybe I could get to some location unmolested. But if I so much as hit gate illussion drops and the 30 mobs around me beat me to a pulp (Like I'm a pinata and my guts are pieces of candy, I have no ac/hp) because I got there ALONE.<P>BTW the topic is "enchanters in velious: End of my illussions" yes, with a focus on illusions. But including how we function after velious's release. So please don't say "off topic".<P>You can't balance things on an item by item basis you have to look at the whole picture. I think this is evident with necros. Sure none of thier talents is overwhelmingly powerful but you keep adding every spell in all the other classes lists to necros and they are starting to get overpowered. Yet on an item by item basis they are fine.<P>With the addition of fairly useless spells as oppossed to the generally extremely useful 1-2 velious spells for each of the other classes (and a few useless ones as well) we got kind of shafted.<P>And you call us enchanters yet rangers enchant. Sure we can make metal, that's all nice and good. But without help from other classes we can't do much, and thier classes didn't say "enchants weapons and swords" in the description ours did..rangers...they hit a spell icon. We need to use much mana, expensive materials, learn trades to high levels and recruit help from other classes.<P>Further point you say enchanters and shaman can enchant. You guys gave the ability to enchant to druids, clerics, mages, as well and who knows who else...pretty much everyone. OK, fine game balance..sure you can argue that we were unbalanced in trades. But by giving our talent to multiple other classes we took a small hit in viability as a whole. One more novelty of being an enchanter GONE, with no compensation.<P>Verant has slowly been devaluing the enchanter class more and more as the months go on and quite frankly we are at a breaking point here. You can't remove weapon enchanting, illussions, faction, crowd control, pets and give new stuff to the other classes without making us very very irritated.<P>Please feel free to read this a second time. I realize my grammer is lacking and this tiny little window only lets me see a sentence at a time so proof reading is next to impossible. But the points are genuine.<P>P.S. I like the Santa/Fironia Vie it's cool but the ad banner refreshing keeps making me pause while I type. Can we make that not refresh or refresh slower? The people will still see the same ad for just as long but not in 2 second increments.<P>I know...It's a long post. I'm famous for them.<P>I have many characters...the one of relevance to the topic:<P>-Citra Brooke-<BR>56 Enchanter<BR>VEESHAN</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First off, thanks for the response. It's definately a hotbutton issue for benders.<P>Here's some clarification for you.<P>This point was referenced before but my not have been clear enough.<P>Absor: "And the reason for that is still true (as I mentioned in my reply). It would allow an enchanter to go wherever he or she wanted and never be attacked. I highly doubt that a mage pet will be doing tours of Veeshan's Peak on its own any time soon."<P>This is not in the mechanics of the game as it stands atm. Our Undead illsions are a prefect example. Our undead illusions do not change faction. We are still kos to them.<P>Now, I'm a DBA first and a coder second. I realize that there may be a lot of work involved in changing that code, but there shouldn't be. Please sit down with your code team and find out what's involved and let us know.<P>If it's bad, then there were some strange design decisions made early on. That I can except as no one is perfect. But I can tell you that a simple, "we messed up and didn't foresee this situation and thus didn't code for it" may indeed go a long way to smooth the justly ruffled feathers of the "Illusionists".<P>Thanks for all the work.<P>Kinder,<P>Try reading the thread to see what this is about...

</FONT><HR>My point is this.  "Illusions" and "Transformations" seem to have the same effects.  Why is it that they have different descriptions.  To be truely called and "Illusion", there would be no stat enhancers.  To say that this was not the way it was intended is not a valid excuse.  A lot of Enchanter spells are "Transformations".  This being the reason why you can't use "Druids, Shamans, and Necromancers are transforming.  That's why Enchanters don't get it", arguement.<P>From a roleplaying aspect, illusions would grant the faction ability of that illusion.  Illusions are just that, illusions.  It makes a person or think he is seeing something other than the true form.  That form is not taken on, itself.  Don't beleive me?  Look up the word.<P>I think, a long time ago, VI made a mistake by giving Illusions stats.  Now, they are paying for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I also *love* to roleplay during downtime/boring plane raids/long low level camps.  I find my illusions that I currently have are nice, I actually am  very glad that necro's got spectre, and shm/dru got bear, and I'm hapy for them, I don't want these illusions for myself 'because I need to be the best'.  I do feel 'betrayed' because we where lied to about the global file multiple times, and we were lied to about illusion spectre.  I have a decent lenght post I was saving for the right time at home, I'll post it here.<P>I would ask that all enchanters provide some 'cool' illusions they could impliment, I have a few off the top of my head.<P>51: illusion fire imp -- elemental faction<BR>53: illusion emerald drake -- wolf faction<BR>55: illusion froggy -- 'good' racial faction (so u cant walk through guk pharming)<BR>56: illlusion fire beetle -- wolf faction<BR>57: illusion wyvern -- elemental faction<BR>58: illusion rock dervish/blade fein -- elemental faction<BR>59: illusion sex -- no faction<BR>60: illusion spectral &lt;race&gt; like the ghost in unrest of spectral callers in karnors -- undead faction or no faction.<P>some other ideas,<P>illusion tenticle terror (this would be cool, add double attack but make it self only (cause we all know MELEE ENCHANTER gets lots of groups  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<BR>illusion basalisk<BR>illusion newbie -- turns you into a naked level 1 character in /who zone and hides your robe and equipment unless inspected<BR>illusion giant<BR>illusion goblin<BR>illusion kunark goblin<BR>illusion orc<BR>illusion iksar skeleton<BR>illusion gnome skeleton (dono if this is a model)<BR>illusion *class* makes you appear to be wearing armor generally asociated with a level 58+ of that class (not changing weapons or stats or anything)<BR>illusion &lt;some silvery texture already in the global file&gt; enchanter pet<BR>illusion sarnak (part of the epic quest)<BR>illusion aviak (like the enchanter guildmaster in freeport... who I might add isn't a good enough enchanter to even have his epic item, so therefore that might be a reward on the first part of epic with the a sarnak imitator guy)<BR>illusion current pet -- only change faction if certain mob types (eg not seb frog or soemthing)<BR>illusion bat<BR>illusion rat<BR>illusion kobold<BR>illusion shroom<BR>illusion mini-deity (proy not)<BR>illusion frost giant (velious spell)<BR>illusion whatever kinda wurm (velious spell)<BR>illusion gnoll<BR>illusion centaur (the horse/men people)<BR>illusion tar-goo/the goo stuff in dalnir<BR>illusion farie<BR>illusion bixie (is that same model as farie?)<BR>illusion butterfly (in FV)<BR>illusion tiger/rino stuff like that from OT<BR>illusion the new spectre model in tower of frozen shadow (proy not)<BR>minor illusion with 95% snare instead of root (worthless but good enough)<BR>illusion I dono the stuff in perma very well but mebe one of those<BR>illusion golem (this one would be cool, ele faction again, mebe some STR but nothing more than WW form)<BR>illusion pox scarab (seb)<BR>illusion the dinasour things in WL and TT/EJ<BR>illusion &lt;whatever is in CoM -- never been there hehe&gt;<BR>illusion the cazic guys that guard OT outpost, outdoor only evil faction<BR>illusion gnawler or whatever (mouths with tails)<BR>illusion chromodrake<BR>There is one unique mob in SoNH (swamp of no hope) cant remember what it is<BR>Illusion griff<BR>illusion drovrang<BR>illusion never been to HS, might be something cool there<BR>illusion forest elemental, group spell, causes eveeryone to be green elementals who proc root<BR>Illusion spider<P><BR>********<BR>Thats All I can think of that would be illusionable atm, I listed the extras in order that *I* personally thought they where cool, but thats subjective.

</FONT><HR>You're wanting what happened to necros to happen to you. Necros have everything and are totally overpowering because they looked at the necro and said "wow! wouldn't it be cool if this, because necros should be this way" with resses since they are so involved with undead shouldn't they be able to bring a corpse to life for example. You are acting like enchanters are all about illusions, how helpful are your illusions? do people group with you because your illusions? what do you want more, clarity and breeze or illusion bear? on a role playing stand point enchanters are the master of illusion, on a game play stand point they are the masters of croud control,with all the unbalance in the game you are complaining about "fun" spells? you are already good so stuff is being given to other people, it isn't like everyone is balanced so everyone should be getting an equal amount of everything, the perfect example of unbalance is the rogue, even if you don't play one you know rogues aren't very good, by making this whole fun spells ruckus, that you want because you are already good and want something new, you are pretty much saying ignore the rogues, which will probably never be REALLY looked at, to give you new illusions would be unbalancing though, even though they are fun spells, by spending time on enchanters other classes, like the rogue, would be put off leaving the game in unbalance<P>for enchanters being the master of illusion, which is a role playing stand point, here are examples of why other classes should get things:<BR>-magician ports, they "summon" a gate way or worm hole<BR>-monk heals, well monks are pretty relgious based in real life, so shouldn't they being using the power of the gods to heal?<BR>-rogue one hit blows, you have all seen and heard of rogues killing with a clean swipe<BR>-enchanter feign death, it would be an illusion of a corpse<BR>-druids starting with 100 in sense heading, they are the masters of outdoors<BR>-monk pickpocket, with that dexterity and swiftness? why not?<BR>-enchanter being able to charm a mob, and then make the mob give them its money and loot<P>and about druids and shamans getting new illusion spells, do you now think druids and shamans are now the masters off illusion because wolf form, tree form, and bear form? which aren't illusions, they are actually turning into wolves and the like, druids are not supposed to server one purpose, which they do kiting in a way, if I wanted someone to heal I would want a cleric over a druid, if I wanted extra direct damage I would want a wizard, if I wanted buffs I would get shaman, if I wanted croud control, druids get harmony and animal kind of things which are crappy,I would get an enchanter, if I wanted evacuations I would get wizard, they do come with an extra packed punch, so as much as everyone uses druids as an excuse they aren't the best of everything, or even the best of one thing with everything else on the side</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I felt like crying when I read the original post. Silth made such an eloquent case, I couldn't help it. Right after reading his post I went over to the Mage boards on several sites and read about what they were saying about their Monster Summoning spells. Guess what I found?<BR>Remember the excitement you used to hear on the boards about seeing mobs fight each other. The swapping of stories and acheivements. The messages that USED to be on Enchanter boards. Well, those smiles and glee are there now. Don't get me wrong, I don't begrudge other classes their spells and abilities. But for God's sake in the name of all that is holy please maintain class distinction. Druids can track better than Rangers, Mages have pets that simulate our charming abilities, Bards can regen mana better than Enchanters. I could go on.
