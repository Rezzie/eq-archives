Keep in mind that these ‘talks’ are geared toward making sure that the classes are ‘balanced’. Please work toward that goal when posting (yes, even if that means you suggest a ‘nerf’). But I’m also interested in hearing about bugs and such too, I’m just not going to focus on them.<P>Here are the notes that I already have. Keep in mind that these are only my notes, and just because I’ve listed something does NOT mean that I like the idea or that the designers are working on making changes based on these notes. This is just what it is, a list of ideas. I’ve also added my notes to you all under the header of Note:<P>AoE spells: Mentioned elsewhere… (earlier on my list, probably under mages: basically the idea here is that maybe pets should be removed from the equation).<P>Gaze/Glimpse: Due to the clipping plane, these spells don’t really allow further seeing, just zooming in (which makes your resolution worse anyhow).<P>Note: this may not be ‘fixable’ at all due to the way the game works. It’s not like we can force your PC into a higher resolution when you use this spell…<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder: There seems to be a problem with these spells. Since they will not teleport you up, they don’t work too well in hilly terrain; because the spell only sends you a few feet (stopping when it reaches a hill or building).<P>Note: Again, this may also not be something we can change, but it’s on the list.<P>Bind Sight: Seems to cause viewer to see the target as running into walls or spinning in circles if target goes up an incline.<P>Enstill: It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive. <P>Cazic Gate: At level spell is attained, using it will most often cause death because the caster appears amidst many aggressive monsters that /con white to them.<P>Note: We’ve actually discussed this before. If I remember correctly, the general feeling was that having a dangerous gate like this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But it is also still on my list.<P>Tishan’s Relocation: This spell evacuates you to a very dangerous location, a monster crossroads in the Skyfire mountains. Could the location be moved, or was it intended that this be a very dangerous evacuation spell?<P>Note: See note about Cazic Gate.<P>Concussion: A level 39 spell dropped by a creature in a location that requires a party of level 50s to handle. Should it be in such a location?<P>Icestrike effects: Graphical effect looks like fire.<P>Lightning Bolt effects: looks exactly like Fire Bolt.<P>Other lightning and cold effects: It seems that there might be other spells that have the look of fire when they should not.<P>Having just re-read this list, I see nothing at all related to actual balancing stuff. This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such (with the possible exception of Area of Effect spells, changing those would certainly have an effect on class balances). So, please, try to focus on balance issues…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I’ll be as brief as I can so that Alan doesn’t have to strain his eyes any more than needed.<P>BALANCE ISSUES<BR>These are things that relate directly to the balance of the Wizard class in the game.<P>-Too weak and easily killed at lower levels<BR>-Unable to contribute in highest level Velious fights (due to hit point totals)<BR>-Damage Inequities (levels 1-15 and 34-38 outgunned by other classes)<BR>-Resistance cap at 6+ or 1.2x level reduced Wizard to meditating when party needs him most<BR>-Harvest post 50 appears to not work properly<BR>-Needing to dip as many as 15 levels for a given damage type of Fire, Cold, Magic<BR>-Damage poorly scaled compared to monster’s hit points (damage output and value to group by level lowers each level)<BR>-Mana efficiency and damage too poor for group contribution when compared to melee and pet classes at lower levels<BR>-Fizzles at highest levels too common<BR>-Tishan’s Relocation is a deathtrap, that is unacceptable for an evac spell.<P>REPAIR ISSUES<BR>These are things that are only slightly related to balance but contribute to imbalance because they are not working properly.<P>-Al’Kabor line costs too much mana and does too little damage to be of any use<BR>-Concussion Spell quest requires you to be significantly higher level than the spell<BR>-Imbue Fire Opal is in Nagafen’s Lair, nothing you can achieve at the level of the spell<BR>-Area Effect Rain spells STILL have problems (not enough waves of effect, highly resistable)<BR>-Bind Sight spell sticks and stops moving<BR>-Fade, Shadowstep, Yonder will not teleport you UP and will not port beyond objects<BR>-Bonds of Force has Z-axis problems<BR>-Enstill costs more mana and casts slower but almost never has any more effect than normal root.<BR>-Staff of Temperate Flux worthless in its intended use (needs more than 6 points of resistance reduction on cold/fire)<BR>-Post 35 innate resistance reduction does not appear to be in the game, if so it is very insignificant<BR>-Area Effect spells are sporatically efficient, often are not, and in no pattern (making them consistently useful would encourage their use and learning)<BR>-Cazic Thule gate in a poor place, move outside<BR>-Color/Graphic issues (red ice, etc)<BR>-Level 44 interrupt blast is too slow to hope to interrupt spells unless you really get lucky<BR>-O’Kiels Flickering Flame costs too much mana.<P>ENHANCEMENT ISSUES<BR>These are areas that, like giving Resist Cold to Rangers or better heals to Druids would make Wizards a class that people want to group with more and more useful.<P>-Push Ports (teleports with y/n dialog box that send the target to the location but not the Wizard)<BR>-Bigger blasts past level 50, so people won’t have to use AE Rains on single targets to be able to do damage<BR>-Lower level Draught-type spells (without the mana efficiency) for that quick blast in an emergency<BR>-Lower level Lure-type spells (Verant keeps adding EXTREMELY resistant creatures to the game even at levels lower than 44).<P>CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES<BR>These are issues with the concept and design of the Wizard class, where the idea behind the class or areas in it are troubled.<P>-UV spell is at highest level of all classes and self only (sight spells SPECIFICALLY mentioned in description of class and concept, why is this so?)<BR>-Sight line (glimpse etc) have no actual effect, would be nice if these could be fixed<BR>-Quick damage is supposed to compensate for downtime and no contribution without mana, does it?  Is Wizard damage really faster and better in the short term, and is this a valid design concept, given the nature of groups now and aggro?<BR>-Start out weak and grow to be the same power level as everyone else, valid concept?<BR>-Planar Gates, we get 2 of the 5, one requires an expensive gem and one we don’t have much reason to go to.  Why keep adding more that Wizards don’t port to?<BR>-Why was the description of Wizards written the way it was, and what changed between its writing and now that required it to be altered and for it to not be true?<BR>-Wizards have notable weaknesses<BR>--no contribution without mana<BR>--unable to assist group if over resist cap<BR>--any other class can clear a dungeon of low greens without stopping<BR>--related to above, helpless without mana (low greens easily kill)<BR>Is the rest of the class design adequate compensation for these weaknesses?<BR>-Gravity Flux at higher level than Enchanters, who get NO other AE spells.<P>WISH LIST<BR>Just goodies we can dream about, nothing critical but hey, why not bring it up while you are paying attention?<P>-Sense monster line (gives basic information about monsters like if they have high resistances, their social tendencies (groups up, runs, etc), what kind they are (undead, summoned etc).<BR>-Make Staff of the Wheel look distinct (Wizards have nothing like a pet etc to look unique)<BR>-Eye of Zomm that can swim (present one has swimming of 1)<BR>-Spell that lets Wizards see through any atmospheric effect as if it wasn’t there<BR>-Spell that lets Wizards see underwater clearly (crocodile eye effect always).<BR>-Pointy hat! (with a brim or the top bent over)<BR>-Familiar (non combatant pet mostly for show)<BR>-WK portal moved<BR>-Ocean of Tears portal<BR>-Low level skin spells (using low level reagent)<BR>-spell that only interrupts casting, quick cast time<BR>-spell that lets Wizards read any language<BR>-spell that lets Wizards comprehend and speak any language<BR>-tracking spell (have to recast each target, limited time period)<BR>-bigger, powerful blasts with poor mana efficiency, low casting time and long recast time<BR>-Guild Gate (Clerics got the idea from this-makes more sense for Wizards) ports you to your racial home guild<BR>-Shadowstep type spell that ports you in random distance within 90 degrees of facing<BR>-Magic Resist self buff<BR>-Poison/Disease self buff upgrade.<BR>-More Wizard quests (class with the fewest class-specific quests in the game, seekers of what?)<BR>-More Wizard only items (see above).<P>Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>GStaff has most of the issues pegged pretty well.<P>I personally want to see the Al'Kabor line switched to be castable only on a group member, and I want it to act as a point blank aoe centered on that target party member. The aggro would be counted as if it were the "tank" targeted. That way we could be useful in groups because the extra damage/taunt could keep the monster on the tank.<P>The exact damage, cast, recast, mana, resists, area, and max affected I leave to the game designers to work out.<P>Animated</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agree with almost every point made by Grimstaff. Man, I hope Absor is taking notes. Thats the best post so far. Especially the Wish List.<P>Playing a low-level Wizard is such a pain, there should be a pay-off at higher levels. Yes, I know this thread is about balancing issues.

</FONT><HR>I still wonder how we are part of the same mana pool that the our casters are when they have the ability to get there mana back after there pet has been cast, seems a bit odd to me, too bad we don't have some item that we can quest for to store mana. I dont really see an imbalance with it since the other catsers (Magaician,Necro and Enchanter) all get the chance to regain there mana once spent to make there pet.<P>I really don't see us with pets, just seems sort of weird, the one we get at 57 or 58 still seems out of place but i think it was put in only because they (Verant) ran out of ideas and wanted to try something different but something that wasent too powerful to unbalance us.<P>We have alot of potential as a class but i think we have been over looked for a while because we seemed to be as balanced as a class can get in Everquest and when i say balanced i mean where we're not stepping on the toes of the other classes out there but with all the melee upgrades(much better weapons in Kunark, skill upgrades past 50 and the HP's being raised on some Kunark MOB's but more on the  Velious ones) we have fallen a bit short of where we can be in the damage dealing area.<P>Maybe its time to separate the casters from the true Damage dealers I'm just at a loose as how to do it.<P>Just wondering..how many of us Wizards out there would be willing to give up there Harvest to have a self-only clarity(one that stacks with our own Epic weapon effect and breeze,clarity and clarity 2)?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Turn skim mode off please =)<P>Please think about this seriously - might have been mentioned before but take a look. (If it has I'm sorry, only read about 2/3 of the posts)<P>Rather than give Wizards a separate mana regen spell or independent mana boost:<BR>Make the Enchanter's line of mana regeneration WORK better/faster on a Wizard only.   This would further the interdependence of Wizards and Enchanters and would have far less affect on soloing.  In the way a complete heal better benefits a Warrior because of his massive hit points, the enchanter's mana regeneration will better benefit the Wizard because of his great dependence on mana ALONE.   With the Wizard having less down time it might contribute to being wanted in groups more. =)<P>You can turn skim mode back on =)<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>If warriors are the base class for melee, and clerics are the base clase for healers, then wizards should be the base class for casters.  Wizards get nothing, they can't chain cast cause of the taunt factor, they will get pummelled, so post 50, they just sit and med and occasinally blast for about 650 damage.  In the meantime, the tanks and rogues are stacking up WAY more damage, so what is the wizards purpose?  There isnt one in groups.

</FONT><HR>Sure would be nice if -*wizard*- AE's didn't break mez.<P>I know it sounds nuts but how many of us really use AEs from 1-50??  They make up about one third of our spells.  That's ridiculous.  NO, it's worse than that.  Was our spell list scrawled out on a paper napkin and handed to a coder 30 minutes before the Gold phase?<P>Enchanters don't get a second AE stun till what, level 20 or so??  You just can't pull off AE without chainstunning.  It's nearly impossible till they get at least 2 stuns to cycle between.<P>In fact I think the number of totally useless/unused spells outnumber the ones we regularly use at most levels.<P>Another idea would be to give wizards a new line of "Hate and Aggression" spells.  When cast on the tank it would cause all mobs to aggro on that tank(group only of course).<P>At 12 the spell would cause 60pts of damage aggro to be directed at all mobs within close proximity of the tank.  At 24 it would be 120pts, etc.<P>If Verant is scared to death of letting us compete with other classes' damage with regular DD they should give us a COMPLETE set of tools in which to use AE in groups.  Note that here again this would be of no use to us in soloing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I do not care how you do it, but make us wanted for our skill in a group.  Do not make it so any one of three classes can easily sub for us.<P>Look at the enchanter...perfect (mostly).  It does exactly what the manual says...and no one comes close to doing what they do.  Why is it then, that mages, druids, and necros can easily substitute for a wizard...sure they do about 100-200 points less dmg a round than a wizard spell but when a mob has 15k hit points ,who cares.<P>Bottom line:  We are not DISTINCT in what we do.  Other classes come very close and offer other benefits to the group. I gave up Hitpoints, Armor Class, a Pet, Charm, Good Self Buffs, Group Buffs, to do one thing and do that thing better than anyone...but I am sadly disappointed.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, Grim's post pretty much sums up most wizards concerns.  Even for the lower and mid levels (which I think get's ignored at most times).<P>I realize that the class balance thread is meant to balance out the classes at the high end of the game, but I think it's important for lower levels and mid levels to count for something.  What I mean is, wizards aren't anything special at lower levels (1-20), then we kinda even out with most classes during mid levels (20-40), then (from what I understand) start to get quite powerfull until level 50 and then it goes down hill all the way until 60.  <P>To mean this doesn't seem to make sense, but maybe that's just me.<P>One last thing that I would like to add and hope that it doesn't take away from what I have said ... but I really think it's funny that all the necros are whining their heads off that they didn't get any enhancements on test yet. Hehe, like they are as 'broken' as us wizards are.

Glad you didn't.<P>"I’ll be as brief as I can so that Alan doesn’t have to strain his eyes any more than needed.<BR>BALANCE ISSUES<BR>These are things that relate directly to the balance of the Wizard class in the game."<P>"-Too weak and easily killed at lower levels"<BR>"lvl x wizard looking for a tank"  I never saw the problem with wizzie.  I did see the problem with pickup groups.  At low levels we solo sooo badly, IMO.  It is a grouping game.  Group.<P>"-Unable to contribute in highest level Velious fights (due to hit point totals)"<BR>I will never be in these fights, so I am not entitled to an opinion.<P>"-Damage Inequities (levels 1-15 and 34-38 outgunned by other classes)"<BR>OK.  And?<P>"-Resistance cap at 6+ or 1.2x level reduced Wizard to meditating when party needs him most"<BR>Don't fight those, you will lose a lot.<P>"-Harvest post 50 appears to not work properly"<BR>Hope they fix it.<P>"-Needing to dip as many as 15 levels for a given damage type of Fire, Cold, Magic"<BR>Yep.  OK.<P>"-Damage poorly scaled compared to monster’s hit points (damage output and value to group by level lowers each level)"<BR>I don't see this.  "Can you come help kill Naggy on x day?"  I hear this pretty regularly.  Soon I won't unless I sell deaths.<P>"-Mana efficiency and damage too poor for group contribution when compared to melee and pet classes at lower levels"<BR>I don't see this.<P>"-Fizzles at highest levels too common"<BR>Yep and not just for us.  Hope they change it.<P>"-Tishan’s Relocation is a deathtrap, that is unacceptable for an evac spell."<BR>OK, it was an evac in the ancient days, before the critters that wander there were there?  Don't use it if you don't like it?  I use it whenever dying won't cost me a level.  I have died only 1 time.  *shrug*  I used it the day I found Karnors.  SoW, Lev, Invis(to shorten the agro radious - and yes you can, it just takes a friend to help.  Group up.)<P>"REPAIR ISSUES<BR>These are things that are only slightly related to balance but contribute to imbalance because they are not working properly."<P>"-Al’Kabor line costs too much mana and does too little damage to be of any use"<BR>Yep.  Take them out.  It confuses wizards as Al was supposed to be a great wizard and his spells suxor so badly.<P>"-Concussion Spell quest requires you to be significantly higher level than the spell"<BR>Yah, like the staff of the wheel for most folks.  Have friends or wait til later.<P>"-Imbue Fire Opal is in Nagafen’s Lair, nothing you can achieve at the level of the spell"<BR>Have friends or wait til later.  I guess they could nerf the spell.  But why?  A fellow passed these to us the day Naggy fell after they were discovered.<P>"-Area Effect Rain spells STILL have problems (not enough waves of effect, highly resistable)"<BR>Pretty much a waste, really.  Maybe they should take them out, it confuses people to have the spells in the book and not use them.<P>"-Bind Sight spell sticks and stops moving"<BR>"-Fade, Shadowstep, Yonder will not teleport you UP and will not port beyond objects"<BR>Hehe.  They are trying, I think.  Not sure the engine is going to be up to this.  EQ2 maybe?<P>"-Bonds of Force has Z-axis problems"<BR>Z-axis in EQ is a real problem in manymanymany places.  I mean, comon, you cant shoot your bow straight down a wall at an enymy.  DOH.  Not sure the engine is going to be up to this.  EQ2 maybe?<P>"-Enstill costs more mana and casts slower but almost never has any more effect than normal root."<BR>OK.  And sometimes it does.  And when it does and it saves your life, that is good.  Should they take it out?<P>"-Staff of Temperate Flux worthless in its intended use (needs more than 6 points of resistance reduction on cold/fire)"<BR>Not so.  I use it whenever the mages/shammies are not going to be able to.  It helps.  It is noticeable.<P>"-Post 35 innate resistance reduction does not appear to be in the game, if so it is very insignificant"<BR>I see it. My druid is only a bit behind my wizzie.  He has a lot more resists casting "sortasimilar" spells.  Maybe the effect should be more pronounced. *shrug*<P>"-Area Effect spells are sporatically efficient, often are not, and in no pattern (making them consistently useful would encourage their use and learning)"<BR>Playing a wizzie is hard.  Using AE well is harder.  OK.<P>"-Cazic Thule gate in a poor place, move outside"<BR>I use it regularly...but you gotta really want to.  I considered fixing my faction but decided waxing lizzies whenever I wanted was more fun.<P>"-Color/Graphic issues (red ice, etc)"<BR>Cute.  Nice to have only.<P>"-Level 44 interrupt blast is too slow to hope to interrupt spells unless you really get lucky"<BR>So group up and share the load.  Use clerics and druids and ... group, see?<P>"-O’Kiels Flickering Flame costs too much mana."<BR>Is another spell to confuse wizzies.  GZ, this was a mean trick, I think.  It looks bad.<P>"ENHANCEMENT ISSUES<BR>These are areas that, like giving Resist Cold to Rangers or better heals to Druids would make Wizards a class that people want to group with more and more useful."<P>"-Push Ports (teleports with y/n dialog box that send the target to the location but not the Wizard)"<BR>OK but if you MUST then make it an ini-file entry.  I hate the idea.  I can just see dying waiting for a lagged "ok" to go through on a group gate.<P>"-Bigger blasts past level 50, so people won’t have to use AE Rains on single targets to be able to do damage."<BR>Guess I am not high enough yet.  Good to me at 52.<P>"-Lower level Draught-type spells (without the mana efficiency) for that quick blast in an emergency"<BR>OK.  But this seems like a lot of work for a little return?<P>"-Lower level Lure-type spells (Verant keeps adding EXTREMELY resistant creatures to the game even at levels lower than 44)."<BR>Yah, what is up with these lowbie MOBs with high resistances?  Impacts all classes.  Change the MOBS instead, please.<P>"CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES<BR>These are issues with the concept and design of the Wizard class, where the idea behind the class or areas in it are troubled."<P>"-UV spell is at highest level of all classes and self only (sight spells SPECIFICALLY mentioned in description of class and concept, why is this so?)"<BR>Marketing?  It is a neat spell although VERY limited?  I like it. I wish it did more, but every engine has limits.<P>"-Sight line (glimpse etc) have no actual effect, would be nice if these could be fixed"<BR>It is a neat spell although VERY limited?  I like it. I wish it did more, but every engine has limits.<P>"-Quick damage is supposed to compensate for downtime and no contribution without mana, does it? Is Wizard damage really faster and better in the short term, and is this a valid design concept, given the nature of groups now and aggro?"<BR>Yes, I can drop a mob into run mode quickly.  I have been chain-summoned and run out from under the critter each time.  It lost.  We won.  Nice loot too.  Wise choices and strategy are required.  Playing a wizzie is hard, eh?  I love it.<P>"-Start out weak and grow to be the same power level as everyone else, valid concept?"<BR>Never seen this.  I duo'ed with a druid from 5 to 28 continuously.  He controled them and we killed them...and I did more killing than he did.<P>"-Planar Gates, we get 2 of the 5, one requires an expensive gem and one we don’t have much reason to go to. Why keep adding more that Wizards don’t port to?"<BR>Because everyone hates having to have wizards to port them up?  Wizards complain about the reagent cost?  *shrug*  Um and both require an expensive gem...kinda.  If I needed plat I knew where it dropped from blues at the levels this was "expensive".<P>"-Why was the description of Wizards written the way it was, and what changed between its writing and now that required it to be altered and for it to not be true?"<BR>Never seen this.  Marketing.  This is why I waited til after beta and let others tell me how great the game was, and how I wanted a wizard instead of a mage.  Sometimes I have regretted this. SO I play my mage a while.  Wizzie is *MUCH* higher.<P>"-Wizards have notable weaknesses"<BR>"--no contribution without mana"<BR>Enchanters, Clerics, Druid?  I see this as a fact but not a weakness.<BR>"-unable to assist group if over resist cap"<BR>Correct.  And?  Leave those alone.  You will die alot if not.<BR>"--any other class can clear a dungeon of low greens without stopping"<BR>ROFL.  No.<P>"--related to above, helpless without mana (low greens easily kill)"<BR>Yep. Your point?  I died and popped at my bind point on the dock in OOT, some fool had pulled the pirate there.  Dratted thing nearly beat me to death.  A kind VERY GREEN PC came over and rescued my wizzie.  Thank you whoever you were.  If you want to mele be a tank.<P>"Is the rest of the class design adequate compensation for these weaknesses?"<BR>"-Gravity Flux at higher level than Enchanters, who get NO other AE spells."<BR>Your point?  I see this as a tool to get up on ledges and a fun spell.  WAY more effective in the spell book of an NPC.<P>WISH LIST<BR>Just goodies we can dream about, nothing critical but hey, why not bring it up while you are paying attention?<P>"-Sense monster line (gives basic information about monsters like if they have high resistances, their social tendencies (groups up, runs, etc), what kind they are (undead, summoned etc)."<BR>Fun.  I like it.  Wrong thread.<P>"-Make Staff of the Wheel look distinct (Wizards have nothing like a pet etc to look unique)"<BR>Fun.  I like it.  Wrong thread.<P>"-Eye of Zomm that can swim (present one has swimming of 1)"<BR>Yah, that spell is a fun party trick. I have used it for pulling a couple of times, and for fun.<P>"-Spell that lets Wizards see through any atmospheric effect as if it wasn’t there"<BR>I LOVE THIS.  Wrong thread.<P>-Spell that lets Wizards see underwater clearly (crocodile eye effect always).<BR>I LOVE THIS.  Wrong thread.<P>"-Pointy hat! (with a brim or the top bent over)"<BR>Cute - no balance.<P>"-Familiar (non combatant pet mostly for show)"<BR>Cute - no balance.<P>"-WK portal moved"<BR>Would be nice, but I am betting it was too late the 1st day the zone was exported.<P>"-Ocean of Tears portal"<BR>Not a balance issue.  If they give it to us they should activate the druid one.  Different thread.<P>"-Low level skin spells (using low level reagent)"<BR>OK.  Why?<P>"-spell that only interrupts casting, quick cast time."<BR>Valuable, especially if it was like a lure.  This sounds like an actual balance issue because we could be valuable on CH-casting mobs.  Esp if the aggro was low, and it was chainable.  hmm.  sound unbalancing.<P>"-spell that lets Wizards read any language"<BR>I like this a lot.  And put quests in the game that use it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Not a balance issue, fun though.  Belongs in another thread.<P>"-spell that lets Wizards comprehend and speak any language"<BR>Cute, useless.  Does not go on this thread.<P>"-tracking spell (have to recast each target, limited time period)"<BR>Not our area.  Like damage shield and invis to undead.  If you want tracking, have a ranger, bard or druid close at hand.<P>"-bigger, powerful blasts with poor mana efficiency, low casting time and long recast time."<BR>Why? To die with?  I don't understand the point.  I hear "we don't do enough damage per load of mana".  This would make the problem worse?<P>"-Guild Gate (Clerics got the idea from this-makes more sense for Wizards) ports you to your racial home guild."<BR>Cool Idea.  Nothing to do with balance.  Should not be here.<P>"-Shadowstep type spell that ports you in random distance within 90 degrees of facing"<BR>I think this is what the current spell should do.<P>"-Magic Resist self buff"<BR>We have this.  It stacks with the priest line of MR.<P>"-Poison/Disease self buff upgrade."<BR>Not our line of work, should not be there at all.<P>"-More Wizard quests (class with the fewest class-specific quests in the game, seekers of what?)"<BR>"-More Wizard only items (see above)."<BR>There is a lot of variety now, not sure they should do this.  Would have been nice once but.  *shrug*  EQ2 I think.<P>Wants aside.  And gripes about the post 50 game for all classes aside.  (I *TRULY* believe adding lvls 51-60 was a mistake, in hindsight, the game was not designed for them.)  I love my wizard.  Whenever I was not burned out from playing WAY too much, I have loved playing him, and my druid.  Solo and grouped.  Once I learned about how tough the post-50 game was, I never expected to level him up.  But I play because it is fun, and playing gets exp, and exp gets levels.  And now he is 52.  If I don't do something, raiding with him will get him to 53 and he won't be able to kill my favorite red dragon.  ROFL, although I have beaten my personal record for losing and regaining levels on total wipeouts on raids.<P>I LOVE ROOT OVER SNARE!  *YES!*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff, you are my hero.<BR>I personally play a high lvl wizard, and you nailed everything on the nose.<BR>Wizards need:<BR>More safe portal ane evac spells, and more portal like spells (ex.

(Currently with my wizard, i can get off ONLY 5 casts of my second best DD, and even than it isnt enough to take down a mob)<BR>Those are the 2 MOST IMPORTANT wiz things which MUST be looked at.

</FONT><HR>Agreed Sinn, wizards are a hard class to play (the whole reason why I choose to be one, instead of a druid or necro), it takes skill to play a wizard well.  Maybe not as much as a bard or enchanter, but difficult still.<P>But the bottom line is, in a group there is nothing we can really bring that a mage or druid can't (and they bring more).  The exception being lures in most day to day high level encounters.<P>I dunno.  I feel like I add to any group I join cuz of my skill and knowledge of the game.  But trying to get into a pick up group can be difficult since my rep rarely precedes the rep of wizards in general.<P>Baldikin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed!?<P>The points in Grimstaff's post were have been articulated well by many with examples in previous posts.  I don't understand your need to nay-say the arguments with one line quips.  What really burns me is that some of the post 50 Wizards seem to have forgotten the path that brought them there!  Maybe you had your regular group that you participated in that didn't care that you had to sit and med for 90% of the battles - contributing little - soaking up the group's experience.  Maybe you could always find a group back then because you had developed a personal relationships and a good reputation....  Well, sometimes it's hard to get a foot in the door.  I and many others often have a hard time finding groups because we are not perceived to contribute our fair share to the experience progression.  In my opinion they are right to believe this when you consider how deep most other classes are.  It is not because I don't know how to play my Wizard.  I do not enjoy soloing.  I would much rather be welcomed into groups, but they can get magical direct damage and SO much more from the other caster classes.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What about a new series of spells, 4 in all, that allows us to create items with a click effect(similar to the shaman jaundiced bone bracer) and put a spell inside them?  spread them out at 8, 24, 44, and 55, and only allow a spell of a lower circle to be placed into them.  To balance this out, make these items lore/no rent, and make it so that while one of them is in your characters possesion, you do NOT regain ANY mana.  The only way to gain mana back would be for a necromancer to use their subversion line on you.  Give them a triple cast time(9 seconds for draughts, 19.8 for ice comet...) and make them falter or break on occasion.  This would allow us to keep pace with other classes, make them essentially useless for soloing(even with atols shackles, 9 seconds is too long to cast something and not get hit), allows us to contribute to the velious uber fights(rogues would still outdamage us due to the longer cast times), doesnt really add effectiveness to the kunark uber fights(after about 10 VS raids, except for the 2 times we've lost, I have yet to go oom from luring, he usually dies quicker than that), and would make us desired in groups for our DAMAGE potential, not our evac/snares.<P>Another idea that I like is giving us a pet line of spells.  Im not talking about your mage/necro melee pets.  Im talking a pet that has 2 commands, /pet cast, /pet back off.  Let it have the same ac and hp that a wizard of equal level would have with maxed defense/dodge, and have it cast a direct damage spell of the same level as it is.  This would prevent it from being a tank pet, since a creature would be able to take the pet down even easier than the caster.  Then, give us another spell that allows us to haste buff the pet, so that it has less time between casts.  Another nice spell would let us give it an extra spell to cast, I would love to have a pet that casts voltaic draught followed up by concussion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Both of these suggestions would give us more variety, make us more useful in groups, allow us to do more damage while not significantly increasing our solo ability.<P>Syndrome</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055066&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055066&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
