&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have been playing this game on and off for the last year and a half. I have seen a great many things. I have been a guide for a few months on two different servers. I have played my play character all the way up to the mid 50's and have alts ranging from level 14 up to level 34. I'd say I've seen my fair share of issues come up in game as well as out of game. But never before have I been so frustrated and disturbed as I was last night. <P>It seems a player from my play server has been banned. Now, thats not a big deal, right? Well she was banned for posting a story on an indipendant messageboard. Now, I'll be the first to admit that the story was a bit on the graphic side. But how far can Verant and the customer service staff go to banning someone? This was not posted on a Sony-owned board nor a Verant owned board. This was posted on eqvault's boards. If EQVault found it necessary to ban her from their board, then fine. But I don't see how Verant could come onto that board, read what is posted there and determine that it's okay to apply what's posted there to someone's IN GAME account. <P>Gordon's post on the Gameplay forum was "We make determinations based on information at hand regarding who is or is not having a positive affect on EverQuest's community. If we determine that one person's actions make EverQuest a game that other people do not want to play based upon those actions, we will excercise our right to refuse service to the extent necessary to provide a reasonable and enjoyable gaming environment." <P>Now, does that mean that if I type up a review on Everquest as a game and decide that its utter crap for my own reasons that I will be banned as well? I mean, it wouldnt have a positive effect on the community because it would keep people from buying and wanting to play the game if my opinion was valued enough, no? <P>I see this banning as stretching the limits of Verant's authority. I'm ashamed to say that I have stuck up for the actions that Verant has made up until now. No longer will I continue to do so if actions like this are made. <P>A game like this is supposed to inspire creativity. It's supposed to stretch the imagination. The story this person wrote was VERY WELL WRITTEN. If it was on any other topic, it would be praised. But it was honest. It was about dark elves. It was about necromancers. It was about hatred and torture. Now, its okay for the programmers to put torture racks in Neriak, but its not okay for us to write about them on indipendant messageboards? <P>I've probably said too much, and I'll probably get my guide account taken away for stating my opinion, but that's okay. I'm frustrated and I am not sure that I could go back to my guide account and remain a supporter of Verant Interactive in that way anyway. I thank you all for taking the time to read what I have to say. I would really appreciate hearing what you all have to say in reply. <P>Jessie Lawrence <BR>AKA Sithic the Creative <P><BR>Now, that was my post on their forum. I was a guide on Veeshan known as Sithic. I cant post a link because well...i cant get into their site any more. /sigh <P>As far as I am concerned, Verant is censoring hundreds...even thousands of people with this one ruling. Now people are going to be afraid to share a gift that they have because of the fear that some corporation will not only remove their post but remove the privelage of playing their game. <P>Sorry verant, but its not a privelage any more. It's sickening. Its sickening that people are tired of the way you handle things but keep coming back not because you have a great product, but because they care about the community that THEY have created. NOT YOU. THEY. <P>Check out brellserilis.net sometime. check out OUR messageboard. We might have our fights, but we also have respect for eachother and know how to treat eachother. You could learn a lesson from your players...if you would just listen.<P>Simple solution that could have been had here, Abashi and Aradune; take the time to email EQVault and ask them to delete the story stating why you want that done. They, in turn, would delete the post...stating why. That prevents it from happening again, and people understand. Instead of doing that...well, you know what you did. And it was, in my opinion (and others) the wrong way of handeling it. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately despite any common sense that might surface in the matter, it is all too easy to see why the author was banned. Like all large institutions instinctively do when faced with contraversy, Sony/Verant has drop-kicked the questionable item and its creator as fast and as far away from themselves as possible. <P>Funny how the handful of people shouting about injustice are always drowned out by the handful screaming about immorality.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think Verant has made their statement, and we all know where they stand...Now.  I think re-instating Mystere's account would be a good move on their part.  <P>This position VI has taken on this subject was unbeknownst to most, especially Mystere.  Now we know, and I this definatly served as a warning.  But I feel there was no reason to ban the account from playing.  <P>Verant could really walk away from this in good light, if they do agree to let her back on.  As it is now, many people are threatening to leave EQ, and/or never purchase anything from them again.  <P>I also am from Brell, and I think we have a very close knit community there.

</FONT><HR>I feel it's very sad that Fahreek was removed from the guide program for writing that.<P>I also feel very unhappy with Verant for lying to their paying customers with their 'intellectual property' statement, clearly an excuse made up after the fact. Besides, banning a player will do precisely nothing to stop him from writing similar stories, if you stopped to think about it.<P>Abashi's initial statement was probably the truth. They saw a story, realized it was pretty graphic, and took umbrage with the author. Unfortunately their EULA doesn't justify that action.<P>Again, the story was not about the rape and mutilation of a 14 year old girl. This was about the sexual mutilation of a 14th level dark elf of unspecified age as a part of her actions in killing her captor.<P>People saw it as child pr0n. <P>(shrug) EQ features the wholesale slaughter of froglok, goblin and gnoll children, and killable halfling children, and a quest involving the murder of a pregnant halfling woman and her unborn half-Tier'Dal child. I don't find they have particularly solid moral ground to stand on.<P>/salute Fahreek<BR>/rude Verant</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The stories would have been changed, and no damage would have been done.<P>Instead, they acted in their usually ham-handed, bullying and vengeful fashion, as a result of which the story Verant fears could damage its good name has increased its readership by several orders of magnitude, Mystere is free to continue writing worse stories with no incentive to cooperate with Verant, in fact, with every reason to want to hit back; and they are dealing with what looks like the worst single PR disaster in EQ history.<P>One would have expected them to have learned something from their last clumsy attempt to censor activity on an independent website, but apparently they learned nothing at all.<P>I can't decide whether this behavior represents actual stupidity, or whether Verant are just blinded by arrogance. Perhaps the company, as has been suggested, really is run by a collection of socially-ignorant nerds, embittered by their ill-treatment in high school and revenging themselves through random and erratic acts like this one.<P>Sky</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Volunteer your time, labor under oppressive and paranoid policies. Spoonfeed GM's like Lokkison and Axgoreth.

</FONT><HR>Yep, sorry but no thanks. I pay to play the game not to volunteer my time. Also, apparently as a guide if you express your opinion even in a verant private guide forum about Mystara or such issues and they don't like your opinion, you are banned. <P>It seems to be easy enough to get banned now, I don't want to volunteer and get banned. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Not to mention that you can have your play account banned as well. Why would anyone do anything to gain Sony's attention? Including volunteering. You are just asking to get banned.
