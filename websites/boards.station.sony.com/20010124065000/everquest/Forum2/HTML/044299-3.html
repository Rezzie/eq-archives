</FONT><HR>I saw the reply to this on Casters Realm. Sheesh, so typically Verant. The old bait and switch again. I as a Druid at 53 Level see the same thing. Instead of answering your question we get "Well the Cleric has accepted their role, why cant you?" Come on! The clerics are complainig about the same thing! What it all boils down to is this. The gaming system we call Everquest is quickly becoming old and antiquated. Sure you can create the illusion of new and improved by releasing an expansion but its pretty much the same thing with some new eye candy. Everquest will not ever be what we all want because the system can only change so much from its original design. I am not defending Verant here I am just stating fact. The thing I object to the most is that Verant won't leave it alone! You have the higher level players dictating what the lower level up and coming players will see when they get high level. What I mean is....The higher levels complain to Verant. Verant responds and changes things due to this pressure (Sometimes generated internally) and then this changes the game sometimes completely for an "up-and-comer". This isn't fair. Of course Verant, explains this away by citing game philosophy or Mob AI etc. What they really mean is..."We decided to change it..live with it. You don't like it..Leave."<P>I will play my Druid till he can go no further and then patiently wait for "the next best thing". I agree that it is a very boring existence. The least Verant could do is compensate the long hours with a reward that is on par with the level of boredom we have had to endure. Instead, they arbitrarily nerf mobs, drop rates and loot. This is pitiful. There is an old saying, "Leave well enough alone".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Repeatedly.<P>To the point that I can not heal...even if I could land all my dots for say 10K damage, over the course of a fight keeping tanks and clerics alive is much more important when mobs have hundreds of thousands of hit points our dots are a drop in the proverbial bucket.<P>I hope you can take these facts to someone and have the classes upper level balance looked at, because right now my collection of items for a monk is growing on a daily basis.<P>I've tried to 'focus' solely on the problems with our ability in Kunark and Velious to be effective, when the fights lasted 90 seconds or less, who cares or notices if all you do is mana dump?

</FONT><HR>Er, Clerics ratio of Mana--&gt;HP is much more efficent then necros HP--&gt;Mana.<P>I'm no necro advocate but if your main role in a raid was to pump mana to a cleric wouldn't it be more efficent to just be a cleric? Like 4-5x more efficent on mana usage plus the fact you could heal 2 targets at once....plus have more ac/hp.<P>I'm not saying increase thier efficency...I'm just saying the comment "if all you do is transfer mana it's like a cleric healing HP's" is just plain wrong. I'm sure you see the error in that statement.<P>I honestly think necro's have plenty of ways to contribute besides mana transfer but I can't let that statement go....if that is the only thing they can do ona raid it is NOT an acceptable role...Luckily it isn't.<P>You see MANY classes can not affect uber mobs. And I know if I can get my enchanter nuke as a 56 enchanter to land 60% of the time on raids besides the uber mob then a necro can lifetap much more effectively since it is less resisted then a normal spell and my nuke is more resisted since it is dual action all or nothing with a stun.<P>A raid isn't all about the uber mob...it's getting to the uber mob as well and recovering after a failure.<P>Your great at getting to the uber mob and great in recovery. Think about how tanks feel like in planes when everyone ping pongs the mobs. Or how a enchanter feels against all the new non-mez mobs like whole cities of giants etc...<P>On a uber mobs all a enchanter can do is cast clarity and haste beforehand. Maybe cast some runes at 10pp a cast to help with healing. But man on the way up to an uber mob we do alright in MOST places. Some places like Kael or the new planes etc...all we do is haste and clarity.<P>But seriously please don't liken a necro's transfer of mana to a clerics healing. It's not even close...it's like saying my enchanter or clerics nuke is the same as a wizards or my enchanters pet is as good as the mages epic pet. That was a silly statement.<P>If my 46 cleric got the same heal ratio as a necro gets on mana transfer I'd start a new class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necros are usless and unwanted on raids. This is a fact and is not up for debate because no matter what you say 300,000 subscribers say and act otherwise ingame. Im actually not as conserned w/ that aspect because necros were a solo class and have to pay the preverbail piper at some point.<P>What is a load of cr$p is agro factor of necro spells. I have played "almost all" classes to very high levels and i can garentee that the necro spells agro so much that its almost considered a bug imo. <P>Example; In PoG<BR>Mob has 32000hp and the battle startes. The ave life of a mob there is one minute to one minute and ten seconds. Cor,EB and Vex are the only dots that are worth casting. (Im not going to get into the reasons why these spells you can only use but will say that any dot that has a time of 90 sec or more is usless for a number of reasons.)<BR>Cor will get you summoned and beat if you cast on the mob when it has more then 17000hps every time. Now think about this, 25000hps have already be done to the mob and ONE 1000 dam dot that does NO up front damage gets you immediatly summoned? Many times Cor will get you summoned all the way down to the mobs death. BS. EB is a little more forgiving because you can cast it when mobs health is about 70% and usually it can run its coarse but you still get summoned about 50% of the time. Stacking dots are out of the question.<P>I dont want to make a 5 page post so im going to sum up. DOTs have a constant and accumulative agro every time that the dot ticks damage. Another class will do 1000 damage in one spell lets say and the mob will register the 1000 damage and any other effects and put it on a hate priority list at the time the spell is landed and that hate value does not go higher as the battle continues, the mob agros then or ignores the caster for a higher hated foe. A necro will land a dot and the mobs will "hate" him like he just landed a 1000hp direct damage spell then "add" to the hate value every tick of the spell damamge. One, thats not fair, and two because of the penatlty of doing damage over time(over DD) and having an increasing hate value, necros should get a lower hate value on the short duration dots. Casting a 1000 damage dot on a mob of 32000 hp and it bearly running its course and in the process has an excellent chance of getting you summoned makes this class usless on raids. Period.<P>On a brigher note, if they would lower the agro of the dots up front hate value necros could actually become VERY useful in raids though still of low value in exp groups. (which is ok) If they did this we could stack Cor w/ EB or EB w/ Vex and put our damage output to aprox 2300 damage on each mob which is a good value imo. At present i can put on about 700-1000 damamge in dots (in pog) w/ out getting keeled and i think thats a shade low and people know that.<P>=)  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor quote:<BR>"Think of it this way. What does a cleric (the class that most people think is the most wanted on a raid) bring with him to the group? The ability to turn his mana into hit points for tanks to use. It's pretty much the same role that necromancers can play on a raid, turning hit points into mana for the casters to use."<P>Ok, so if this is to be our only role in large raids where is the necro mana version of the cleric complete heal?  If you are going to use the analogy and compare us to clerics turning their mana into HP at a phenominal rate than where is the necro Hp to mana version to another target of that spell.  At best it is 50% of 60% of our Hp (which would leave teh necro dead, not to mention needing the time it takes to drain from Full Life to no hp at all).  Frankly, a couple mod rods lying on the ground are the same effect as a necro.  Whoppee.  Anyway I know there will never be a mana version of the CH (at least one that doesnt use someone elses exp as a reagent, Infusion, which is only about 1/3 of most caster/priests manapool at high levs). <P>BTW:  The last couple raids I've been on a cleric has gotten the killing blow.  A 600 magic DD isnt 1/2 bad.  <P>All necros are really asking for is one of a few things.<P>1) At 50+ levels uncap the lifetaps so there is no level restriction.  The 6 level cap is ridiculous especially when there are mobs over level 66 which means even a level 60 necro has 100% resists on these mobs.<BR>2) At 50+ levels mobs save lifetap ALOT.  Gullerback in Burningwoods isn't anything special but he saves against lifetaps 100% of the time.  That is just ridiculous.  Maybe adjust lifetaps at these levels so they at least have a reasonable chance to hit these mobs.<BR>or<BR>3) Give us a DD that can get partial resists.  It isn't asking for a whole lot and it would not unbalance the class in anyway, seeing as how if we solo we are using dots because they are so much more mana efficient than IB/CB or lifetaps.  Basically just a level 55 version of Shock of Poison would really help out immensely in the large raid.  <P>END THOUGHT:  Clerics have more of an offensive role in large raids than necros do, which is rather sad considering clerics are also the class that are saving everyones rear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow Absor, I'm speachless.<P>Let me quote you, "Think of it this way. What does a cleric (the class that most people think is the most wanted on a raid) bring with him to the group? The ability to turn his mana into hit points for tanks to use. It's pretty much the same role that necromancers can play on a raid, turning hit points into mana for the casters to use".<P>Ok, this would be fine, IF when I was at level 1 my job was to mana dump other level ones.  If at level 12 my role was to mana dump other level 12's.<P>Whats significatant about the levels I just mentioned?  Its simple.  At level 12 I've invested VERY little into my character, I've obtained nothing special (twinking aside), and I have a chance to decide if I like that play style.<P>I've experienced the class, not to its fullest degree, but enough to taste what the class is about.  I know at that point, roughly, whether or not I want to play a GAME in that fashion, whether its FUN for me.  If its not fun (the purpose for playing GAMES), I have 13 other classes to select, and find one to suit what I consider enjoyable.<P>Now let me list some things for you absor:<P>Necromancer Spells level 1.<BR>Cavorting Bones Summons a skeleton pet<BR>Coldlight Summon a dim light<BR>Disease Cloud Diseases the target <BR>Invisibility to undead Single Target Undead Invisibility <BR>Lifetap Steals life from target and gives to self. <BR>Locate Corpse Points you in the direction of the target's corpse.  <BR>Minor Shielding Self Only HP and AC Buff <BR>Reclaim Energy Regain Mana From Your Animation <BR>Sense the Dead Detects undead creatures  <BR>Siphon Strength Takes strength from the target and gives to self<P>Necromancer spells level 4<BR>Clinging Darkness Damage over time and slows target movement<BR>Endure Cold Adds to cold resistance <BR>Fear Single Target Fear Spell (18 Secs) <BR>Gate Return to Your Bind Point<BR>Grim Aura Attack rating is increased <BR>Leering Corpse Summons a skeleton pet <BR>Lifespike Single Target Lifetap (Max: 11) <BR>Numb the Dead Single Target Frenzy Ranger Reducer <BR>Poison Bolt Poisons the target with direct damage on impact and a small DoT<P>etc.<P>No where in there is a friendly spell to anyone (with the exception of invis to undead, and find corpse).  From this, the sames spells spring forth, and not until level 20 is our first "group friendly" spell.  A minor my health to your health spell.  Every other spell is either self serving, or offensive in nature.  This is the necro I thought I was playing.<P>Now you tell me I'm supposed to accept that I'm a mana stone, because clerics accept they are healers?  THEY DAMN WELL BETTER ACCEPT THEY ARE HEALERS, THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR 60 LEVELS.  If they don't like it, then they can blame themselves... they put up with it for their entire game careers.  If I don't like being a mana battery, should I blame myself?  No.  Because thats not what the original "vision" was for the necro, so the blame is on verant.<P>Absor, either let us do what we were designed to do, or change the class description and name to manamancer and give us the abilities at level 1 so others don't have to deal with a useless 60 class. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor I hope you come back and read this but I doubt you will.  I see many errors in the logic you have used in your post.  First off clerics are used in Raids more favorably because not only can they heal, but if the raid goes bad, they can return the exp of the bad raid.  Plain and simple that is it.  They turn Mana into life and turn Mana into exp.  A very useful role.  However, Necros are considered mana batteries, you said we had other roles, short of corpse recovery I dont know what you are talking about.  All our DoTs, if used, are either resisted or taunt the MoB off of the tank and kill us, there by causing the MoB to be killed by our DoTs and poof instantly, which really piss of other players.  But lets discuss mana battery idea, ok our best lich, which is demi lich (recently renamed to Arch Lich in SoV release) converts 31 hp into 20 mana per tic. Our best mana transfer, transfers about 33 percent of what it costs us to cast.  So in other words for every 31 hps per tick we can transfer about 7 mana.  Clarity 2 does 11 mana per tic, and doesnt cost the resident healer any mana for healing us.  So in other words battery isnt really correct word, buff that would be more acurate.  Necros are mana buffs that stack with clarity, but can only be used on one player at a time.  So why bring a player that can only be used for one buff.  Please if you know another role for us in high lvl raids where we dont have to attack (cause that will get us killed and not help the group any) or where we are more than a buff (since our mana conversion isnt very efficient) please tell us.<P>Oh wait I know it, someone has to be there to take the pictures to post on Everlore.  Finally a role we can do.<P>     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me you're just crappy necros...<P>This nonsense of getting yelled at by enchanters for having your pet up?  Poor pet control.  I assume you have pet attack and pet back off hotkeys, and an assist key?  And the damage output on the rogue pet and especially the monk pet (not 59 yet, so can't comment there) is a definite addition.  Combined with backup mes (yes folks, ST does work, I've done crowd control to the kitchen in Seb and other nasty places), mana transfer, self-healing...<P>And where the hell are you people getting resisted?  The only things that resist my taps are uber mobs with AEs... and let's think about why!<P>Let's say the queen in Chardok.  If I could cast and hit deflux on her in between AE waves, I'd never die, and never aggro her.  So why bring wizards at all at that point?  Bring a couple necros, and have them tap her silly while magician fire pets attack her!<P>But let's face it.  Yes there is a drawback to our soloing power, and you can't complain of it.  First off, having a necromancer or two on a raid is a good safety net.  Do you know anyone else who can fd and res?  And yes, your guildmates will be willing to let you sacrifice some secondaries once they notice you're the only one left at wipeouts.  Cleric or wizard used too much mana?  Pump them.  Enchanter getting pummeled by a mob?  ST, turn your pet's taunt back on (you do leave it off for raids, don't you?) and send it, or cast anything out of the Heart Flutter line, guaranteed to make the mob want to eat you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Throw a shadowbound out to save that tank, because Bond of Death and Deflux WILL hit every mob except the last one, despite these asinine complaints.  Oh, and your DoTs do hit.  Try using the right ones.<P>It's yet another thread of complaining on these boards, but sadly, it's my class this time.  I've been playing since release, and while I don't know of the beta power of necros, I've seen every "nerf" to come our way... and frankly, I still feel like the most powerful class in the game, and cannot bring myself to truly play any twink I start, because it's just not the same.  Nothing compares to the diversity, flexibility, and outright power of a well-played necromancer.  I don't have any problems getting groups, and neither should you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We even killed the herbalist guess what not a one of the three necros even cared if they got the darn herb because they don't want that crappy epic weapon.  They didnt even want to roll!  My role on this raid besides some CR, was DMF, mana dump!<P>We are not complaining about bad faction.  We do not want to be gods on raids.  We don't need to replace wizards.  But geez we ought to be able to do something besides give our mana away at horrible costs - I dont thing this was the intended purpose for the spell that Verant invisioned.  This defintely is not the role one would expect a necromancer to have in a RP sense!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan keeps tossing this "changing roles" thing around like it's no big deal.  He doesn't even take into account that we've invested thousands of hours (2,496 for me) into our characters to have a completely third class and gimped out roll shoved onto us that NONE of us like.  I'm going to go to every message board for future verant products and after every class role discussion I'm going to post: "Ya, but are you going to gimp the class out into a completely undesirable waste of time at the end of the game after people have wasted thousands of hours into what was their valued character?"<P>You know that Alan has no clue when he even thought about comparing a necros value to a clerics LOL.  As if twitching a cleric for insignificant amounts of mana at the expense of our own health over a HUGE amount of time is even in the ballpark of complete heals, resurrections, buffs, ect.  Play the game Alan.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lech said<P>Absor,<BR>Necros were designed to be a damage-dealing class. The ability to transfer mana came as a small addition to make up for the tremendous pet nerf a while after the game was released. The 3:1 ratio of the transfer is far too undesireable. That is why manadumping is the last resort for epic encounters when necros can do no damage to the mob. It is useful in emergencies, but on a large scale another cleric or wizzie or bard (who can serve as a real mana battery) would prove more effective to have. <P>Absor said<P>So I guess I just don't understand what it is that has brought about the death of necromancers. Though I do appreciate the pun.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Lech says<P>There's a formula for associated with Lich. Hit points are transformed into mana and then regained at a better ratio thru lifetaps. But how does that apply to an epic encounter when lifetaps are taken out of the equation? I hope you know Trakanon and VS are immune to taps. Maybe the cleric should heal the necro with the necro's own mana? <BR>==========<P>Absor said<P>So I guess I just don't understand what it is that has brought about the death of necromancers. Though I do appreciate the pun.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Lech said<P>Some people think we picked the class to be powerful. But please define the term "power" after a statement such as "necromancers are the most powerful class." The fact that we can solo in one zone past 55 (not even better than some other classes) doesn't mean we're powerful. Necros can make a moderate addition to the occasional Seb group or Hate raid party (not a better one than most other classes'!), I'm not complaining about that. But when it comes to epic encounters, the "powerful" damage-dealing class brings little or no contribution (after all my offensive spells were resisted, I began to melee the King in Chardok, for the duration of the battle). Don't even mention pets because either they're not allowed (Chardok) or they're feared nearly 100% of the time and annihilated by AoE's. <BR>Lech Bonedigger<BR>55 Defiler<P>Absor said<P>So I guess I just don't understand what it is that has brought about the death of necromancers.

</FONT><HR>Ok, Verant gave us the Duck Staff of Annihilation. This is our uber weapon (epic if you will), but that weapon could not even be used in an epic battle with little us, except for the stats bonus. WooT!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.  So we get our Epic weapon we cannot use in Epic encounters because the DOT is resisted 120% on those epic mobs. So how is it epic, I am not trying to start a flame on this, but name we one, just one other classes epic weapon, that would not be used on a fight against Trak. (Do not say Cleric because you know someone is bound to die). I am 36 now; I got a long way to go. I also got an 18 fighter, what do I have to look forward to, if I wanted to farm stuff I would be a druid. So what a useless mana battery Yaaaaahoooooo!  *sigh* I digress, please just look into what we ask, I want something to look forward to I enjoy playing the game but I am just wondering what is in store for my time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ALL of the higher level necros in my guild (we once had more higher level necros than any other guild on our server pre-Kunark) have started rogues or monks because of the "usefulness of necros" in uber-mob raids.  Basically, the necros log in now to do corpse summons and that is about it.  I also play a necro (level 51) besides my 60 Druid (don't even get me started on druid problems) and my contribution to the Plane of Growth is that I summon a pet and set it to attack.  Sure, I can land a DoT or two on occassion but they are resisted so much I don't even bother.  I too have started a rogue and have him at 48th level now (mostly because I got tired of having to sit around waiting on someone to pick locks for me but that isn't a problem anymore because of all the rogues that have been started recently because the only classes that NEED to be played are Cleric, Warrior, Monk [and that is questionable], Rogue [for locks and traps], and Enchanter).  No other class is needed in EQ now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Metphisto:<P>As far as the epic weapons being used, well, the Druid one won't be used (pretty much the same thing as the Necro one).  The Shaman one would only be used if DoTs are allowed (not often in my experience).  <P>It all boils down to unreasonable magic resistance and the DoT bug.

</FONT><HR>One Question, I saw in your response that you said we have our mana transfer abilities for grouping post 50 for uber raids and events.  If this is true, why must our abilities be so inefficient.  Most MOBs of this caliber have been demmed untappable which means no life tap will stick in any sort of way.  In other words, we Lich ourselves to death practically supplying mana because we can't get any health back.  All I ask is where the common sense lies in that?  Almost seems that the only good post 50 Necros are gonna be Iksar with regen spells added on that stay in Lich form the whole fight and med for other people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044299&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044299&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
