</FONT><HR>Fantastic Thread.  After reading everything that has been posted, I have some thoughts that echo some of what has been proposed.  Obviously my thoughts are based on assumptions, but perhaps it might help you.<P>I think the idea that certain conditions need to be met at certain times may apply to this puzzle.  The consistent pop/depop time of Bristlebane leads me to think that he will only stay or act based on certain conditions being met.<P>One idea I have is that the whole zone consists of discrete puzzles to be solved.  If each of these puzzles is solved at the time that Bristlebane pops, he stays and you complete the next part of the quest, possibly involving the cards.<P>It seems equally as likely that the way Velious plays may be part of the equation-the addition of scripted events in order to complete quests might be involved in this puzzle.  Perhaps you haven't found the correct sequence to invoke the next script.  An example might be that the NOT guy needs to be killed before you talk to the 5 guy, or vice versa.<P>Another thought is that the cards themselves and the game of king's court could involve certain NPC's having certain cards at the time that Bristlebane spawns.  This might involve the Number NPC's having posession of the cards or might involve spatial positions (i.e. Kings in the corner, etc.) where certain cards need to be in certain npc's hands when Bristlebane spawns.<P>If the check of what npc has what cards is only completed once a day (9:00 am game time or whatever the time was) it might explain why the NPC's aren't eating the cards as normal quest mobs do when you give them something they want.<P>Sorry if this post rambles, but I felt I had to get these ideas out before my brain turn to mush thining about this enigma.<P>Mithre Mythweaver<BR>55 Bard on Quellious Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>heheh .. Dorian (yes he beat me on one of the climbing rocks things .. eheh .. my father beat me climbing .. once ... ONCE .. hehe /em said in a Johnny Dangerously tone ...<P>It's hard to train NPC's 0,1,2,3 .. as they assist each aother and wont kill each other .. Also 8,9,22 and 86 are in areas beyond teleporters .. I have not been to success ful in training Bristle Bane past the porters but I think I can do it will 86 ... 22 would also b hard as I would have to go past red and even con assists ... lots of them. If we had a full guild up here it might be possible as we've killed everything up to them .. but then wouldnt b worth training. The normal NPC's near 22 hit for 165 and 175 .. so it's hard to train anything past them.<P>I will try 86 though tonight .. I think I could get him into Donk with np and maybe a guard and be interesting to see what happens with My right hand ... he's red to me and hits hard .. so I may die a few times there, but I can get a rez so np, I'll try it.<P>Cass ... I have to agree with the guild atm, I would love the help, but to mount another assault on PoM does seem sort of fruitless atm 8-( There are only a few things I cant do, and I know the guild is trying to get alot of ppl thier Sleepers keys, now that most have VP keys.<P>Even though it is tuff ... enterance to PoM is not impossible atm. It is possible to get a monk or even a few individuals up there at a time .. just have Necro Available to CR and Clr there to rez. Gettin to ToV alone is sort of a pain, but ... I havent found the exit point that Coladar did, but if it wasnt a bug and indead exists .. once a caster gets there to bind ... a good size, and organized guild should b able to as a weekend endevor, get here with a few deaths (on the range of maybe 10 or 20) and have an interesting outing ...hehe 8-)<BR> <BR>Coladar if you find the exit could you post it or give as much detail as possible and I'll see if I can find it, and post the Loc 8-) <BR> <P> <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another couple things to try in addition click the cards on the chess pieces...<P>1)  Drop the appropriate card on the tile that you would want a piece to move to.  So you would take a black king card and drop it on a tile next to the king and see if he moves.  Obviously, you need to conform to the rules of chess.<P>2)  Talk to the chess pieces...Say something like "King to Rook 5" or whatever the appropriate chess terminology is.  I played the game but never really learned the terms for movement.  There's also a shorthand for movement too.<P>A little research into chess may go a long way.  Perhaps the goal is to arrange the pieces to force a check mate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

To have the movements of the gorillas based on the colors of the squyares, there would have to be WAY too much info going back and forth to keep the server and client updated as to what color meant what and was therte at the time a piece started to move.<P>(Of course just a guess)<P>I do think that the cards will have to be given to someone or they need to be given to several people in sequence..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Very interesting reading. I have not been to PoM as I have no way to get there (ie. casual player off peak time). The only information I know about the zone is what I have read on this thread, I know nothing about the story lines behind the gods etc in this game. In short I have very little knowledge at all to help solve this problem.<P>However, sometimes, the best way to solve something is to get someone that know nothing about the subject to look it over.<P>While reading the thread, two statements stood out:<P>&lt;&lt;Irontail&gt;&gt;<P>/Q<P>I personally think it's FERJENEROR .. the Sphinx out in the garden. S/He asks DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME?, also says DO YOU HAVE WHAT YOU STOLE FROM ME? .. this is not exact wording .. I will get exact wording tonight for you. but if you say "YES" then s/he says "THEN GIVE IT TO ME" .. if you say "NO" S/He attacks.<P>/EQ<P>&<P>&lt;&lt;Olga_Feara&gt;&gt;<P>/Q<P>2 - Wasn't the way that PoM has been reached and *can* be reached a fluke really? I mean that a raid of nearly all 60s couldn't get there at all and that a monk using FD and using an item with a charge of rez on a mage to CotH others up there.. is that supposed to be designed for that? I seriously doubt Verant playtested that eventuality. And the fact that there has appeared new npcs that quad for a gabillion placed at the spot that the monk used to rez the mage for CotH and from what I have heard from Ester - basically getting there the way you all have is something Verant couldn't/didn't guard against. Therefore there *has* to be an alternate entrance or (much more likely IMO) a different avenue to reach the already known entrance. And if there's a way to get there without killing the mobs along the way and without dodging them there's probably some exotic quest that raises your faction with all those dragons that are currently kos to everyone. Or the idea of a secret wall and passageway to near the PoM dollhouse sounds equally likely. The main reason why I think this will help inside PoM is that there's no backstory or reason for PoM being in Temple of Veeshan or it being past a horde of dragons that seem unkillable and unavoidable except to FD hop. There's got to be some backstory or reason for Bristlebane's domain to be in a temple devoted to Veeshan and full of Veeshanese followers (dragons). I could almost believe Verant was placing it randomly and putting the almost unavoidable dragons just for the assurance that only the uberest guilds in all of EQ ever got to attempt it's puzzle... but there are no leads in PoM to be found, no npc text, no discernable quests(Cept for the sphinx who wants the the stolen something but that sounds like flavor IMO). If you are missing the clues and leads for PoM then it seems like you might've skipped a step: finding out how to get there and actually getting there the correct way. I mean you can't jump over that and dismiss it like it doesn't matter - how in the *world* are you *supposed* to get to PoM? The mage/monk trick is just that, a trick, and fighting there seems futile. And Ester mentioned on her visit how they got there without a rogue or something akin to that? Sounds like something needs to be picked and that it warps the group from somewhere else in ToV TO the dollhouse. Perhaps something in the non-kos CoV faction portion. Point being: you missed a step of how to get there legitimately I think.<P>/EQ<P>This may be a long-shot, however, Olga may had hit the nail on the head with "you missed a step of how to get there ligitimately". Could it be possible that the correct (intended) way to get to PoM involved completing some quest that involved a story line around FERJENEROR? ie. this item that was stolen from him is been hold by a NPC (rogue?) in some other zone? May it be possible that FERJENEROR has a alter-ego or counterpart out there somewhere that gives a quest to return this item to him and the reward is some type of Key to PoM? <P>On completion of this quest you may even been given some type of portal item and instructions to return the item to FERJENEROR. Is there anything in the zone that looks like a portal in?<P>Once you find the item you return it to FERJENEROR you may receive back some sort of combinable box to put cards in? Different cards, different piece of armour is made? Maybe I'm giving VI too much credit, but to me this would be best one to stop the stupid class fights from the other planes about one classes armour dropping more then other classes etc. A different combination of cards (with possibly some other rare items) combines to make a piece of armour wearable by your class and race.<P>This most likely has nothing to do with it, but I had a close look of the name Ferjeneror. I do know any fictional characters of that name. If there are any, the rest of this paragraph is no doubt pointless, don't read it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> We all know VI have a habit of reverse spelling names, so this makes it Rorenejref. I won't go into great details how I came up with this, it sort of just jumped into my head. But Rorenejref to me seems to be a made up from other words like "Ro, Roll, Render, Ref" etc. Don't ask me how I came up with it, but by after mucking around with words I ended up with Rorenejref meaning "To return/give back, dice, money or a token"<P>But whatever Ferjeneror means, after reading this thread, the only clear "hints" that I see are the cards and what Ferjeneror says. If I was a betting man, I would bet that if you give the correct item to Ferjeneror, he will return a combinable box for the cards. The hard part is finding that item  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Anyway, these were just my thoughts after ready the thread. Good luck.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I tried plugging it into an anagram generators on the internet, but none came out with anything that made sense.

</FONT><HR>Haven't been keeping up today, was trying incredibly hard to get a Locket of Escape and bind up there (Which I finally did manage to find.)<P>However, no, I am not BSing about the exit. We were fighting the kos chest in the courtyard, clicked around, accidently got ported out to Cobalt Scar, loc 0, 0. After that the casters that were bound there searched for it, and found it. Neither of the two were on earlier, but I'll get the exact loc out of one later tonight if they come on.<P>One quick note, I don't believe we have gotten back to the area I mentioned in an earlier post. There is no way past the door at the end of the hall where Life/Hallmonitor roam... Yet there is a rather large area further back that no one has explored to my knowledge. We might want to focus on finding that area before going through dictionaries of words with the known NPCs. I've banged my head against the wall trying to find an entrance, but there must be one...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok I tried a few of the suggestions that were made ...<P>1 - I fished in the main moat .. just normal fishing stuff, I couldnt fish in the pool in the sideways room and DOH!!! . .my fishing pole broke in Lilth black and white room ... b4 anything  was pulled out .. but you can fish there.<P>2 - I still havent found anyone invisible to trade to 8-(<P>4 - I used a damage shield on Number "5" .. no effect he does not take damage<P>7 - I used cancel magic on 86 and Donk .. I'll try Bristlebane and his puppet later tonight<P>11 - I also tried to use the cards in portals ... no go .. just askes if you want to drop it on the ground.<P>16 - I trained "86" around for a while .. as mentioned .. not much around without a portal, and he loses agro when you use a portal.<P>Also interesting note about the 4 moving halflings and the chest out side .. they move at a specific interval ... they all rotate clockwise by 1 spot .. then 45 secs later they do it again .. then 45 secs later then cross over to opposite sides then 90 secs later restart the proccess.<P>Im of the opinion that each little section of PoM is a small self contained puzzle area and that Fenj is the key to the cards. Im planning on posting a web site also ... to start a collection of screen shots through out the zone .. not sure how long it will take but maybe it will also help others to see something the ppl that have gone to PoM have not seen yet .. 8-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That could b a life saver and prove to b one of the biggest finds here, allowing ppl to attemp the PoM suicide run on thier own, knowing that they could get out 8-)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think someone should get a systematic way of finding out the answers kind of like the scientific method.  Form a hypothesis - There are many hypothesis out there so start on ONE of those and then - Collect data - Get as much data on everything that would be involved as possible then - Experiment - Do all experiments that could be thought of to either PROVE or DISPROVE the hypothesis.  This way, you could eliminate certain things which would make the a bit easier.<P>So far, what I personally think, is that this whole "Lets say the dictionary to every NPC" thing just wont work.  I mean, cmon.  Do you really think Verant would expect players to sit there and feed words into NPC's spending coutless hours doing so?  I highly doubt that and I dont see that as being any sort of a fun puzzle.  If anything, there should be a clue somewhere of what to say if that is what is needed.  A key word should be given by some NPC or another.  I would hold back on continuing this for a while untill other options have been explored.<P>I do believe that the plane has to be done in sections and a speciffic order.  Perhaps the first room you come into is one puzzle.  After that is complete, you get an item that is used to start the next.  I dont see much interdependence on the puzzles but there might be some.  I suggest going to the beginning and do all your initial experimenting there first.<P>I believe that once the zone is cracked, it will lead to the "real" PoM and this is just a gateway...A test if you will.  This stuff has been said before but Im just re-stating it because it seems to make the most sense out of everything.<P>The cards may be the key to each puzzle.  We DO know that the cards are a key factor so work with that.  Try to get a list of which MoBs have the reputation of dropping which cards and use only those dropped in each "section" ONLY in that section.  I dont see this zone as being a "run through it, collect all the cards, then give them to someone to pass"  It seems more complex than that.<P>Bristlebane I think is the last puzzle to figure out, the ultimate goal of this zone I think is to find the Cazic Thule (I think thats the missing one, sorry if Im wrong but you know what I mean) puppet and get that to BB himself.  After that has been done, the real PoM will be shown.<P>Well, thats just my thoughts.  After reading this entire thread and following it a few times a day, this is the stuff that seems most reasonable...Though, I always have a very good chance of being wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056688-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056688&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056688&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
