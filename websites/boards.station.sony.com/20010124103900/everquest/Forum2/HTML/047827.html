</FONT><HR>Hi all,<P>I wanted to bring up this issue officially and also talk about some aspects of it, and how we are looking to solve some of the issues.<P>First of all, we are working to come up with a new target server population at peak hours number.  Our inclination at this point is a number somewhere between 2300 and 2500 players during peak hours.  We feel we need to adjust this number because of how much Velious has added to EverQuest's size and quantity of content.<P>We also feel that undercrowding is probably more detrimental to the game than overcrowding, in that while crowded areas are frustrating in that there is greater competition involved, there are some advantages to it (help from others when an encounter goes bad, help with CRs, etc.).  (No, I'm not saying Overcrowding is good overall -- so please don't misunderstand me). Undercrowding, however, can mean a player can't find anyone to play with, and thus leaves.  In other words, that frustration can be worse.<P>There have also been some problems with packet loss and link death, specifically on E'Ci, when populations are growing high.<P>So, what are we going to do about all of this?  <BR>Well, before launching new servers we're going continue to analyze where players are at, what zones are crowded, and what zones are underused.  Significant experience bonuses are going in next patch for underused zones (mostly dungeons). <P>With E'Ci specifically we found out that after a recent hardware change, the network interface was incorrectly configured -- last night this was fixed, so please tell us if anything has improved.<P>Also, when there are network problems out there with the Internet and a large group of players go link dead, this can cause zones to go down.  We are working on this issue as well.<P>So, there you have it, both gameplay and hardware solutions we hope will have significant effect.  And please understand that any hesitation to launch new servers is due to undercrowding fears only -- if after these adjustments and attempts to better utilize all the zones we have it turns out target populations are lower than we believed, we will launch new servers, both split and new.<P>thanks, and we look forward to your comments and feedback.<P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What do you intend to do about the connection problems many of us have been experiencing on other servers?  On Druzzil Ro ever since about the time 'SoV' went live, myself and many I've spoken with have experienced the following problem:<P>The left side of the lagometer goes to 50 (or more commonly this week) up to about 90 percent packet loss.  During this 10 or 15 second duration we are completely unable to control our characters.  It then suddenly snaps back to zero, and the right side number increases to 6000 to 7000 for several seconds.<P>From my informal polling of other players who have experienced this problem, this isnt isolated to any particular user-ISP, geographical region, or method of connecting.  And it all started in the time-frame of "SoV"s release.<P>The chat-GMs and Operations staff continue to ignore this issue completely.  Not once of the many times that I've been in chat have they attempted to offer help or work on a solution.<P>What does Verant intend to do to solve this issue?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I disagree. 2500 people is way too much, since many zones are poorly designed and thus everyone ends up in the same spots which leads to kill stealing, trains and plain frustration.<P>Unless it is your wish for people to level more slowly so they can pay up for a longer period...<P>The promised 1500 still is the best number for me. Some may disagree and they are welcomed to do so. Even though I doubt any feedback will actually be listened to, I wanted to let you know of my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>yes for God's sake PLEASE split the Rathe.<P>We are experiencing the exact same lagging conditions as Kodan describes, and also Rathe being the original beta server and one of the oldest non-split servers by far has a badly skewed population of level 45-60 players compared to the rest. This is leading to very ugly situations, and this server is in dire need of a pressure relief valve.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree strongly on this post.  Undercrowding is a bigger fear than Overcrowding.<P>As an Enchanter, when I moved to Ayonae Ro, I feared that I would have deep troubles finding groups due to the overall low population.  Coming from Karana, one of the oldest servers, I moved to Ayonae because I hoped that a new server would have less LD attacks and lag.<P>Thankfully, the Ayonae Ro split seemed overall well done, IMHO.  Although the server peaks at around 1800, it's newer, and I don't have any trouble finding a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

HELLO the rathe with normal peak time users of 2700 +- 100 .What do you think adding xp to others zones are going to do? Yea ok so more people MAY or MAYNOT be spread out, but the problem is when 1000 46+players are all going after what lets see VS/TRak/Ser/Goen/Inny/CT/Vox/Nag and maybe 3 or 4 more I cant think off at the moment. So we have 8-12 mobs that spawn once a week between 1000+players, most of the time this causes one of 2 things, major death/frustration/arguements between player, and general unfriendlyness, or we call in a gm who has no real clue what to make of the situation and does the best he can while all the above situations are probably happening anyway.<P>2500 people is not a good target period.<P>I have seen entire guilds discussing leaving EQ all together ,moveing to another game etc...<BR>I was recently invited to AC, UO, and D2. I like EQ but its becomeing more like a job to find areas to hunt and maybe pick up a decent item or 2.<P>listen to us we pay we play we deserve a say.

</FONT><HR>Your numbers are staggeringly disappointing brad.  Your servers reach their breaking point well below 2500 players.  At 2000, everyone on The Rathe notices a slowdown in network performance.  When we hit 2500, we start getting consistent timeouts.  When we hit 2900 a couple weeks ago, it was very very bad.<P>You are forgetting about demographics.  Either you're forgetting or you really don't care.  The demographics on older servers are what should be driving your decision to split.  You should look at the number of active players over level 45 or so and base your decision on that number.  Otherwise, you end up with 100+ people in all the high level zones in the game.  Which means the zones crash.  On a daily basis we have 100+ people in Dreadlands.  The other day, at the Bazaar we have in East Commons on a daily basis, there were 194 people in East Commons.  The server is suffering from burnout and really needs to be split badly.<P>Your game servers can't support the number of players you're talking about Brad.  You may THINK they can, but go talk to the 30,000 players out there with 150 days /played on their account.  They'll all tell you the servers tend to get sluggish at 1800, start having odd problems at 2000, and just stink at 2500.<P>Lewick Goodheart<BR>Outrider<BR>Knights of Eternal Good<BR>The Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alby makes a good point Brad. If you've decided to "move the goalposts" and up the peak server pop to 2500 then please remember that things like the ancient cyclops spawn (important item only available one way) were implemented with a target pop of 1500 at peak. This means a 40% increase in spawns is needed to account for the all new higher demand.<P> Of course if you didnt change these things accordingly we could be forgiven for thinking that , god forbid, you didnt want to add more servers because they cost money, and surely that couldn't be true.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Brad,<P>  I don't post much at all but since you posted on a Sunday here goes.<P>  It seems to me that overcrowding on server's isn't the problem it's overcrowding in zones. The idea of revamping zones ie dungeons is a good one but the last one I know of was paw and that really didn't work too well, meaning it is still underused. Changing the exp in some dungeons may help, just have to wait and see I guess.<P>  From my own experience in EQ the used zones are the ones with loot and experience with loot being the priority.<P>  I would like to see you guys revamp your hardware!! People with high speed connections shouldn't have the kind of packet loss and disconnects we have been seeing lately.  If I'm wrong and it's an internet in general problem maybe you could investigate isp's and have a list of approved isp's for different area's of the country or world for that matter. Hehe a VI seal of Approval.<P>  Well since you posted I'm sure  you will get lots of requests for split this or that server most complaints will be about log in problems and such, is that a soft or hardware problem?<P>  Step lightly around the rants  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>  Leafgiver<BR>  Wizard of Tunare<BR>  Can we get a pointy hat?<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just a couple of suggestions here:<P>- Revamp the Karanas.  There is a lot of space devoted to the under level 20 game that simply is not being used much.  <P>West Karana has under level 13 or so mobs throughout its vastness.  The only things to fight over 13 are the ogres, various NPCs, treant spawn, and hill giants.  I'd like to see something a la Lake of Ill Omen or Rathe Mountains done to West Karana.  Sector the zone off into higher level sections where the mobs wont path (unless chasing) outside of the area.  Also, make these areas away from the main path, so lower level players can pass through relatively safe.<P>South Karana is generally good.  The only thing I would change is to add more of the wandering non aggressive NPCs.  Everyone seems to be camping spawn points here (Spires, treants, posts in the village, centaurs).  There is again a lot of space unused where more wandering mobs (or spawn points) could be added.  The level range of the zone is great though.  Perhaps more content for the level 25-30 game could be added though to this zone.<P>North Karana and East Karana are good zones for their size and intended level, and I don't see any major problems with it.  But, since most of your player base can go level 1 through 20 in about 24 played game hours or so, it seems superflous to have two zones right next to each other with generally the same level range.  I think EK should be bumped up to a level 15-30 zone personally.<P>-Ok, enough about the Karanas =) The next improvement to the western world would be added dungeons.  I know that Verant is looking more for adding content to existing zones, but I don't know how this could fit in.  Currently, west of HH, the only dungeouns I know of are Splitpaw, Blackburrow, Permafrost, and the Hole.  Compare this to East of HH: Sol A, Sol B, Runnyeye, Befallen, Unrest, Upper Guk, Lower Guk, C-T, Crushbone, Najena, Mistmoore, and Kedge.  I probably missed a few, but there is much more dungeon content east of HH.  I hate to say it, but we need more "phat lewt" west of HH to draw ppl there.  The Hole has its good share, but I'm pretty sure there are comparable Velious/Kunark drops.  Nothing exceptionally good in Blackburrow.  Splitpaw is generally good, but I don't have much experience with it.  Permafrost, despite it having some nice items dropped, is very underpopulated.<P>First of all I think a dungeon or two for levels 20-30 and for levels 40-50 need to be added.  There should be loot added to these dungeons that is comparable to that of Sol A/B or U/L Guk.  Loot can even be replicated.  For example, have the FBSS or GEBs or something drop off something in these newer dungeons.  Even better, instead of making it drop off of one specific mob, pattern the new dungeon drops like the Forest Loop, etc.  Make it (or a group of items) drop off equally difficuly mobs at different spawn points.  Granted it would have to drop off of say 5 mobs at the same rate it would drop from one, but it gives (in this case) 30 people a chance to get the item instead of 6.<P>- Next thing I would like to see is a portal in Qeynos hills.  This kind of goes along with the adding of dungeon content, but when you get good loot and want to sell, you usually go to a large marketplace like Gfay, NorthFP, or EC tunnel (depending on the server).  Those are all east of HH where the good content is.  Putting really good loot and a closer portal will help bring a market for items to the West side and keep the people there.  I think if a poll was taken of the players, the number two most excruciating travel experience behind boat rides is running across WK.<P>- One more suggestion before I leave.  I have heard rumors of another expansion somtime in the summer or so (not confirmed), but if there is an expansion, might I suggest you make the boat dock in Qeynos.  There is already an empty dock to use there.  That would help bring more traffic to the west side of the world too.<P>Sorry, this is such a long post, but my first character was a west sider, and I have spent much time in these zones, only to make east side characters later to find how much better it is there.  So, in conlusion, I believe that if more level 20-50 content is added to the western world, we will see a better balance among all the zones.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A couple of things to the people who say that 2300 to 2500 ppl is too much.<P>First, different zones are on different physical pieces of hardware.  The number of zones has nearly doubled since release.  I know around realease time, they were shooting for 1200 people at peak times, so with nearly double the zones, shouldn't they be able to handle about double the people.  <P>What Brad is saying (and what I agree with) is that there is plenty of space for everyone, but if everyone crowds into a few select zones, lag problems are going to occur, since groups of zones are on the same server.  What he wants to know is what we think they should do to help spread the population to the underpopulated zones.  If server population becomes fairly equal across every zone, then less lag will happen.<P>Another comment I wanted to make that I personally have not experienced, but have heard much about, is to make many more areas of Velious doable by a group of 6.  The game was designed with a maximum group size of 6, but from what I have heard on this board, groups of 30 are having trouble in some of the zones.  I could be talking out of my behind as I don't have personal experience.  I personally think that Velious should be the playground for a full group or two of level 40-60 adventurers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play on Vallon Zek which is one of the lesser played servers probably because of the PvP element. And I agree with Brad, I think that undercrowding is a lot worse than overcrowding.  You can at least log on non-peak hours or venture to underused zones. My character recently advanced to lvl 35 making my hunting places unusable with greens.  So I explore to new zones that are of my level and the zones are empty of players.  This is at peak hours.  What are you supposed to do then.

</FONT><HR>There is no doubt muddled thinking here on your part, Brad, with all due respect.<P>You seem to be defining over-population only in  geographic terms, where it is fair to say a larger world spreads the characters out more, and ignoring the technical side. The problem with populations over 2000 is that the servers simply can't handle them. Innoruuk has been having terrible lag lately, huge spikes that come and go, a lot of people complain across the zones, and as a 37th druid I tp through a good few zones so get to see what is happening. A friend has died 3 times in 3 days this last week, twice by going LD.<P>I put the recent worsening of lag down to Velious, it wasn't like it before. Is it the new world or just the DirectX 7 "upgrade" to the coding that is causing this?<P>Please sort the technical side, and meanwhile stick to enough servers to keep populations below 2000 per server. By all means promote a more widely spread population - but don't think that will ease the lag, it won't - but don't concentrate all the extra exp on dungeons, make some of the under-used outdoor zones more attractive too.<P>Not all of us want to hunt in dungeons, nor should we have to, and it makes sense to make better use of open zones like East and West Karana rather than herding everyone into North and South Karana because that's where the mobs are, for example.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In theory, doubling the size of the world since release should allow the servers to support more people (ideal going from 1500 to 2500).  However, many of the the zones (SoV and Kunark) are designed with such a specific demographic in mind, that they will never be populated to the extent that Verant expects.  <P>Not all dungeons are like lower guk, the newer dungeons have new additions (such as the giant steps in Kaesora in the beginning of the zone, or the super tough mobs of the Hole) that make them very challenging and not the sort of place that a character can stay in for weeks at a time.  The newer dungeons support a very specific type of player (soloer in Overthere, uber guild in Chardok) and so with each or new expansion, the size of the world does not increase by 50%, instead it adds 1 or 2 utilized outdoor areas, and 1 or 2 guk-like dungeons (Sebilis comes to mind).  Even if verant significantly enhances the underutilized dungeons, they *wont* be enhanced enough to support the number of players you are suggesting should be the norm.  Many of the dungeons are not utilized for good reasons (pathing, insane toughness of monsters for their levels, lack of loot) that won't be solved by simply upping the exp tables for those zones.<P>I've played on Bertoxxulous (old server, suffers from overcrowding), I've played on the Seventh-Hammer (nice server, but it is just coming into its maturity, so it is suffering from political upheavals), I've played on the Test Server (I played there for the longest, it was great fun before the item wipe...the peak of 600 players was great fun.  The instability that the player/item wipe brought totally destoyed the server.  After the wipe, the peak of 600 dropped to a peak of 200.  That is the undercrowding you are talking about Brad.  You know that whenever a server drops to 200 people it crumbles and becomes less fun.), and I have played on Vazaelle (new server, peak 1600; bliss).  It is obvious to me from adventuring in the expansions, and the original 3 continents throughout nearly all phases of the game, on servers with pops from 200 to 2200 that the BEST peak time server population is 1400 - 1600.  Before you decide that the best pop is 2200, stop playing on test and go play on The Tribunal for a few months.

</FONT><HR>First of all, I agree with the person who said that more people need to be drawn to the West side of Antonica.<P>What if there was a boat that went from Paineel to Ak'Anon?  Or something similar, to round out the world so that we don't have these far corners that no one wants to get stuck in.<P>Another thing I've noticed is a problem across the world, but no zone brings it home like South Karana.  Here you have a zone with all sorts of wandering 20's mobs: centaurs, elephants, etc.  It's a 20-30 paradise.  Plus you've got the Aviaks and the spires, not to mention Splitpaw.<P>So the Spires are *always* camped, and I've never seen as much KSing as there is at KFC.  There will be 18 people, in three groups of 6, camping the 6-10 spawn points at the spires, and 20-25 people trying to make a bird mad enough to follow them back to their group.  While this is going on, and people are getting frustrated with the downtime waiting for pops at one place and the KSing at another... the centaurs and elephants walk about, unmolested.<P>Why?  Because *we can't wander and stay together.*<P>This is, in large part, a technology limitation.  Lag and prediction make it difficult to follow either automatically or manually.  Autofollow has that huge warning on it because it is quite falliable, and it makes it clear that it's simply not viable in many situations.  manually following can be a pain... prediction can make it look like someone's running off in one direction, when in fact they turned around during a lag spike.  In just a few seconds of packet-loss, you can end up out of sight of your group.<P>This is a tough thing to solve, but if it could be, it might make it feasible to do dungeon-crawls, wander large zones, and such, which would greatly alleviate crowding.<P>Some suggestions:<P>- Use some of the NPC pathing that is now in place to guide autofollow.  This would be very useful in dungeons, to make it possible to use it without getting stuck in corners and such.<P>- Maybe introduce a 'radius' boundary around the group leader.  Allow the group leader to set a radius (say, 20 units) and the members could agree to it and then they wouldn't be able to go farther than that distance from the leader.  Either side could turn it off at any time, and it would be broken automatically by zoning, including gating.  If packet loss put you outside the radius, you'd teleport into it.<P>- Give us another command, like /y, that gives a directional cue.  Let's call it /holler.  If you /holler group, your group will hear <P>&lt;soandso&gt; hollers to you from behind and to the right.<P>/holler all would be the same as /yell, such that all people within a radius would hear you, and just /holler would only show for the person you have targeted.  Maybe even let it give a direction, so that if you /holler group and some of your group is in another part of the zone, they can come find you.  i.e. &lt;soandso&gt; hollers to you from the NorthEast.<P><BR>These suggestions would reduce some of the risk of wandering and traveling, but given the current population distribution, I would argue that the risk vs. reward ratio is too high.  People are not willing to try to wander, at least not with people they don't know very well.  Heck, I've had terrible experiences just trying to get a group to change camp spots by 100 feet.<P>As an out-of-game temporary solution, I suggested this in another post, but it died quickly.<BR>For the most crowded servers, perhaps a moratorium on new accounts could be established until such time as the green servers population hits a certain threshhold and it's time for a new server.  More specifically, if an account already has a character on that server, they could create additional characters.  But if an account does not have any characters on that server, they would have to select another server (preferably a green one).  The main disadvantage to this would be cases where RL friends take up the game; you wouldn't be able to twink them up with your level 55 whatever.  But nothing would stop you from creating a new character on the server they select, and adventuring with them.<P>At any rate, I hope it all gets worked out before my server gets too crowded.  The Nameless feels just about right right now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad is right, undercrowding is an issue.<P>I live on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, When I play, server population is usually around 400-600 (I play on one of the old and never split servers). This is my typical day:<P>I zone into Sebilis, /who There are 7 or 13 or 19 players there. That means there are one or two or three full guild groups fighting there, and myself alone at the zone-in LFG. I do a /who all cleric 50 60 and 4 turned up. I do a /who all enchanter 50 60 and 2 turned up. <P>If my server is split there will just be even fewer people on at the times I play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Summarized Hypothesis:  To combat the 'overcrowding' issue per zone, you should 'encourage' players to move less populated zones.  One way this might be accomplished is to have the experience bonus per zone be adjusted by the number of players in the zone (within certain set minimums/maximums).<P>If the number of players in a zone does truely adjust the difficulty of a zone (for better or worse), then the experience gained might should be related to this.  A zone at night, with few people in it, would be equally difficult to an equivilent, but under (player)populated zone, during the day...  I suggest, therefore, that if you base exp off of the number of players in the zone (calculated by players per zone, with set min/max's per zone), people would then SEEK for the best 'kill spots' in the less populated zones.<P>Your humble servant,<BR>*bows humbly*<P>Helamin&Grimshok of Bristlebain<BR>Erbright&Theodin of Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's not acceptable even if dispersed throughout every zone we would still run 10-50% PL.  Your hardware for the Rathe can not support these numbers and all it takes is to walk through the zones and look at the PL to prove that.<P>I really hope you make this decision based off of what is right and not off of the ledgers of some accountant from Sony.  2500 is too many, that's a fact.<P>Grundall Dameatshield<BR>Foundation Rathe </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Grundall-BT:<P>No no, don't worry, this has NOTHING to do with cost savings or ROI or anything of the sort.<P>It's simply the fact that with increasing the size of the world with Velious, we need to reestablish a target population maximum at peak hours, and that undercrowding is a concern.<P>As we increase the target number, we are monitoring and watching our servers and network infrastructure and will make adjustments and modifications as necessary.<P>For example, in addition to the misconfiguration that was plaguing E'Ci, I just talked to operations and it appears some machines on the Rathe need more RAM to support the additional people, and that that might be the cause of the problems you and others are describing.<P>All in all, the EverQuest server infrastructure really scales well, and we're confident we can continue to grow and expand it as the world itself grows and expands.  Unfortunately, there will be some growing pains, but we are committed to addressing problems as they arrise.<P>Bottom line:  real ROI (return on investment) comes from a great game, and part of making a great game means always trying to find that target population between undercrowding and overcrowding, that makes a fun environment for players during peak hours AND off-peak hours.<P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From my own experiences over the past year (with lag, LD, etc.), I have to say that I think a server population of 1500 should be tops.  Once it starts climbing over that, I have more and more problems, exponentially.<P>One way to combat the potential "undercrowding" problem would be for VI to make it possible to move entire groups or guilds.  As things stand right now, I would never consider a move, because there's no guarantee I would even be able to stay with my husband, let alone all my in-game friends.<P>We need more servers.  Not 1 or 2, but at least half a dozen.  And we need to be able to keep friends together.  Yeah, I know that's totally unrealistic, but it's what we need.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
