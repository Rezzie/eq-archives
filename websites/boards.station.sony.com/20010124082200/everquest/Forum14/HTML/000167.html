</FONT><HR>To Verant/Abashi/Absor:<P>I have never posted before, becase I have never had a legitimate beef with EQ.  I noticed today on an EQ website the proposed new spells for the Scars of Velious expansion.  It was with much dissapointment that I read about the new spell granting Druids a pet.  I play a shaman and love the fact that I get a pet and Druids do not.  It is the thing that keeps the two classes balanced in my opinion.  On the one hand you have druids who have wolf form, telport themselves, and others to earn money and save them time.  Shamans balance that with Alchemy and a pet wolf.  If you do ultimately give druids a pet, it will horribly upset the balance between shaman and druid.  A bear form for a level 55 spell will not blance this situation out in my opinion.  If you do give druids a pet, please equalize this with shamans.  Perhaps a bear form earlier in levels?  Or maybe giving shamans access to the higher level charm animal spells?  In my opinion, it is a bad idea to give druids pets, but if you must do it, please keep it balanced for us shammies.  Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We do not as of yet know the stats on the Bear Form.  They could very well blow those of Wolf Form away. I'd think they should, it being such a high level spell.  As a guess - cause I havn't seen anything yet to give the stats - it being a 'Bear' - I'd say the form comes with a huge Strength and Stamina Buff, Regeneration, HPs, AC and a Resistance to Cold buff.  That's what I would think is appropriate for a Bear form. If we're really really really really lucky, they'll also think Bear's are Wise.. but I doubt it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  It's also probably Non-aggro to all Undead, like the Wolf form.  It probably doesn't come with built in SOW - bears aren't very fast (other than IceBerg and company).  It might even come with a Agility and Dexterity debuff.<BR>We do get improved Pet spells in the 50's don't we?  So I'd guess our Pet would still be alot better than that of the Druid.<BR>I'm looking forward to it.  We had Form of the Bear on one of the big Shaman spell wish lists some time ago.  So I'm thrilled that they listened!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Fenira<BR>Barbarian Shaman of 33 Winters on E'Ci<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>johnloving please post this on the main board. I really feel the same way you do. Druids should not be given pets. Its what makes shaman stand out from druids. Besides our pets what do we have that druids dont have. A slow spell. Big woop.  Before we know it they will assign that to the druid as well. Shamans get the shaft and of corse the druids get even more power. go figure!<P>jilseponie atreries <BR>43 shaman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, lets not get terribly concerned about things that aren't really in the game yet.<BR>That said, I fail to see the reasoning in giving druids pets. They are already insanely powerful soloers. With the 2 kunark dots they get shortly after lvl 50, they do thousands of points of damage in short order. That is coupled with snaring, nuking, and group buffs that make shamans look silly.<BR>[We] shamans are just upset that one of their major trump cards was given away. If our 55 pet was better (or even acceptable), I don't think folks would be as irritated.<BR>As for big woop about the slow spell, *luckily* it is an INCREDIBLY useful spell. Its just too bad that we really aren't very useful beyond that in mid to late 50s groups. This means 1 shaman per midsize raid. Others aren't very welcome. I can't tell you how many raid recruitment posts I see where they have the #s of desired classes needed, and it says "shaman: 1 MAX". Ugh.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, i dont think that the druid pet will be that good, but it is a unique thing about shaman that is sorta cheeze to give to a druid.  they already get our high level dots<P>As far as the reported (emphasis on reported) bear form, it blows.  Why?<P>Well reportedly it makes you a bear, gives you wisdom, and gives you strength.<P>Wisdom would be great, but when we get this spell (what 55 or so?) all shaman worth 2cp have 200 wisdom.  After 200 you are better off to have mana items than widom items.<P>Strength is usless for us at higher levels relative to combat.<P>What is it good for?  Well it will probably imporve faction and the STR can help vs encumberane.  I think id take an imporvement to our last pet please!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Give me the ability to wear plate and i wouldnt care a bit about a pet <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Ohhh but im a nature freak and it makes sense that i cant wear plate? ok i agree with that...but if THAT is true..give me 1 good reason that the class that is supposedly CLOSEST tied to nature should NOT get a pet other than the fact that Shamans with their "through the roof" AC dont want us to get one. Dont yell for improvements to your class and nerfs to others, im QUITE positive druids have been nerfed more than enuff by now.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a druid, I still think that we don't need a pet. Adding the pet will most like be the trade off for the bear form for shamans. Because a lot of druids will be upset, if shamans get a change shape spell and druids not a pet.<P>It is most likely known, that the bearform will add 40str and 10wis. But it is not known, how strong the druid pet will be. Most likely it will be a pet like the clerics pet and in this matter more then useless.<P>I say the same as bevor Kunark. Lets stay and wait, bevor getting big discussions. Maybe Verant will release the stats of the pet, so we can talk about or we will just see, as soon the spell is life and then "nerf" the pet, if it is too strong.<P>- Ainalda<BR>Wanderer of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not true,<P>Druids are *Protectors of Nature* not just Earth people, all of their spells revolve around plants, animals and nature.  Wolves, Bears, Treants, etc. all love them and are protected by the druids.  I could see a much better chance of druids having pet wolves, bears, or even treants, than I could a shaman.  Shaman's are medicine men, witch doctors, tribal priests.  They are focused on healing, mystic potions and improving/lowering others' abilities.<P>With that said, I think a pet for the druid is a BAD idea.  To add a pet to any class at this point would have a greater chance of messing up the *balance*.  And at the level, the pet would just get in the way.  Honestly, would you want to drag a pet with you, that will most likely be cosmetic vs. useful, into a dungeon or on a plane raid?  A pet would just get you into trouble at that point.<P>I would rather see them expand/improve on some existing spell lines.  Possibly, alternate animal/plant shape shifting forms ... Kodiak form, Treant form, etc.  Or, change the charm animal spell line to a permanent effect or at least non-agro when it breaks.  And increase the resist rate so that it was harder to initially charm the animal, but once you did, it was your pet.  As it is now, the spell line is rarely used.<P>Rather than add completely new lines of spells to the druid and risk having to remove it later, they should just make changes to the existing spell lines.<P>Tundrawolf<BR>33rd Wood Elf druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok,i dont care druids will get a pet,it wont be close to be good at this level or verant will have to explain to shamans why they have weak pets.<P>If they give pet to druid to balance the bear form from shaman,what do shamans get to balance the teleports?<P>If druids are proctectors of nature and shamans are witch doctor,tribal priest focusing on healing,why are we just as good as druids for healing?We should be better by this definition.<P>After level 50, druids get nearly as good dots as shamans,way more powerful DD's and same healing power. We get.... buffs and one good debuff.<P>Shamans dont get any useful offensive spell before 54 but it is a weak dd,then 56 than 59,last two are very powerful dots,but they are just a bit more efficient than druids ones.Druids get them at 52-53 we get them at 56-59.Druids also get a better COLD base DD spell than shaman.<BR>Druids also get more useful groups spells like regrowth and group dmg shield.Druids get snare and roots,we get root.<P>Only thing shamans get that is very useful and druids dont is the tugur line of spell.If we are so close,why is there so much differences?<P>Druids need something to balance bear form?

</FONT><HR>Charm isn't a pet spell.  The charm line of spells has been *broken* or at least, very damaged since the beginning.  Charming an animal is very dangerous.  It has a good chance of being resisted, the animal turns agro once it's broken, and on the occasional times when the charm sticks, it lasts for about 30 seconds or until you pull a mob.<P>I've used charm occasionally for the novelty of it, but I would never consider it a pet spell.  If charm was changed to non-agro when it broke, I would use it all the time and consider it as close to a true pet spell as a druid should get.<P>I know that raising your charisma is supposed to improve charm animal's effectiveness, but if it does, it isn't noticeable.  I've seen a druid testing the charm line with a 190+ boosted charisma and had nearly the exact same results as a druid with half that charisma.<P>Maybe, the charm line for Shamans works better/differently.  It is nice to hear of someone using the spell.<P>Tundrawolf<BR>34th Wood Elf Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think you are all nuts to be crying about this. The druid pet is weak, very very weak. Why? Well druids asked for a pet for a companion. Druids also stated when they purposed this spell that they would be willing to have to protect thier pet as opposed to having the pet protect them. The spell is a novelty, nothing more.<P>Next we go on to Bear Form, an equally novel spell with the same use. Roleplaying.<P>I know no druids (good ones) that would possibly want a pet while kiting. There is no "/pet stay close and out of trouble" nor a "/pet don't attack" command. The puppy will be a pain in battle.<P>These two are novelty spells. Plz my fellow Shaman, let spend this energy on RAGE, frenzy and fury.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am not sure what you guys are whining about.  The spell isn't in the game, the pet will probably suck because as another poster mentioned pets don't fit druid soloing style (if they had a non-animal only fear spell it might).  The thing that irratates me the most is you are all talking about soloing, who wants to solo ?  It is boring.  Post 40 druids almost become dysfunctional in a group and post 50 it is laughable.  Most groups would much rather have a shaman post 50 than a druid, after they have got a ride of course, than a druid.  My shaman is still low level but already I can see how much more group friendly it is than my druid.  So while druids are out in burning woods or where ever kiting and talking to their pet, my shaman will be in dungeons getting actual loot and talking to real people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On behalf of all Shamans who are, or ever were for that matter, truly what a Shaman is supposed to be I'd like to apologize for any players who chose to post here with whines.<P>I'd also like to empathize with any of you Druids who feel that some of the Druidic posters here have misrepresented you. My post goes out only to those Shamans who enjoy, and understand, their class as it is and are not concerned with how it was and will never be again. As well my post is targetted for those Druids who understand the need for balance in the game and what and who they believe their classes are really about.<P>It's to you that I say the following: Your class is whatever you make of it. I personally feel that the Shaman bear form is being looked at the wrong way, the spell is called: "Form of the Great Bear" and if you know much about the Shaman class you should know that Shamans are spirit callers. Their importance lies within the spirits that abound all among us and they call to those spirits in time of need or, in the cases of evil spiritmasters such as my own Troll Shaman, they master the spirits around them and force them to work for their bidding and personal gain. Whereas Druids are in tune, from what I've seen examples of here, with nature, animals and all things leafy.<P>It makes sense to me that Shamans get wolf SPIRIT pets (which is what they are, spirits). It also makes sense to me that Druids get Bear pets. It makes sense to me that Druids can take on the form of a living Wolf. It also makes sense to me that a Shaman might be able to take on the total embodiment of a Great Bear Spirit. Consider it a channeling of the next level, now not only do you have the bear spirit inside of you but you become the bear spirit itself, because you are just that in tune with, or a master of, spirits themselves.<P>-Just my 2cp<BR>-Dinguss Dorfeeter<BR>-50th, Morell Thule, Sinister</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm so tired of hearing how druids get everything.If they are soooo godly make one for yourself. Why not pick on wizzys?The get tp's and the only ones to some of the planes??Nukes to kill about anything.As far as shaman give us all your buffs and take our pet.I would give up a pet to have them buffs.All i see anymore is how druids get it all..YOU ALL CAN MAKE 8 CHARS..Make yourself a druid and see how godly they are.If you dont have 200wis then you can forget kiting higher lvl.You chose your char because it had things you like..Did a druid take them from you when they gave us pets?Nope still the same shammy. Sorry for sounding bitter but the druid bashing is getting old!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only way to escape a bear is to run downhill.  Their front legs are much shorter than their rear legs.  As such, they cannot run downhill very fast or they risk toppelling head over shoulder.  As true bipeds, we can handle the downhill speed far better than they can.<P>And since most bears do not consider humans as a major source of nutrition, they usually become aggressive because of their instinctive territoriality.  By running, you are confirming the bear's right to that area - - and it probably will not pursue you once you've gained some distance.<P>Probably. &lt;Grin&gt;<P>Also, do not try to stare down a bear.  avert your eyes if you can and back up slowly.  Keep them in your peripheral vision.  They will perceive a "staring match" as a challenge and will react accordingly.<P>Daku Inochi<BR>54th Vicar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lets think about this... Druids should not have pets?<P>EQ is based on Dungeons and Dragons BIG TIME!  A D&D Druid starts with a pet at level 1 according to the new players manual just released.<P>Besides that Druid are Neutral in alignment... Just like animals except they are also subject to both good and evil.  However rare there are evil druids out there.  Mithrael Marr knows I have seen a few in my day.<P>Bear form    vs   Wolf form<P>LOL has anyone even used this spell yet?<P>BTW a bear will kill any dog/wolf and eat it for lunch litteraly.  I am sure you not get the sort end of the stick here shamans.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>let them have the spell. make it a good pet, hard hitting and lots of ac. maybe then they would freaking make the shaman pet worth something, higher lvl or something, or perhaps some original spells. or perhaps potion ports to new areas. not the same recycled sheit that everyone else has. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000167-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000167-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000167&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000167&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
