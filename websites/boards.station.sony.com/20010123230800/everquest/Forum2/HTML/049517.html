</FONT><HR>For a while now melees have been far superior to casters in PvP despite the general belief that casters are still ganking poor melees like they used to in the early days. With Kunark came great melee items such as regen tunics and über weapons and the disciplines are absolutely deadly in PvP. And now as a final touch you are introducing blue diamond jewellery. Spells were bouncing off people even before, but now they simply cannot be touched.<P>Have you ever fought a lvl 60 SK with HT, fungal tunic and 200 resists? The damage on HT + disc alone will actually kill some casters some times. Or how about a lvl 60 monk with a fungal tunic, tranq staff and disc inner flame? One proc and you are dead before you can regain control of your char. You think a wizard’s lure spells are powerful in PvP? Think again, the casting time is much to slow and the nerfed PvP damage is not enough. Necro dots? Lol, the only ones that stick can be dispelled with one click on the pumice stone (e.g. splurt which is pretty crappy anyway, but I won’t go into that) <P>I seriously doubt your game developers  even know that PvP exists when creating such powerful items and discs. Please get a clue.<P>/rude Verant<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"explain why SB is the most highly anticipated game out there on PCGamer then?"<P>My guess is that pvp aways looks better on paper then it turns out when the game finally comes out.  There are some people who really crave pvp and those people might well be among the first to leave EQ when a new pvp game come out.  I do not think that this is the majority however.   I think that mose people would rather not have to worry about someone ruining their day.  IMO that is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Xombie, I play alot of classes, but that has nothing to do with this post. I haven't done much testing, but at lvl 55 an SK does about 1100 almost unresistable damage with his HT. You think that's ok?<P>RunDMZ, I believe you're wrong actually. Alot of people would play on a PvP server if the system wasn't as flawed as it is now.

</FONT><HR>It's sooooo easy to accidentally leave an opening to make PvP exploitable and therefore not "fun"....  and from what I've read of SB they are missing some key points.  The virtual world has no moral or legal reaction on killing other players.... implimenting one would be a monumental task that I haven't seen even rumored at on any game (will maybe a little in HZ)... without these constraints in place people WILL random kill and WILL do everythign they can to ruin other peoples game.  It's just a sad fact of the sub-culture.<P>Yes SB is highly anticipated.... but mostly by PvPers which happen to be a very vocal bunch.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But there will always be loopholes because RPing always allows for the "bad" guy which in turn will allow for peoples play time being ruined which will in turn cause the deturrence of the Mass market players EQ has with its PvE focus.<P>There is interest with the crowding of Vallon Zek and such.

</FONT><HR>Heh Pagan, in a way you're right. If you don't have resist gear as a melee you're going to bite the dust pretty fast. <P>The problem is (and one of the reasons for this post) that it's very easy nowadays for anyone to get high resists, especially melees who always had an advantage in this area. With the introduction of blue diamond jewellery you can get your resists so high that you are UNTOUCHABLE to most of the spells. And at the same time you have items like tranq staff that procs an irresistible stun and discs like HT that can kill a caster in one shot.<P>You loonies who are cool with this need to get a clue. The fact that casters were powerful pre Kunark doesn’t justify this imbalance. This absolutely disrespect for the PvP community need to stop.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Casters are still in control of the outcome of the battle.  They have gate.  They do not need to be in melee range to do any damage.  They can move around, use lag to prevent melee from hitting.  They can levitate and get out of reach.  They can cast through walls, around corners.<P>2. I'm sorry an SK can't reach all 200 resists with equipment, don't exaggerate, makes your points look bad.<P>3. The *discipline* version of SK HT (the one that will do 1100hp pvp) is checked vs. disease.  It is not unresistable.  Do your homework, get DR up.  Their lower damage regular HT is unresistable though now.  BTW, the SK must be in melee range for it to work.<P>4. So you are saying that unresistable splurt should be unremoveable? that spell alone will kill most characters if not dispelled.  You have to be kidding.  You also have poison and disease based dots - while resistable - few people have high DR and PR.  Forgot to mention them?  Lifetaps are also unresistable.<P>Your ego is just being hurt b/c a few melee actually have the *possibility* of killing you now, whereas before you were a god.  Deal.<P>Now, rangers, shadow knights, monks, rogues have been added to the list of pretty good PVP killers.  This list previously included only: necros, druids, wizards.  The list just got bigger - oh no the world's gonna end.<P>I play a paladin btw - yes I have a hard time killing anybody (I can on occasion)- but yeah, they have a damn hard time killing me. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. Abashail, sorry, but gate is not a good reason enough for casters to be happy about this. Yes I can cast through walls and around corners, but if you actually knew what you were talking about you'd know that it's considered an exploit and is warnable so give me something else.<P>2. I never said an SK can get 200 to all, but with buffs they can easily get pretty close. A full set of blue diamond jewellery will give you this:<P>+62 poison & disease resist <BR>+59 cold resist <BR>+57 fire resist <BR>+46 magic resist <P>Some of the items will of course replace some of your previous items, but the increase in stats are still tremenduos.<P>3. Ok, I guess I was wrong saying it's not irrestistible then, but an 1100 damage HT at lvl 55?? You got to be kidding if you think that's ok. It's not even nerfed to 66% damage like other DDs and dots with casting time.<P>4. No, I didnt say splurt should be unremovable, but as it is now it's way to easy to remove and therefor it's completely useless. And while the DR and PR based dots can't be pumiced they are very easy to resist especially with this new jewellery. I haven't had ebolt stick on me for months. (and btw you can remove it easy with counter poison, cost a few pp at your local vendor)<P>I play a 50+ monk as well so if I wanted to boost my ego I could very well play him. Tranq staff own all casters.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  If the designers would have kept the tanks as non-casting pure melee as it was in the beginning of the game, I would have no problem with this new jewelry.  But when Kunark came out, and now Velious, tanks can cast almost as many spells as an actual caster.  Sticks with shielding, full sets of armor that buff the tank and the like all supposedly "balanced" them a little more.  Now that these tanks can buff themselves, proc DD's and dots, and also resist just about everything, it has become too unbalanced.  Even if I use lure I will still be near oom if the tank just stands there not attacking and they might have some sort of healing item or mend to cancel the dmg that I've already done.  This is just not right.  Not only do I have to get resist gear to protect myself from other casters, I have to use it to save me from a tank with charged items.  If tanks can resist all my spells, why do they still beat the hell out of me with their weapons?  Shouldn't it work both ways?  I might be rambling too much, so I'm gonna leave it at that.<P>Pyromous <BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well Huktonfonix, I realize that a lot of people disagree with me and I have to admit that I am a bit surprised that not more people question the über powers of melees at higher levels. If you think fungal tunics, tranq staves and dics are powerful in PvE it's nothing compared to what they can do in PvP. I know plenty of people who agree with me though, but I guess they decided not to come here.<P>I have played PvP since the beginning of time and I honestly feel that things are getting really imbalanced. The only class that can somewhat compare to melees are necros and that is only due to their life taps. Mind you, I play both caster and melee 50+ so I don't think I am biased.<P>Anyway, the blue diamond jewellery is very new and I think more people are going to realize the impact it will have on PvP game play when more people start using it. Before it was very hard to get high resists all over the board, but now this is going to change as I demonstrated above. Necros and shamans are the big losers here since people in general couldn’t get their DR and PR up and still keep high resists on FR/CR/MR, but all casters will be effected.<P>Oh well, I guess I’ll shut up for now. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I whine all the time about clerics being ineffective in PVP  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Clerics shouldn't have uber offensive capacity, but a lure-type stun or two would be appropriate.  Level 8 enchanters get a stun that beats the holy hell out of any cleric stun (level 58 stun included).  Not to mention our crappy melee skill stat maximum of 175. As it is, the only thing we can do in pvp at high levels is perhaps interrupt pure casters or out heal them. <P>I personally am looking forward to the blue diamond jewelry.  The level 60 wizard ice nuke  deals about 800 damage in PVP, 4 seconds to cast it.<P>One thing that people fail to mention about inequalities in PVP, casters vs. melee, is the 'to hit' rolls and damage rolls with respect to level difference.<BR> <BR>Put a level 52 melee against a level 60 wizard, and the melee has a very hard time dealing appreciable damage based on level difference only.  Lots of misses and low damage rolls are generally the case.  This is a bunch of crap.  Pure casters should be fodder for melee hits, regardless of level.  Just because a wizard has levels on the melee it shouldn't render him with effectively higher AC.<P>The PVP system in EQ really sucks I think.

</FONT><HR>All the resistance debuffs in game need fast cast times and larger reductions done to the stat it effects. Enchanters, for instance, are now forced to flee from players how are below them in levels, and that is not right at all.<P>Should there be a point where resists can be a safe guard against most spells of that type?<P>Yes. But never 100% resistant on each and every single cast.<P>Should there be a way to reduce the resists significantly on a target?<P>Yes, but never to the point that each and every spell lands.<P>Even the playing field Verant. This is what class balance is all about. Players are MOBs just like anything else.<P>And the reason why the majority doesn't play PvP in EQ, is because they fear it. They think someone will ruin their day. Which, is far from the truth if you learn your server. Only occasionally will you run in to that personality. About as often as you do on a non-PvP server.<P>What's broken in PvP?<P>Cross team healers/buffers. (oor we can deal with, but not xteaming exploits)<P>Xp Pking, intentional or otherwise (no different then someone training on you, so its not a PvP specific problem at all).<P>Corpse camping (doesn't happen as often as you'd think, but still needs to be worked out).<P>Bind spot camping (same as corpse camping, in fact, if you bind in a smart location, you will hardly ever experience this).<P>Uber guards that are trained to xp kill (happens on non-PvP servers as well).<P>Uber guards that should not be in this game to save low level fools that don't lose any xp anyway, preventing raids on other teams cities.<P>Spell resistance checks across the board need to be addressed.<P>Spell cast times and melee interrupts need to be balanced.<P>Many quests nearly impossible because they don't have a real story line involving your race, but send the person to enemy cities to deal with enemy NPCs, or worse yet... hour/day long camps in enemy zones.<P>There's a few others, but that's basically it. People can ruin your day just as easily on a non-PvP server as they can on a PvP server. Its just on the PvP server you or someone you know can get revenge. Heck, half of the Tallon Zek population stays away from PvP as much as possible. You can only find maybe, 5-10% of the players actively PKing at any given time. Most are busy playing Everquest itself, as everyone has the right to do. You think I go around owning people with my mad skills day in day out?<P>Heck no. I'm playing Everquest (and I don't have any mad skills heh). PvP is just another slice of pie to go with it. You earn your levels and equipment in spite of other players trying to stop you. That's the real thrill to EQ PvP, not the fights themselves. Anyone on any server can have a good PvP fight, so this is not the reason most play PvP.<P>Just because one plays PvP doesn't mean they are now subject to harassment. A player has rights in this game given to them by Verant. And the right to play PvE without undue harassment still exists (just remember, being killing by an enemy is not undue harassment no matter how low on hp/mana you are).<P>If you look at EQ PvP overall. The problems that exist in PvP are generally not because of the players nor the PvP design. The problem is with EQ itself, and the way they choose to implement certain things. And guess what folks, I can all be fixed if someone would just get off their ass and do it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
