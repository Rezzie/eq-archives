And as the par, I use the Cleric/enchanter weapons, and what is required to complete this quest.<P>Maybe a lot of people don't know, but I was EXTREMELY lucky to get my weapon.  I've got a decent to good rep on my server, and a lot of friends helped me with the god drops.  And a guildmate had the sky cloak on a character he didn't play...<P>So with just that, I was able to complete one of the harder FA quests in a short time...<P>That being said, what is needed to get this thing is not worth it.  Had I not had everything ready, I wouldn't have cared if I finished it.  I wouldn't have gone out of my way to do this quest.  <P>If someone else had it, and I stood next to them, there would have been no envy.<P>Well, I'm sorry, but the uber weapons, ALL OF THEM, should be something that makes your peers jealous.  They should send you tells saying "You #$%!@#!!!  Give me that!"<P>Sorry, but when I weild my duck of death, I don't feel a sense of accomplishment, I don't feel epic, and I definately don't feel more powerful.<P>Just my opinion...take it or leave it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know alot of Necros dont have a great understanding of the warrior class or their issues, I will just summarise their concern.<P>The only way a warrior can successfully stay high enough on the mobs hate list is to deliver fast damage or have weapons proc with very high taunt effects.<P>Warriors cant rely on a proc so they need fast damage or else rangers and some casters will be creamed by mobs.  No point being a tank if the mob isnt hitting you.<P>Warriors have a wide range of kunark weapons with a sub 20 delay, some with decent ratios.  Whilst the warrior FA weapons have good ratios they are not fast enough to be used by any high level warrior.<P>Their self buff proc doesnt stack with clerical buffs making it... useless.<P>From what i have read, the proc doesnt go off in many zones, not sure if this is accurate, if its true it reall does rival the necro and shaman weapons for crappiness.<P>Off topic, i played my new Erudite Necro on the weekend, up to level 12 now. Woo!  I'll get my own duck one day, not!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Abashi dispelled this rumor, stating that Rogues recieved no such prize. <P>A concered Solusek Ro player posted to the boards today pleading for a split, stating that things were much too overcrowded. In a quick rebuttal, Abashi gave the response that there are many under utilized areas that are not crowded. <P>Gee thanks for taking care of these burning issues that obviously demand immediate attention.

</FONT><HR>Folks..let's not bash on Abashi..let's just correct his thinking since I belive, based on his comment, that we have a legit bug here.<P>First...I see where he was going with the ST comment.  If the effect were resisted then the mob would be rushing towards you and you could ST it.  If the ST stuck, you would have plenty of time to use the effect at least once.  If it resisted again, you would almost have time to try again; if it stuck, then the mob would, of course, wake up because of the first tick of damage from the DoT, but so what...the ST was just to stop the mob from clobbering you until the snare stuck.<P>That said, I seldom have ST memed unless we have no 'chanter.  I never snare unless we have neither druid nor ranger.  Soo, this scenario would only occur if there were no chanter, no druid, and no ranger.  I can't remember the last time I was in a group where none of those classes were present.<P>**** Bug Alert ****<P>Abashi...you said the staff's effect was a DoT and like all DoTs the damage and thus the duration is constant assuming it is not initially resisted.

</FONT><HR>Abashi, please, sorry for the flames. Lets talk a second.<P>Our concerns are basicly 2 fold<P>1- Effect<BR> The effect breaks, and breaks ALOT! This dark breaks FAAAAAR more than dark, infact, I have NEVER had dark break, ONCE IT WAS ON. I put that in caps, since Dark has high resists. Often, something will resist 4 casts ,in a row. Now, we aint talking 29th lvl dark, we are talking for the 49th lvl dark, with mobs blue to me at 53rd.<P>Simply put, someone made a boo boo on the resist check. Please, just have someone look at it. I think when you do, you will see it. <P>2- Graphic "Daffy Staffy"<P>Come on. can you, someone that PLAYS a necro, think this graphic is good? It looks like a DUCK! Look at all the other class items. Not a single one makes the user feel stupid weilding it. Everyone, when they saw the screen shots, was hoping their class item was not the daffy staffy.<BR>Can someone HONESTLY say this thing looks good? Not one SINGLE necro likes it! Not a one! People say they can DEAL with it. <P>Maybe, the graphics could be like the Spectre sykle, since that is a graphic in all zones, and make the blade glow, black or red. Heck, just make the blade flame like a FA. Any of these would be VERY welcome over the daffy staffy.<P><BR>Other than these 2 changes, the item aint bad.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>First, <P>Thank you for replying.<P>Now I'm not going to flame you but I want you to at least think about this.  You claim you play a necro so this should be old news to you.<P>Problem 1:<BR>Necros, and I mean all skillful necros, don't use darkness as anything more then a snare.  The important thing about snare is that it is a short cast, so that IF it is resisted (and darkness often is) you have time to recast it.  For this reason, no skillful necro (which you must be to obtain this item) uses a darkness other than their level 29 one.  Therefore, no one will use this pathetic effect, because it is worse then spells we already have and already do not use.<P>Problem 2:<BR>Unreliability.  Look at the log, or the other thread on this topic.  This spell wore off prematurely on a level 30 ranger in EC (NPC, the one near the rune, not a PC).  When a epic item can't last full duration on a mob I was soloing at 27, there is a problem.  Heck, if I managed to twink a necro with this item,  I wouldn't use the effect past 29, except to maybe pull...MAYBE.<P>Problem 3:<BR>Necros, if they know anything, don't solo past level 54.  The reason is because the mobs have too many HP, and its too slow.  Dungeon XP is faster and in a group you can kill enough to make up for the fact that you are grouped.  Now, this being the case, there is a GOOD chance that there will be a wizard, druid, ranger etc. that can impede the movement of a fleeing mob.  Why on earth would I use a high agro, random duration spell that takes 9 seconds when I could use that 9 seconds (which is roughly 1/2 a battle) to tap, dump mana, or keep mobs mez'd if we are unlucky enough to have no enchanter.  I WILL NEVER USE THIS EFFECT.<P>Abashi, doesn't it strike you as odd that every necro says they won't use this effect?  Don't you understand that regardless of how cool you think it is and how defensive you get about this weapon, isn't it us, the players who will ultimately judge its utility and worth?<P>I'm sorry, but this is just sad.<P>This is not to mention even the stats which are easily beatable by the enchanter AND Cleric items.<P>Take a look at these 2 threads:<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024699.html<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024336.html<P>Read those, and make your judgement.  I'm not going to beg you to change it.  In fact I'd rather you say "I'm sorry, we screwed up, and the person who made this has never played a necro, or Everquest", because I'm quite sure anyone with a clue could have created a better effect.  Its strange how you'll change the shaman one, but won't even give us the benefit of the doubt...<P>Zrazzt...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So why in the world &lt;or in this case Hell&gt; would I want to use one with a 9 second casting time?!?  There would be no way I could ever recast this if it broke.  Which brings us to point two.<P>The darkness line doesn't check for resistance each tick with the effect of the staff is reported to do so.  That is just stupid.  The darkness line is all of nothing, no resistance check not multiple!<P>Not to bash &lt;well at least not to much&gt; you Abashi but you might want to spend a bit more time trying to understand 'Your' class...<P>Bril<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hey gordon, stand back and take a look at this item one more time.  Ask yourself the question, "Will a Shaman use thise epic item effect?"<P>Will a Cleric?<BR>Enchanter?<BR>etc...<P>The answer is yes, yet necros, with this item, will not.  Any well equiped necro, which any who could get this item would be, will not use the effect.<P>I have a slight chance at getting it. and spent a while  trying to race with people posting spoilers, but have stopped at mansai herb, because  that is when i saw the effect of this.<P>A good necro, will have 200 int, and around 300 mana on average, and most good necros, know you do a lil damage, and snare at the end.  #1 9 seconds or whatever cast time, is too long for it to be usefull at the end of the fight, and since you really cant afford to have a snare you cannot count on to stay its duration, the staff is not an option here.  Look at krup frogs in Sebilis, sometimes they will run away, at near SoW speed, if not snared.<P>Now soloing, the art of a necromancer, whatever you wanna call it, It is not worth using because of the extra spell slots you would need to fill up, to protect yourslef if the spell resists.  Use darkness, it resists, you can run well enough with jboots, to get another dark off.  etc...<P>Im not talking about Burning Woods giants, im talking about real mobs, like  Elder Wyverns, and Mature creatures in Sky Fire Etc...  Crap in BW etc.. is hardly a challenge, Gorgul isnt even hard.<P>Now alot of necros, will use this, by virtue of, the can, but i see no use in the effect.  I'm a level 55 necro, with way too much time played, and in my ever so humble opinion, this effect, is worthless to me.  And i do group, and i do solo, and  do cr, and i do break fear.  Im not sheltered.  Hope ya read this =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, does this mean that the weapon is bugged? Is it NOT supposed to check for a resist on every tick of the DoT? If the weapon is bugged, then I understand your post. If the weapon is working "as intended" all your strategy is going to accomplish is getting you killed. <P>Example:<P>You spot the mob you wish to kill. Your Duck o' Death begins to quack. The target resists the spell and comes running toward you. You cast Screaming Terror and the mob stops in it's tracks. Your Duck o' Death begins to quack again. The snare takes, the first tick of damage hits, the screaming terror wears off. Now you either fear the mob or DoT it depending on your battle preference. After the fear, you definitely DoT it because you're a necromancer. Your DDs suck. Another tick of damage is about to hit, the program checks for resistance. The spell is resisted. The snare is now broken. The mob is now either running away from you or toward you. Either way you're not going to have 9 seconds to cast the spell and you're not going to be able to mez it again. You either have to snare it with your level 29 spell, or you need to zone. <P>If the spell is working as intended, then you still need to keep a faster casting darkness mem'd. If you have to do that, what use is having a "mana-free darkness spell"?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMFG those responses are infuriating.<P>/em takes some time to calm down.<P>First, there IS something wrong with a free high end darkness spell.  We dont use Cascading or Devouring.  Why would we use one in between?  To answer that, look at why necros use the darkness series, and why we dont use Cascading or Devouring.  Can anyone who works at Verant answer that?  Probably not, because you dont play the game like your players do.<P>Second, assuming you WOULD cast this spell, who in the HELL is going to be soloing at the levels they acquire the epic necro item?  *** is the point?<P>On to your next response.  LOOK AT THE LOGS!  There is a resist check every tick.  Intended or not, it is there.<P>To sum up:  This item is VERY hard to get.  I realize that because it was one of the first 5 class quests completed might lead you to believe otherwise, but dont let that fool you.<P>You need a) a drop from CT b) a drop from Inny.  Both of those encounters are cake right now, sure, but chances are you are fighting multiple other guilds or alliances for a shot at a God.  Also, neither God always loads what you need.<P>c) you need a drop from DEEP within Chardok.  Thanks to the buggy as hell nature of this zone (which you dont seem to care about fixing as the weight of your resources are devoted to cranking out more buggy content that you can charge for ie. Velious) getting this herb requires 3 awesome groups, or 4-5 groups.  In other words, the same muscle you need to take down Inny or CT.<P>Finally, the kicker IMO, you need a Sky reward which requires a rare drop from the Keeper of Souls, boss of isle 4 in Sky.  This item has flat out never dropped on most servers I would be willing to bet.<P>This quest is hard, the reward is not in line with what is required to get it.<P>Change the graphic, it is a freaking joke.  Keep the handle, change the duck skull to a black scythe blade with the little fear skulls as the particle effect.  Change the effect.  Make it an improved augment death spell, something like 70% haste, more AC, and either instant cast or longer duration.  We DONT want or need a darkness 'upgrade'.<P>Sayleth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>To sum up:<P>Either: <P>A)  The effect is working as intended, and it is supposed to do a resistence check every tick.<P>-or-<P>B) The effect is bugged and is broken.<P>If (A) then there is no point in using this effect as we have better<P>If (B) then it will be fixed and give us a 9 second darkness, which we won't use.<P>In either case, the effect will NEVER get used.<P>I have a darkness at 4, 12, 29, 49, and 59.  I have used the darkness at 59 ONCE to test it, I've used the 49 darkness 10x (once to test it, and the other time I was in a contest with a friend in sebilis to see who could be summoned more by a mob, 15 summons btw, in 1 battle).  If I need to darkness, it defaults to my level 29 darkness.<P>There ya have it.  Thanks for the effect that will not be used.  Please feel free to change the cleric FA weapon to a 5 minute cast revive, the Enchanter weapon to a 10 minute cast 10% haste... (sarcasm) because thats precisely the equivalent of what you've given us.<P>(Yes, I know you didn't program it, I'm refering to verant by saying you)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/ponders Abashi<BR>Abashi by your answer you sound like a soloer.  If I am in a 50+ group I can assure you that our Necro is not the puller. Therefore the only time you found this spell usefull -pulling- is completely irrelevant here.  Really now, just listen to Zrazzt as he knows how to play a necro since he is the only one ever to complete this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
