</FONT><HR>A section on etiquette would make a great addition, right from the beginning.<P>For example:<P>Is asking other players the best way to equip my new character?  (i.e. people are sometimes charitable, but begging is annoying)<P>How should I use the inspect option?  (explain what it does, and that some people consider it more polite to ask before you inspect them.)<P>I think it would help A LOT if there was a section on "dead issues" though it would probably be prudent to call it something more like "Design questions."  In here, give a succinct explanation on melee binding, exp distribution, why can't my class do such-and-such.  I'm sure you'll come up with loads of them.<P>And, yeah, table of contents all the way =)  That thing is ridiculous.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>guice - I understand what you are saying, but I must disagree. With every game I buy, there are certain steps I always take with everyone of them.  1) Buy game.  2) Install game.  3) Run & play game.<P>Then after running around bumping in to things looking at all the perty graphics and dazzling effects of spells and whatnot, I log out and search for that newbie guide that explains all the things that newbies need to know on their first day.<P>Then after I have had a chance to get used to the basics, I then turn to the manual to find out all the in-depth information.<P>Although the info is in the big ole manual, it is still important to include some of that into the newbie guide.<P>Hehe, as a veteran, RTFM is right!<BR>But as a newbie, manual - what manual - I just want to play!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why can't the FAQ be setup like a knowledge database or at the very least something similiar to Microsoft's Help Index's (Can't believe I actually suggested that, but it's the closest example I could think of.)<P>This would enable a newbie to type in a word or phrase and the FAQ would pull up all relevent topics related.<P>Heck, look at the many EQ fan sites for ideas and examples.  AllaKhazam's, Caster's Realm, etc. have really good examples.<P>While we are at it.  Why can't you incorporate a way to get decent help/faq while in the game?  Something better than /help I mean come on, the manual that comes with the game is pretty pathetic.  If it weren't for all the online spoiler sites I think many of us would have given up long ago.<P>In game maps would be great, could even be quest items or a trade skill.  I for one hate getting lost, but a 3D world is much harder to map onto our old pen and paper graphs while still trying to play.  Hence, unless you have previously downloaded the map for the zone from one of the online sites it makes it almost impossible unless you have a lot of time to do it right.  <P>I guess I kinda got off topic, but hopefully some of these ideas will be kicked around.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some of the things metioned so far are more for comical relief than anything else. <P>I have a few problems andthey are that - <P>1. The inconsistency between server GM's/players/VI on what are appropriate and inappropriate names or surnames.  Just about every week we have people coming in here and complaining about how a perfectly legal name has been changed.  There should also be a clause that names cant be changed after a certain level (40 or so) as by that time most players have been on the server several weeks or months for some and there has been plenty of time for their name to be changed before then.  The story a while backk about lvl 60 characters having their names changed was sofar beyond belief I can't believe VI stood by and let that decision stand.  You say people have to live by their reputations (one reason you don't allow server moves) yet taking away peoples names is taking away that reputation they have spent months working on.  It's irresponsoble and should be considered more carefully. This also applies to guild names as well.  Was a debate recently about whether Tolkien's Revenge was legal or not as  a guild name or not.  VI were ****ting their pants because they were afraid of being sued by the Tolkien estate for use of their name.  Point that surnames can't be owned is beside the point.  Maybe it is name of a popular fantasy fiction writer but what if the guild leaders surname had been Tolkien would that have changed your mind? Tolkien is a name and thus can't be owned.  If I change my name legally to Tolkien would the Tolkien estate be after me?  This just isn't about this guild name but many others including FOH.  Sure they may say that it is a well know phrase (maybe to them) BUT it is also the title of a well known part of fantasy fiction which I would say over 75% of EQ players have heard of.  I bet when most players on boards or anywhere else hear the name of Fires of Heaven they think of the book by Jordan than what they say it means and thus are in violation of the naming policy.  I don't want their name removed as they are too well known and they are the uber guild VI hate so much.  <P>2. Server moves, who can and who can't.  Another sore point with me.  Over last 6 months we have heard lots of stories about characters or even whole guilds been moved yet other stories of other individuals being told that they will not be allowed to move.  The 1FOL debacle really highlighted this issue and the whole guild was moved cause they claim they were being harassed by the server when in fact most of the server was just showing respect that one of their guild died in real life.  This is not harassment and would only a few days or weeks if that long and they should be honored that so many people in this world care so much about people they have never met.  The fact that on their own board they had been planning the move before the death didn't help them on the boards tho so they lost a few fans there.  Point is there have been individuals/guilds who have had stronger claims to be moved from their server yet have been told a blunt no-one can be transferred between servers except for a /movelog command and everyone who knows and reads these boards knows that this is untrue.  It can be done and the reason you don't do it is as I said above you want people to live by the reputations they have earned on their server and suffer the consequences. <P>Look at what I have said on these two issues and why they need to be addressed in the FAQ....naming policy needs to be standardised so a GM having a bad day can't go on a rampage to make himself feel better and also make uniform AND documented rules on moving servers and how you can do it.  Please don't say it can't be done as everyone here on the boards knows it can and does. <P>Thank you<P>Kodomo Sunsoar<BR>Guildleader<BR>Honor of Povar<BR>Povar<P>P.S Please email me if you need to discuss anything I have commented on in the above essay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Which FAQ please?<BR>the Everquest FAQ at http://everquest.station.sony.com/faq.shtml<BR>or the Forum FAQ at<BR>http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.shtml<P>The general Everquest FAQ was apparently created before the Everquest was released.  Notice all the questions are written in the future tense.  I'd change that, if it was up to me.<P>But here are my top three FAQ submissions:<BR>1) A completely accurate description of resurrection time limits.  Check with a developer and tester to be sure the answer matches actual in-game functionality.  I know that it differs based on whether you died to an NPC, or a duel, whether you were in one of the planes, how much of the time since your death was online vs offline, and whether servers have been reset.  It's a complex formula, but give it to us please.  I am certain this is a frequently occuring question, when players discover their corpse doesn't actually have any rez time left on it.<P>2)  Some detail about disciplines.  (Q: where do I go to train disciplines?  A: You don't.  Go read the out-of-game supplemental manual to learn about disciplines).  In my opinion, guild trainer NPCs should have a series of text that explains what a character's disciplines are.  Or when you hit a new level, it should say, "You may now use the XXXXX Discipline".  At any rate, there are always questions from players about how disciplines work, and while you're at it... get someone to correct the supplemental file that says Monks have two level 59 disciplines.  Ashenhand is our level 60 discipline.  Surely someone at Verant must play a monk.<P>3)  A list of the various game settings and preferences and how to adjust them.  It's overwhelming to newbies that some things are changed inside the game by selecting a button under Preferences, and some things can only be changed by editing an external .INI file (or that datarate one whose name I've forgotten).  <P>Iago Oathbreaker<BR>55 Monk of Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
