</FONT><HR>In the past 6 days I have spent in Dreadlands the same thing happens every damn night over and over.  Someone aggros the DL Dragon, Gor....something, and drags her arse all the way to Karnors or even FV zone line if they are feeling lucky.  Once they get to Karnor's/FV they zone leaving a dragon behind killing anyone she doesnt like and even people she DOES like.<P>  In my case she went nuts on a necro in my group and fired an Area Ice spell killing 3 group members instantly and severely screwing me up.  Only the Necro was KoS while the rest of us were warmly to indifferent.<P>This happens over and over sometimes happening 4 times a night.  In the only time I saw evidence of someone pulling gore I saw a bards spell effect for their running spell flashing way ahead of Gor heading straight to Karnor's.  Bards are the only ones that I know off that can out distance her aggro range quick enough.<P>  This isnt some poor shlob running through DL an accidently aggro'ing Gor and running for the zone.  There would be pleanty of time to type a /shout warning people plus there is BW zone to bring her to.  <P>Its damn stupid and getting alot of people, most in their hell lvls or the lvl afterwards, killed.  By chance there was a cleric in zone passing thorugh that was kind enough to give res'es to the dead.<P>Tonight we had a guide on that spent a great deal of time with my and asked my questions on what I knew and how often it happens.  The guide patroled the zone and saw Gor in the hills and reported to me that she was back in her place.  The GM came back down towards Karnors and then it happened.  The Death Messages Gor gives started rolling.  The GM hauled arse back up to the snow just in time to see Gor barreling down the hills into the desert after someone.  She explained to me that she saw what happned but with her limited abilites couldnt catch a name to the puller.<P><BR>This is getting old.  Sure its cool to see a Dragon up close without getting your ass handed to you but when people get killed by either direct attack or an Area spell then its just ()**$#) stupid.  Knock it off!!!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Who says there aren't evil bards.<P> Muahah!<P> Actually, it definitly sounds like that is a bard, a high lvl one as well. That it has happened over the last week with this leads me to believe someone is studying Gorenaire. Unfortunatly, it sounds like they are not caring about anyone getting in the way. Keep an eye out on the names of bards in the area, see if you can narrow down the culprit.<P><BR>Jhade<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, Verant needs to make up their minds.  They need to either:<P>1) Fix the bug whereby an AoE-using mob will suddenly hate a warmly player simply because a KOS player happened to wander by and get hit by the AoE.  Also fix the delay between zoning-in and a faction update as well.  Its disgraceful that a warmly to Wushi player can zone into the dragon ring and still get insta-killed simply because there is a lag between his presence and the update of his faction.<P>2) Tuck the dragons away in a little more obscure place.  Why not stick Gorenaire in a corner of DL where people cannot casually run past her or pull her?  It sounds like last night's problems were intentional training, but when the mob wanders in the middle of the ice hills, who's to know when she's being intentionally trained and when she's simply being run from?  <P>A player who activly manages their Ring of Scale faction should not have to worry about meeting up outside KC for a port, or passing through on their way to DL and being insta-killed just because a KOS player happened to be anywhere near Gorenaire.  <P>This isn't like putting SG's (even the named one) in oasis or putting cyclops in SK -- I understand the idea of adding intentional risk into a zone.  The issue here is placing an epic-level,faction-bearing, AoE-using mob in the middle of one of the highest traffic zones in the game.  Add to that the fact that KC is train-city, and the entrance to KC makes a great place to avoid Gorenaire, and you get a real mess.<P>Look at how oasis is setup.  If someone is just passing through, you can follow the water and have virtually no effect on the zone.  They need to do the same with DL.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt; "Fix the bug whereby an AoE-using mob will suddenly hate a warmly player simply because a KOS player happened to wander by and get hit by the AoE."<BR>This was fixed a while ago.&lt;&lt;<P>Nope -- that is not fixed at least under some circumstances.  Last Sunday, on our way to Dragon Necropolis, we had a mage who was warmly to Scars of Velous dragons.  Only a few people in our guild are still KOS to dragons, but one of them zoned into cobalt scar and decided to pick up a CS key.  The mage was sitting at the dragon ring waiting for the rest of us to arrive, and when the KOS player ran to the dragon ring, a cobalt drake (warmly /conned to the mage) hit the KOS player with an AoE.  The KOS player ran, the drake eventually got him.  Then, the drake promptly returned to finish the mage off as well.  Warmly went to KOS simply by being AoE'ed.  I was in the zone, and in the mage's group at the time.  I watched her health bar initially drop, then several seconds of no damage at all (while the KOS player ran), then I watched it drop like a rock when the drake came back.<P>I'm not going as far as to suggest that a player should be susceptable to an AoE from a friendly mob, I'm just suggesting that the mob not return to finish the job once the player gets out of AoE range.<P>And yes, Cazel gets trained in oasis regularly, but most decent players (and yep, there are a ton of scumbags out there) will take him a bit west (away from the shoreline) on their way to NRho or SRho.<P>I just think this is a great example of something Verant could do to make the game better overall.

Since that would benefit players, they'll have the servers down by lunch today and the bug will be fixed with an emergency patch.

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to say a few quick comments.<P>The puller likely was not a bard.  Bards of high level likely have either the tamborine or at the least MM drums.  That said and as the original poster commented "This happens over and over sometimes happening 4 times a night. In the only time I saw evidence of someone pulling gore I saw a bards spell effect for their running spell flashing way ahead of Gor heading straight to Karnor's. Bards are the only ones that I know off that can out distance her aggro range quick enough."  IE.. the bard would not drag the dragon since the bard can enter and exit the aggro range way before she makes it to karnors.<P>I would guess it's someone SoW'd or with Jboots.  who out ran her but not her aggro.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is shocking and saddening to realize the number of people that would rather kill a dozen others than just take a death themselves.  No honor, no morality, no sense of community.  Just me me me.  I always offer free rezzes after some damn moron trains Gore to Karnors, and if I can find the person that trains her, he/she goes on on my NEVER rez list.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This goes back to the old questions of "Who do you blame for a train?" and "Will you help someone who is training?"  I have a very simple rule.  The first time I see you train something (running in fear for the zone line), I'm going to help you if I possibly can, maybe even at the cost of my own life (because I'm not as paranoid about it as some).  The second time I see you train the same thing, I will not help and will stand by and laugh (while helping anyone ELSE caught in your train).  The third time you train (usually the same thing), you get /petitioned.<P>I'm sure you've all been to Crushbone.  There was a night about a week ago where, on Tholuxe, where I was in there and Emperor Crush was trained to the zone three times in fairly quick succession.  I was unlucky and was never in a position to see WHO was doing it, but clearly this should NOT be happening, particularly during primetime.  The only thing I could think was that people were doing it so that they could pop out of zone, rest and come back to kill crush.  Well, if that was their plan, it failed because my group killed Crush three times when he was standing in the corridor there (with bodies of people who just wanted to group up and kill some centurions and the like strewn all over the place).<P>Another thing that some bards do that REALLY bothers me is their kiting method.  I have seen bards run around with four or five of one type of creature behind them, taking forever to kill them with their damage song (don't know which one, but it would be a bard in the low 20s).  Meanwhile, of course, my group (and other groups in the area) have that many less creatures to choose from.  This is made worse when those four are of the type that we were hunting, either for exp or questing.  And, of course, what is this bard going to do when he gets into trouble?  He's going to /yell for help causing others to jump in and very possibly get no experience but take a bunch of damage, or he's going to train those creatures to a zone, running them right into a little guy (me, a halfling) who is just sitting, healing and trying to fish.  &lt;ARGH!&gt;<P>This is why, when I'm in a group at least, when something is giving us all a bunch of trouble (and we are likely to die), I taunt everything onto me and tell everyone else to run.  This way, they will get a huge head start while I die at the hands of the Sarnaks, goblins, whatever, and they will zone before the creatures can get very far in chasing them, thus eliminating the train that would hvae formed after I died.<P>Ah well.  I guess there will always be some people.  But when I know they're doing wrong, they ain't gettin' no help from me.  Ever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with you Babbster about helping people with trains, and with not helping them the third or fourth time.  The difference here is there is no helping with Gorenaire.  No way a couple of groups can just up and say hey lets get her! and be successful.  Most groups around Karnors are well beneath the level needed to take down Gorenaire, even assuming they could organize quickly and efficiently.  I can't imagine any number of 40 to 50 groups could take down that dragon.  Normal trains to zones, while annoying, can be dealt with, I see it happen all the time in Karnors.  Training a level 60 dragon to a zone is just incredibly rude.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not talking about /petitioning every single third train I see, I'm talking about someone who is consistently trying (and failing) to multi-kite or people who are constantly going back to someplace they KNOW they can't handle (hence already causing three trains of the same d**n creatures).  I'm not talking about someone who gets in trouble once in a while at all.<P>As far as the people saying "don't sit near a zone line", well I do try not to do that often unless it is obviously relatively safe.  However, where ARE some people supposed to go when they've gotten into trouble, made a run for the zone and need to rest up again?  Are they supposed to make another very hazardous run (sometimes across multiple zones) to get to someplace there are guards?  Are they supposed to ALL have hide or invisible available to them (you do know some people don't, right)?  Or are they supposed to try and get their rest where they can?<P>If you are having to run enough where you are making trains of the same creatures over and over again (as in my Crushbone example), you deserve whatever you get, and training like that IS covered by the PnP, to wit:<P>"You may not intentionally cause experience loss to another player, such as by "training" them.<BR>Training is defined as pulling an NPC along behind you and attempting to get it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement.  The intentional training of NPCs will result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by an EQCSR. We are aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional trains, and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely."<P>I would submit that bringing the same trains over and over again to the zone line would fall under this standard.  Again, the "whoops, pulled four when I wanted one" types of trains are understandable at times, but I can count the number of "real" trains (three or more creatures) that I have brought to zone lines on both hands in total.  A wandering high-level NPC, again, can be understandable, but multiple times in one night?  I would think this would encourage being a little more careful, and it would NOT be understandable to me.<P>You're all right to say that they are a risk that we all face at times, but there is a point when it stops being just stupid and becomes malicious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1)  I do generally stay away from zone lines (at least the ones that are narrow and well-defined) for the most part, when possible.<P>2)  Quote:  "It is ridiculous to petition a gm about that, half the time you will never know who really started the train, and the other half the time, even if you know who did it, you cant prove they did it."<P>You're absolutely right, which is why it states in the PnP Policy that this will be dealt with when WITNESSED by a CS rep (GM).  My petition, assuming a GM has some time to spend in a particular zone, could result in finding someone who is being malicious with their trains.  I've said it before and will say it again, I am *not* overly concerned with people who have occasional inadvertant trains.  My problem is with people who engaging things that (by the third time they fail) they should know are too tough for them and then dragging them along to the zone (which, BTW, can cause similar problems to people who AREN'T at the zone lines, so get off the "stay away from zone lines" high horses), and I am also concerned with those people who are just being jerks and doing this because it gives them pleasure (you have heard the term "grief" player, right?).<P>I know that there are those who have to believe they are smarter than the people they disagree with, but in this case some of you are just being purposely obtuse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This cracks me up. People who hunt next to zone lines (so they can easily escape should things go bad), whine when someone who has the guts to hunt deeper in the zone has to cut and run. Normally, I try to avoid other people when running from something, but if you are blocking the zone, there's no way I can do that. <P>To those who say, "die like a man". Why? To keep your cowardly zone-hugging butt safe?<P>Like someone said, if you don't want to get trained, don't sit on the tracks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057980-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057980-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057980&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057980&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
