</FONT><HR>The standard on Veeshan for DF Belts is 2pp each.  Occasionally you'll see someone offering to buy for 3 or 4pp each but not too often.  People usually offer to sell for 2pp, if they go much higher there will be all kinds of answers back saying the price is too high.<P>And it seems that by the rate you're getting them why be so greedy?  I never saw the interest in the belts and when I was in Orc groups I'd let the others loot them if they treasure them so much, much more than I.  But that's greed for you.  Heh, also made it easier for me to get into groups when I said I wasn't looting.<P>Whatever floats your boat I guess.<BR>Time is money?  Sure, but not at those prices.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I as a lvl 30 Bard I understand that it is very hard to lvl.  So when I was a low lvl in WC getting DF belts i found sometimes in order to get DF belts it was sometimes easier to just buy the belts, though turning them in now gives me problems in some areas in Antonica, because of the faction.  So I say some prices are ridiculous for those belts and many people just take advantage of the classes that are harder to lvl.  So it would be appreciated if people would just stop griping about this and just either sell, or buy them.  If I did not like the price I went to someone else or just went out and fought and died for them.<P>Gaberael Songsopain &lt;Storm Legion&gt;<BR>wood elf bard League of Antonican Bards<BR>Hater of Giants<BR>Bertoxxulous Server<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is becoming a pet peeve of mine. You go to auction something, and someone shrieks, "WHAT? LOL. I saw someone selling that for 2pp in Dalnir!" I've become a bit impatient with this, and will usually reply with a tell saying, "Then you should have bought it, because it is worth more than that."<P>Bottom line: someone can try to sell something for whatever price they want. If it is ridiculous, then noone should pay it, and they are only wasting their own time (unless they are spamming - a different and self-explanatory problem). When I've seen someone selling something at an outrageous price, I have on occasion sent a tell just trying to figure out if there is something I'm missing, and usually ending up with a, "More power to you. Best of luck selling at that price!"<P>That being said, even if you *should* be mad at someone overcharging, I can't see throwing a hissy fit screaming, "4pp! That's outragous! You should be taken out back and beaten senseless! I'd never pay more than 3pp!" That's just not that big a difference.<P>Dave<BR>ZsaZsa Vavoom of Drinal<BR>21st Level Paladin and Keeper of the Funk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's just it. I take the risk of dying, and I do die sometimes to get these belts. Needles to say the time involved. I have found that for whatever reason people buy these to level and some don't take the risk to die getting them. As a pal I don't know of anything I can buy that will raise my level. Like you said, once the price is called out either buy it or don't. It was unneccesary to begin insulting someone and throwing baby fits about it. The funny thing is I'll bet a backpack of belts she will look for me tonight and try again. I might even consider asking 5pp now in her case.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That's right eyenose. After her huge fit (and she was obviously looking for a large amount of belts) her attempts to buy in that quantity only resulted in failure. She only managed to buy 2 belts in over an hour. I had people say wow that's steep but they bought them anyway. One guy even apologized later and said it was worth it because it shot him up a full level. As a paladin I don't get spells untill level 9, if I could have bought something to raise a whole level for 50pp or 70pp I would have done it. Passing level 9 was a big difference for me, I no longer have to worry about getting to the orc camps without dying.

</FONT><HR>And to answer your question, you will know it is too much if nobody buys it.  I assume she had a fit in /ooc or /shout?  My answer would have been simply to reply using the same channel that if she doesnt like the price she doesnt have to buy them.<P>I will admit however of having intervened in the past when I felt a higher level player was exploiting newbies by offering ridiculous prices for stuff.  Using your case as an example, I may have shouted a warning if someone was offering 2 gp per belts instead of over 2pp.<P>Just like in real life, prices vary according to the number of people who are offering.  A stack of 20 batwings may be worth 2pp in Greater Faydark where everybody and his pet orc pawn is offering some for sale, but on some other continent it is probably worth more.  I bought a Robe of the Oracle yesterday for 600.  A friend of mine bought hers for 750 and another friend couldn't get one for less than a 1000.

</FONT><HR>Yeah, talk about a shift of product versus demand.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">.<P>On Luclin, you can get 3pp for each deathfist slashed belt. Now if you were logon to Xegony(sp)<BR>things change, people may pay 4pp and so on.<P>The difference in servers(I'll use Freeport as a point of reference) is so large it's staggering..!.<P>First off for those that don't know Xegony is a server of the ancients, one look around you and you'll see more 50+ levels than ever before. The market for basic items goes something like this.<P>Deathfist slashed belts:<P>Luclin = 3pp <P>Xegony = 4-5pp<P>Batwings: <P>Luclin = They don't sell very often here, because there are TWO merchants that sell them.<P>Xegony = The same<P>Bonechips:<P>Luclin = 3pp (and on rare occasions, 5pp)<P>Xegony = 5pp+<P>High Quality Bear Skins:<P>Luclin = 20-25pp<P>Xegony = 30-35pp<P>Polished Granite Tomahawk:<P>Luclin 100-150pp<P>Xegony 10pp<P>(I still can't believe this one...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> ..)<P><BR>If your used to selling in east commons as I am, even during the primetime hours. Xegony doesn't seem to be the place to be, It's frankly dead, dead as the decaying skeletons you kill for your bonechips. Many times the orc camps are free to hunt at will and you may have to gather up a group yourself to hunt them and the dervs as well.<P>I like this (for solo hunting) because on Luclin the east commons is so crowded, I often try to fight the creatures I'm hunting and the lag from all the people in the zone (100+ on weekdays and 130+ on weekends).<P>Oh and one more thing, after this patch the game will forever change the way many classes play. With that comes more capabilities for some (in the form of experience increases) and the addition of massive changes in dungeons zones and grouping.<P>I hope all this works out for the best, don't you..?. <P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something to remember about ecomomics in a situation like this.<P>&gt;&gt; The value of ANY item is determined by the Seller and the Buyer.  If the Buyer has the need, and the Seller has the item, the perceived value of the object increases.  Those are the ONLY two parties that need to reach ANY agreement in ANY sale in Everquest.  Everyone else may comment on the sale, but it comes down to this.  Don't like the price?  Don't buy it.&lt;&lt;<P>Set your own prices.  If they sell, fine.

So to a secondary that has been twinked with alot of PP and wants to Powergame through the lower levels the Belts may be worth 5+pp each. But to true newbie they may only be worth 2pp each.

</FONT><HR>I would hope that on Drinal it would be to the advantage of the lower levels to try to get a good high price on belts. 4pp is a lot of money to a level 4. That's food for a month. I heard a newbie as for a price check and someone told him 1pp. I saw on the chat were that same person quickly ran to buy it. New people know nothing, I didn't know on my first day that I could have gone around buying belts for 1 or 2pp and selling them for 3 and 4pp. I killed rats for chicken feed.

Of course the market doesn't suck for everything across the board - there are a few hot commodities, but in general most things seem to sell less on Drinal than they do on other servers, especially when you try to compare prices at websites like www.eqprices.com.<P>Anyone that's been on Drinal along time know why that is?<P>Hresvelgr, Shaman of 16 Poverty-Stricken Drinal Winters</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
