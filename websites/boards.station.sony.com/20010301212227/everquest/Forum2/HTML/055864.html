&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>So let's talk about necromancers.<P>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons.  You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread.<P>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out.  It is not complete, I'm sure.  But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion.<P>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are.  And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now.  The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters.  But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game.  And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.<P>Anyhow, here's what I have already.<P>Ignite Bones:  Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do.  The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that.  Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns.  If we can’t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD.  Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>Lifetaps:  The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters.  If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana.  Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now.  I am not convinced that this is something that we should change.  But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community.  Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<BR>		<BR>DoTs and corpse poofing:  This affects everyone.  Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed.<BR>		<BR>Mana transfer:  Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate.  A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough.  I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change.  But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<BR>		<BR>Infusion:  Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell.  Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>Defoliation:  There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on.  I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type.  But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet.<P>Track Corpse:  Broken spell.  Is it going to stay that way?<BR>		<BR>Epic Weapon:  The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<BR>		<BR>Lich Series:  This series of spells is broken.  It is more powerful than it should be.  It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana.  It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'.  Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players.  This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2).  This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'.  I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right.  If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series.  Note:  Series includes:  Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sounds like you have all the facts and understand them well. I say fix the lich series, it is not working as intended, so fix it regardless. Please do not let an unintended 'bonus' prevent us from gaining abilities to dish out damage to boss mobs. You seem to focus on that bug quite a bit, and refer to it as a reason to not improve our effectiveness in other areas. Huh? Fix it already, and allow us to land lifetaps on big mobs so we can more effectively fulfill our role as manastones. As it stands, the lich bug does us really no good at all since we cannot use it without lifetaps (vs boss mobs). I for one do not want a bug 'bonus', I would rather play the game as intended. The ignite/chill bones series speaks for itself, I imagine the illusion was never intended to be prohibitive, only to prevent chain casting with a cool effect (effort appreciated). Our plant based dd's would be a great addition if expanded with some common sense. If it is a plant, we should be able to use it. I think that it would be very cool if a group thought "hey, we could really use a necro" when facing a plant based mob. Just expand the spell line's usefulness, as it stands now it might as well not be there at all. I doubt that was the plan...Thanks for your time Alan. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for a good recap Absor.<P>I think you may have missed one point about Life Taps in your recap though.  Its not that we want Life Taps to land on Uber Mobs for the damage, we need them to land so that we can heal ourselves while using Lich spells to make more mana.  Without this ability we make mana at the same rate as any other casting class.  Which seriously hampers our ability to do mana transfers.<P>BTW, I have to say even if we could do this, I hate being a mana battery.  Its not what I chose a to play necromancer for.<P>Thanks for listening.<P>Tanalei Sali<BR>Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please look into mages getting Anti-Fear for their pets.  I know its on Test, and subject to change.  But Mages have no fear control whatsoever.  Necros are the masters of fear, which only makes sense to have an Anti-Fear for their pets.  Unless Necro pets are being made unfearable without spells.<P>You mentioned the lich series.  Arch Lich has the same mana/hp ratio as Lich (49).  This spell should be moved to level 55 and have the Spectre illusion either kept on it, or moved to Demi Lich. (Or move demi lich to 55).  We should not get 2 lich spells at 60, spread them out some.<P>Essence Emeralds:  When used in Trudication and is resisted, the EE should not be consumed.  Making Trudication unresistable was another option which sounds viable because of the high cost to cast it.  <P>Infusion would help a lot to be targetable (perhaps if cast on another player it takes 50% of the necro's health, or down to 1hp whichever comes first).  At level 57, doing large-scale raids 4 or 5 times a week, I have yet to use this spell because of the high casting cost.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't play a necro.  Never have and probably never will.  I also don't group with them very often, which is kind of my point to this post.<P>I spend most of my time in dungeons.  Given the choice, there aren't many classes i'd rather have less in the group than Necros and Mages.  They are pet reliant and they should be.  That's not the problem.  The xp loss isn't noticeable, and the pets can give me, a warrior, a breather to regain some stamina and take a little less dmg.  <P>My main problem with necros is that, unless the players is very good, I seem to die alot when grouped with them.  They need to stay in constant control of their pets.  Some players do, some dont.  Pets pull trains very easily if they're not used right.  I'd suggest making pets aggro things a little less than players.  Not to the point of being able to target something invis and then going to the zone and sending your pet back in without it getting killed, but just so what a pet that takes a weird path back to it's owner won't pull the whole place.  <P>This is really just a  problem with pathing.  Which is really a problem in alot of places.  This isn't really a "colorful band-aid" like alot of the other suggestions.  Alot of players don't need it.  I've grouped with some necros who really know how to control their pet.  And if a change like this done wrong i'm sure it could be exploited by the "Kings of Soloing".  But until I feel fairly safe that some errant pet isn't going to get me killed i won't be inviting necros along into dungeons unless i'm completely sure they know what they're doing.  <P>The problem is that, since i won't group with them unless i know them, it makes it kind of hard to get to know them.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>OK.....thought out post Absor but there are some things that need revising.<P>Question:  What level range is the ultimate goalfor every player on these servers?<P>Answer:  Post 50.  The whole point of this game for most everyone is to reach the higher levels in order to do things like kill the boss mobs, dragons, etc.<P>What is wrong with Necros post 50:  <P>1.  Our whole life, necros were the most feared damage dealers.  When I say damage dealers (I use this term loosely), I mean to say that mobs were soloable by us, weren't soloable by other classes until they had a group of at least 3 or 4.  Yes that is powerful.  But post 50, most mobs that we actually want to kill, have WAY too many hps, and higher MR, so soloing is no longer a viable option.<P>2.  Post 50 boss mob raids.  Lifetaps for the most part have been unresistable within the level cap rules prior to 50.  Now all of a sudden we get to the boss encounters and necros have no place.  We are there to only transfer mana, and no real viable solution to get the hps back that we lost in lich to supply our neighborhood cleric with mana.  That should be changed.  Make it so it is 1:1 ratio on Lich and above.  That way it really only applies to the post 50 game.  Or change Arch lich to 1:1, then making necros want to keep going.<P>3.  Group spells post 50.  Group DMF isn't really a bad idea, and most seem to agree.  Even if it costs the same or more amount of mana to cast this, it would make it easier.<P>4.  Sacrifice.  This is a fun one.  It is extremely hard to find someone that is willing to sacrifice for you.  In addition, quite spendy.  And all for what?  So sometime down the road we can give 1000 mana instantly to ourselves?  So we can land a lifetap on someone that 2 lifetaps of the previous lvl can do same damage?  No, it is only used for that wonderful res.  Proposal:  Let sacrifices be ressable with a small amount of exp gained back.  Any cleric of any level can res them, but it would only be a level 39 res concerning exp gained back.  This might make it easier to get the essence emeralds, and it would probably be a viable option for necros to use the other two spells.  In addition make Infusion targetable so people would be even more willing to sacrifice themselves.<P>5.  Dots - Wonderful dots we have, and when they land, we really feel like we make a contribution.  Post 50 raids, most leaders tell us not to use them because of corpse poofing, or the mana used could better serve the clerics and wizards.  If you can fix the corpses from poofing, or ALLOW GM's to bring the corpse back, then we might use dots, and people will let necros go on more raids.<P>6.  Track corpse does work now.  At least it has for me, so I don't think that is a concern anymore.<P>7.  Epic concern:  The cloak for our epic, and its drop ratio?  Only 1 person on my server has the epic weapon.  If that is your idea of epic, well congratulations, you have succeeded.  Casting time is too long.  An epic weapon should be that...something everyone strives for because it is the best in the game.  Yes stats are great in terms of int, saves, mana, etc....but for the most part, I can have a "cooler" look and raise my stats in other areas, and use a lower lvl spell that does same snare rate and damage for less mana, and less cost.<P>These are just my concerns.  Mostly about the game post 50.  Let us be useful on raids, and we will be happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I had to cancel my last account and by the time I could start a new one it was to late for my character. Well anyway you say if you dont fix the lich series of spells we will be limited to the up grades that you can do to the class. What kind of upgrades are you talking about. I am sure you have ideas or you would not have brough it up. Maybe you should be letting us know what kind of changes you have in mind so we have an idea and can make a judgement. I like the necro the way he is now. The biggest concern is that you are going to wind up changing what Necromancer actually stands for ( Masters of the Dead ) and I would hate to see this happen. Also I have chosen the characer that I play not because of his power but it best represents me as a person.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necromancer pets are basically mindless skeletons that do whatever their master bids them.  When the pet is low on life it doesn't get "scared" and run away like normal mobs do, so this further shows they are brainless.  I don't see why then, they can be affected by mind spells when they don't seem to have a mind to be affected.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thanks for revisiting the class.<P>First, I will only discuss the high levels since that is all I am accustomed to, post 60.<P>Before we begin, let us define the necromancer.  What better way to do this, than to examine the spell lines available to us.<P>For almost our entire lives, we are responsible for dealing damage.  We do not really do insane damage "in one shot" as that is the mark of the wizard.  We deal slow death, through dots.  Our Taps have a poor ratio, and as a result, are mainly used to suppliment our health.<P>As such, a necro is a damage dealer, in the same way that mages and wizards are, though more slowly.<P>1)  The problem, at higher levels, is that its not how much you inflict, it's how fast you inflict it.  In your average group, the creature dies in 30 seconds, and a 90 second damage over time spell does miniscule damage while still charging you the mana for a full dot.<P>Perhaps scaling the dots to do 45 seconds of damage, instead.  (Similar to Envenomed bolt, and drifting death).<P>The dots would still rarely do full damage, but would at least do a good portion of it.<P>That being said, thats the only balance issue I can see at lower levels (and other necros can correct me if I'm wrong, as its been a while since I've been sub-50, and I'm sure things have changed).<P>2)  The next issue, is Essence Emerald spells.  Three spells require the use of this component: Trucidation (1100 point tap), Infusion (1000 point mana dump), and Convergence (Ressurection).  Now I agree with the component cost for the third, but the first 2 need to be reconsidered.<P>Both Trucidation, and Infusion have a 10 minute recast time, which means that after memorizing it, you need to sit 10 minutes to use it.  Would a wizard memorize a nuke that simply used mana but had a recast time of 10 minutes, instead of using their 700 damage spell with no recast time?  No.  In the same way, a necro will never memorize this spell, EVEN if it was free to cast (using just mana).  As for trucidation, would you memorize a spell which gives you LESS than 1/3 of your full mana bar, if it took 10 minutes to repop up?  Maybe, during those long velious battles, but never if it costs someone 4 hours of XP.<P>Solution?  Change the component to peridots and star rubies for each (respectively), and cut down the cast time to 5 minutes.  It'll still be cast rarely, but it will have situational uses.<P>3)  Thirdly, we come to night time only spells.  The main ones which we have issues with are: <BR>a) Quivering veil of Xarn, and b) Levant.<P>Quivering veil of Xarn is an upgrade to our Harmshield spell which lasts 6 more seconds, turns us into a skeleton for the duration, has a minor damage shield, and a minor regen.  It also, is a 10 minute cast.  Unfortunately, if you have a regen spell on, it will NOT stack.  Not only that, but it can ONLY be cast from 8pm to 6am norrath time.  Would you really want to have a spell memorized that is meant to save your life if you can't rely on it due to the time of day?  <P>Levant, is a self only spell like the druid spell Succor.  It takes you to the safe spot in the zone.  It is a high mana spell, and only useful for traveling one way.<P>Solution:  Remove the nighttime only component and maybe increase the mana cost to compensate.<P>4)  The epic weapon.  I know, you said don't discuss it.  The problem with it, isn't the look.  I can live with it.  The problem is the stats, and the effect.<P>The stats are slightly lower in comparison to the other epics, and in my opinion should have some mana removed, hit points added, and 5 more int.<P>The effect is our level 49 darkness spell with an additional 2 second casting time (9 seconds total). 1200 damage, over 96 seconds.  The point of this spell is to snare our victim, meaning we need a fast cast.  For the most part, necros use our 29th spell in order to accomplish this, and will not use the duck of doom as it takes far too long, and puts us at risk.  It isn't even our best spell, as devouring darkness does 2000 damage, in the same time frame.  And in case you didn't know, this spell is a HUGE agro, meaning, you never use it, unless you're soloing, or want to annoy your tanks.  <P>Solution?  Change the effect.  Give it a held regen like most other classes have (why not, you give warriors fungal regrowth, and a small regen on Zlandicar's heart), give it effect slightly lower than regrowth, but better than chloro and call it "Revisit Death".  This would make it a truely epic, and online with the effect of some of the others.<P>5) This is the big one.  Uber Raids.  Necros are not support classes, and shouldn't be one at 60th level when we weren't one all along.  Currently we do nothing, or we dump mana, or summon corpses when its gone bad.<P>Solution:  Make Deflux unresistable, its 320 damage for 198 mana, along with Vexing Mordinia.  Touch of night being unresisted would be over powering, as would trucidation (as if we'd ever use it).<P>Also remove the illusion skeleton from ignite and chill bones series.<P>Remember, and this is VERY important:  Not doing my first suggestion means we can not lich to dump mana or cast our heal spell as it hurts us.  No income of hp means all our secondary fuctions shut down.<P>Also keep in mind that on average we have 1 dot which lands on a mob, which means 1 necro is useful, but what about the 2nd 3rd and 4th who want to come on the raid.  So unless we can tap and ignite/chill bones, only 1 necro is worthwhile.  Don't make us exlude our friends because of artificial limits.<P>Another topic to add here, is pets on these raids.  Pets shouldn't be fearable, as they are mindless slaves to the necro/mage.  Also, because of the inherantly low resists, pets die in 1 or 2 waves of a creatures AoE spell.  Make them more than a 4 second npc on these encounters.<P>7)  Finally, feign death.  In Velious, mobs hit with such rapidity that casting feign death does nothing.  Please make this spell useful in velious, or give us deathpeace.<P><BR>Thats about it.  <P>I love my class, and most of these things (besides the dot change) would not affect our power daily.  Its simply making us viable where there are artificial restrictions placed on us.<P>Zrazzt WarDuck, Warlock of Tarew Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is something I mentioned in another thread, and I just wanted to mention it here as well.<P>I don't want to solo anymore.  I hate it.  When I solo, I may as well be playing a single player game.  I think Verant is absolutely correct in encouraging grouping as much as possible and reducing the emphasis on soloing.  However, in the current situation, I have difficulty getting groups.  The same people who think that I am overpowered when they see me fear/kiting don't want me in their group, because they know that there are many other classes who can contribute more to the group dynamic.<P>Therefore, as a possible way to increase my group desireability I would like to be able to buff more.  Buffs are something tangible that people can see (thanks to the nifty little icon they get) as a direct benefit to having me in a group.  Also, buffing others does not increase my soloing ability, which should be avoided.  However, straight buffing would probably impinge on the turf of the buffing classes and would not be in line with the Necromancer's image.<P>I would therefore like to suggest a way to give necros some buffs that would be in line with what is already in the game.  I have an eighth level spell called impart strength.  It takes a maximum of 10 strength from me and gives it to another player.  I think its a cool idea, because it gives me a way to buff another player but at a cost to myself.  In that way, it is similar to our heal spells, which transfer our own health, and our mana transfer spells, which transfer our own mana.  The problem is that it only transfers 10 strength, which is not much to get excited about.  For starters, I would like to see an upgraded version of this spell that transfers something like 50 strength.  I would also like to see a spell that transfers some of my armor class to a target, and even a spell that transfers some of my total hit points to a target.  I think a spell that took 500 off of my hit point cap and gave it to another player would have its own inherent checks and balances, as it would leave the necro seriously vulnerable.  What I would really like is to see a high level spell that did all three, transferring some of my strength, hit point cap and armor class to another player.<P>Tell me what you think.<P>Darq.<BR>(55th level Necromancer)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Make lifetaps land.  <P>Get rid of essence emeralds as a component for our spells.. let them use diamonds or black saphires or if were stuck with them let essence emeralds drop occasionally off mobs.  <P>Make our "night only" spells work 24 hours a day so we can bother memming them.<P>Make chill bones drop more often, I dont know anyone that has it.  Never seen it for sale either.  Why cant we just buy it like ignite bones?<P>Increase drop rate on the 56 monk pet spell.  <P>Increase the duration of our darkness line, druids get a snare that lasts 10 minutes at level 29 I believe, why cant we have a long lasting low damage version of darkness at 50+?<P>Make shadowbound stack with regen spells.. Its not a regen spell, Im giving MY hp away.<P>Reduce the mana cost of Corpal Empathy.  Again, I'm giving away MY hp, why should it cost 200 mana to do that when I can heal twice as much with pact of shadows for 10 mana?  Why would I even mem corpal empathy?<P>Group feign death, or failing that, targettable feign death.<P>Make our pet haste spells work on pc's.  It wont make us solo better but would make us more group friendly.<P>Let enchanter mezzes overwrite screaming terror.  I get chewed out for using it by enchanters.<P>Give us a higher level version of screaming terror with a little longer duration that is still overwriteable by enchanters.<P>Take off the skeleton illusion of ignite bones or give us a similar spell with no illusion.  Give it a recast time the same duration as the skeleton illusion.  This would allow two necro's on raids to cast our DD spell at the same time.  Whats wrong with that? 2 mages, wizards, etc can cast their spells at the same time.  Maybe raids will let more than one necro come if you do that.<P>Dots from multiple casters should all stack, especially since you've raised the hp of mobs so high with Velious, but I know your mind is closed to that.<P>54 necro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Necros are uber powerful from 1-50 and still very powerful 51-60 and have a great use on big raids (mana transfer).  <P>     Roles for classes change as you progress, its time for necros to accept that having an easy ride in the lower levels is balanced out by a rough ride at the the end (rough ride being that they have to face the same problems most other classes do, finding a useful role in the end game).<P>     Suck it in you whiney necros, accept your roles or play another class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Word of Spirit Series, havent found a good use for a point blank Area effect Damage Spell, other than to stop trains for newbies 30 levels below me.  Would be much better if it was changed to target instead of self. <P>Screaming Terror - Great Spell but it needs an upgrade.  Many things that are blue to me are considered to high to be mesmerized.<P>Pet Line - Very Valuable and essential, yet some of the upper versions are not really upgrades.  After Lvl 49 they dont get to be much of an upgrade. This is true of most spells.  Also I would like to see a diversity in the types of pets we could pull and possibly the ability to summon at least one weapon for our pets (piercing style since they seem to do more dmg with piercing weapons).  And definitely we need the ability, like Mages, to summon our pet if it wanders off.<P>The Scent line, Surge Line, and other debuffs need a bit of strengthening.  They dont do enough to warrant being loaded or bought for that matter.<P>Essence Emerald line of spells - Needs to be changed, to not require an essence emerald or to be gotten rid of entirely.  <P>Mana Transfer line - Personally I would like for this line of spells to be taken from a necro and given to another class.  In exchange make it so that we have a couple High lvl DoTs and Lifetap that will land on a Upper MoB.  This would decrease the amount of damage a wizard would have to do to a MoB, which is one of their concerns at end game.  <P>Lich line of spells - they are fine just as they are.  They give more mana than clarity (which it should), and they take quite a bit of hit points to use.  Please dont make any changes to this line of spells.  Unless you want to improve it.  <P>Epic Weapon - just needs to be completely redesigned totally.  A staff with the skull from the iksar helmet quests on top of it surrounded in  black fames with glowing red eyes would be really cool.  As for an effect, a lifetap spell, a prenerfed pet that looks different, essence emeralds for our unuseable spells, a coffinless summon corpse spell, or an effect that causes the MoB to be afraid but not run call it paralyzing fear or something.  Short duration 10 seconds, must be landable at least somewhat on all MoBs, including God ones, in the game, and not have more than a 15 second recast time on it.<P>Ignite bones - first off, after you use this spell on a MoB and it turns undead, make it so that undead spells can land on it at that point.  Next the only way you are going to be able to fix it is to create a skeleton for each MoB or make it so the MoB doesnt change size and just looks ghostly.  Like the spectral guys in Traks teeth.<P>Pre lvl 50 Necros arent the best soloers, wizards and druids are.  Yet they both have group friendly spells and we have none.  How about a group DMF at 44 (move DMF to lvl 24), Group Lich at really high lvl, Group Feign Death at 49, and targetable pet spell which gives a pet to target (only targetable on players of your lvl or higher)<P> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
