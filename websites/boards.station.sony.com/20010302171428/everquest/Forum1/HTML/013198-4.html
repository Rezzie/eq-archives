</FONT><HR>It is exactly because of people like that the GM's are really cracking down. Are you really serious??? Are you telling me that every time you get summoned due to a questionable action that you are going to /quit right in front of the GM??? That right there, especially if there is a history of that happening, should also be grounds for banning. Don't even tell me I am wrong on this. I have seen numerous people that have KSed, defrauded, and scammed others just /quit when their victim complains to them. They will tell them(and this was told to me many times): "What ya gonna do? Petition me??? What a joke!!! All I gotta do i log and make myself scarce until the GM(s) are not online, then I can log on and do it again. Muhahahaha!!!" This ALSO sounds like something Colla would pull so why EVEN defend that punk unless you are Colla or one of it's cronies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No Om, that statement from you was not considered a threat and I am sorry if I offended you in any way. I was trying make a point about how many people get away with things like this by /exit to avoid getting called to the "Principal's Office". But my original point still stands, the GM's are cracking down because shady characters are exploiting and ripping off players, AND getting away with it by just logging. There is definately a past history between Colla and the GM's. Even though Colla may have been an employee of Verant, it still does not give that punk the right to do what it wants.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I do respect you view on the subject Tyronnax, as well as I respect others.<P>GM have been abused in the past, and they are, it seems, cracking down as you said.<P><BR>My friend for instance, although at his own fault, tried to twink his lower level character doing the drop/log/pop techinique and beknownst to him, a halfling was hiding right in front of him. He petitioned that he lost items, and the GM answered back that they can't do anything because once a bag droped, it's fair game for all.<P>Now, that's an old example. But it seems to me, that it has some relevance to what happened to Colla. FYI<P><BR>Anyways, I'm tired now ...<P>Keep this thread going, I want this guy Colla to go out in a blaze of glory.<P>*much respect for someone who has 3 40+ characters*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You get mad and say "this is crap" and and ask to speak to a manager.  That manager gives you a run-around and you ***** and complain.. then you write a letter to his manager and complain.  OOP, you are now banned from ever having phone service because you were being lippy and rude to customer service people!!<P>Hello, this is the US... why can't we be lippy when we are unhappy with service we are PAYING for.  <P>What about this other guy posting on here that says his guild leader got kicked for sending mulitple complaining letters to GM's/customer service about a guildmates name change?

</FONT><HR>This may be the U.S., but there is a limit to just how lippy you can get and how far you can push things. These should have been lessons learned at an early age in the first place. *Scenario* You offer to trade your brother/sister your allowance for the toy you always had your eyes on. The deal is made, but somehow you misplaced the item. You tell your parents and your brother/sister is "summoned" for "interrogation". You take the same attitude with your parents that Colla took with the GM and I guarentee the end result would be the same. Now lets think about this carefully.

Add to the fact that after the item was "misplaced" thy sibling had "ported" far away.

But Colla did admit if I recollect that this isn't the first time he's run in with Gms and gotten suspended/warned.  Now ... seems as what happened is Colla got suspended...and then the case was reviewed and decided a ban should be put in place due to past and present "marks" on Colla's record.

The GM could see how it had alreeady affected one poor gamer - he even told him to 'Sit Down'.<P>He would not allow this Colla to continue his verbose attacks on loyal Verent customers and jeapordise many account with-drawels over the 'lippyness' of ONE SMALL MAN.<P>Colla was a bad seed, he would only have gone on to cause some other Shmo the same discomfort that Jumlace' pants exerted.<P>Gone is ONE account holder.
