</FONT><HR>Question arises - do the Customer Support people KNOW WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING CS FOR??? Yes, the story was disturbing. But guess what, this is a part of Norrath as it was designed - but the original EQ team, and by Ruins of Kunark team - the story actually goes along QUITE well with the game storyline - do you know where did Lanys T'Vyl come from? Read the Harpy's Head tavern. A story, published on THIS VERY SITE, is very similar in nature to a story, posted on a non-affiliated board, which got a player banned. Hypocrisy? Stupidity? I don't know... but this thing is evolving into a very very big ****storm, very very fast.<P>By the way, here's a link:<P>http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/h_hc_lanys.shtml<P>I wonder, will I be banned for posting a link to an official Verant story? It's not as graphic as the one written by Mystere, but the events described are quite similar...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Oh, and necromancers geeee i'm sure they never do nasty things.  *sigh*  You'd think since verant ripped off everything in this game from D&D they'd be rather lenient about banning over a story.

</FONT><HR>Silelwen saying something is "sick and twisted" is merely an opinion.  I found the story very enjoyable, it was well written and fit in character perfectly.  That is an opinion as well. Just because one person feels something is sick doesnt mean another person wont enjoy it.  This is where different lifestyles come into play  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I guess its Verants game though so they can do what they wish.  Its really disturbing that they banned her and would hope they choose to reconsider the decision.<P>The story was awesome though, I'd never visited that board before but I'll be doing some reading there on my spare time in hopes of finding other well written pieces.<P>Venner<BR>55 Necromancer<BR>Bristlebane<P>Saben<BR>51 Paladin<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Thought so.<P>There was an article somewhere a few years back, forgot where, think it was CNET GameCenter. The author (or the person being interviewed, don't remember) recited a case, where he went into a cinema, and was sitting next to a father and son. Whenever there was a sexually suggesting scene on the screen (like kissing), the father quickly covered son's eyes. But violence didn't disturb him - not one bit.<P>All you "moralist" people need to shake your stale brains a bit, and for a change, THINK. Norrath's culture corresponds to europe's early middle ages - 10th, 12th century - and, this might be news to you, in those times, few lived past 40, and ages 13-15 was when most women married. Read some literature - pick up Harry Harrison's Hammer and Cross for example. Norrath has similar culture - and with similar culture, you will recieve similar events.<P>If role playing on the scenes provided by game designers is considered bannable - then perhaps the time has come for me to quit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The new EQ manual has a slightly watered down version.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>excerpt on the net from: <BR>http://eq.stratics.com/content/details/lore_history.shtml<BR> <BR>The Prince of Hate snatched away the Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over the course of three thousand years. He then gathered the quivering pieces of these beings of light and rebuilt them in his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children.<BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Not exactly snuff pR0n but not all sweetness and light either.

I am Innoruuk and this is the Maestro of Hate, your guide for the next three centuries. I hope the straps and chains holding you to the La-Ze-Boy chair is comfy." <P>"Our programme that we have planned is to play to you, "The Little Mermaid", the cartoon version of "King and I", "The magic sword" and "Pocahontas" on an infinite loop until your skin turns blue from the UV radiation of the TV and you develop a taste of playing with the bodies of dead people." <P>"I hope you enjoy it as much as we had fun thinking it up. Thank you." <P>AAAAAAAAARRRRRFGGGGHHHH! EEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKK!

Banned for moral reasons no less. <P>But yet actually playing the game, players can make the inital choice to play 2 classes of characters who basicly engage in unholy acts against the dead to make their way through the world. <P>Somehow it's not ok to write a story on a third party website about the rape of the living, but it's ok to play the game and rape the dead of their spiritual essences?

</FONT><HR>Let's not lose sight of the core issue here.  It's not about what she wrote as much as where she wrote it and the CATEGORY of writing it is.<P>First, we'll all acknowledge that it's not libelous or defaming in any way.  It makes no statements that could be construed as anti-verant or anti-everquest.  There are no exploits published or suggested.<P>Where was it written?  On a privately owned and moderated site that Verant has no control or oversight.<P>What was it?  It was LITERATURE.  OMFG!  I can't even come up with words to describe how scary this is!  She was banned for writing LITERATURE!<P>I frankly wouldn't care if she depicted DE's has having sexual relations with dead animals.  The subject matter is not at issue.  <P>The very ESSENCE is that Verant is exerting control over what people write on OTHER SITES.<P>Stop talking about whether the writing was sick.  It was.  It's nasty and disgusting.  I personally don't believe it was very well written, but that's just my opinion.  But there can be NO QUESTION that this was creative prose.  Verant is saying, "You can't make up stories about our world and tell them to others unless we approve of them."<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bardo , you seem more well versed in legal matter then my poor HS jaunt into criminal law did ( nice touch , the teacher was arrested for finding 16 yr olds exciting! heh ) But its my understanding that Verant would be discriminating if they did NOT set down a blanket form or precedent upon which to justify banning people for this style of writing. This is marking out a specific detail that was NOT forwarned , and ( supposedly ) other who also perform said detail and banning them for it. This said detail can be race , religion , hieght , weight , color of eyes , all of which are covered by federal discrimnation laws. <P>This may or may not be a " first case " where they are looking to set an example , but since no warning was given ( IE verant in good faith looked to settle the matter before taking drastic action ) I believe a case for discrimination can be made. <P>As for copywrite , it has been in my experience that its the owner of the material who says what can and cant be done with it. Recently W Bush was using songs in his campaigns , the auther of which called him up and told him to stop violating copywrite =P But verant did not state this was the issue they took up against Myst. If was her violating the spirit of the EULA. Unfortunatly laws concerning shrink wrap/click agreement EULA are still in the works. <P>I can see verant warning about possible TOS violation , as there is NO PLACE setting guidelins for acceptable/nonacceptable posting OUTSIDE Sony boards , as such Myst had no way of know the written piece was in violation of thier agreement.  As such , I believe there are legal grounds , but unfortunatly its frankly not worth sueing. Few people can afford to even TRY to sue someone as large as sony , let alone have the patience or willingnes to try. This alone lets the big companies dictate what they can and cannot do. Heck look to the tobacco industry =P<P>EQ has paied for itself as far as sony is concerned , they have more then covered the cost of making it. Dont doubt for a minute though that they will simple erase the game if it becomes to much of a hassle. Not to mention the ease in which they could start up another company with a new game ( taking all the ideas they have been gathering from us while we play and whine ) and eventually " buy " it later on. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
