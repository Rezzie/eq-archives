&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Abashi, I pray you read this post.  <P>First I would like to paraphrase the portion of the PnP policy that I am making reference to.  I know this has been addressed, perhaps even with my angle.  However, this is something that I need to have answered.  The PnP states:<P>No player shall cause intentional experience loss by "training" npcs onto another player.<P>Training is defined as pulling an NPC along behind you and attempting to get it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement.<P>The intentional training of NPCs will result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by an EQCSR. We are aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional trains, and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely.<P>I recently had this particular situation happen to me, and a GUIDE would not do anything.  Here is what happened:<P>I was playing aandayr, my cleric, and died, on my own, in NRo.  I then proceeded from Nektulos back to Nro for corpse recovery.  I zone into Nro, and not long after, I see a shout by an anonymous PC named Balorf.  The shout reads "Come see my Train at Wiz platform."  This to me signals an intentional train, and if you saw it, you would know for sure.  To continue, I get to my body and loot it.  As I stand up from my slain body, I turn to my left to see Balorf, running by with his train of literally 50 or more Monsters.  I was at this time at a safe distance.  I decide to head back to the tunnel, following the wall.  I turn, only to see MR. Balorf turn around and run the train Straight for me.  No question at this point of intentional training.  And as one might have guessed, several of the monsters who were aggro toward me attacked, slaying me once more.<P>Furious, I examine my options. Thinking as rationally as I can, I petition a GM, well aware that training is in direct violation of the PnP.  I also /report Balorf to get the last 10 chat lines involving him, including the shout to the zone announcing his record train.<P>Not long after, I get a response from Aindaur, an EQCSR.  Aindaur asks me how he can help me, and I explain the situation above.  He then asks me "did he threaten you before he did it?" I reply with the truth.  "No"  He then asks me "did he threaten to do it again?"  Again I must answer no.  I remind the EQCSR that I have filed a report.  <BR>"Well," he says, "if he didn't threaten you, and he hasn't threatened again, it is your word against his."  My word against his, despite his public announcement that he was training NPC's.  Come on, I did everything I could to prove my case.  <P>My point is this:<P>a.) Who does PnP REALLY protect?  It was designed to protect players from this type of childish behavior.  Instead, it protects those who engage in these activities, while letting them go unpunished.  <BR>b.) No, it was not witnessed by an EQCSR, but the /report should have cleared that up.  "Come see my train" should have hinted that the train was not accidental.  <BR>c.)What I get out of this experience is that I can cause exp loss to anyone I want, as long as I do not threaten them before or after I do it?  <P>I don't think this is what PnP was designed for.  And though I was not a high lvl character, it was still frustrating to have to retrieve my body from nek, as I was not high enough to bind. I hope that this is an issue worth addressing ABASHI.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure why you say that it "protects" the people taking inappropriate actions. No part of the Play Nice Polices allow that it was that the person was doing.  It is, however, true that these things must be witnessed, as we can't allow one person or group of people to adversely affect the account-status of another on word alone.  As I'm sure you can imagine, there are people who would use that as an offensive tool if we allowed it.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I turn to my left to see Balorf, running by with his train of literally 50 or more Monsters.<P>I'd like more information on this if possible.  Code was put in a long time ago, before public release of the product, that keeps people from forming a train this long.  That many NPCs are not supposed to pursue any one player-character.  Once enough NPCs are chasing a player, the others will consider the situation "well in hand" and go back about thier business.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Trains that long aren't possible.  Actually, more funny than going about their business, many MoBs will stand around and watch for a bit before returning.  This can be an issue because the code is a maximum per PC.  So, for example, if I "pull" 5 monsters through a bunch of others to a group, then a groupmate heals me, he's gonna get some of these MoBs on him, then some of the others that didn't persue will come over and join up with me...<P>It's too bad, though.  I'd love to pull 50 gobbies to the zone of Sol A just to get a pic  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually I don't think there is anything in the rules regarding the building of trains.  In other words, the fact he built a long train is not in of itself a violation.  The only direct evidence we "have" is that he built a train.  He shouted it, it was witnessed.  You then said he trained you purposely.  Well maybe it really was an accident.  Maybe even he had through he had agrooed the mobs so thoroughly they would not leave the train and he was just trying to give you a thrill.<P>With no history or record of him abusing you, threatening you, or "admitting" to you he purposely trained you, there really is no way to determine if he was being malicious.  It really is his word against yours.<P>If the GM's sanctioned everyone who accidentally killed someone through direct or indirect means, there would be no one left in the game.<P>Remember, the PnP rule states you have to have intention to kill via training.  If they didn't have that modifier, every time people died from a train caused by someone feeing (unrest anyone) there would be mass bannings.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Remember, the PnP rule states you have to have intention to kill via training."<P>Of course, what could be the probable outcome of intentionally "building a train?"  In a zone as small as Oasis, you're likely to run past quite a few people.  If you're engaging in this kind of "sport" as some form of popularity contest, as this guy seemingly was ("Hey look at me!  Look at my big train!"), not only are you incredibly lame, you are just about CERTAIN to get someone killed.  There simply isn't enough room in most zones to train a large number of mobs safely.<P>I don't think it needs to be a question of intent to at least issue a warning.  The guy probably didn't INTEND to kill anyone (not that anyone could prove it anyway), but let's look at it this way:  once you create the train, you've got to do something with it.  Your options are:<P>1) Stop, fight, and kill them all.  Easy enough for a planes-geared 50+ person with a bunch of very low greens.  Not so easy if any of the mobs are even CLOSE to being blue.<BR>2) Die.  Even still, the crowd of mobs have to disperse.  If you're nice enough to pick a desolate area of the zone to die in, the mobs may disperse without causing any harm.  If you run toward others for help, good chance that whether they jump in or not, they'll benefit from your "generosity" regardless.<BR>3) Train them to the zone... where unsuspecting folks will run into a horde and be slain.<P>I think that if you intentionally cause ANY kind of train that you don't intend to kill/pull to your group, you should get a warning not to do it again.  Basically you are practicing anti-social behavior simply by the fact that you are causing problems for the other folk in that zone for your own amusement.  To me, that's harassment, and repeated acts of it constitutes harassment of the population in general.  Bam.  Warning.  Do it again?  Suspended.  Seems reasonable to me.<P>It's fairly easy to distinguish an intentional train from some unfortunate bastard that looked away from the screen for a few seconds and accidentally ran into aggro range of a camp full of mobs.  The person that does it accidentally typically doesn't parade the mobs around the zone shouting things like "look at this big ol' train I got here, isnt' it cool?"  Typically something like this could be easily corroborated because several people might petition, or at the very least you could hope that the "investigation" would allow for the guide to question other bystanders/spectators, and the story will typically develop rather quickly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>FWIW, I've found it impossible to agro more than 3 mobs at a time while in NRo.  I figured that this is to prevent super-trains, and super-twinking (arising from 50 mummies on a lv.1 char with a lv.50-druid damage shield + SLN + regen + heals).<P>But...  as someone mentioned, it is quite possible in Permafrost, as well as Paw, I may add.  In both of these dungeons, if the mob on top of a bridge is agro'd, he will ask all of his friends along the way to come join, and voila - a train of 20+ goblins/gnolls stacked on top of each other.<P>(Died to this train once upon a time, and still in disbelief, we tried to reproduce it at level 45, and with a chanter + evaccer + wizard... oh yeah, it still happens...  AE Stun, AE nuke nuke nuke...  a nice pile of 20+ corpses...)<P>45th Cleric<BR>Sol Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually, Trains are no big deal to me.  Their occurence can be accidental or purposeful, it really doesn't matter to me.  PNP does not protect the train puller, but thankfully it doesn't in Gustapo style, go after them either. <P>High level players sometimes pull trains on purpose, for the challenge of fighting them off.  Other players are just not great pullers, and end up causing trains and deaths to other players. Should these actions be against the rules?  No, I don't think so.  We're all so concerned about our character's experience bar that we're (or you're) willing to call a GM every time you get stuck in a train, more accurately described, a buttload of monsters chasing a fleeing character.  Well Hello?  Trains can and do happen.  It's not even worth a second thought to even think about petitioning about one if you die to one.  That whole concept of crying to an EQ staffer about a train if just beyond me.  I can sum it all up by saying, "Silly".  Let in-game actions (reputations) be handle in-game.  It just drives me nuts that so many EQ players lean on the Petition key everytime something goes wrong.  <P>  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, perhaps that was an exaggeration, though I cannot admit that I counted the mobs, I can tell you that I was SO LAGGED that I was getting a rediculously low frame rate.  I remember seeing for sure, 3 Mad Men, 7 or 8 dune Tarantulas and  Several Sand Scarabs.  I have been playing EQ since about July of 1999, and I have NEVER seen a train this long until this incident.<P>To reply to why I feel that they protect those players that engage in this behavior.  I have clear proof of his announcement of intentional  training, in the form of the /report command.  This should at least count for something, despite being witnessed by your people.  Otherwise, what I understand is that if I don't threaten, or make threats to repeat the train, then I may train whomever I please with no fear of penalty from EQ staff.  Is this what I am hearing?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>   I don't know what the max number of mob's is supposed to be, but I have seen some very large trains. The most notable one, the one that always brings a big smile to my face, was when I was passing through Mistmoore (back when SK still had to turn in their items there for Darkforge), I saw a bark elf running for the zone with a HUGE number of ancilles chasing him. There were so many, they were overlapping, no way to get an accurate head count. Needless to say, the poor guy didn't make it far and I whisped my thanks that my invisibility did not drop (for some reason a dark elf SK is just as hated in MM as a high elf or bark elf, despite that the majority of people there are dark elves, and the possible relationship between Mayong Mistmoore and the queen of the dark elves). Anyways, my point is, either the limit is set rediculously high, or it's broken (and probably never worked). <P>Yoshua Gilbert</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Guk  stun the lord and run to the zone and wait 5 sec before zoning  better be a buffed pally if u want to make it. perma is harder to do since u have to be lower lvl to get agro's but have seen the mess it causes  when u run from the scryer room to the zone  if u make it. paw is easy hit the gnoll that stands on top of the bridge behind the double doors easy 20+ train and if 10 blues can't kill a group of 6 they deserve to live no need for any more mobs than 10 blue to the runner ever in my opinion that many can kill as many as 2 groups and has before. unrest was explained train the ghost to zone 3 in ghost room 6 in pit 4 in pool 6 in tr and 2 on the stepps.<BR>this is all stuff i have seen un intentionally done i would hate to see what could be done intentionally if u buff a warrior up with enough buffs he'll survive zone won't.<P><BR>Trelani Onespell<BR>50 Wizardess of innoruk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

This Balorf one night while I was on under my lower lvl character as was my friend on under hers. We were both in the arena in Freeport. Yes I know the arena is a PvP area, but we were just messing around and Balorf came in and killed us in one hit. He not only enjoyed it, but said he did it because he enjoyed killed people that were lower lvl than he was. When my friend was trying to get to her corpse she had to step into the arena to drag it to safety and he killed her yet again. After that he proceded to kill a lvl 3 that had fallen into the arena and was trying to get out just because she was there. None of this was reported because even though Verant has their new customer service policies in effect I did not want to waste my time by getting the reply sorry there is nothing we will do. This Balorf and others like him ruin the game for people that log on to have fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

When a person reports someone for doing this should a GM not go and observe this players actions for a little while to see if he does it again? I mean how many GM's are going to be in one of the exact zones that someone does this in at the right time? There are numerous zones to explore over 4 continents and if someone wants to something like this they just need to do a /who GM before they do it.  I'm just wondering if the person who is reported just gets to keep doing what they are doing until they happen to mess up and forget to see if a GM is in the zone?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>If you go into lower guk you can see trains of up to 20+, I taged a ghoul wizard near the bedroom and he went around by the 5 greater icebone skeletons, he pick them up, the 2 ghoul frogs on the steps, the rit and his 2 wizzies, the 3 gargs, 2 spiders and 2 bats.  I know this for sure, not sure if the frogs from the area around the ass/sup room came or not.  All of these critters took out a group of 6 in less than 5 seconds.  So that blows your answer of a limited number of mobs on one person.  I know that at the end, me being a troll warr with 1500hp, I was the last and all the critters were on me, saw the hits from that many different one's before I also died.

</FONT><HR>Fyrestaff is right on the money.  If 3+ mobs are engaged with you, the others will stand in place/wander off (to come back as soon as one of the three die).  But if they are aggro to you but not in melee ranged, you can create trains of 20+ mobs.  The only thing I'd add is that you can get more than 3 mobs attacking you if you position yourself so that some of the ones "standing in place" are in melee range.  Then they will attack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Man Abashi you're on a roll today. That's the second question you haven't answered.<P>If the guy has on record that another said come look at my train, then he died to a bunch of roaming spawns in 30 seconds you would have to assume that there is a *really* good chance that this person died to a train created by someone.<P>Worst of all you didn't even answer his question. He said his view was that if he makes a train and kills people with it but doesn't threaten others he's ok. You didn't answer that at all. you side stepped. Also what does it matter if it was 50 twenty or a train of ten? If a train was started by someone else purposly and it gets others killed is that legal? that's the question. It was a straigt forward question, doesn't that get a straight answer?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, a bit of info on "train size limits":<P>Yes, there's code in there that limits the number of mobs that will actively attack any one player at once. This is set to three mobs.<P>In the event that more than three mobs are agro'd on the player, the fourth and up mobs will either hang out at the edge of casting range, or simply run away.<P>The caveats are thus:<P>As soon as you start running, these three mobs are no longer "engaged" with you, and all creatures agro'd on the player will resume the chase, until the time where the player stops and again three mobs are beating on him.<P>As soon as one of the three mobs dies or flees, one of the waiting mobs will agro on you again (which does make sense).<P>It it not impossible at all to get very large trains. I've run around with hordes of moss snakes before for the humor involved (well, funny to me anyways). <P>If you want to test this, try it in Paineel's newbie zone. Start gathering up skellies and watch their behavior as you move around and let them attack you, then run away again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi, this is Balorf. 1st thing is you are a liar. I only had rattlesnakes triantulas and scarabs on me and they are all NON agro. Second thing, i saw what killed you. You were running from the other direction with a crypt mummy on you. i saw it chasing you right as you came into view. 3rd thing is i even tried to save you from the mummy that killed you and you try to make me look like the bad guy. Also, i had no mose than 15 things on me and it just looks like alot when they are all clummped together. The last thing is, you were swearing at me </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Calling me a liar. If that isn't hypocracy at its finest.  First off, every bit of what I said was true.  Secondly, if Abashi would read this post once more, he would see that you DID infact cause the train.  And Finally, I NEVER swore.  It would be rediculously stupid on my part to swear, and subject myself to a PnP violation.  I am not an idiot.  If you recall the conversation it began by me informing you that you have been reported for intentionally training.  You got defensive and YOU (not I) began the namecalling.  No Swear words ever were typed into my keyboard in that conversation.  In fact, I put YOU on ignore, or did you forget? Whether or not you believe it, there were several madmen and mummies in that train also.  And I saw you run by, and turn around, so deny it as you will, I am NOT deceiving anyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Man I should go start a train in Upper Guk and post screenshots. This code may work where there's plenty of space and mobs are spread out, but it doesn't work in tight dungeons very well. I literaly have died there to more mobs than I could count at the time. I'm pretty sure I could go back and aggro 15 or more no problem.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would like to correct an error.  I found out today that Balorf is not higher than my shaman, but rather the exact same lvl.  It has been a while, and I know that I have in the past have seen him around.  And since I have not been playing my shaman for the last couple of months, assumed that he had surpassed me.  Anyway...just wanted to make this correction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005206-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005206-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005206&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005206&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
