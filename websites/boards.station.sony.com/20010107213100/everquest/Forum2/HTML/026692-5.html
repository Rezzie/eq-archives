</FONT><HR>From Isriam the Poster:<BR>&lt;&lt; The ONLY information they have and could have is my ip address where i reposted the post from sluggoexploits. Which, by the way, is not even an IP that can be traced to everquest due to it being a work IP address that I do not play EQ from. Verant is LYING that they can prove the poster was Brene/Isriam. Once again, I still have the orginal post as a .txt file from my copy paste and have no problem reposting it again due to the fact I no longer play EQ and my IP from work can not be traced to ingame even if I did have an account.<P>In a nutshell, Verant banned Brene and 3 of his accounts due to the fact I posted using a name of one of his characters. I wonder how many other people I can get banned by posting using their ingame name?<P>&gt;&gt;<P>Let me get this straight:<P>1) Abashi claimed they did not have the IP addresses of the posters. Then how did they know the location from which they posted? Sounds like Abashi is not being completely honest, OR<P>2) &lt;&lt; Verant took the name of the user and searched its records, finding a player named Isriam on Xegony.<BR>They scanned all accounts to find 2 other accounts with matching IP's to Isriams from Everquest. They proceeded to ASSUME that this must be the same person, and banned all accounts<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>Verant did in fact nor recieve IP addresses, as claimed by both Abashi and Lux. They simply decided that they would ban the player who happened to have the same EQ name as that used by the poster on the Xegony site, despite HAVING NO PROOF WHATSOEVER THAT THEY WERE THE SAME PERSON as the poster.<P>3) &lt;&lt; Brene and I live in the same house<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>They then used that IP address to ban the account of another player, simply because he (or she) was guilty of the unforgiveably heinous sin of living at the same address as someone who happened to have an in-game name just like the forum name of a NON-EQ-PLAYER, who reposted an exerpt of a post containing possibly confidential information, posted by an as yet unidentified 4th person. Hmm, that seems like guilt by 4th-hand association.<P>4) &lt;&lt; Abashi's post saying that there have been no bannings is a complete lie. Here is a direct quote from one of the many e-mails I have received from Jacob Thornley, Guide Coordinator, "Unfortunatley the banning on all of these accounts will stand."<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>No comment necessary from me on that one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Everyone needs to get off Verant's back.  Lets look what happened here:<P>Someone promised not to release the information that was released.<P>Someone illegally released that information.<P>Gamereal.com gave the IP's to Verant (they had to have.  How else would they be able to track them?  The posted message content wouldn't be enough)<P>Gamerealm.com denies helping Verant to look better to the players.  They don't want to be in hot water when the fit hits the shan.<P>Verant finds a connection between the IP's, information in the post and their logs<P>Verant bans the accounts of the posters<P><BR>No one knows the facts but everyone is hot and bothered.  Everyone is all paranoid.  Why does everyone think that they shouldn't be accountable for what they do?  Why does Verant always look like Big Brother with a stick whenever they are only trying to protect their interests and intellectual properties?<P>It is not difficult to get a court order to get information from ISP's.  A large company like Sony has lawyers that would be all over this shtuff in a heartbeat, and rightly so.<P>The bottom line is, they can and did track those people (and it isn't hard to do with the long arm of the law), they suspended their accounts so no more malicious activity happens.  This sounds all right and good to me.<P>But maybe I am just a dreamer and believe in the system...  Everyone should be accountable for their actions.  I think everyone should lay off Verant and I would hope Gamerealm.com would come to terms with this and tell the truth.  Verant is in the legal and ethical right.  They didn't jump the gun, they had probable cause.  This isn't a court of law so probable cause is enough to suspend an account.<P>We REALLY don't know what happened.  Try not to go spouting off before you know the facts.  The statement was given "They did not care that the one that was doing wrong was caught, they simply wanted someone to blame, and attacked."  A large company cannot go out and do this.  I think we should give them a little more credit than that.  Verant and Sony are are not "emotional" entities.  It isn't like they go off half ****ed.  They made that mistake before with the Mystere thing in some people's eyes (not as if I think they did anything wrong with that either).  I seriously doubt the whole "vendetta" idea.<P>And about the statement "the Internet is actually owned by Electronic Arts and Sony. It's a joint operating agreement, I think."  People say statements like that when they do not want to be accountable for their actions.<P>Just my thoughts...

Suppose someone plays EQ consistently from 1.2.3.*, with the asterisk representing every IP address in that class C address.<P>Now, you post to a message board from the IP address 1.2.3.4 under your character's in-game name. Verant need only to get that IP address from the message board operator."<P>Even this analogy is flawed. At home I use a cable router which does the network address translation for all 6 computers behind my router. 3 of the computers have EQ accounts, maintained by different individuals. However, the only IP address anyone could see if I post to the boards is the address of my router, much like gateways and proxies do. <P>Oh, and it's simple to get another IP address. Simply shut down the router for a brief period, and when it broadcasts to the DHCP server again, it will most likely receive a different address.<P>Basically, Verant couldn't determine for almost all of us what EQ account we have based on posting to a bullentin board. Even if so, it would be painstakingly difficult and most certaintly not worth the effort in most cases.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Again, there is alot of 'talk' about Verant Inc changing its customer service image, but actions speak louder than words.<P>I think that if the people in question didnt come onto the boards here then they were dead and buried without given any chance whatsoever to talk first.<P>I have a very real concern.  I play from a country where good internet connection isnt all that easy to find, almost all EQ players from this city are all on one of two or three ISPs capable enough of holding a good enough connection to the USA.<P>I know of between twenty or thirty using the same cable modem connection, god knows how many more there are.  Will I be hung up to dry for something someone else does?  It would be quite easy to mistake it for me.<P>What assurance do we have that we will not be strung up and hung based on circumstatial information?  VI is ready to push the wagon over and start all guns blazing when it comes to the rights of Verant Inc and Sony in relation to EQ.  <P>You have every right to preserve your image, but there is a price.  The tighter you squeeze your grip the more you will lose in terms of customer relations.<P>Where is your commitment to your customers?<P>Why do people have to come to these boards and face ridicule and be humiliated in order to get any kind of fair representation?  Do we mean that little?<P>I dont blame you Gordon, your just a puppet in the grand scheme of things.  I know at times you look like an idiot with the things you say, but I understand how the garbage in-garbage out system works.  The chain is only as good as its weakest link, the VI chain must be made out of lead because I'm sure you are constantly put into a position which makes you look like you are anything but honest.<P>I am glad there was justice.  But I hate to think what the accused people have and will go through because of this 'avoidable' experience.<P>Gordon, Alan... You really need a formal document for your customers so we have safeguards against being treated in this manner.  In both Mystere's and this case it seems your customers had nowhere to go, nobody to take up their case.<P>In fact, whoever spoke to Mystere behaved in a very inappropriate manner.  I'd hate to think I'd have to approach that rude and unpleasant person in any matter.<P>Remember that word you used, Gordon?  Professionalism.  Door swings both ways.<P>Either change your corporate attitude and put your customers as your number one priority or don't bother making any 'innacurate' claims that your care at all about your customer service.<P>Whilst you play judge, jury and executioner with your customers without even having the decency to talk to them first and gather real evidence then its painfully obvious where we, the customers, stand.<P>I'm sure VI will change one day, I just hope its sooner rather than later.  I'm tired of seeing issues like this come up all the time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bloodsage posted earlier:<P>"Why is the inability to play a videogame for a few hours or days such a terrible injustice? I know how much it would affect my life--not a whit."<P>This may be true for you Bloodsage, but honestly a lot of people out there are seriously addicted to this fantasy world.  I am in agreement with you (on this point ONLY), and would shrug and move on.  However a lot of introverted or just fantasy addicted individuals would have some serious issues with losing touch with their virtual families.  Some may laugh or scoff at this, however it is a fact.  Just because it doesn't bother you, doesn't make it right.<P>As for your comment saying the system worked as "intended" (not a direct quote I know, just too lazy to scroll back); you are dead wrong.  The system didn't work, and I would like to believe from the sheer number of people posting their disgust with the way it was handled, the matter was escalated.  Do you think if it didn't make it to the msg boards, and the kind folks at xegony.net didn't post their side HERE that it would have been resolved (or if it was, that quickly?).  I sure don't think so.  Look at the Mystere example, Abashi finally responded "due to the sheer number of posts on this issue".  <P>The one point I haven't seen addressed is the "ICQ Profile" comment from Abashi regarding their "location".  I didn't see the original posts on Xegony.net, but I do see a *lot* of people posting their ICQ numbers in their signature.  If (not sure if the original posters did) include their ICQ number, you can pull up the users profile and see the IP number.  I know that ICQ has an option where it "hides" it, but even then, just send an ICQ message to the person when they are online then jump to a command line and do a "netstat -a", that will show you the active connection to the end user.  It even helps if you do a netstat before then after the message and pull out the differences.  God knows I have used this technique many times to find out who someone is that's spamming me over ICQ.<P>Just another guy's perspective, and congratulations everyone.  Without your support for these guys I am afraid to think that those bans would have stuck forever.<P>Teddan Thistletoe<BR>Dead Sexy Halfling Druid<BR>Bristlebane<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Then the ISP checks back logs typically they are held for  3 days. Who logged in where and from what city and into which node and what IP they got. This is all info that is supplied.

</FONT><HR>Hehe, everytime I see threads like this, I can't seem to get the picture of peasant mobs with torches out of my head...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>  Anyway, from what it sounds like (although only the people involved know for sure), VI found out someone posted confidential info on a board that only a guide would have access to, by a poster named Isriam.  What an amazing coincidence that it just so happens that the person who ingame is named Isriam lives in a place that has a guide account!!!  (Please don't think I'm accusing the ingame Isriam of being the poster, that seems apparent to not be the case).  What was VI to think?  Guide info was posted;  they had a name linked to a guide account.  It's unfortunate if anyone innocent was suspended, and hopefully it will turn out ok in the end.  But it seems that VI DID have enough circumstantial evidence to suspend the accounts.  (I won't make the argument that the EULA states they don't have to even have a reason to ban accounts, as no company would just arbitrarily turn away customers (on purpose anyway, companies DO screw up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)  <BR>  Try to keep in mind also, that only a ridiculously small fraction of CS cases appear in this oh-so-lively forum (and those are 99.999% the bad ones).  So to say that VI has a 'bad CS policy' (and they may have, but we certainly don't know from the few cases we've seen on the boards) is to make an assumption that you have no evidence to back up.  How many people have had wonderful CS experience from VI?  I'm sure it is exponentially more than the bad.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Damn you for beating me to pointing out the blindingly obvious  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Even if there was NO IP situation going on, to me that alone -does- constitute enough circumstantial evidence to warrant a suspension pending more investigation.<P>Okay, how many guides are there with access to the information?  Are you thinking there's hundreds of thousands out there?  Hardly.  I'd be -very- surprised if the total across all servers was 300.  What ARE THE ODDS of the above statement occurring?  Poster Isriam posts info that only a guide could have, and player Isriam just happens to be a regular poster to the same boards and to live in a house with a guide account.  DOES sound to be -very- reasonable circumstantial evidence to warrant a suspension pending more investigation.  <P>Why suspend first and investigate later?  For one, no one is going to be more than slightly inconvenienced by not getting to play for a couple of days.  I would THINK that anyone would find the above to be reasonable grounds for suspicion.  And in this case, you do need to suspend ASAP even with only good circumstantial evidence, lest even -more- information be released.<P>I know a lot of people disagree with that last point.  But there is the concept of a holding cell that is used every single day in our justice system.  It works.  It's necessary.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Dudes, its simple.  If you guys cannot stand what Verant has done then stop using their service.  Since you pay to use their service, you basically have to deal with whatever they say.  They have the right to terminate service at any time.  Meaning they can ban you for whatever they want.  So if you don't like what Verant has done, then close your account and go play UO.  Otherwise shut up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I, for one, am cheered at the evidence that there is indeed "a vibrant community" in EverQuest (pardon the hackneyed term.)<P>There is evidence of intelligent, informed discussion on these boards, and amazingly, evidence that the corporate benefactor Verant is listening. -Woot-!!! <P>What I mean is: people speak up about issues that concern them, and are not stifled by threats of suppression, whether opposed by corporate policies or the attitudes of their fellow EQ'ers.<P>Long Reign the Consumer!

</FONT><HR>Ski_Muerte<P>I realize this mya be a somewhat novel idea to you, but have you ever considered actually reading the posts in a thread before posting a reponse littered with fundamental ignorance of the carefully reititerated facts?<P>&lt;&lt; Gamereal.com gave the IP's to Verant (they had to have. How else would they be able to track them? The posted message content wouldn't be enough)<BR>Gamerealm.com denies helping Verant to look better to the players. They don't want to be in hot water when the fit hits the shan<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>Abashi also denied getting the IP addresses from Gamereal. The fact that the poster and the banned player (since reinstated as Verant admits they blew it) had completely different IP adresses, would tend to confirm that, wouldn't you say?<P>&lt;&lt; else would they be able to track them? <BR>&gt;&gt;<P>By making the foolish assumption that a name used on an independent noticeboard "proves" that the player who happens to have the same name made the post. Subsequently they actually check this assumption (or rather the site moderator shoves it in their faces), discover their latest PR ****-up, and and retreat, weakly muttering vague excuses.<P>&lt;&lt; Verant finds a connection between the IP's, information in the post and their logs<BR>&gt;&gt; <BR>Verant did not have the IPs (or they wouldn't have banned the wrong person), did not find any information in their logs connected to the post, and were forced to admit an embarassing mistake. <P>They did this only because both the poster and Gamereal informed them that THE POSTER AND THE BANNED PLAYERS HAD COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IP ADDRESSES, WERE COMPELTELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, LIVED IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. Information they could have verified before lashing out vindictively, had they learned anything at all over the past 2 years.<P>&lt;&lt; Verant bans the accounts of the posters<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>Verant banned the accounts of 2 people who had NOT posted, then had to retract with egg all over their faces.<P>&lt;&lt; It is not difficult to get a court order to get information from ISP's. A large company like Sony has lawyers that would be all over this shtuff in a heartbeat, and rightly so<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>If they got a court order, they would have had the IP address of the actual poster, and discovered that he and the player with the same character name were completely different people living in different locations. They would not have banned the wrong people, then had to retract.<P>&lt;&lt; The bottom line is, they can and did track those people (and it isn't hard to do with the long arm of the law), they suspended their accounts so no more malicious activity happens. This sounds all right and good to me.<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>The bottom line is, they can and did ban the wrong people, despite easily verifiable information to the contrary. They did this because they were too foolish or too arrogant to check with Gamereal.com to confirm that the poster and the player were the same person. They were then confronted with incontrovertible evidence that they banned the wrong people, and had to rescind the bannings and apologize (well, they probably didn't apologize, that would be most unlike Verant) in another embarassing but tediously predictable faux pas.<P>Shows they have learned absolutely nothing from the Mystere case, as I predicted at the time.<P>&lt;&lt; We REALLY don't know what happened. Try not to go spouting off before you know the facts<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>ROTFL!<BR>Ski_Muerte, did it ever occur to you to follow your own advice, and ascertain the facts by, say actually READING the thread, before "spouting off" a bunch of completely (and unnecessarily) erroneous conclusions?<P>Try it - you really will look much less foolish ... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
