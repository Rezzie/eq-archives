</FONT><HR>I read your post about dungeon based faction in Kunark.  I understand it, and feel I know where you are coming from. However, unless there are some dungeons that affect the faction of players of GOOD alighment in the outpost in Firona Vie, then your statement "Kunark is not meant to be an encapsulated environment that people never leave" is totally unfair. It should be ammended to "Kunark is not meant to be an encapsulated environment that EVIL RACES never leave"  The dungeon based faction as it exists right now is totally skewed AGAINST players of evil races, while it favors that of good races, for the dungeons will be less crowd, for the faction hits taken will have many evil races shying away from hunting there.  And exacty what are you talking about when you say "This is the same choice that players of good alignments had to make when deciding whether or not to kill things that give them bad faction" Uhhm....you mean guard killing? Seems to me people only killed guards due to overcrowding...not enough high level critters to kill, so they turned to guards! Other than that, im at a loss at WHAT faction they have to watch out for!?  They are allready KOS to evils, so who cares about them....other than that...they have the run of Antontica.<BR>All in all..i'm pretty disappointed.  it is a black mark on an otherwise fantastic expansion to this game.  The past week, I have been unable to group with my friends, because they are all loving Karnors Castle....and I do not want to kill there, due to the faction hit.  I truly hope you reconsider your decision in the future on this matter....it is a BAD thing!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I've read a lot on this faction issue in Kurnark and thought hard about it. I read Verant's reasoning behind their decision, and weighed it versus the impact this situation has on the game.<P>After deliberation, I think the situation is not acceptable. Here's what made up my mind:<P>I play a High Elf magician. I'm currently working on my focus items quests. These quests involve getting some items from Najena (among other places) and bringing them to the Temple of Solusek Ro.<P>Now, what I asked myself was: What if killing the magicians in Najena to get these items made me KOS in the Temple of Solusek? How would I feel?<P>I'd be really, really ticked off, that's how I'd feel. I'd feel that Verant was being deliberately cruel in a situation such as this. From what I understand, this situation is pretty much the way it is for the Evil races in Kurnark.<P>This just really isn't fair. I don't care if there are compelling roleplay issues for the decision (and I roleplay heavily, I might add). If there are roleplay reasons to not allow you in the city if you hunt in these dungeons, then DON'T PUT THE SPELLS THEY HAVE TO QUEST FOR IN THE CITY.<P>NPC: "Go and kill the might Jim Bob, and bring me his head, and I will give you a Good Thing(TM)"<P>Player: "Okay!" (runs off, kills Jim Bob, brings back his head) "Here is the head you asked for!"<P>NPC: "Oh my god! You killed Jim Bob! Now I will kill you!"<P>I mean come on, this is garbage. Something should be done about this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I dont think that any of the quests "required" by the Evil Types in Overthere to get spells and such force them to kill things that are bad faction for them.<P>I think that this is a case where the evil types wanna go where the k3wl l3wt wif da phattest 3ff3ctz are so they can twink and become as powerful as possible.<P>They should make a different choice, and hunt and kill something else.<P>On a side note, you say that people only killed guards due to overcrowding and there not being enough high level things to hunt.<P>Why are there people killing Overthere and Cabailis Guards now?  Seems to me that there is plenty of things on Kunark they could hunt and kill for XP, and it sure as hell isnt overcrowded on Kunark.<P>The reason they do this is because it is relatively safe and easy xp.  Plain and simple, it is completely lazy.  Same reasoning why they want to not have the faction hits in the kewlest of dungeons.<P>Want a hard choice for factions?  Play a Rogue.  Rogues have to decide if they want the entire world to hate them or if they want their own kind (Rogues) to hate them in many cities.  Some of the Rogue's quests that they do FOR the Rogue guild give them bad faction with other Rogue guilds.  Some of the best quests in the game give very bad faction with Rogue guilds.<P>Suck it up and do what the rest of us have been doing for a long time...deal with the penalties relating to the class/race you have decided to play.<P>Drachar Kneebreaker<BR>32nd Dwarven Cleric of Brell<BR>Tarew Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I must say I agree with several of your points Drachar, but you are skewed yet. Most people killed guards out of greed originaly, as well as safety, lazyness, and lack of creativity. But, this faction hit in 3 of the dungeons in RoK is absurd there is no dungeon or even near equal situation anywhere else in the game for the good races to contend with. The original evil races had 3 cities maybe that they could use for banking and vending as compared to the good races what oh 6 cities?? hmmmm Then having played both good and evil races and being a roleplayer who likes to discover and complete quests. Most of my various evil characters became kos in 2 of the 3 cities quite often from performing their native city quests. Ok from a roleplay standpoint evil is evil and tends to fall in upon itself to no avail. Yet the story line wasnt very wonderful for any of these quests, several of which gave no reward worthwhile in the time required to complete them,let alone the faction losses. I certainly did not get any flaming mallet for becoming KOS in Neriak and Grobb as a Ogre shaman doing the Gatorsmasher quest. The new lands have more vending available in FV than is available in OT at present herbs are available in FV and not in OT, this is only one of the slights given to the evil races. The one faction increasing quest that is in OT doesnt appear to work, I have completed it 12 times now and seen no faction change whatsoever?? I like roleplaying actually and questing more than the typical lets go clear a dungeon and get fat loot. Yet I will not sit quietly and watch the good races run rampant from an already superior position controling the market in needed items, for quests or eqipment. There is no correlation to this situation in the original lands at all, good races could run rampant in any dungeon or zone and with exception of killing their own guards or citizens ( which many chose to do out of shear greed ) not lose faction with any of the good cities. Many chose to do so and it was no great lose when they have the option of so many cities to shop in who cares? If the story lines that VI has at this point enacted, made good cinema, common sense, and offered questing as a option within these dungeons it would be a different matter? But, I have visited 2 dungeons now that cost faction with Overther/Danak shipyards and have found myself to still be kos with the undead denizens, not found any npc's with a storyline of mention, not one quest, nor any redeeming factor to make me feel VI has handled this any better than they have any of the other evil quest/storylines? I expect interesting contradictions, faction problems, ( like the decaying Dead faction within Neriak for Ogres for no apparent reason? )even betrayal and infighting among the evil races, they are evil after all. This does however need to be tempered and balanced in some way. As of yet that has not been happening in either quality, number, reward, or playable storyline with most of the evil quests, or services available. Evil races are a part of the game play and should have consideration. They can say whatever they will about planned faction problems, or that is how the storyline is meant to be. But it must be made playable and not relegate evil race/class characters to second class citizens. I could go on, but anyone can look at the working quests for the dark races, in particular the Ogre and Trolls, and you will see on average more quests with higher monetary/item/ exp reward in every other good city. And yes I do play a rogue as a alt he isnt but lvl 30ish and factions are a pain but he isnt kos everywhere all the faction hits I have taken from quests were repairable thru other quest easily and none of the rogue quest even the longer dynamic quests made me suddenly kos completely to anyplace, only disliked.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=039436&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=039436&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
