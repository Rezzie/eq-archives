All my mez did was get me mobbed and killed first.

</FONT><HR>Really wish I could make sure I'm not repeating someone else before I post, but damn this thread is long ... and it's not even my class.  So apologies if this is redundant.<P>This isn't bard-specific, but I think it would be a BIG plus to the bard class especially.  Please add a client option that can be set so that you don't automatically target a player who buffs you!  I love bards, but I had a helluva time last night in ToFS because of a combo of invisible mobs I couldn't click on, and bard songs stealing my targetting whenever I cleared it.  It's unfair that a bard's songs should hinder the technical aspect of someone's gameplay like that, to both the bard and the other players.<P>I don't know how easy this is to code, but the effect would simply be a /autopctarget (on/off) command line option.  This way it's a relatively simple client change, and doesn't require making bard songs behave differently than spells.<P>Morudoth Nimgaur<BR>Teir'Dal Enchanter<BR>Council of Arcana, Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, in my experience, the toughest levels were from 21-31. It was difficult to find groups because generally the bard was not considered that helpful. And prior to some grouping xp changes, the hybrid penalty made bards level slower than any other group.<P>I think the idea of providing bards better defense skills is very good. A lot of the songs are defensive in nature already. If the bard is taking a ton of damage (often) while singing defense songs, he doesnt last long. These defense songs (for example rhythm line and psalm line) mostly stack with other lines. That differs from the buffing lines. <P>I don't mind that a bard is not a major damage dealer. Though it is fun to solo giants now at level 39. It just takes a while.<P>Generally, since mana song, groups are happy to have me. Most groups find that the addition of a bard makes a huge difference in down time. I do not have experience with 50+ fights but I can group effectively with up to level 49. Occasionally, I run into a group that has a really stupid player, like a ranger or a cleric who wants to nuke, then the bard doesnt make so much difference.<P>SO maybe the enhancements are<BR>1) Reduce taunt on some defensive songs or reduce natural taunt. Except for damage songs and healing, the monster just doesn't recognize the effect because it's subtle?<BR>2) Lullaby just doesnt seem playable. Perhaps if it nixed hate list?<BR>3) Increase defensive skill<BR>4) Songs that have a dual check against mob are resisted too often and messages are confusing so it is difficult to tell what happened. Make it so either the spell is resisted or not and change the formula so it's not successive tests. Just one random against both combined. <P>Tzinger on Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Problem1 : We overlap so much with Enchanters that we are "useless" when they are around. <P>Why? They got the mana to keep all their hastes/mezzes and buffs going all the time. Seems like ye guys at Verant gave a tad too little manacost to these lines. <P>Solution : It should be so that the Chanters had to choose between what to do, not just be able to do it all.<P>Solution 2: Try find a class defining ability that we can rely on when Chanters do it all. (This aint easy). <BR>1) Our snare has been discussed, reconsider its failure rate.<BR>2) mana drain as our speciality?<P>Problem2 : When we feel useless with chanters around, the highlevel Bards feel that the damage dealing we then resort to is mediocre. We do roughly 30 dam/sec with 3 DoTs at lvl 51-53 ish. <P>Solution : <P>a) clarify how much damage the other melee classes do per second on normal mobs. Rogues do some 60-80 dam/sec, do indeed warriors do 40-50 dam/sec, monks 60-70 dam/sec? (Reported by lvl 60 know-it-all players).<P>b) based on a) scale bard song damage to fit in. We now do 30 dam/sec. We should be able to do as much damage as a warrior if we focus ONLY on damage dealing.<P>Please note that I find it strange that a) damage rates to be real (I know the Rogue one is, but the others!!), cause if they are, I just dont see what casters do in this game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Problem 3: Too few instruments<P>Solution : add more medium-level instruments. Come on, this could add a new dimension to the bard game!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hehe, I'm not even a bard, but i have a balance Thing I'd like to adress.  When I read the rogue talks, their was constant complaining on the epic weapon.  When someone said that it was too easy.  YOu suggested that perhaps you should add another harder quest for the epic.  I agree with this 100%.  But if you give 2 "epic" quest items to rogues, wouldn't it be logical to give 2 such quests to bards too?  I mean, monks' gloves give them the ablity to use 2 epic weapons (in the sence, that you count fists as the weapons), and if rogues get it (which like I said, I agree with...Ragebringer...doesn't look that cool at all), then I just think its right that bards should get another one.

</FONT><HR>In reguard to twisting issues. There seems to me to be one great overriding issue that requires attention.<P>Bard must twist to be viable.<P>We've made you well aware that because of the inconsistent nature of the internet, twisting is difficult to impossible when we are not playing under the best of connection  connections (ping/latency/packet loss).<P>What I have not seen mentioned is this.<P>You can not twist on machines close to the minimum hardware spec for eq.<P>With every feature turned off(clipping, particles...) on my 300mhz/voodoo 2, there are still many times where I just don't have the frame rate to keep twisting (2-3 songs) up.<P>For those who do not play on mid/lower end machines... The ability to interact with the interface is tied directly to your frame rate. You have to wait for the spell button to play the whole animation to click on it again. On my machine this can take a full second or two depending. If there are more than a few creatures on screen it can be a truely horrific experience.<BR>The box is significantly faster than the minimum spec. The connection is normally fair to good. Still I am not able to play a bard. And the reason is purely technical.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i think the 15th ae mez song and the snare song should work 100 percent of the time  BUT on only 2 conditions..<P>the ae mez song should for the most part work 90 percent of the time, because we are tied up doing that song.  90 percent with an instrument.  and about 40-50 percent without an instrument.  as it is, with an instrument, i cant keep a bat mezed at level 20.  to make sure bards dont play other songs while using it, give it a 90-100 percent chance to break after 5 seconds.. so that at least the song is useful. we couldnt keep them permanently mezed because eventually our health would run out. <P>the snare song, i dont have this song yet, but i think this song should work 100 percent of the time.. rangers snare does.  but to make it so that bards dont do much else while using this song, make it so the song ties the bard up.  so that he has to play only one song.. make it work 100 percent of the time, but make it wear off after 5 seconds.  <P>most bard songs last very short periods of time, so i never understood why you make them so easy to resist or fail.  after all at most a bard can do is 3 effects on a party.. but i would be happy if these crowd controll spells would tie up the bard so that he only does 1 song..wouldnt be unbalancing. it would be like the bard is casting on the person every 4 seconds.. and would do alot of taunt.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sapper: "Steevin: Who the hell are you? Have you ever grouped with me? Apparently not. Are you so mentally weak and emotionally immature that you have to attack others to make your point? Well, I can make some negative inferences about your background and playing style from your ignorant comments about mine, but I wont."<BR>------------------------<BR>Funny. I say you don't play your Bard well, you attack me personally by calling names, and then say you won't do that the very next sentence. I'm convinced.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> <BR>But wait, you proved it again, and also reflected the very point that needs to be made.<BR>------------------------<BR>Sapper: "I die a lot becuase I am usually taking the rear of the formation to insure that everyone is in radius of my run song."<BR>------------------------<BR>I've never died that way. Run song with a drum is faster than any mob in the game. Even in last place, you're still running faster than the mobs.<BR>------------------------<BR>Sapper: "You know as well as I, that when the group loses control, for whatever reason, the Mobs go for the Bard first."<P>Sapper: "But the bottom line is, if a Bard is DOING his JOB, he (or she) will be one of the first to die if things get out of control."<BR>------------------------<BR>Not true. In any group, if the rest of the group isn't doing their job, then somebody is going to die, and usually it's the healer first. However, the healer has the sense to take care of themselves. This brings me to my point.<BR>------------------------<BR>Sapper: "I can usually take solace in the fact that I bought time for the rest of the party to run to safety."<P>Sapper: "But pre 40, [bard binding] would certainly help the Bard to get cycled back into the fight quicker"<P>Sapper: "I die because in a fight, I am doing what I can for the group, and thus pissing the mob off."<P>Dalakar_Daystar: "Often, If my group is in trouble, I'll fire up one of my super aggro-AoE songs, or, these days, start charming and mezzing left and right, and tell everyone to get the hell out of there. Assuming they obey me, I'm left with a bunch of mobs ticked off at me, the HP of a pure caster/priest type, and probably not enough AC to offset that ... A Well-played Bard dies often, so that his group may live. And most of my regular grouping partners will back this up, The Bard dies first."<P>Sapper: "Thanks for trying to tell me what the balance issues are for MY character you egotistical jugheads"<BR>------------------------<BR>Says it all right there doesn't it?  YOU are the egotists.  You players who play Bards like that are defining the role of the Bard that way, and expect Verant to get in line with your egotistical way of thinking.<P>Who said that because Bard's are a benefit to the group that they should be the END ALL BE ALL of group members?  You take the fall for the group because you CHOOSE to, not by being a Bard.  You think you're so special because you're a Bard, and in being a Bard you can gain respect by sacrificing yourself for the group over and over because that's a Bard's job.  Sorry, you are dead wrong, all pun intended.<P>You, and people like you, die because of the way you play your character, not because you play a Bard.  I could just as easily take an enchanter and say the same thing, or a cleric, or a warrior.  I could taunt every single mob onto me and die for the group so they can get away.  Doesn't make me a group god, just makes me dead.<P>You people want Bards to be absolutely indispensible, and that is not balance.  I'm not an advocate of running away when things go bad, not at all, but why not look at what happens when a caster is in a group and things go bad because the group fails to do their job.  He gates out if he can.  Does this mean he abandoned the group?  No.  It means he saved himself from a bad situation created by the other players.  Some players have to run to the zone; a benefit of being a caster is gating out of a fight gone bad.<P>Bards are not the captains of the ship, they don't go down with it while everyone else gets to safety.  YOU, the player, play like that.  It's a very egotistical attitude.  It isn't all your fault that the fight went bad, and therefore isn't your responsibility to make sure that everyone but you gets to safety. That's not your job, but you make it your job.<P>Your codependant attitude gets you killed, not being a Bard.  I'm sure that everyone on your server "love" to play with you, not because you play your Bard with skill, but because they know you'll take the dive for the team no matter what.<P>A lot of the people posting here have that attitude, so you are not alone.  Fine, go ahead and play that way.  It doesn't hurt me at all.  I've never been in a group that demanded a Bard go down for the group.  I've never been in a group that chastised a Bard for not taking the fall.  You are creating that atmosphere for yourself, and it actually doesn't affect me or give a 'bad' name to Bards as a whole because most people want somebody to play with skill, not take the fall for the good of the team when things go bad.  Nobody expects that.<P>YOU build an expectation that YOU are going to save the day, because YOU are SO SPECIAL that YOU can do it, and if YOU don't do it, then, in YOUR mind, the group would be upset at YOU because YOU failed to live up to the expectation that YOU created in YOUR mind.<P>Get off your high horse people. Bards are not intended to be so much better at being a group member that a group would be so much worse off without them versus some other class.  That's not balance, that's ego, and lack of self-confidence (read: lack of skill), pure and simple.<P>Who am I?  I'm a Bard people want to have in their group.  I take the dive for the team if the team is good and we have bad luck and I can do something about it. I play my Bard very well, but I'm not so self-important that I put myself on some pedastal that the group just couldn't work without me there.  <P>Some people like me, some don't, and there's nothing I can do about that except be myself, play my character well, and be fun to be around.  I don't go out of my way to make people like me by taking a dive for the team everytime.  People like me because of who I am and how well I play my character.  Hard workers are liked by people because they do their job, and do it well. <P>You are overcompensating your own importance in a group for your lack of skill at doing your job.  That is the definition of mental weakness, emotional immaturity, and being an egotistical jughead.  <P>Have a nice day!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to say thanks to VI for having these forums to help balance classes... that said... <BR>Im not gonna repeat everything thats been said already... I agree with some haste slow stacking ideas and also disagree with defense skill increase as we dont and should tank or get hit much except when agroed by songs... now lets look at the bigger issue...How do bards really compare to other Hybrids and other classes in general...<BR>1st lets us compare our melee ability<BR>raise atleast 1 weapon base skill to either match or be close to warr and rogues...after all rogues who maily use piercing weapons have higher skill caps for all weapons... warr of course should do this... solution give us 1 weapon type that we are very good at... raise out duel wield skill, we are 40pts lower than rangers... close this gap a bit.. give us double attack that caps at 100...<BR>raise hps some.... come on i feel like a caster in bard clothing... a necro with mana skin can take as much dmg as us...<BR>2cd issue compare to other hybrids we seem a bit weak from the song versus spell prospective<BR>look at it like this... bards get invis that can invis self and group only... rangers and SK's get invis... in exchange for no mana we trade the abitily to cast on others and we have to use a flute.. god forbid a group members gets out of range... Snare.... well rangers and Sk's can do this pallys can root we cant... what do we get a manaless snare that just doesnt hold up to the standard... manaless well snare and a basic dark spell can snare em just fine and cheap too... oh and forget using that with a druid that has ES gaunts...<BR>3rd healsong/manasong ... manasong is meant to be a downtime song but in a balanced group downtime isnt long between pops and pulls... so really manasong is really and parttime worker... while clarity works around the clock... healsong well its a good free heal if im sitting by myself... but in a group people would rather me play manasong and let the cleric heal... possilbe solutions raise manasong and healsong... maybe make the increase instrument dependent...<BR>ok next issue... mezz and charm... first off... in the vision of the bard i think this got outta hand from the beggining ... this is the purest from of one class stepping on another classes toes.. why verant.. I think the majority of bards dont want the job, never asked for the job... i hear all these bards asking for changes the mezz and charm... leave it alone.. get rid of it... as it stands enchanters do it better, do it right and should not have to worry about bards becoming better at it than them...<BR>Please read this part!!<BR>Verant ask yourself... what is a bard???<BR>Jack of all trades, master of none??<BR>impossible from a balance standpoint...in a game of specialist... Cleric = Healing... Shaman = buff debuff... Warr/monk/rogue = melee Dmg... Enchanter = crowd control/haste.... you leave a bard who doesnt do anything well or better than other no role to play.... Fix is simple dont waste yourtime trying to change songs or create news ones... we are or were suppose to be a hybrid<BR>and hybrids are tanks with casting abilities... raise or melee skill to compare to hybrids, fix a few song stacking issues.... get rid of some usless songs ( there are so many) .... then we will be balanced<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I'd like to put in a general perspective here.  My main is a 55th lvl enchanter but recently i've been playing my Bard quite a bit (just hit lvl 31).  What I really enjoy about the Bard is his versatility, he can solo and he can group...both effectively.  What I fear is that in trying to make all classes entirely dependant on grouping that it's going to rob the fun out of the class as it did for my enchanter.  I enjoy grouping...but lets face it, if you're 50+ you can't just group for an hour.  You litteraly NEED to have at least a few hours to play.  That's ok but what ends up happening is if i don't have a full 8 hours to spare I can't really play my enchanter because he's SO group orientated.  I've heard many people refer to Bards post 50 as "batteries"  (for mana, hp, etc) and i'm already dreading that.  I suppose at that point i'll retire from EQ.<BR>What i'm asking is keep the class of Bards balanced...let us have the ability to both solo and group throughout the levels.  An example of how this has been nerfed is by raising the mana cost of charm from 5mana to 40mana.  Why?  To prevent charm soloing I suppose.  I appreciate Verant's position of making EQ a group dependant enviornment.  But I think it's been taken to an extreme.  Grouping is always going to be required for Dungeons and Plane Raids, epic quests, etc. And I think that's a good thing...don't get me wrong I like grouping.  But why steal away the ability to occasionally solo?<P>Anyway the reason i'm bringing this up in the bard balancing forum is because most of the feedback i'm seeing is all group orientated.  Also because at least at lvl 31 I'm really enjoying the freedom of not being forced to but LFG up as soon as I log on.  I sincerely hope that doesn't change as the levels progress.  Thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow. What an excellent argument.<P>"Adding a bard to a group of 5 should increase their power MORE than any other class, not LESS."<P>We are, like the enchanter and the shaman, not a damage output/absorption class, but a group support class.  Enchanters are better at damage output and crowd control, as well as increasing mana recovery.  Shamans are better at damage output, healing, and buffing.  Both shaman and enchanter buffs, once cast, have no limitations beyond time.  A shaman can buff up all warriors of the party and not have to worry about it again for 20 mins to an hour.  Which means that he can pile on buffs, and THEN blast and debuff the enemy, and heal the party.  Enchanters buff some, blast VERY well, and have excellent crowd control.   <BR>While Bard songs do not use mana (mostly) the other limitations they suffer from are much greater.  They must be twisted to be effective, which adds physical strain to playing a bard, as well as a susceptibility to increasingly common lag.  It also means a bard can either run 3 buffs, or 2 buffs and a crowd control or 1 buff, a crowd control, and a Damage Shield.  A real problem.  Further, bard buffs are very limited in range.  A SOW or levitate as an enchantment is great for the whole party. The bard songs that do the same require constant attention to avoid losing party members.  Literally in the case of the levitate song.  <BR>Whether haste is made to stack or not, bard songs must be at least 2/3 the power of caster spells of the same level.  The range limitations of the buffs, and the 3 song twist limitation put the lie to the idea that because they dont cost mana bard songs must be kept weak.<P>Either bard damage must be brought up to near parity with other classes, or their buffs/crowd control must be brought to near parity. The defensive increases suggest that there is some confused idea that bards will take on more of a melee role, but even if defense is increased, bards are still hopelessly deficient in 1)Damage dealing 2)Good AC items 3)HPs when compared with other classes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine with that too.&lt;&lt;<P>Playing an Enchanter is complicated, yet lots of people play them.  Playing a Bard is *annoying*.  There's a difference.<P>To get the full utility out of a Bard's spells, you have to move and/or click the mouse at least once per 3 seconds.  This works out to almost one million motions in a month of played time.  And this does not include the "advanced" techniques involving instrument juggling.  We joke about carpal tunnel syndrome, but this game is actually injuring some people.  That's really not funny.<P>I would assume that most people who play games such as EQ instead of Quake, etc. do so because they enjoy the "complexity" and strategy aspects rather than the "twitch" skills used in the other games.  In addition, I would assume that one of your main goals in programming should be to help people with slower connections enjoy the game as much as possible.<P>I understand it will take some re-coding, but if twisting songs is supposed to be part of the game, there really should be a way to just select three songs and have them played automatically.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To recap on some previous posts that I agreed with:<P>JackFetch - Stated that a self on melee buff song would be great at the higher levels alowing Bards to be more effective Melee'ers at high levels.<P>JackFetch - Certain classes make Bards unnecissary, or of minimal value. This reminds me of Rangers, Paladins and SK, who are weaker than their caster counter parts, but make up for it in being able to tank and deal a significant amount of melee damage and spell damage. But many of their spells, (skins for ranger) are never used at mid to high levels unless they are soloing. Our songs are like this, we dont use our haste songs if our counter part shaman or enchanters are in a group, or slow songs, or much of anything else. The bummer here is that our dots and dds do not do anywhere near as much damage (or heal as fast) as the other hybrids, and to top it off we have lower defense and hps as they have. Our balance when compared to hybrids is way off set which is why Bards have a problem when their counter parts show up, unlike a paladin, SK or Ranger, we have no way to make up for it, no dds, weak melee damage, and no real tankability.<P>RFaul - Stated that charm should not take mana. My 27th level charm song doesnt take much but I think RFaul was refering to post 35 songs. I agree with him, the use of mana is the one thing that is considered a benefit when playing a bard, yet all of the negatives remain, 3 tick time limit, low level spell effect limitations, Higher fizzle rate, etc.<P>Taenia-BT - Stacking Haste songs, at early levels I would agree that these should stack more effectivly, at higher levels other players tend to get their caps met so it doesnt matter that much.<P>Iwave24 - Bards are mana bateries, just as enchanters feel they are mana hoses so shall we feel the burn. I would like to see bards benefit a group more than being a mana hose just as enchanters are more than mana bateries.<P>Mechmagma - Connection speeds efect the power of a bard. Slow connection limit the twisting ability, and can often get you killed as a bard. I know this seems lame, I have created some hot keys that when clicked the sing various songs in a pattern. This may fix some peoples problems, but I have a fast connection so I would not know for sure.<P><BR>Some issues that I believe are invalid, or need info:<P>Desbarolis - Bard soloing is limited when they hit 15 to 30. I totaly disagree, I have been able to solo effectivly from 1-35. Not the entire time, but at each level I soloed at least a few mobs on my own. But I disagree with bards soloing in the first place.<P>IronPants - Invis song causes critters attacking you group to agro on you. This is because you are trying to cast a beneficial spell on a group member. I learned this at level 20 when hunting aviaks in sk. If the monk got to close to our group before FD'ing, my song would agro the mobs on to me. I see this as a acceptable situation, and a necissary problem.<P>Yakikorosu - On issue D, the bug that you experienced exists when you get a large amount of lag. To fix it you can also zone. It is a bug that has existed for at least a year now.<P><BR>Bard Nefing - I wont tell you how to bend the least played class over, but I will say that Bards soloability is very viable up to level 35.<P>Bard Balancing - Make bards as effective in a group as a Paladin is in a group with a cleric(Ranger/Druid), (SK/Necro). I wont give you specifics as there are many great ideas already on this board. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just needed to respond to the previous post before my last one:<P>Kopema hit it on the head. Bards are no stop activity on the users side. A warrior hits the a key and then periodicly taps kick slam taunt or whatever. Bards swap instuments, and weapons with a mouse, and then have to click songs on and off every 4 seconds. If they miss a song, it screws everything up, but a warrior only looses a few seconds if they dont kick or whatever, its not like it greys out if they dont use it in 15secs.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I may be playing this class, which I absolutely love and wouldn't trade for anything in the world with the probable exception of a shadowknight, wrong, but I have to say that I've had a hard time from level 21 and through 24 (which is my current level). For one, I feel useless in a group. I can't tank because i'm constanly missing, I can't buff because there's usually a shaman in the group, and I can't heal. So what do I do? Bellow. No, for some reason, defense and attack go down. It may be a natural occurence, but I see it as bad, especially when I'm trying to heal the casters and something attacks me.<BR> So what do I do? Solo. If no group out there wants me, and that is more likely to happen, I have no choice but to solo. But I can't fight, so I kite. I hate it when all i have is bellow and speed and snare. Fighting would really come in handy.<BR> Also, Lulluby is ineffiecient. Lament is too especially when higher mobs gather in groups of 4 or more. By the time the last one is mezzed, the first one is free to go. <BR> finally, somewhat off topic, I'm a wood elf and my cap for foraging is 50. Ok, in that perspective, it's ridiculous. Wood=nature. Nature elf. Nature=Forage. Now Bards are supposed to be traveling creatures. What if there's no food? Forage, but forage is at 50 and the chances of getting something are very bad. Not a very important skill to focus on, but something to consider.<P>Recap:<BR>1. More resourcefulness in groups.<BR>2. More defense and attack<BR>3. Look into Lullubye and any other mezz song.<BR>4. (but not as important) Raising foraging cap.<P>also, and this is totally wacked, a song we can use only once a day or every two days where we can bind or gate. Just something wacky, but useful, off the top of my head. ;p</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I got some Ideas to deal with the effectiveness of bards for groups with enchanter or shaman:<BR>Make the songs variable:<P>If there is already a haste buff on a target and so the bard song wouldnt stack then the bard song should be automatically changed into a stat modifier like ATK (instead of 50 percent haste - 50 points ATK)<P>And if there is a slowed Mob and the bards song would normally do nothing or screw everything up, the bard slow-song should reduce the AC of the target for 50 points then instead of the 50 percent slow (which does not take effect because the target is slowed by a shaman or enchanter already). <P>These changes would allow a Bard to do much more in a group with chanter or shaman !<P>Dont know if this idea comes to late, but would like to get response or comments on this idea.<P>Thanx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why is it that I can be having incredible fun in a group, but as soon as an enchanter joins the group, I become so useless? I actually try to avoid guild groups now because there is an enchanter in the guild about my level who always comes along. This shouldn't happen!<BR>Why should enchanters be the masters of SO many INVALUABLE facets of gameplay - Magic resist debuffing, hastes, damage absorbtion, mana-regen, mezz, charms, mana-drains, and a complete monopoly on arguably the most useful (and perhaps the most profitable) tradeskill. And don't forget, 2nd best on slows and stuns and debuffs, by a small margin. I am NOT asking for enchanters to be nerfed...thats not the way. But it infuriates me that whenever I group with an enchanter I am reduced to being very very useless. Its not just that our spells dont stack, the enchanter's spells are VASTLY AND IN EVERY WAY SUPERIOR. How is this balance? Enchanters may complain at being reduced to buffing machines in Velious...but at least the buffs are the best and most valuable available. <BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some more points etc..<P>(1) Selos in dungeons. Suspect that the reason this is 'nerfed' is because of corpsing that would occur with FAST trains to zone, and is for the good of all. Could get a self-only version but not sure worth it or have room for such a song.<P>(2) In reply to a rather ill response above. I don't think Bard should be the first to be corpsed, in some groups in some areas this is the case, but its no part of being a bard. <P>(3) For all i know at high levels, post 50, bard maybe balanced regards power etc, however it is certainly clear that others, not just bards, think otherwise. This is a poor reward for anyone who starts at lvl 1 with the aim of being a social player or having at least one social char. And really this is the poor.<P>(4) I would rather Verant solved the quality of connection problem than 'fix' songs or for that matter balance the class. Frankly my bard degrades considerably with weak connections. I suspect this is more so that any other class.<BR>A solution could be a non-twisting song variety that has an obvious effect and is considered highly useful in high level groups.<P>(5) The bard song screwing other classes up because they can't target as well because of the constant name popping. Hey Verant fix this!!! Its not a gameplay issue its your screw-up. You obvious 'test/balance' the class in isolation.<BR>Why are you making bards unpopular with some classes like this, are bards by there nature intended to annoy hell out casters?! Fix it, it appears technically easy. And you have no excuse.<P>One thing is for sure, if the bard class is preceived as being of little use in high-level groups then Verant have done a great dis-service to alot of people. Bards are groupies all through there levels -- or at least more than ANY other class-- to achieve ungroupiness at high level is going to rip a few people off, no matter how well balanced the class is.<P>Lastly all should remember that a good player of any class is worth much more that a bad player of any class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I can do some 7,5 dam/sec this way, which is more or less what a good melee can produce of damage. BBB is USELESS. It does like 10 dam for one song. DDD does 60 (!!!!) for one song (3 tics) in 18 seconds. All it costs you is to juggle in the Horn for 2 seconds. So DDD is 6x as powerful as BBBellow. Do you have any idea how much each song adds to your damage production, and decide from this? Are you aware that you most likely outdamage ANYBODY in your group on 2 mobs? With instruments only? If not, check out this site for the tools for just that..: http://home.c2i.net/toream/Filer/Bard<P>3) My songs are very versatile. Just using the lvl 20 slow is a huge thrill for me; Slowing mobs 28% is ultra powerful!<P>4) WORST CASE: With an enchanter/shaman in the group, my Anthem and Slow falls out, but I still go full AE in most situations. On ADD mobs, I have to turn them off (mezzed extras), this is the only situation where I feel truly restrained. If there is no Chanter, I go AE songs on 2 - 3 mobs, and do so much more damage than ANYBODY else. (Jup I know the problems with tanking, it hurts a lot  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>In a worst case scenario (Enchanter, 2 or more mobs), I do Warsong(pitiful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">), (slow?) & twist in Lute on Hymn fex. There is always the Hymn with lute to fall back on when you are completely useless...<P>Educate your group, tell them to share the damage to utilize your Group heal. I hate it when the main tank is taking all the punishment, that is dumb usage of HP group regen. Tell them that you go AE Instruments only on 2 mobs and that it is ok, it allows the Wizard to pull out the BIG cannon, which is his AEs. (Druids, rangers, mages, Wizards & YOU got AE spells! Go AE tactics, its AWESOME!!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).<P>Crap, I am totally off course here; Alan, my bottom line is : <P>a) we are fine at lower levels.<P>b) we need to have decent damage dealing when a chanter in group (the 3 DoTs), see to that these are balanced in the 50+ game ok?<P>c) you went overboard with Enchanters. They can do ALL their things comfortably. They should need to CHOOSE between their tools. When was the last time I heard an enchanter say OOM? Dunno, never?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im going to post something here that may not be that popular of an idea, but we'll see.  It seems that the bard has falen into the Hybrid type of classification for classes.  Then brings to question, if the bard is a hybrid, what is he a hybrid of?  In other words, what two classes is the bard made of?  I won't pretend to know what Verants vision of a bard is, but i will say that it seems that the majority of bard players want to be part Rogue and part Enchanter.  Now i don't mean for bards to be recreated so that we get enchanter songs at lvl 9 and use mana and such nonsense.  What i mean is that when we look at what we want a bard to do we should, perhaps look at these two classes.  In melee we dont need higher HP or something like that.  I dont want to be able to take more damage, i want to be able to AVOID more damage.  So something like increased dodge parry and riposte skills would be nice, also another skill like dance that works like dodge might be nice, call it dance.  Also up melee damage just a tad....no too much, maybe raise dual wield a bit and put in a faily low double attack, at high lvls, just makes sure its not so low as to be useless.  Secondly increase the utility of are spells, but sepcifically in the direction of the enchanter.  Give us a a single target mez song at a lower lvl.....somewhere between 15-10 would be nice, that will work on just about anything an enchanters mez will work on, now there are two ways to restrict this song if it must be done<BR>1) Make it instrument only and make the duration exactly the length it takes to pulse so that the bard MUST keep playing the song to keep the MOB mezzed, very low resist on this would be nice, perhaps add a MR debuff on it so that it has a chance of getting resisted intially but after it sticks it is not resisted.<BR>2)  Make it almost unreistable for a decent lvl range around the bards lvl, like 5 higher than the bards lvl or lower.  Now make it so the song only mezzes for a certain number of pulses.  Make the number of pulses equal to about half the time an enchanter can keep a MOB mezzed, we know each pulse is about 6 seconds  so the math is farily easy.  If we want a bard to be able to keep a MOB mezzed for 60 seconds (just an example) then we would have the mez drop after 10 pulses of the song.  Keep like some sort of ticker buff on the MOB, shouldn't be too hard.<BR>Wow that was really long, so ill just throw out some suggestions for other songs.  <BR>Charm song- NO MANA USE, instrument only, very short casting range, low resist, makes it somewhat useful if you have a good group but hard to solo withas you have to stay close to your charmed MOB and if you want to attack something else you have to get close to it.<BR>Snare song- Please make it at least stop runners, thats all i ask, and it should resist less please, runners= dead groups.<P><BR>Basically we would be able to play the role of Enchanter if there is none in the group, but also be able to melee, much like a rogue if an enchanter is present.  The limiting factors is that it would be VERY difficult to do both at the same time, and you would have as powerful skills as both, just close enough to be a good addition to a group, is the player is good, and an excellent addition to a group in the case of an excellent player.<P><BR>All in all I love my bard and if none of my ideas get used, I won't care just so that my beautiful bard is fun to play all her life.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not just group members?  If a bard could buff an entire raid party with resists, and or hit all 12 casters there with mana songs, it would be a reason to have them on a big raid.  Perhaps upgrades to songs at high levels that are not group specific, but have a little bit lower bonuses?  A "guild" manasong that regened 2/3 the mana of the regular mana song, or a "guild" resist buff that raised resists 2/3 as much as the regular resist song.<P>Fiznar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually thinking about it- simpler coding would be....<P>Okay- Bards can have 3 songs playing.<BR>You can't start a 4th song.<P>This would be trivial to program and achieve the same affect.<P>Code would involve changing the code to which checks that another song isn't playing to check that three other songs were not playing.  No other code changes needed except something ot make sure you couldn't twist a 3/4 slot.<P>I think the idea of a good haste song which didn't stack and a poor haste song which did stack would be great.  You could make a low level song (L11-L19) with poor haste (5%) which stacked.  This low level stackable haste would give groups a reason to pull in Bards. Then make high level haste songs (L40+) which didn't stack.<P>As an enchanter, I drool over the idea of having a bard in my group.  I have to work around them a bit (the fact that they constantly retarget me to them is an issue) but clarity does stack with mana song in the correct order and then you have almost unlimited mana L45-L52 (after that it is still fast- just not fast enough.

</FONT><HR>Resists<P>Resists are what are annoying me.  Even when against blue mobs.  In the fort in Fonrtier Mountains against blue giants (and in many other places) I was virtually useless as most of my offensive spells were resisted.  I could but give a little haste to the party, a little heal (I heal 11, giant hits for 50+, repeat) and some other small buffs.  Could hardly snare/debuff them (resists), not allowed to charm them - was useless.  It doesn't matter how mana cheap our songs are, if you can't use them because of too many resists.  You simply have to forget them, which means there is not real point to having them in the first place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My main concern is all this about animations.  Being only 21 I haven't run into all these ill- effective problems yet so have nothing to say.  I'm just wondering why on Earth (or Norath) you care waht you look like?  If the song does it's stuff and so does the instrument I couldn't care less how I appear.  One thing I would however like looked at is Lullaby.  Granted we are not Enchanters we still should have a usable song.  As of yet i really can't find a use for Lullaby as without an instrument it is almost worthless and with an instrument you still need to keep it going all the time thus reducing one of our main abilities, twisting, to almost nil.  Also we are veiwed as atleast partial tanks yet we die so quickly there is not a chance.  At lvl 21 i should have aver 490 somthing if you want me to tank.  Also i like this whole theory of our songs stacking with all caster buffs.  In my expiereince we are much more of a grouping class than a soloing class and therefore shouldnt detract in any way from a group.  <BR>         My last thing is this.  Please give us somthing worth casting as far as dmg goes if you are going to call us a caster.  currently i do a max of 11 dmg with Bellow and you call me a caster?  So I can sing some nice haste buffs and heal when the Cleric is oom.  All casters can atleast do some significant dmg.  Also anyone responding "Well what about the DOTs?" is slightly confused.  I rarely use any of the DOT soloing or grouped because they are AOE.  I have actually gotten several groups killed because I was singing these and brought to many MOBs to play with us.  As my major point I mainly agree about the whole all songs stacking with caster buffs as we are so much weaker than the buff yet considered major grouping people.  <BR> Just my 2 cp<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

When playing this song with a wind instrument my faction jumps exactly how it should but it does not affect the price at which merchants will buy/sell things.  If they are amiable to me (instead of apprehensive), shouldn't I get those prices instead of the same base price I get when not playing the song?

</FONT><HR> I have playued my bard off and on for almost a year and he is 35 songs now. I cannot play him all the time because my wrists hurt to play him right I hot key 3 songs and one hand for switching weapons, I am doing switch every 3 secs half with hand switch too. MY hand actually goes numb after a few hours of play now. So I had to make some other characters to switch with. I really think we should be able to twist without the repetition. No other character has one quarter the things we do. maybe make only non resisted songs last longer so only one song has to be renewed constantly. Also do bards really have to play in battle a lute or flute? why not be singing fighters who encuruage the group through song? Is that so bad? I hardly ever get hit and I pull alot so defense isn't what I would like better singing, haste, shields, stack ability, Snag that lasts like the rest all but warriors and rogues have root snag we should have it working for us too. Make the new song 34 as strong as the singles so we can twist less I get more out of twisting the old mana heal. Also I have tested all the continents for the ability to twist kunark 2 songs velious 2 songs old continent 3 songs I have a dial up connection but ten feet from switch box connect at 48000 all the time. My cpu is 650 with 128 ram and nvidia gforce video I cannot twist three most of the time other bards cant either but with the time frame of songs we should be able to. The twist is what makes us better and our inability do to high pops on servers and lagg makes us worth alot less.<BR>At 3 am I can twist 3 hmmmmm. Some times anyway low lagg areas alot more success. If you really want to help us eliminate corpul tunnel change the twist for us make more stackable fix snare as good as any, raise pre twisted songs to same as the singles, Make singing battle songs better so we can do more help with offense.
