</FONT><HR>Being that my primary is a Ranger i have a counterpoint or 2 to bring up Absor and i hope i can be objective here.<P>"""Illusion gender, I don't know why that couldn't be done. I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of the things that determines how NPCs react to you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or she might very easily be able to travel anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that we want. I'd never heard the idea of Illusion Pet. It's interesting, though I wonder how odd you'd look… """"<P>     i thought this was what illusions were all about?  Ie: Invis.. things dont see you (most)... some do... thats the risk of using it.  Cant this also be true for illusions?  Counterbalance on verant part......&gt;&gt;&gt;  Remove the invis line...  Would chanters trade invis and invis undead for the right to mimic any mob?  with a failure chance similar to invis being seen?  Increased randomlness in the form?  Random "you feel like yourself again"??  Wouldnt this be the same effect and more "fun" for chanters?<P>"""The trick is how we use it, and would we rather give one class a new illusion, or create a whole new race? """"<P>The new race all the way... good point Absor.I've never heard that…<P>"""My personal opinion is that enchanters shouldn't have any undead illusions, that should all be left to the necros and their type. But I've never heard anyone say that spectres cause lag… I'll ask about that."""<P>This strikes me as odd Absor and im sure im misinterpreting what you are thinking but if the dead should be left to the Necros et al.... Shouldnt the illusions be left to the people that mess with minds?  IE Chanters and to some extent... bards? (i could see a bard getting illusions more than i understand druids/wolf, shaman/bear.  Is this the same logic or am i reading this poorly?<P>"""<BR>That is, of course, pretty silly. For every Verant employee that plays one class, there are as many that play another. We don't favor any class. """<P>Are there any Rangers LOL?  They certainly arent favoured...  (OUCH.. said id not bring that up.... moving on LOL)<P>""""Actually, I think the bear was already global, but I don't know, I'll find out.""""  <BR> <BR>A fire beetle.... a moss snake....  all global arent they?  I dont see a balance issue with Enchanters being immune to Fire Beetle agro do i? LOL  SARCASM on:  "We dont want level 50 Enchanters being immune to Fire Beetle agro so we cant give them that illusion"  sarcasm OFF   that was just for fun... which is what the original poster is after i think... not balance.. fun.<P><BR>""""Again, my personal opinion would have it so that only druids and shamans were to get nature-type transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique factor with them, and not giving it to enchanters. Again, that's my personal feeling on it. I'll see if I can get an official response for you on the reasons why. But don't discount the whole uniqueness thing, it's important.""""<P>I think you hit the nail on the head here Absor.  The word TRANSFORMATION..... Druids gain the Wolf abilities.... the Shaman get the Bears strength etc.... an illusion is just that.... it LOOKS like a bear... but chanters wouldnt get the BONUSES that go with the TRANSFORMATION...  see what i mean.,....  Illusion/TRansformation... 2 different things.  That being said... WEREWOLF form gives you VERY good bonuses....  i doubt chanters would trade off the bonuss involved in that lovely addition for the sake of an illusion.  Tough call here IMO....<P><BR>""""I agree, that spreading abilities out to too many classes dulls the class lines, and that's a bad thing in a class-based roleplaying game.""""<P>I think you came on board too late to stop this Absor....  Whats done is done.<P>""""There is no policy about not upgrading enchanters. I think you are doing yourself a disservice by believing that there is. I also think that you are putting too much importance on what a magician pet looks like.""""<P>I think this is in reference to the comments that Rangers ETC should stop complaining because nothing more would be done... the class was balanced (Abashi has stated this on a few occasions)<P><BR>In closing Absor...  thank you for responding....  I hope the original poster got answers... good or bad at least she got answers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, let's get the facts straight:<P>1. Enchanters (Masters of illusion) do not get any Group illusion spells.  Druids (Not masters of illusion) get a group illusion spell that has some nice effects.<P>2. Enchanters do not get any new illusions in the SoV expansion.  Shamans get a new illusion.<P>3. Enchanters, (masters of enchanting people, places and things) do not get any spells to make weapons magic.  Rangers, on the other hand, get a whole new line of spells.<P>4. The one new spells that comes close to being a new illusion (though it is the same old illusion just able to cast on other people) is near worthless in it's duration, recast time and level limit of the target.<P>5. All pets get fixed so that weapons are no longer needed for the pets to dual wield, except the enchanter pets.<P>6. compared to other classes, the new Enchanter SoV expansion spells suck.  We get a spell that adds 50 mana.  woohooo!  That is not even enough for my low level nuke.  Boon of Garou that lasts only 6 minutes and will not cast on anyone lower then 44.  A mana stealing spell that takes 2 minutes to give only 120 mana.  Great after my entire party is dead and I am running around with a very angry mob on me, after 2 minutes, I might be able to stop to cast one nuke.<P><BR>Just face it.  Enchanters are ALWAYS getting the crappy end of the stick and nothing we do or anyone else does will ever change that as long as we have these Enchanter hating, Necro loving, game balancing wizards that call themselves Verant employees.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Reguarding the illusion spectre, this is what were told before from casterrealm's archive.<P>DEATH DOES NOT BECOME YOU, MAY 1, 2000 <BR>Source: Everquest Gameplay Forums.<P>Can Enchanters have Illusion: Spectre? <BR>Though we certainly appreciate everyone's desire to look "cool", we don't want to open this model up to player characters. <P>- Gordon <P><BR>ILLUSION SPECTRE, MAY 4, 2000 <BR>Source: Everquest Gameplay Forum.<P>Abashi recently stated that enchanters aren't going to get the spectre illusion, because it would just grant a "look cool" spell that Verant is against. Many would agree that this is a lame excuse, and so, I have come to give a rebuttal to this "reason:" <BR>Enchanters get no illusions after level 44. The spell line is cut off. <BR>Before, the excuse was used that enchanters couldn't get any more illusions b/c it would take too much memory to add another file to the global index. This spectre image has been added to the global file, and there is no reason not to give this to us. <BR>Why did necromancers get the spectre pet to begin with? Does it enhance the effectiveness of their pets? No? I bet it was to LOOK COOL. <BR>Enchanters get illusions from every other pet, so why should this be different? <BR>On "look cool" spells: When has Verant been against fun spells? Might I draw attention to the summon beer spell and the minor illusion spell? <BR>Too much memory? Gee, maybe if you stopped giving the GMs unique looking armor and swords you could save memory for where it will be used more. <BR>This is not a post stating, "They got something cool so we want it!" Enchanters were told they couldn't have anymore illusions b/c it would take up too much memory. Then, they come along and add a new pet for necromancers, and use a new, lamer excuse. I am sure the enchanter community would be happy with just a couple more illusions after lvl 44.<P>I think I might have mentioned this in the other thread, but the spectre model has too many poly's to have two classes able to create spectres on demand. System resources are unfortunately finite, and we have to keep EQ usable by people with Voodoo 1 cards. <P>- Gordon<BR> <P>And can you give us a good reason why our "Spirit Wolf Illusion" is indoors only?  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was quite dissapointed in the response from VI on this.  It came across to me as a response you would see to a flame email, rather then an issue posted and supported by a large number of people.<P>[i]I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of the things that determines how NPCs react to you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he or she might very easily be able to travel anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that we want.[/i]<P>Fortunately VI Have incorperated a Faction system.  This system seems to over-ride any given Racial features.  <BR>example.<BR>Kill 100 Oggok Guards.<BR>Cast Illusion: Ogre.<BR>Result: Thes guards will be prepared to kill you.<P><BR>Prior to the release of Kunark the number of illusion spells available to Enchanters ment that they were pretty much able to travel anywhere safely provided they played the Faction game.<P>Was there a policy shift that came with the release of Kunark that ment Enchanters were no longer able to do this? We did see some examples of this policy shift prior to Kunark.<BR>Wolf Form in Fear.<BR>Wolf Form in Permafrost.<P>With the release of Kunark I was able to purchase my "Class Defining" spell: Collaboration.  It was at this time I thought that more illusions would be comming in order that I could use this spell to more effect.  I have cast this spell a total of 2 times.  In both occasions it has proved no more useful then my pre-Kunark equivelent.<P>Based on what I have seen posted may I suggest an extreme.. <BR>Remove ALL Illusion spells.<BR>Remove ALL Invisibility Spells.<BR>Remove ALL Movement adjustment spells.<P>Only by doing this will VI be able to have their Vision of [b]easily be able to travel anywhere...This isn't something that we want[/b]<P>Regards,<P>Mahar Delusion<BR>Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sutatnac<P>&gt;"Enchanters were told this idea wasn't possible b/c the ability to have any mob form would be exploitable. Isn't it with a mage pet too?"<P>And the reason for that is still true (as I mentioned in my reply).  It would allow an enchanter to go wherever he or she wanted and never be attacked.  I highly doubt that a mage pet will be doing tours of Veeshan's Peak on its own any time soon.<P>Look, I'm not telling you that there won't be new illusions.  I'm telling you that you will never see a targeted illusion like that.  As for other new illusions, I don't know.<P>Prezley wrote:<P>"Remove the invis line... Would chanters trade invis and invis undead for the right to mimic any mob? with a failure chance similar to invis being seen? Increased randomlness in the form? Random "you feel like yourself again"?? Wouldnt this be the same effect and more "fun" for chanters?"<P>Ok, there's something I hadn't considered.  The trouble here is, though, that the illusions would have to be VERY unreliable.  Probably so much so that they wouldn't be any fun at all.  But I'll keep that idea in mind.<P>&gt;"This strikes me as odd Absor and im sure im misinterpreting what you are thinking but if the dead should be left to the Necros et al.... Shouldnt the illusions be left to the people that mess with minds? IE Chanters and to some extent... bards? (i could see a bard getting illusions more than i understand druids/wolf, shaman/bear. Is this the same logic or am i reading this poorly?"<P>Well, the problem here is that everyone (especially in this thread) uses the term illusion very loosely.  A necro is becoming undead when he does his magic.  A druid is actually turning into a wolf when he does his.  The problem is that the game uses essentially the same mechanics for those transformations as it does for illusions.  If you really think about it, the way to distinguish illusions from transformations would be to make the illusions completely… illusionary.  There would be no real component at all to the spell:  no haste, not regen… just a faction change and a new look.  And, actually, I think that was the original intent with illusions (going purely on my memories from beta – no official information here…), but it was changed because they were not useful enough as a way to change your looks.<P>&gt;"Are there any Rangers LOL? They certainly arent favoured... (OUCH.. said id not bring that up.... moving on LOL)"<P>Consider yourself chastised.<P>&gt;"A fire beetle.... a moss snake.... all global arent they? "<P>Actually, no.  All of those things are only in the zone that they are in, they are not global.  They just happen to be in a lot of zones.<P>And, just to add fuel to the fire (I'm silly that way), bears were not global before they were added to it for Velious…<P>*ducks*<P>&gt;"I think you came on board too late to stop this Absor.... Whats done is done."<P>It's not that it's gone too far, really.  But perhaps it has gone as far as it should…  But you are right, what's done is done on that matter.<P>EverGloom wrote:<P>&gt;"1. Enchanters (Masters of illusion) do not get any Group illusion spells. Druids (Not masters of illusion) get a group illusion spell that has some nice effects."<BR>2. Enchanters do not get any new illusions in the SoV expansion. Shamans get a new illusion."<P>Here's where we get into semantics, and people start getting mad at me.  But, technically druids and shaman are doing transformations not illusions… see my previous response above.<P>&gt;"3. Enchanters, (masters of enchanting people, places and things) do not get any spells to make weapons magic. Rangers, on the other hand, get a whole new line of spells."<P>Well, actually, enchanters and shaman are really the only ones that get the ability to make magic items.  What rangers are doing is basically a buff, since it affects them, not their weapon.  But I don't disagree with your sentiment.  Based on a recent post by Brad, he agrees too.<P>&gt;"4. The one new spells that comes close to being a new illusion (though it is the same old illusion just able to cast on other people) is near worthless in it's duration, recast time and level limit of the target."<P>Well, it's hard to argue against that.  Basically you're saying that you got a new illusion, but you don't like it…<P>&gt;"5. All pets get fixed so that weapons are no longer needed for the pets to dual wield, except the enchanter pets."<P>Unrelated to the current topic.<BR> <BR>&gt;"6. compared to other classes, the new Enchanter SoV expansion spells suck.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>   I was glad to see that you did respond but I don't think you did enough research before you posted about the rationale for giving Illusion Spectre to Necros, and giving Monster Summon but not giving us Illusion Copy Cat.  You cited two different reasons:  First that Enchanters shouldn't be given any undead illusions, and second that if we had the ability to change into any form found within a zone we could too easily go to areas that were intended to be too difficult.<BR> First:  We already have TWO undead illusions, Both Skeleton and Dry Bones Skeleton. <BR> Second: While in either of these illusions, there is no faction change to undead.  In the eyes of any skeleton that sees me, I remain KOS.  Surely Verant could ask one of the old programmers who used to work on EQ to stop working on Star Wars long enough to show the new kids how it was done. <BR>  I am grateful that Verant chose to reply to us but why not admit that we are no longer the 'Masters of Illusion' and just change our name from 'Illusionist'  to  'Group Buffer'?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Illusion gender, I don't know why that couldn't &gt;be done. I do know why illusion copycat wouldn't &gt;be done. Keep in mind that your race is one of &gt;the things that determines how NPCs react to &gt;you. If an enchanter could mimic any creature he &gt;or she might very easily be able to travel &gt;anywhere with no risk. This isn't something that &gt;we want. I'd never heard the idea of Illusion &gt;Pet. It's interesting, though I wonder how odd &gt;you'd look… <P>Umm, sorry what?!<P>The way NPC's react to you is based on three things. Race, religion and faction. Having an illusion spell takes care of race, but doesn't take care of religion or faction if you've ruined it for a particular race of NPC.<P>Otherwise rogues would walk with impunity among all the dark elf areas (including OT) with a mask of deception.<P>And that's simply not the case.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems that the main reason for not giving enchanters the Illusion: Target spell (or other illusions) is that the faction change associated with turning into that mob would allow most enchanters access to a LOT more places with little or no danger associated (at least where religion was not an issue).  <P>Suppose you've been fighting in a dungeon that sees invis and you are deeply KoS.  Normally you'd have a pretty difficult time getting down to the Uber_Loot_01 camp.  If you were able to cast Illusion: Target on yourself, you would inherit the faction of the target and would be able to waltz down to the camp with no problems.<P>I would imagine that if Verant could separate the faction from a mob's appearance when it gets loaded on your player, the Illusion: line of spells for enchanters would truly blossom.<P>Am I incorrect in thinking that this is the main issue behind Illusion: Target?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eeep I started another thread.  Thanks Absor for your continuing visits here. <P>If there is still some openness to the idea of new illusions then I would like to respectfully submit the following:<P>1. Illusion Gender. I've heard it is already there in the code, would be a fun thing to have. SHOULD stack with race illusions if possible.  (great response to over zealous men, illusion ogre + illusion gender)<P>2. Illusion Monster. Would work exactly like the Magician pet, except the monster would either... 1. retain your same faction or 2. Make you kos like our current skeletal illusion.<P>3. Illusion: invisible This would make us like the enchanter pet. The enchanter pet only shows up as whatever items he is holding. This should be a neat spell. I would usually appear as two floating steins  There would be no other bonuses or faction increases. It *could* make us act as invisible, but that would not be balancing because normal invis has a random duration and illusions do not.<P>4. Major Illusion  (upgrade to minor illusion). I remember back in beta enchanters could illusion into very very large structures. (Like a copy of the Felwithe Castle Front, buildings, orc tents). Put this code back in for a VERY high lvl VERY rare illusion spell. (Level 60 perhaps) So that so few people would have it that it would not cause tremendous lag.<P>Illusion: Eye of Zomm. This is just a fun one, and it could either give no faction or kos faction. The model is already present globally.<P>Thoughts?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off. Thanks for the replies. You had us all worried there for some time.<P>With that said, I have to disagree with some of your points.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"4. The one new spells that comes close to being a new illusion (though it is the same old illusion just able to cast on other people) is near worthless in it's duration, recast time and level limit of the target."<P>Well, it's hard to argue against that. Basically you're saying that you got a new illusion, but you don't like it…&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>No. He is saying that we got a re-hashed version of an illusion we already had. With the change being that it is targetable now.<P>And FYI, enchanters have been able to mimic the undead since the very beginning. We have skeleton and drybone skeleton illusions already. An spectre illusion would fall into this saem category.<P>And I hate playing the semantics game as much as you do. But if your definition of a "transformation" is just an illusion with stat bonuses; I believe that just about all of our illusions would qualify. <P>Thanks again,<P>Lars<P>P.S. I believe you when you say that you will look into this further.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I (as well as every enchanter that reponded to this thread) eagerly await whatever news comes of this further research.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Can't you just use the same one that werewolf has since werewolves are KOS?  It is clear that mobs can associate summoned mob pets with their owners, why is it hard to assign a global KOS faction with illusion doppleganger?<P>Third:<P>Comparing Illusions to Changeforms - I think every enchanter in the game would give up the stat buffs of their illusions provided that the illusion would actually fool all npc's into thinking they were agnostic religion.  That way they would be true illusions.<P>Fourth:  <P>Spirit Wolf was made to be outdoor only because of faction problems with Lady Vox.  Those factions were fixed so why is it still OUTDOOR only?<P>Fifth:<BR>I am curious as to your response to -Kateru-'s quote of Gordon's comments about illusions spectre?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was going to bring up the "eye" topic as well. It is global...not only is it global but Evil Eyes are ALWAYS enchanters AND our insignia thing is a hand with a blinking eye.<P>However I would rather see this as a pet...a level 60 pet that assists us in some way rather then using melee or is commandable, like casting tash with no melee power, but higher ac/hp. But that's off topic.<P>Also our one targetable illusion..boon of garou is not castable on my own pet. I realize there might be a coding issue but it irritates me none the less so I figured I would mention it.<P>A 3rd illussion that is still KoS is minor illussion...I don't normally see mobs attacking chairs, lamps, carpets and such. Just a small point....doesn't really mean anything.<P>As far as going anywhere...well I would think that I could maybe get an illusion to help me out slightly with velious dragons and giants. I mean just like illusion ogre...a few kills and I'm KoS to ogres anyway. Just frustrating I am suppossed to have the most deceptive means of moving around hostile territory and I can't do anything here. I used collaboration and got them to dubious...but trying to find the zone line I was attacked anyway...not once but 3 deaths. I'm sorry but a 56 enchanter should providing he doesn't make a bad choice like killing any giants be able to go where someone who killed merely one dwarf could go. We need an illussion to fix this. How unbalancing is this? Not very...people are intended to get to non-KoS status..and if you choose to kill giants or dragons you will be KoS in those towns anyway in 10 minutes.<P>As far as spectors was never stated as causing lag...someone already posted the quote I was about to look for. Look above. I realize you can't memorize every statement verant ever made. I don't blame you for not knowing but that statement was infact made.<P>Also I'm sure you remember our level 51-53 and our 59-60 titles are illussionist and phantasmist. Nice to have a reason for those high level titles...why use those as titles if those functions are just parlor tricks the newbies enchanters preform? I just had to bring it up.<P>Also in the way of illussions..can we get grow and shrink? I mean you would think we could possible make someone "appear smaller". Also the argument of making these indoor only...bah! Let them do it outside please...even if we don't get the spell.<P>I can't tell you how much I would love to see Illusion: corpse. Memory blur just plain doesn't work at high levels or really on much over 35. Memory flux and all the other upgrades don't work either. Funny though...that evade skill for rogues, evade spell for wizards, and probably jolt for rangers (most rangers I know quit before they can scribe this spell) all seem to work well and cost less mana...even though we are the masters of wiping minds...or really any mental manipulation but the level 8 memblur is a good indicator of this. Maybe just a tweak of mem flux would be OK..but illusion corpse would be nice too if flux is unfixable.<P>P.S. off topic but what is with the giants/dragons/high-MR/54+ mob unmezzable stuff? I don't see you neutering any other class to this extent yet every new zone has more and more non-mezzables then the one before it. This trend is rather depressing. I'd use charm...but my best real charm spell is capped at 52 and I am 56 (although the ghoul scribe charmed me in Lguk 2 for 2 attempts when I am 56 and have 120 MR and have to be WAY above his cap). So I am reduced to ROOT. Jeez. Even paladins and rangers can do crowd control better then me in places like skyfire, kael and the likes...thanks guys. Way to remember why enchanters were made in the first place. Did I mention I recently made a cleric?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>I honestly think you are missing the point of the Illusion: Target spell enchanters have proposed.  Our idea is that enchanters get the ability to change into any thing we target (within) reason WITHOUT CHANGING FACTION WITH THAT MOB.  That was never part of the spell proposed to my knowledge.<P>In addition, do not blame the distorted idea of illusions.  It's Verants fault we think illusions should add buffs b/c almost half of them do so.  We can't help that our spells are called illusions while they do the same thing as wolf and bearform.<P>In addition, I know it isn't related to the topic, but can you look into getting the Illusion: Spirit Wolf spell indoors again?  There is no longer a reason for enchanters to not be able to cast this indoors and we need it in Velious for the CR buff.

However, I think Absor is not because obviously he had read this post way before he responded.<P>Also, the bottom line is too many class specific abilities are being overlapped into other classes.  Though I play a necro and like the skeleton look for Call of Bones, I tend to believe that there is no reason for the illusion skeleton.  I know, I know.  You said it was a transformation.  But they *DO* work as illusions, and not just transformations.  Druids going wolf form makes them not KOS in some places.  If you ask me, thats an illusion, not a transformation.<P>On a side note, all hybrids suck.  All of the abilities they take from other classes are inferior.  This makes them less group desirable.

Because the locals think you really *are* what the illusion makes you look like. Why? Because you *look* like them! <P>Actually turning into something should give you the same, if not better results than an illusion.<P>If people in an area hate humans but don't mind wolves, why shouldn't wolfform make you non Kos to them?

The faction buff was useful enough.<P>Then the druids could have their nature forms, the necros could have their death forms, and maybe another class could have actually turned into Elementals.<P>But that is how it was done until now, so I am not saying they should retroactively change anything.<P>Still, actual transformations should definitely have faction adjustments if the new form is not KoS in the area - it just so happens that the enchanters have illusions to the same effect, with a greater variety of options.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a level 51 enchanter and I have no complaints about what the game is offering me.  All i can say is my enchanter is getting less and less play time; I feel like my hands are tied and his future is limited.  Besides not being able to entertain with some new illusion spells, the class is laggin behind in a world that has made a big step with velious for many of the classes.<P>But what is new and exciteing about enchanters, the REAL life of the party?  Boon of the Garou is a great spell and satifies the targetable illuson so many wanted (i guess this fall in the tranformation catagory as there are bonus' associated with the spell).   Gift of Magic is also a nice addition to the spell book, 50 mana isn't much but it's not too shabby either.<P>The new leather armour for pure casters has given my character the look he has wanted for a long time, sacrificing the intelligence, for a nice casual look.  PLus it lets me pass myself of as a druid, so I can truly mess with peoples minds.  Of course, for key encounters, the robes come out.<P>I dont know what is gonna make this situation better, but my enchanter has not been progressing well in the new world.  Im just out nuked, my pet is wild and weak, my mes is not so useful anymore, and groups just don't need us anymore, and frankly why should I continue to stick my neck out for a world full of powergamers who most popular use for a enchanter is determining the time to evac, and that is upon his death.  "Chanter Down! Evac Evac Evac!"  That makes for a real fun time, spending hours digging up a corpse...oh yea a necro can help me for a price...but, what can't the necro do...for a price?<P>Needless to say I have been playing a necro and will adhere to the apperant vision for EQ, which leaves us with a high level game that is full of exclusive uber guilds in a struggle for power and fame, lol, weeee this is real fun.<P>&lt;cough&gt;<P>This illusion thing isn't our biggest problem.  We need some other tools to make out class desireable again.  If we are expected to use charm more often in the new world, then fine.  I figure it will only take FOREVER to explain to a group how to work charmed mobs.  Just when the world was figuring how to assist the main tank, now it's our job to educate the masses on how they need to provide either taunts or roots on mobs that lose charm.  At the higher levels, though, it doesn't take more then 3 or 4 melee rounds of quad attacks to turn us into a pile of lifeless flesh, so that root or taunt beter be quick.  Sometimes I die SO much it's rediculous.<P>If I could ask for one thing...<P>lower the taunt on our higher level charm spells, starting with allure, or make our charms as faithful as the summoned monster is to his owner.  I mean, how beguiling am I if I can't keep a monster under my spell for more then a few minutes.<P>Destined to be a necro/shaman/cleric like everyone else,<P>Keefer by the Sea<P>PS - my other high level character is a Pally *sigh* talk about making bad choices.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Illusion vs Transformation: Transformations give stat bonus and faction, and illusions should not?<P>Enchanters have Illusions, would a fire elemental illusion actually have a damage shield?  In fantasy yes. <P>If the person attacking belives he is getting hurt, he will feel hurt, if he truly belives that he is almost dead he may become unconsience. And if his mind believes he is dead his heart stops pumping, and he dies.<P>Stat bonus, if your mind thinks you can swing faster, you most likely will, if your addrenaline gets pumped up, you become stronger, faster, and can do things normally you are not able to do. And conversly if you feal sluggish and slow you will most likely have negative stats.<P>Speed, actually an Illusion of speed to others is not true in this case, if we fool ourself to belive we could run faster, then maybe. Of course levatate is the enchantment of your body not to have gravity, or your body not to require oxygen with waterbreath. No Illusion would allow you to fly.<P>Enchanters are not Illusionists, they are beyond that, Illusions are a great part, and most of the fun, but Illusion alone would make a poor enchanter. <P>Now as for not getting Illusions post 44, it hurts.<P>1) Global file has spectre, bear, eye, and  sword/shield.<P>2) Gender Illusion-&gt; how about +cha with it on. Well might be cool to RP, and was shown in spell dat posted on some boards.<P>3) Monster Illusion very easy to program, could take from mage list.<P>4) Illusion Armor: Person is shown as if in Chain, gives same AC as comparable spell. <P>Well I am sure Verant has plenty of Ideas, although I will not hold my breath, as I see enchanters getting more Illusions as a closed subject. But I am always dreaming.<P>/em casts benevolence on himself<BR>Dead-nameless looks happy.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The illusion is not just visual, but present in the very mind of the beholder.<P>Boon of the Garou: This not only makes someone look like a werewolf, but grants them a feeling of ferocity and speed as part of this mental state. <P>All illusions with stat bonuses can be explained in such a mind-over-body way. See, that wasn't too hard<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>A far better way to explain:<BR>An illusion that is obviously fake won't fool anyone.  Magic can be used to make damage shields (enchanters have one, as a matter of fact).  This magic is added to the looks portion to create an image that feels, acts, and reacts right.<P>Look through the spells.  There's not a single effect on illusions that some other magic (from an int based class) doesn't grant.  +attack (necro grim aura), haste (enchanter quickness line), lev (levitate), water breathing (enduring breath), fire resist (endure fire, elemental armor spell that wizzies have), cold resist (endure cold, elemental armor), vision (ultravision, serpent sight), fire based damage shields (feedback, mage line), +hp per tick (the mage's ac line).<P>No illusion does anything that hasn't been done by magic before.<P>People need to get the idea that it's just an illusion out of their heads.  It isn't.  It's a fake look boosted with enough reality to make you believe it.  And that means you burn when you touch mr. fire elemental.  Because magic can do that, and I master magic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll summarise this post.<P>1) Are there any technical issues that prevents an Illusion: Target type spell for functioning WITHOUT changing the base faction of the player when the spell is cast? If not, then why is this spell unavailable? Why can not this Target illusion just be given a specific faction set like any other race? Simply make them KOS to everything if you want to restrict access to other areas.<P>2) Why is Illusion: Gender not available when the code is already in game? I've seen this spell in action as a male monk was mystically turned into a female monk by the wills of the gods a while ago, and on a live server no less.<P>3) Why are nature and undead related illusions restricted to necromancers and druids in your opinion? As you yourself stated, what the other classes are doing are in fact TRANSFORMATIONS, not illusions, and therefore not the same. Why can not an Illusionist class mimic what these other classes are cabable of in appearence if not in function?<P>Basically, the spells the Enchanter class are asking for, we want to be on a level of usefulness as say Bristlebanes Bundle. You know, a 'fun' spell? As Enchanters, some of us enjoy being able to alter our form, regardless of the benefits of such a transormation (90% of my time is spent in Gnome / Dwarf / Halfling illusion just for the looks, damn I should've been a Gnome).<P>If you want to be nitpicky about Abashi's statement about the Spectre model, bear in mind that there are a lot more necromancers around than enchanters on most servers. Why would you give them Illusion: Spectre when they can already summon one if it creates lag? More necros = more spectres running around, with spectre pets to boot.<P>All we're asking for is a frank and to the point answer as to why we are not deemed worthy of such seemingly harmless and potentially enjoyment creating spells, whether it be a true technical issue or otherwise.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sigh, I had a good response earlier, but my school's outside connecten went blah when I tried to send it.<P>Absor: The reason we're not inclined to believe any reason we're told about why we can't have an illusion is because we've been slapped in the face on the issue twice now, once on having no room in the global file, and once on spectres having too many polygons to let a PC become one.<P>As for implementing illusion:mimic, there's a very simple method of "code magic" that can be used to avoid having to code a workaround for faction: Add a new table to each zone (or a flag to each mob) listing which mobs are allowed to be mimiced. You go through a zone and you have a proggie automatically mark all mobs without faction as being mimicable, and then add in other allowable mobs one by one.<P>It sure would be more interesting to go through Freeport as a freeport militiaman rather than a normal human and it would be one of the cases where it wouldn't be imbalancing at all.<P>Enchanters have a line of spells whose whole purpose is to improve faction with mobs (alliance, etc), and another line whose lower level spells are mostly used for improving faction in towns (illusion:PC race), why SHOULDN'T enchanters get the ability to be non-KOS in more places? An enchanter is the only class that can walk into every starting town with zero faction work, why should there be very few other places where an enchanter can manage to walk freely?

It's also just kinda silly to have an illusion that doesn't actually convince anyone that you are the new form…<P>But don't let that distract you.

I'm not saying that it won't happen.

</FONT><HR>On the way home, I was thinking of the roots of why I picked an enchanter in the first place.<P>The class that appealed to me most from D&D was that of the illusionist (well, illusionist/thief to be precise). Our group wound up not playing together long, but I really enjoyed the times I got to illusion myself for a short time to get through dangerous situations, or to lay a trap.<P>Now, coming back to EQ, since we ARE illusionists (past 50 anyways), the same excitement could easily be given into EQ with a marginaly reliable illusion:target. Of course, not everything could be mimiced "Your will is not sufficient to convince others you're Lady Vox", but there's no reason that MOST mobs couldn't be mimiced for a short time, maybe something like half your level + 1d100 seconds, or something like that, with some modifier based on creature type.<P>And as mentioned by someone else, the greatest of enchanters have successfully disguised themselves on a permament basis to be an aviak, a clockwork, a scorpion, a sarnak and live among those beings for the latter 2... surely the greatest of PC enchanters has the ability to at least TEMPORARILY disguise themselves as such, even if for less than a minute. After all, from most reports, we can't do much else in Velious.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hate to put it this way,  But Yes,  Enchanters in a way get "Screwed over (not with just illusions,  but this isnt the right board for this)."   You say you dont like to mix class's and have old spells become new for someone else, but look what you do.  You mix class's.  By giving Druids, Necros, Shamans, ect.  the ability to change their form,  you, in a sense, make them Illusionists.  Kind of a double standard there eh?  For me,  as an Enchanter,  Illusions were always for the fun.  I still change into Human, or Half Elf, or Ogre,  just for the fun of it.<P>Now letting other class's have ONE or two illusions is okay in my opinion.  But they should already be an Illusion enchanters have.  Enchanters should be the Masters of Illusion.  You say we shouldnt be able to travel everywhere,  but were we not able to travel everywhere before RoK or SoV came out?  I remember going to each city so i could use my illusion and just checking out what it looked like.  Those were the fun days.  EverQuest is still fun,  but its a different type of fun.  I dont see groups looking for enchanters as much as they used to.  We arnt as usefull in SoV.  The one thing ive been asked to be grouped for is Boon of the Garou.  Thats a great spell,  but its not an additional illusion.  We already had that one.<P>For me,  its not about the stats or bonus's that you gain when using illusions,  Its the "COOL LOOK" that you get.<P>I hope Enchanters get some new stuff soon.  It would surely add something to our class.<P>Amerzel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I beleive enchanters are not just for illusions, i mean the ability to charm a mob and make it there pet, completely mezmorize a horde, and being one of the best group partner you could ever want is what enchanters are about. Illusions give you the ability to go places and do alot of the stuff the rest of us cannot. Sure necros get skeleton and spectre illusions. But they make us kos to our own guards. Sad huh? i deleted all my half breed classes. The only thing i see would be nicer in future is for exp penalty to be dropped. Sure they get neater stuff. But there weaker group wise then truebloods.

You said in tranformation, basicly that when you change to a wolf for instance, you get stat buffs with that tranformation, and with an illusion you do not.  But there is an error in this statement.  Doesn't the Enchanter Dark Elf "illusion" grant Ultravision.  Isnt that a stat change, same with the illusions for the infravision classes?  Granted this is the only "stat" change we recieve with these illusions, but it is a change.<P>I belive you also stated that -you- believed that the first idea for illusions were to just make you look different but it didnt work out in beta so you changed your plan.  Well, in my opinion, that change is what is causeing the confusion between Transformation, and Illusion.<P>Much like enchanters thinking that the Spectra Spell the necro's get is an illusion, I imaging if Enchanters got Wolf Illusion, the druids would be upset as well, saying we took there only good "Illusion" or "Transformation", even though we would not get the stats.  This is where the problem lies.<P>What to do about it?  I dont know.  It is an issue that you at verrant created unknownly and it is something that will probably need to be dealt with in one form or another.  <P>This is where I think you need to start looking<BR>Thanks<BR>GTLoco</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about illusion monster, uses the same random tables that mage summon monster uses and is random what you get.  That way you could have the possibilities limited and enchanters aren't always safe.<P>Eryl Flynn Level 52 Wood Elf Minstrel on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The enchanter would be safe for the most part, becuase the random table draws a monster from the zone you currently reside in.  Most zones do not have more than one faction in them, so you would get a  ramdom monster that would be pretty much free to go anywhere he(you) pleased<P>GTLoco</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=040527&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=040527&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
