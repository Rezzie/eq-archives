</FONT><HR>I have been reading a thread lately here about how long the quests take to do and how difficult they are. I have recently failed on my Robe of lost cirlce  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> it took me a long time to get all the componets needed. Then i try to create FAILURE! I was furious and almost decided to quit my wonderful monk character. As for Treant fists I have heard many stories of  monks waiting 70hrs + just to kill the alchemists! I consider myself lucky it only took me 10hrs to get both of the alchemists and later i got the Catskull cap and Femur. And when i when i got the fists i was somewhat dissapointed, only +3dex and +hp ?? id rather buy 2 blackpearl earrings and 2 +75 hp bracers. Verant needs to make these items much better for how difficult they are to get. For example the treant fists were much better when they were broken they had regen on them &gt; <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Now...Im kind of ask something since talking about robe of lost circles . If anyone on Xegony server has this ill buy from them for 100p or wu gauntlets and something else... It is not worth more then that because how cheap the stats are my lockjaw is just as good as far as im concerned you can icq me at 57678971 and well strike up a bargain.<P>Anyway another thing is i heard that 1h blunt is going to be better then our hands??If this is true all the monks are certainly going to be mad because we have been training up hand to hand for ever and now verant is coming in saying that 1hb is going to be better..NOw i have some ideas if this is true on what their going to do...<P>1. They are going to add in Martial art weapons like Nunchakus which are 1hb a 3 section staff which can be 1hb a BO and a tonfa.Which is pretty possible in kunark.. And verant should add some real monk gear like the red and organgish robes that the tibetan monks wear. The blue  and white garment that the japanese monks wear with that huge hat (forget what they are called) because...we look the worst when it comes to looks.<BR>And for skills we should get one that would drain our stamina all the way and half of hp left? Lets say the more hp you have to spare the more damage it does because of how much energy you put into it.It would be a last resort because of all stamina is gone, As a monk stamina is not that important to me because i have yet to run out of stamina. another neat skill is the option to ignore pain or like real monks can do or have weaker weapons break against our bodys such as rusty swords.. Rusty swords etc dont break they just have higher dly! Anyway just thought id write on here because i havnt done it in a long time<P>Faze of Xegony (remember about robe of lost circles ill buy)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, I can understand where you are coming from on the robe, it sucks compared to what we have to go through to get it, but heck, look at the Shiverback stuff, it has great stats but really lousy AC for stuff from the planes.  As for the 1hb, they already have something, it is called the White Treant Fists (I wonder why its initials are WTF, hmmm...).  It is a 1hb from PoS, I don't remember the stats, but I was also pissed off to find out that my H2H skill would become a moot point after that, which means I will have to get some cracked staves and start practicing, oh boy, oh joy.  At least at lvl 13, it shouldn't be to hard for me, just go help some guys about 5+ lvls over me attack red stuff, and I don't get any exp but get great practice, shrug.  I like the idea about the oriental robes, but I doubt it will happen after they went to the effort to get us cured silk that looks like Shiverback.  As for getting the Robe of the Lost Circle, even if they could sell it, which they can't, it would probably cost you several thousand pp, just look at everything else we can wear after cured silk, it all costs several hundred pp to several thousand, at least on my server.<P>Fany, monk of the 13 order<BR>Dragon Avengers of Norrath<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Heh, lucky you.  I've spent months in Guk, and being a puller I usually get to the critters first, and I have yet to see that monk.  Well, then again, maybe not that lucky...  sort of sucks to go through all that work only to have it fail on you.<P>Well, the Monk quests are definetely quite hard.  Well, actually they aren't that hard now that I think about it.  It's just you have to wait DAYS and DAYS and DAYS and DAYS for spawn(s) only to accomplish the quest and find the items is a piece of junk and mesh is better.<P>Ya, like that's my perfect idea of fun.  Coming home from work, opening a bottle of beer, turning on the computer...  only to find myself doing nothing but staring at it blankly till a creature spawns.  I think people have more excitement from watching paint peel.  Heck, in some house, there is more movement from the paint then in the game.<P>It would also be nice if they finished the headband and sash quests.  However, in the same regards...  based on what you had to go through to get the other stuff, we probably would have to be level 60 to do it.  Which, again, we could probably find a BETTER item on creature.  Heh, and probably on the same creature we needed to kill to accomplish the quest.<P>* * * * * <P>Carsh exclaims, "Wow! the dragon's eye opal, now you can finish your black sash quest."<P>Moorsh replies, "I'm not going to do that lousy quest, I waiting for the next spawn.  Hopefully it will drop the Belt of the Titan's"<P>* * * * *<P>Already I am not wearing my headband, I wear either and executioner's hood, or Crown of the Froglocks.  And if I get lucky enough to get the belt off the supply, my sash is going into the locker.<P><BR>As for these new weapons that are supposed to be coming out for Monks, I am not impressed.  Granted I have trained in blunt, but that's not the point. These new super-monk items, are really no different then the super warrior items out there. If you add up the damage, it's relatively the same.  I've seen a weapon off the plane of hate that does on average about 100 damage.  Now add in the double attack, usually about 190 a round.  The critical hits on this weapon have been 200+.<P>We do have one plus, we can pull.  About the only thing that keeps us popular in the game.  But other then that, we have pretty much been shafted on everything else.  And it wouldn't matter much to me that we are.  After all, we shouldn't need alot of things LIKE THE MANUAL states.  Heh, ya right!  I get killed by creatures that con green, muchless trying that without any items.<P>Oh well, I guess I should just stop whining and deal with it.  Afterall I am looking for to the quest for the nunchakus, where I need to do the following:<P>1) Break into the plane of air, where most likely the first item I need to get is rare lightning rock off the common lightning bug that happens to be right next to the portal so we can't loot it because we are too busy trying to break in and is only like 3 of them in the entire plane that are concentrated strickly around the portal.<P>2) Only to find I need to be a master jewel crafter, because the item is no-drop, in order to combine it with a ruby, and enchanted platinum.<P>3) Next to go to the Oasis, and wait 30 days (in real life time) for the Skeletal Sand Giant, which takes like a group of 5 to kill.  So I need to be in a group for that full 30 days.  Plus, several other groups are waiting for it as well, so we need to be lucky and spot it first otherwise we wait another 30 days.<P>4) After which, these items are turned in to create to get faction with the Master Monk of SRO, so I can get the real quest in order to get the item.  Which involves me to get fingernails from Cazic Thule.  So I need to get into a rotation from Cazic Thule, which could be quite sometime.  And he doesn't always drop the fingernails.<P>5) However, once obtaining the fingernails, all I need to do is wait for the drooling werewolf of NRO.<P>6) After that, and I turn these items in, there's a test of might in order to prove myself.  In which I need to battle a 55 level Skeletal Asp, which of course, I can't beat until I'm level 70. And if I fail to kill it, I have to repeat the second half again.<P>*Hmmmm... I think to myself as I sit at the bar staring at my spoon...  and I think, a Spoon is a blunt weapon.  And it's free.*<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm also gonna say that monk quests are pretty hard. I'm lvl 19 and I'm still hanging out in SK waiting for High Shaman Phido to finish my red headband quest. Add to that that it's going to take some time to up my faction with the Ashen Order so I can start doing those quests and get sashes I won't wear compared to my Thick Leather Apron, and monk quests aren't worth the effort. Pretty much all the other classes have good quests through most of their levels, except monks. I really would like to see more quest ARMOR, as opposed to just headbands, sashes and gloves that we can quest for now. We'll hopefully the expansion will bring some new stuff for us monks! *crosses his fingers*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

(only a little better)<P>Treant fist, over 40 hours (average, some get it in 10, some in 100... depends)  Best fist item before planes.  But not impressive for the time it takes.  The gorge alchemist is over 70 hours for some horror stories.<P>And Verant admitted that 40 hours for cleric ( i think) armor was ridiculous, imagine our crappy items for over 70 hours... isnt a laughter?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001628&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001628&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
