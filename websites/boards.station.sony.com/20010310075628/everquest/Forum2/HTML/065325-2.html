</FONT><HR>This is a bit off topic but I heard it mentioned a few times. Why is zelda (the new ones) so popular? I played them and found them to be mario 3d rip offs and boring as crash bandicoot or any of the other multitude of 3d template games that have been made. Sorry to get off topic again but I just don't see the appeal for such a widely copied type of game. Personally I liked the type of graphics that super nintendo gave the RPGs. The 3d touch just adds 3 more CDs to the game and doesn't add a whole lot more fun to it. Although the first 3d type moving game Mario 64 was sort of fun but after all the rip offs it's hard to like anything.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that the idea of the /gems has great potential. The games could involve placing bets against other players. Maybe have some NPC as a controller of results and you pay (lets say 1 pp per game) per gaming session and every week there is a final result where the winner gets like 20% of the revenues.<P>Well, this is just my own thoughts, but it would give even more depth to this game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree that games inside of games can be fun. The last two games in the Might&Magic RPG series had some sort of Magic the Gathering card game you could play in every inn. There were even quests related to it, like winning once in each inn to get a price.<P>But in that case the game was well immersed into the roleplaying. You go to an inn and there are some other people and you play a card game with them. Fits perfectly into what you think you should be doing in a fantasy setting inn. I don't think a Tetris clone fits that easily into the roleplaying aspects of EQ. <P>And I can understand people that got their name erased for not being "roleplaying style" enough, getting angry at Verant continually doing non-roleplaying things. Adding Tetris to EQ, having GM events with characters called Captain Picard, naming NPCs Bridney Smears, etc.<P>Well, I'm sure if there is an issue with the next edition of MS Office causing long waits when printing, Microsoft will follow Verants example and solve the problem by adding a little Tetris game to play while you wait.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To reply to the blue name,Brad,OMG!!! are you serious?Did we all make a mistake when we bought EQ,what we really wanted was GEMS?This is supposed to make downtime better?I have to tell you man,this is the year 2001 we have things like TV,Bills,chores,homework,eating,drinking,phonecall,movies,music and other things to take up 5 mins of time while were medding.Even when i can sit and med at 35 i do the alternate things instead of stare at my screen,shoot sometimes i practice sence heading or sneak skill even though boring thats how i get my skills up.Why on earth would anyone make this in a MMrpg with so many problems with casters and tanks bugs,this goes a long way in showing where you people spend your time making impovements.Whats next cartoon short series MPEG or streamline.GEEZ ridiculous!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree that mini-games within a game can make the game more immersive. However, Gems doesn't really achieve that end since it isn't really part of the EverQuest world. If anything, it makes the game less immersive by being so out of place. I can't remember ever reading a story of some fantasy hero going out to slay a dragon, rescue the fair princess, and then taking a break to play Tetris on his Pocket Gameboy.<P>Having mini-games inside EverQuest is a great idea. I've been wondering for a long time why we can't actually play poker in the Highpass casino. Maybe some dart boards in the taverns would make them places people would actually go to have fun instead of just stopping by to purchase beer on their way somewhere else.<P>Mini-games on make a game more immersive when they fit the world in which they appear. Aradune's example of the fishing in Zelda is very fitting. I loved that stuff. But if Link had stopped along the way to play Tetris for no reason, with no reward, with no relevance whatsoever to character or plot development, it would have been absurd. Gems is more comparable to the secret Breakout bonus game at the end of Lunar and *that* was only appropriate because the entire game was OVER at that point. EverQuest is *never* over.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen people complain about a lot of things here on these boards over nearly two years.<P>This has got to take the cake as being the silliest thing to be rallying against.<P>I have not seen one good argument against having Gems in the game.<P>It breaks the role-play environment.  Well it only does that for the person playing.  It does it for NOBODY else.  So if it is a problem for you don't play.<P>They could have implemented some other uber-major fix instead of this game. No they could not.  It is that simple, so stop making that argument.<P>Groups are going to get killed because the cleric is playing Gems.  Prove it.  This has been thrown around a lot.  Mostly before the patch even came back up.  There has not been one instance of this actually happening.  And if it does happen, that person would have let you die because of something else, Gems don't let warriors die, clerics do.<P>On and on the specious arguments go.  People have been clamoring for mini-games for a long time.  Just because this does not meet YOUR VISION does not mean it was not worthwhile.<P>As already stated it took no resources away from other parts of the game.  It is an expirement of sorts.  It gives them some ideas on how they can and can not implement future mini-games that will be more immersive and in tune with the world.<P>People complain that some around here are VAK's.  Well it is a good counterbalance, because there is a contigent here that will absolutely complain no matter what Verant does.  Absolutely find some wrong with anything.  Its quite easy to do to.  Anytime Verant changes or adds something just claim that some other issue is more important.<P>Knock it off.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What happens if you find out that GEMS has caused a memory leak and eventually the EQ client crashes?  What about if there's a bug causing players to get stuck in GEMS when a certain kind of mob attacks you?  What if...<P>None of these things have happened yet, and they probably won't.  What if they do?  When you take any piece of software and add it to the production code, even if it was developed in somebody's spare time, it adds to the maintenance burden.  Past examples have shown us that when something gets added to EQ, it's very likely that something else will break.<P>I think its really great that one of the EQ developers made GEMS in his spare time.  It's a neat little game.  I don't think it should have been incorporated into EverQuest however.  If you asked me, further development along these lines (even more mini games) would be in the wrong direction.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I hope not every programer has access to your base code in his "spare time". The point is, even if it took 5 min to develope into the main base code of the game, its 5 min that could have been spent on something else. BTW - it had to be more than 5 min due to the nature of how GEMS is accessed and runs it runs at the same time as EQ. I'm not against games in the game, this just isn't a logical step within EQ.<P>I could think of 1000 thing to be done in downtime, out of battle time and even in battle time that would have related to EQ the game. I don't think GEMS is stupid or worthless, just not something to be done in the game. Want to give us GEMS free? Download it with a patch and have a new directory set up with all the FREE stuff you want us to have in it. We can exit the GAME and play GEMS all night or play EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Or make cold AE spells look blue instead of red.  Or maybe even so we can purchase stacks of things.  That kind of thing, you know annoying content in the game people have complained about since release.<P>We'd feel a lot more comfortable about your view of Everquest if you put this sort of effort into the game first.

I used to play dice all the time in UO, my thief always carried a dice cup to gamble away his stolen loot.<P>I think gems is a great game. I had to take the Kunark-Velious boat haul (yes, I shouted for ports the entire way, no nobody was porting) last night, and for the very first time ever in EQ I had fun on the boat ride. Kudos to gems.<P>One thing to fix: submit the window code to Rowyl to bring it into line with the 'velious ui' please, if I could move the window, I would keep a paused game up while I fight! =O<P>I think adding a few card and dice games to keep in the rp spirit would be a good move. I think that gems proves that minigames=good and the outcry against it are largely rp based, so investing the manhours to embed a couple of good card games and dice games would pay off nicely.<P>It would also be nice to gamble loot away from people when you lose the /random &gt;=]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Batman, I like gems but I don't log in to EverQuest for the sole purpose of playing it. It's an enhancement to a game that I pay for, not an integral part of that game.<P>"Spare time" is time spent outside of work, hence, it is not spent working on game matters. Whatever you think about roleplaying, this is simply an addition to the game. Gems is not EverQuest. Your character is not playing gems, you are. It is a game outside of EverQuest, not tied to it at all. It works inside the game, uses icons from the game, but does not affect gameplay in the slightest. If you die because somebody is playing gems, you would die because that person was watching tv or playing PS2 anyway, so what difference does it make? It seems to me to be an attempt at making downtime more bearable, and fun for the programmer too. This was not an attempt to circumvent the real problem. The real problem was not being worked on, for whatever reason. Gems was made and helped, but they wouldn't have used the time spent making gems to fix the main problem, so it was gems or nothing. Of those two choices, I'll take gems.<P>That's my opinion. I wish everyone would stop bashing Verant for trying to add something interesting to the game. There are real things to bash Verant about, so let's keep focused on those and not worry so much about a stupid game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

From a programmers standpoint, that's not a complex peice of code that's going to break anything importaint, at least, has such a low chance of affecting anything at all that it's not even worth considering.  Sure, the time spent making this could have been used to fix some of the bugs, and maybe got a start on some of that old "list", but someone decided to have a little fun and throw this in...<P>From a gameplay standpoint, wonderful idea =)  When my newbie wizard I just created takes some of the dervish camps in North Ro and has nothing to do until the puller calls incoming?  While medding, play a silly little game instead of trying to memorize every stat of all of my spells (lol) and distract myself until i'm needed.  Makes the downtime solo'ing (which I rarely even do, killing something alone is always nice, but working with a group is more enjoyable to me) less painful, adds something to do while your group bickers about something you're really not too worried about, or while wating for that whatever to respawn..<P>Whoever made that suggesstion about a multiplayer chess thingie done like /duel, and the comments about contests/casions, you guys are onto something.  I mean, sure that level 50something guy in planes armor looks cool, but how well does he play /gems?  &lt;lol&gt;  I don't know, but if little things like this became multi-player, espically if actually incorporated into the fantasy environment, I think a lot would be added to the game.  More like players playing something related to everquest then related to the Game Boy, but i'm sure you get my point..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think /gems was a great idea!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  All of my characters are casters, and while memorizing spells it's a great time killer!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And the best part about it is, I can pause the gems game to memorize another spell and just go back to the gems game without having to start over again.  Now tanks can have something to do while his/her team members are medding--no more "doin the moonwalk" or "leap frogging" over medditating folks--now they can just sit down like the rest of us and play a nice game of spells-Tetris. (That's what I like to call the gems game) I give /gems two gnomish thumbs up!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm...they put Gems in the game, and couldn't program it correctly... Yes there are exploits in the game that allow you to play forever, racking up points.<P>Anyway, that's beside the point (that such a simple game to program couldn't be done correctly), but the point of my response here is to request the ability to run nintendo and sega genesis roms in place of where gems is.  You know -- you're meditating and a selection window can pop up so you can overlay Super Mario Brothers, or Comix Zone over the EQ display.<P>With gems, why stop there?  Let me play Rush N Attack or Street Fighter Zero.  That would be much more important than nerfing cleric breastplates IMO.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065325-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065325.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065325-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065325&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065325&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
