</FONT><HR>2500 is way to many. I agree Verants systems cant handle that type of load and give good playing quality to their customers. On Sunday nights when its worse I have nonstop PL and and lag when doing much of anything. I have almost just decided to quit playing on Sunday nights at all. Most of the popular zones are so overcrowded not much to do anyways. I have to tell you that, sure adding exp to other zones might help 5%, but that people go A) Where the loot is and B) Where the zone is known to be safe. No one fights much in zones like MM because you just cant live long in there. And no one fights in COM or Paws because their is no loot to speak of. Last two Saturday nights I went to COM during primetime hours and was the only person there. That is a problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Try visiting some the places on BB as on an average nite Seb has 80 people, Chardok usually has a raid 40-50 , Karnors 50.<P> The servers become unstable at 2500 causing 1500 or more people to be dropped. Its doesnt matter if this is VI's fault or the internets faults as this is an online game. If it crashes at 2500 then best to revise your plans to a more reasonible figure like 2000 MAX at peak times.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is all nonsense Aradune but let me check it point by point.<P>You did post-<P>Hi all,<BR>I wanted to bring up this issue officially and also talk about some aspects of it, and how we are looking to solve some of the issues.<P>First of all, we are working to come up with a new target server population at peak hours number. Our inclination at this point is a number somewhere between 2300 and 2500 players during peak hours. We feel we need to adjust this number because of how much Velious has added to EverQuest's size and quantity of content.<P>- 2500 is way to much because players will always concentrate in certain zones no matter how large the world will be.<P><BR>We also feel that undercrowding is probably more detrimental to the game than overcrowding, in that while crowded areas are frustrating in that there is greater competition involved, there are some advantages to it (help from others when an encounter goes bad, help with CRs, etc.). (No, I'm not saying Overcrowding is good overall -- so please don't misunderstand me). Undercrowding, however, can mean a player can't find anyone to play with, and thus leaves. In other words, that frustration can be worse.<P>Undercrowding comes from your poor design of some zones and the crappy loot in most old world zones now compared to Velious.<P><BR>There have also been some problems with packet loss and link death, specifically on E'Ci, when populations are growing high.<P>- Only on E'CI ? stop dreaming !<P>So, what are we going to do about all of this? <BR>Well, before launching new servers we're going continue to analyze where players are at, what zones are crowded, and what zones are underused. Significant experience bonuses are going in next patch for underused zones (mostly dungeons). <P>- Nonsense again because if you don't have a clue right now about this then you will never get one.<P>With E'Ci specifically we found out that after a recent hardware change, the network interface was incorrectly configured -- last night this was fixed, so please tell us if anything has improved.<P>Also, when there are network problems out there with the Internet and a large group of players go link dead, this can cause zones to go down. We are working on this issue as well.<P>- Ok on these...<P>So, there you have it, both gameplay and hardware solutions we hope will have significant effect. And please understand that any hesitation to launch new servers is due to undercrowding fears only -- if after these adjustments and attempts to better utilize all the zones we have it turns out target populations are lower than we believed, we will launch new servers, both split and new.<P>This has been an issue since the game went online and it is a shame that you don't supply enough servers with the cash flow from 300000 paying customers.<P>thanks, and we look forward to your comments and feedback.<P>- so far for my comments and feedback.<P>Pwynn<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I say that Saturday, E'ci was absolutely terrible. Saturday I was dropped from the server several times, many times with the error stating that I still had an existing character in the game.<P>Sunday, was better. I only got dropped twice and I'm certain it was on my end (cable modem lost sync).<P>I appreciate seeing it addressed, though I must say one of the GMs in General Chat was rather useless (sorry to say that). I can understand they have a difficult time sifting through spam and it must get tiresome to constantly repeat the same answer as more people hop in to ask it. (I'd almost think of it as a way of punishing a GM - that's it you're on GenChat duty for the week!)<P>But constantly posting a message that simply refers to the Tech Support is rather insulting/annoying, especially when you are simply trying to find out what the problem with the server was and whether someone was working on it or not - and doing so politely.<P>One GM was helpful in saying that a few zones had issues and were being looked at, that simple answer was appreciated. The redirection to Tech Support wasn't. (especially since it was a server issue, not a client issue)<P>(possible help for GM?) <BR>Something I noticed, was that banner that was at the top saying welcome to General Chat. Perhaps when there is a server issue a GM can modify that message to be informative as to the state of the server or any servers for that matter. It might save the GM from having to repeat themselves.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Over all some good changes.  Will these changes have big effects on overcrowding? Yes with a big IF..IF your server is just busy, getting crowded but NOT overcrowded..your life just got tons better, your options just skyrocketed.<BR>  <BR>IF you play on Rathe or the other jampackedin servers, this effect will last 2 days or so till we all flock to the best xp/loot/risk/reward scenario now created.  There are a few reasons why a lot of these places are empty and adding some minor xp bonuses, may only really help the people already used to hunting there.(they like it cuz its empty).  <P>Does this mean you will leave Karnors or Seb for these old dungeons? <BR>I probably wont unless T-staff is randomized and starts dropping in Paw, Droga, Perma....<P>I mean to convey that we will still be overcrowded if we are already overcrowded.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This is my first time posting. Much of what I see on these boards seems to be complaints, *****es and gripes. However, the issue of server overcrowding is a serious one and for once I felt compelled to share my thoughts.<P>When I began playing over a year ago, server population during the hours I play (mostly weeknight evenings and weekends, EST) tended to hover around 1500 people. I never had continual problems with lag, disconnecting when zoning, packet loss or any of the rest. Oh sure, ocassionally conditions were such that the lines were noisey, but it's an imperfect world and I can live with that. <P>Since those glory days over a year ago, the situation had gotten progressivly worse. With the release of SOV, the problems have increased by an order of magnitude. Every time I play, the "lag-o-meter" jumps into the red whenever I hunt in a group, enter a high traffic area (example: Lake of Ill Omen), or attempt any other kind of action that generates a lot of activity. Fighting is a nightmare - I cannot group, cannot solo any high level areas, etc.<P>I have upgraded my modem and the problem remains. Increasingly the game is becomming less fun and more frustrating. What am I to do? I dearly love the game but cannot enjoy it like I used to.<P>Changing my playing time is not feasable. DSL and cable modems are not available in my area yet, and I'm not sure I would want to pay another $40 a month anyway. Sadly, I am left with the conclusion that unless the situation improves in the next few months, I may have to cancel my subscription. I would hate to do this, but what other choices are left to me? How many other players might be facing the same choice?<P>When I hear offical talk of increasing server population to 2500, I cannot see how this helps my situation. When I started 1500 was the target, and I never had a problem with underpopulation, lag, etc.<P>Perhaps servers on your end can handle 2500 people, but from where I sit, the situation has gone from bad to worse. <P>Please make sure this post finds its way to the proper people. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Brad,<P>Experience tells me that you are still reading this thread at this point, so I won't insult you with any comments about my voice going unheard.  Fact is I read a lot but post very little on these boards, but this is one topic that is very close to my heart.  Yes, as you can guess, I also play on The Rathe.  I will be brief in efforts to save at least a couple seconds of your time today.  We are way overcrowded total numbers wise and, have too large a high level population (I personally feel the 1/3 over 46 estimates are a bit low).  Furthermore, The Rathe is holding at approx 3k during peak hours when hundreds of people have abandoned their mid to high level characters already just to start fresh on other servers.  If you split The Rathe just by itself, chances are you could easily have two servers running 2k a piece simply because so many others would come back and play their characters.  <P>As for wanting to see real life proof, next time you are on the East Coast, look me up.  You can come over have a beer or two, and experience your world from a 56k connection with 3k+ people on The Rathe.  Would be fun!  Now, since I didn't write the novella like I originally intended, please take the minute or two I saved out of your day and do some deep breathing exercises...because even though a lot of people (including me?) may have minor points of contention right now, overall you guys are still doing a kickass job.  Take care.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I beg to differ on your peak population numbers.<P>Most players 46-54 want to get their planar armor.  There are only 2 places to get that (fear and hate). So you up the "acceptable" limit to 2500.  That just means more people fighting over an already finite resource. <P>On the subject of SoV...  I have 3 48+ chars, two of which are 50+.  I'd just assume stay in Kunark. <P>Velious is too big, too hard to travel in and not worth the time investment for your troubles IMHO.  Up the XP factor, up the loot tables, it still wouldn't matter to me.

</FONT><HR>On the removal of class xp penalty:<BR>This change makes a chump out of me. After finally pushing my Ranger up to 48th level, on the threshold of being in the top tier, I now find out that lower level Rangers will be able to do so much more easily.<P>You have, in effect, robbed the RL time I invested in the character. New players will spend less real life time to get where I am. This is wrong. <P>It may seem "fair" in that you are not changing the xp curve itself, but this is FALSE. You are changin the curve or RL time required to level, this is the real baseline measure of EQ advancement. <P>After finally escaping 45 hell level I now discover that new rangers will be given a speed pass. Good for them. Bad for me.. the existing <BR>player.<P><BR>On Dungeon XP...<P>As for Dungeons being unpopular.. you missed the problem. The problem is not bind points. The problem is not xp. The problem is One way dungeons. How can I go to a dungeon as a non-caster to find a group if I am immiediately stuck upon entrance? <P>Give dungeons a top level "waiting" area where people can play before the assemble a group to go deeper. Dalnir is a good example of this type of design, I notice you dont have to change the XP for that one.<P>Dungeons like Kaesora and Droga will always be unpopular ourside of the caster farming community because of their "one way" nature. Until that changes, the popularity of these dungeons with non-gating classes will not change.<P>Regards,<P>Roeg Woodsruin<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune / Absor,<P>I play a 56th level Ogre Shadowknight on E'ci. Its my only serious character and I've been playing since P4. I have a pretty good grasp on what happens as these server population numbers continue to grow. Linkdeaths, spawn fights, and uncompletable quests are plaguing E'ci and likely other servers as a result of there being high population around the clock.<P>The inability to connect or stay connected is your only real (legal) concern. We're playing for a service and when it gets so bad (E'ci last week) that we can't even stay connected, there is a legitamate legal concern on the part of a customer.<P>Hopefully legal concerns arent the only thing your worried about. Everquest servers are a community where our characters "live". Overcrowding is causing people to fight over things that their character could really benefit from. Abashi always beat us over the head with phrases like "No one is entitled to any item!!". But really, its a game and we want to be able to work towards getting things for our characters in your game. Let me cite a couple of examples of in-game rewards that are currently "way to difficult" due to overcrowding.<P>Example 1: 39th level Druid Velious spell, Ro's Fiery Sundering. Drops off one mob, very rare spawn. I dont have exact numbers but I would imagine E'ci has 500-700 druid characters (active or inactive) that have the required level to cast this spell. At any given time there will be 5-7 druids stalking the area where the mob spawns. I've talked to normally good people that have said if they saw the mob pop, they would attempt to "KS" it regardless of who "got there first" simply because there is no other way in the game to earn the spell, and no way of just "getting-in-line" for it.<P>Example 2: SK epic quest. How could you make it any harder than to require a component that comes from a god that spawns once every eight days and 9 times outta 10 wont have the component anyways? With so many SKs on this server, no matter how much time, energy and devoution you put into trying to acquire the Epic Weapon, you'll still encounter battles with other SKs over the parts for the Epic since they are so rare. At any time Cazic Thule is up, there will be about a dozen shadowknights in the zone that have been there since break-in. Too many players means too many Shadowknights (just as it means too many of other classes).<P>Finally, Uncompleteable quests plague a overcrowded server. In Everquest, NPCs will tell you "Go kill ThisGuy00, and bring me his head!". Sounds exciting enough, problem is when you get to where ThisGuy00 is, all you see is PlayerCamper76. I started working on some quests upon SoV release. None of them I have completed except one. The one I only completed out of SHEER LUCK alone. I would start a quest and find that a part of the quest is "camped" and would be for an indefinite amount of time. I moved to another quest and got the very same result. In fact let me tell you a story about what happened to me trying to complete a quest. The quest involved killing Tigerraptors in Wakening lands and acquiring their "guts". I went to Wakening lands to find the tigerraptors. What I found were 5 other people in 2 different groups doing the same thing. I raced around the Wakening lands to try to be the "first" to engage a newly spawned tigerraptor. One time I pulled a Tigerraptor and things went bad. I ran to the Skyshrine zone and engaged it there. I yelled for help (/yell). One of the other groups there killing Tigerraptors came up to me and watched! They sat and watched as I was dying! 2 of the three group members of thiers had a heal spell but wouldnt use it. One had the nerve to ask me "You need guts?" while I /yell 'ed for help. When I replied 'Yeah' He sat down and watched the rest of the fight, not lifting a finger to save me. I barely survived, and of course there were no guts. Aradune, Absor, they wanted me to DIE over this! Disgusted, I logged off. This is how quests work on E'ci. A player can not just move on to a different quest, all quests that have a meaningful reward to any player over 10th level is already being done, always. <P>This is why E'ci and the other high population servers NEED a split. Undercrowding isnt a very big issue at the high levels. You make friends you play with your friends. Overcrowding is FAR worse. Not being able to complete quests and not being able to acquire class specific spells/items is a far worse fate than having "nobody around to save you or help with CR" =P<P>Thanks,<P>Xilr Gnomegobbler<BR>56th Revenant of Cazic Thule<BR>Souls of the Shadow, E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't often post here, but I felt like I had to add my opinion to this whole thing...<P>I play my third and fourth characters in Lake of Ill Omen. Lovely zone, together with 120 other players... if it drops to 90 at any time, that is like a breath of Fresh air. Anyway... why do I hunt there? Well, because at my current levels (17 and 26) these are the best places to hunt... Would I hunt elsewhere? HELL YEAH! What would it take though? More exp to go to a badly designed zone? Or better drops?<P>At this point in time, I'd rather see that you implement more armor/items/stuff and put them in the updated zones, rather than just up the exp. No matter how GOOD the exp is, if the zone is so bad you can't hunt there because of massive training due to the pathing, pets running wild, spells having funky effects etc, no one is going to risk it.<P>Anyway... hopefully you'll do that later... oh, and... WE WANT ROBE GRAPHICS!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Yours sincerely,<P>Noor Stormweaver<BR>Half Elven Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to comment about the population and the evercamp situation.<P>It's gotten so bad that I will not even attempt any quests. No matter how many times you try and randomize drops you still put the quest items (for the good stuff) on named mobs that spawn in one place. You don't want us to camp yet you create the camping situation.<P>I also want to comment on one aspect of Eci (please jump in other servers if you see the same thing) and that is uber guilds who take over... yes take over rare mobs. They time the drops be it 1 day or 7 (yes I know there is some variation in spawns but these people have no life and they assign people to watch for them) and they take over the spawns for one reason... you have made it so that the good drops REQUIRE multiple high level parties to kill. I'm specifically talking about almost all the dragons, and other named mobs.  It's even so bad on Eci that I hear one of the uber guilds is now farming... yes SELLING epic quest items!<P>About a year ago you said you were going to make the quests in larger parts that each part could be done in 2-3 hours instead of one rare spawn that required an evercamp. What happened to this? The epic quests have tons of parts but half of them are super super hard or super rare. This was supposed to make it easier to do quests and keep people from having to camp long hours. For example: XYZ item instead of 2 long camps or 10+ hours each we would have 10 camps of 2 hours.<P>The entire aspect of the game post 50 has changed as almost all the areas need multiple groups in order to hunt in. These 2+ groups are hard to come by, balance and organize and require raids. Was it your intent to make the vast majority of high level zones require major raids? The popular zones for high level are the ones in whihc you can still get a pickup group and fight in ONE party. Karnors comes to mind.<P>What a shame that so many high level places go unused. Part of the problem is from my prior post - VERY poor port locations and the other is the major raid requirment.<P>What would be wrong with allowing pickup single group raids in the beginning areas of these zones but still require major raids deep in the zone? I'll use Vesham's Peak and the hole as examples. You cannot even enter these zones without a raid. AT least in Karnors, SolB and a few other popular spots... you can at least enter the zones and attempt to find a small group to pickff yard trash. <P>While we are talking about it... the planes situation is just plain crazy. Who goes to the Plane of Air of a regualr basis? It's mostly empty because it's too hard and costs too much. Raids to the planes requires a large number of people and a HUGE time investment. You put drops for some classes in only one or the other hate or fear. I can go on and on. I heard rumor that you will be "fixing" the planes as the loot drops is crap compared to the expansion drops.<P>In closing... split the major servers or fix the PL and adjust the entire game to allow for the extra 1000 people over original design and one last non-related item... I would like to speak to the designer of the Druid Class and ask what the heck they were thinking making our port spells not only drop (Ports are an integral part of our class and we pay a penalty in other areas because of this ability) but drop deep indoors that require a large high level raid to even get a chance at a drop. Was this a SICK joke? Druids are one of two solo classes and the one true outdoors class so you place our port spells deep indoors, make them rare and REQUIRE a group. Inexcusable. You want us to spread out and use the almost emply expansion zones yet you make us jump through so many hoops to get there either by holding our port spells hostage or coming up withy this strange kunark port/run to karnors/evac requirement.<P>Any other comments on this? I can't tell you how many times people have not even attempted certain zones as it was just too much trouble getting there in large numbers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think it is well known that the servers, per se, are a bunch of connected boxes with their loads distributed across them.<P>The problem is that some of these aren't powerful enough to handle the loads, and as well, their communications channels aren't powerful enough to handle the data going through them.  It think anyone actually looking at the high level zones can see this quite clearly.<P>What I'm saying is that at the high end, where we all wind up, in zones such as Old Sebilis, we have so many people in there doing so many things and even zone in is so crowded that we all feel the lag bite us in the ass.  Time and again you can see this.<P>Most of us know that ultimately everyone winds up where we are.  We wind up in Old Sebilis trying to get a few nice items, just like LGuk.<P>In reality though, distributed systems such as this aren't the answer to this game.  The game is a game of quests and exploration while socializing and interacting with others.  With a server, even if people are spread out, we never can have that exploration.  We can't do our quests without bumping into one another and conflicting.<P>Think back to your days of playing single player D&D.  You were there in the dungeon doing your thing.  Maybe you were in a game with 6 people, or whatever, but you were there with your own goals exploring and doing dungeon crawl.  With EQ you can't do that and never can.  They could have done it by adding servers regularly and letting splits occur freqently but they didn't do that.<P>In essence the game is what it is today because of the failure to split and keep populations down.  It has become evercamp due mostly to that fact.  This isn't to say that people wouldn't have camped for goods and experience, they would have, but they would also have been more prone to step up and move to a new area or take the challenge of dungeon crawl.<P>Difficulty of mobs in the most recent expansion and some changes to zones and mob difficulty are directly related to overcrowding on the servers.  Look at if from that perspective and you can see what I'm talking about.  Had we had lower server populations there would be little need to make a mob or a series of mobs that required huge numbers of people to kill.  Epic quests would have still been epic yet they could have been accomplished by far fewer people--fewer because they would have been forced to make the epic encounters more realistic.  By the vary nature of overcrowding do we have hugely difficult mobs programmed into the game.<P>So, in essence, the distributed nature of the server is not relevant.  It can't be.  The reason is that not all 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s are in the same zones.  We are already distributed and we still have the same problems.<P>Yes, in places like the DL we have 30s, 40s, and 50s, but the number of 30s is low, the number of 40s is high and the number of 50s is low, yet this zone is so crowded as to cause signficant lag and disconnects.<P>When it comes to the inevitable 50+ range people will be all congregating in the same zones.  Velious with its 100K hp mobs makes it extremely difficult to encourage people to move out of known zones.  It isn't just a change in play style.  It is purely an issue with how overwhelming the groups must be to defeat one mob that drops one simple item when it took teams of 30-40 people to drop the mob.  Some of the encounters in Velious apparently have the need to have people take multiple deaths to defeat them and yet only a single average item is dropped.  This isn't encouragement to move out into Velious.<P>Verant created Velious to spread people out, but because they made the encounters of such a nature that it requires so many people to succeed that they defeat the purpose of decentralized processing power on a zone by zone basis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fennin Ro also encounters similar lag/ld problems as mention for some others servers. In PoG last night with 30 people, we had on average 2 LDs per combat. That's after telling folks to turn down their video setting and dispelling dmg shields (spam) and everything else we could think of. Similar happenings occurred recently in PoH and Wakening Lands.<P>No knowing your architecture or what your cpu/memmory/network utilization is, we can't offer the correct solution, but something needs to be done. Either split the server (to reduce the load) or increase whichever resource is needed (machines, memmory, cpu, NICs, whatever). Something is wrong with Fennin, and it sounds like we're not the only ones having these problems.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Over the past 2 months, Brell has grown considerably.  So has the packet loss anytime the server hits 1800+ people.  Lagg spikes are making the game near unplayable.  Raids of 30+ people die from massive LD and Lagg spikes.  And Verant wants to raise it to 2500+ people?  There is no way the current hardware setup of Brell will handle that.  Ironically, I can go to Tarew Marr with the same amount of people logged on and get 0 (zero) packet loss.<P>20-50% packet loss on 640K ASDL line is unacceptable</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A split to The Rathe etc. will help your overcrowding (finding places/things to hunt) problems, but it will not necesarily help the lag problems that have been massively evident since the DX7 patch.<P>I play on several servers, including the very highly populated Prexus and the very underpopulated Luclin. Since DX7 and even more so since Velious I have experienced constant LD, lag and disconnection problems. They are patchy and sometimes worse than others, but they can be as bad UK weekday morning (400 players on Luclin) as late UK Sunday night (2400+ on Prexus).<P>I have done all the tuning and fixes recommended to little effect. Sometimes the lag is indeed ISP/internet based but there is a separate and very distinctive EQ-only problem which is the much-mentioned packet-loss crescendo followed by either brief stability or disconnection.<P>I have 3 ISPs and when this problem exists it exists on all of them. I also have two pcs running EQ and 2 phone lines and again this problem either affects every combination or none. Other lag problems disappear when I change ISPs but this one is wholly intractable and I am certain it is originating at EQ. <P>If problems have been found on some servers, could you at least check all of them? I am enjoying the game more and more, but ironically I am able to play less and less.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"- Next thing I would like to see is a portal in Qeynos hills."<P>Please.... oh this would be SO well received! <P>On the topic of hardware issues/populations for The Rathe server:<BR>1) I agree with everyone that has stated that the demographics of The Rathe are unbalanced and that it desperately needs a split to change to demographics more toward what the designers intended.<BR>2) With the numbers that were on The Rathe yesterday, even the Planes were affected, and you can hardly call those a highly populated area. I was participating in a Hate Raid yesterday and for the entire day I was averaging 3000 to 5000 ping, with a few spikes up to 6000. At least a half dozen disconnects occurred during resurrections, causing more than a little concern each time it happened. <P>And before you ask: yes, I am on a cable modem.<P>I honestly feel that unless major hardware and/or software changes are made to eliminate or minimalize the effects of a large number of simulatenous connections that the target population of 1800 - tops. (Unless you are attempting to drive your customers into the arms of another game-company.)<P>Lags like we have been experiencing on The Rathe are definitely the biggest problem for the online communities. The understandable frustration engendered by the results of those lags is more than enough to make more than a few people just stop playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My two coppers...<P>There are plenty of zones to handle the population but need to retune and fix the oddball pathing on a majority of them.  Paw and MM come to mind when I think of retuning... whew too many mobs in one tiny area.  Well that might be ok if the pathing didn't make half the castle or dungeon show up on you.  City of Mist also would be an excellent zone if not for the mobs aggroing through walls and such.<P>You have the zones, you have the loot, now fix the current zones that are are buggy and the population might spread out a bit.<P>I would be curious to see some percentages of people on each island or area during Peaktimes.<P>Odus, Antonica, Faydwer, Kunark, Velious and Planes.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Adding my take.<P>Several issues here that I can see. <P>First of all, many people in mid level servers such as mine, brell serilis are advocating for a split. I've seen us in the 2400 range a few times (on mid-weeknights suprisingly) but still I don't see many problems as far as mass overcrowding in all the zones and thats really not the reason to my knowledge why they are screaming for a split. <P>From what I can see its all about specific uber mobs, certain things like Venril Santhir, Trakanon and the planes are the concentration of the server and they are the ones that tend to be overcroweded.<P>Secondly, now that you've givin us percentages for ZED modifieries in certain zones your telling us what zones you want more populated. (I also see that the only 50+ dungeon is the hole which had the largest increase thus lvl had something to do with it).  I totaly like the idea, I'm all for more exp, but I think your trying to lure people where they don't want to go by paying them more money. Ulitmatly you're gonna have the same to risky for the exp problem.  <P>My solution, as other peoples are just retool the dungoens so that they are more suited to your purpose, I'm sure if you talked to some people on a server that have tried those zones like I have with the hole I'm sure we could tell you what stoped us dead in our tracks.<P>Get my quick Hole notes.<BR>You have a keyed door, which you can exploit but, why have a keyed door which most people can't get the key for?<BR>Invis, nor invis-undead work here, so once a group goes down, your stuck like that untill CoH'ed in (How many groups/raids can really have a 55 mage?) or group restarted.<BR>One group can only go so far...I've taken one even two excelent groups (50-55) down to the room prior to the first city, and every time we got demolished. The room is almost a death trap and after I realized that we could go no further, I quickly got bored with the zone and never bothered going back. We probably could have gotten past with perfect pulling and lots of tricks, but thats for a raid, I dont want to go through all those hoops for a exp group. I have explored the zone, thanks to some tricks and its an amazing zone, I'd love to be down there killing stuff with my 5 other good buds, but were stuck at the entrance to the castle totaly bored.<P>Also, if you want certain dungeons populated more, here's a tip. Populate it with Enchanter and Cleric drops, because they are the ones that control the groups. I'd suggest making it pretty rare loot so they have to keep going back. =) (If polar bears droped a 20ac 10wis 10sv cold uber rare random drop bracer, they would be camped HARD)<P>Lastly, I just think a few port places need adjustments. <BR>The two relocations need thier dungeon requierments removed. <BR>Skyfire should atleast be walled off so nothing paths in there and we can make a break for zone. <BR>West Karana should be put at the other side of the zone.  <BR>Abscond safe spot in DL should be moved to the inside of the tunnel of FV.<BR>A port to everfrost would be nice. (lowest lvl possible please, it would benefit the people who want to go to perma the most)<BR>A port to Western Wastes would be awesome.<P>Thanks.<BR>Justise </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
