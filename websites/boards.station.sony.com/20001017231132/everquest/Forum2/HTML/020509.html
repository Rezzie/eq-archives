</FONT><HR>On saturday I and a couple of friends was in OOT waiting for AC to show up. Now, he did show up twice during the whole day so I got one ring and anther of my friends got one ring. The others that were there didn't get a ring but we hoped they would get one when we go there another day.<P>As I looted the ring I noticed it had good stats for an int caster so I put it on my wrist and wore it the rest of the day.<P>On sunday I logged on still wearing the ring of ancients on my wrist.<P>Then I figured why not do the quest as my friends hadn't logged on yet. I am from europe and my friends are from the US and will naturally log on much later than I do.<P>So, I went to bank and got the gold coins and then to commons and got a shadow rapier.<P>Happily I ran to Rathe Mtns in search for Hasten.<P>Hasten was found and I walkned near him. Now, I would do this quest the proper way to make sure I didn't foul up...so I wanted to hail him...<P>Now, I am also completely fully loaded so after looting that shoadow rapier I had one item too many so I carried an item on cursor and ran off to Rathe Mtns and when I got near Hasten I switched that item with the ring of ancients as I was about to give him that item.<P>Now, I clicked on him, but I was too close, so i got the trade window up. I tried to hail him but it didn't work. Confused and slightly over nervious that things might not work I cancelled the trade.<P>ACK!!!!!<P>Normally the ring would go back to my inventory, but as I said, I was already completely full and then normally the item would have dropped on ground but this ring is no drop so it doesn't drop on ground - it vanished.<P>I had to abort the whole quest, no boots for me, after camping the AC the whole day.<P>I /petitioned and first an apprentice guide asked me about it and I told my story to him about what happened and he said he couldn't do anything, it would take a real GM to handle this issue.<P>Much much later (like midnight my time sunday) a GM showed up and I again repeated my story. He went and checked the logs and couldn't find anything in logs. No mention of the ring of ancients on my person in any log.<P>Now, I am 100% sure that I wore the ring on my wrist when I logged on sunday morning, so if he didn't see any trace of the ring it must mean one of the following is true:<P>1. He didn't really check the logs properly.<P>I don't think this is the case and another gm assured me that if this gm said he checked the logs he had really done so. You may call me naive but I believe he really did :-)<P>2. He didn't check the logs at the proper time.<P>I am not from the US, my concept of 'sunday morning' etc is very different from california. He may have misunderstood me and checked 'sunday morning' californian time. However, I did contact him after he said he couldn't find it and stressed that I am from europe and that 'sunday morning' my time is around midnight californian time. I didn't get any response from him after that so I assume he was aware of this and still couldn't find any trace.<P>3. The logs doesn't really enlist what a character is wearing when he camp/log in.<P>In this case there's really no point for him to search in his logs, we all know in advance that there isn't anything for him to find. So, I wonder what he was doing when he said he was 'searching the logs'. In any case, if this is the problem they should have given me the benifit of doubt and not assumed I was lying about the whole thing. Neither me, nor my character has a habit of lying.<P>I even sent an email to the gms stressing both the time zone issues as well as clarifying what happened. I have gotten no response from that email.<P>Sigh, I guess I just have to go and camp that AC again, but on sunday while I was busy with this /petition thing I also tried to get a shot at the AC. However, in OOT it was camped from I went there in the morning my time (around midnight US time) until way past midnight monday morning (yes, I got late due to the /petition talk-with-GM thing) that's more than 24 hours.<P>SO what's the deal? How can the GM claim that he can't find any trace of me wearing the ring when I am very certain I had it. If a bug made it disappear from the logs, why didn't it disappear from my inventory when I logged in? If it was in my inventory when I logged in, why isn't it in the logs? What item did the log show I wore when I logged on on sunday morning? What kind of fantasy item did it name? If the logs doesn't enlist such items, why do the GM's claim they spend time to search the logs when you know in advance that the logs won't show anything?<P>Anyway, I will try to make an attempt on saturday but it is very unlikely I will get it. The AC's are one of the most camped critters in the game and I have spent 20 levels trying to get that ring, yes, I could probably have gotten it long ago if I had KSed some other guy who were trying to get the ring, but I'm not the kind that does that. I have had enough of bad luck in concerning that ring. Just before I got it, a guy in the group went to South Ro while the rest of the group was in OOT and lo and behold, AC spawned near him and he solo'ed the critter. He called me to gate to south ro and I did...problem was, that by the time I got there and found the AC corpse, some lame druid had snatched the ring.<P>As the ring is no drop/no trade the GM's wouldn't do anything about it either, they asked the guy who killed the AC why he didn't loot the ring (he already had jboots) and had no sympathy for the fact that he waited so another group member could come and loot it.<P>Why did I take so long time to gate? well, for a wizard, the south ro gate is really a group evac so you have to run suitably far away from the rest of the group before you can cast it, and then the damn spell fizzled on me once and then failed to work a second. Third time I came to south ro platform and ran north to DE camp and then looking for the corpse....when I found it, I couldn't loot it because it was alreayd looted by somebody else, a druid who just grabbed the ring in front of our noses.<P>Again, on sunday when I came to OOT two people sat there waiting for AC to spawn, 15 hours later they still sat there but after 16 hours I finally got a tell saying they got the ring. So at 4am monday morning I could go and camp the AC and wait another 16 hours for it to spawn? Get real. I was already far too late and got too late for work on monday as it was.<P>It really makes me question if I should continue to play this game. Their logs being obviously lacking in many ways yet unless these lacking logs positively states what you state, you are assumed to be bull****ting them. Guilty until proven innocent. I know that many of the petitions that the gms get are fake and people do it in the hope that they will get some free item. However, I would believe that it is like 2% of the population making 98% of those fake claims. People who has never petitioned before about such items should at least be assumed innocent until proven guilty. IF I was a dishonest person and really didn't have the ring as I claimed and your logs positively states that I wore some other item on the wrist. Then the gms can act the way they did to me, it would be fair. Actually, they could do more (temporary suspension comes to mind) but I am very certain that I really did have it, so when their logs doesn't show it, then it is the log that has a problem. Why do they then push the problem on me? How on earth am I going to be able to prove anything when the logs are the only proof they accept and their logs isn't good enough?<P>To spend so many hours in a game, I have spent more than 80 hours no my level 51 wizard (yes, I have leveled slow at times, wizards is a hard class to play, you die often and generally always having low money - I just recently got an SMR and then only because I bought it from a good friend at a cost way below normal cost and even including a loan, I had 2k in bank when I bought it - so, I have leveled slow. I am not the kind that farm items and get rich, I am now almost able t pay back that loan (I still owe him 1000pp but I have around 1000pp in bank now so I am able to pay him back). Yet, when I say I had a ring, and I have friends in the group who saw me loot it and it's a no drop item so it's not like I could have given it away or anything and if I purposely destroyed it just to petition to get a new one, well, other people may have a hobby of bugging GMs but I don't.<P>Is it really that difficult to either<P>1. State that the logs simply doesn't show what items you wear when you camp/log in and the whole thing of 'searching the logs' was just Verant giving me false hopes and assurances that they were doing something for me.<P>2. State that the logs show it but the gm didn't check at the login time becuase he checked at the wrong time (sunday morning california time is sunday afternoon my time and by that time I had already lost the ring) and therefore admit that he didn't really check the logs properly and admit that he made a mistake.<P>I am very certain that one of these two applies to the problem at hand. In either case, just stating that "we can't find any trace of that items in our logs and are therefore unable to do anything about it" and consider the case closed is really not acceptable by any standard. Again, I am very certain I had it so if it doesn't show in your logs, your logs are wrong, it's really that simple. If your logs aren't wrong, then it WILL show up and if you search your logs as you claim you WILL find it. Again, it is really that simple.<P>Xamar Lightseeker of Felwithe<BR>Level 51 Channeler (wizard)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, my inventory is mostly filled with runes and I never seem to get the right combos so that I can make any of the spells, for each spell that require 3 runes I seem to have 2 of them and lacking the 3rd...so I end up carrying them around...<P>Anyway, I did manage to get some free slots after this happened and I have now a few slots free.<P>Yeah, I know it is kinda silly to have all slots used but I think it is kinda hard to lose the ring of ancients because of it. However, the issue here and my question is more on what do the logs really log... it strikes me that they do not log very much even now after they said they had improved the logs and yet they still handle it as if you are guilty until proven innocent and since you can't prove your innocence in any way due to missing logs, you are guilty, period.<P>It is this attitude I am mostly objecting to.<P>Alf<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=020509&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=020509&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
