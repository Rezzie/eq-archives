</FONT><HR>First of all, Soliptic, if you believe that classes other than Clerics, Warriors and Rogues are not useful or required at high levels you obviously have not played your character to high level or are just being ignorant. As for top guilds recruiting Clerics, who isn't? Clerics keep you alive and restore lost exp through rezs. Wouldn't you want someone in your guild doing that for you? There are plenty of Clerics who do NOT join guild XYZ simply because because guild XYZ is an "Uber" guild. I left an "Uber" guild for a much smaller guild because I grouped with the smaller guild members much more often than with the "Uber" guild members.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sobec: *cough*, those 2 spelss don't stack for some Unknown reason...<P>So, either have 1 Level 51 Ranger or 1 Level 60 Paladin along to cast either of their buffs (both being about comparable, but not stacking), since they also require very little mana, no more than 1 of either of them is required.<P>Divine Aura is used to 'place' an uber mob, yes.  Joy, that is my job.  With proper resists, assuming the uber mob doesn't have an unresistable AE, any number of Melee classes can do this via disciplines... not exactly necessary, in my opinion.  Clerics can also do it, as can Necros, although Clerics never would, as it is considered only a function for the 'Paladin' who brings nothing else to the raid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cleric - Required.<BR>Warrior - Yep, you want that damage sponge.<BR>Rogue - Uber damage? I think you have them confused with Monks. Good melee damage and god help you if you don't have one and you don't have the key to that blasted door to Nirvana.<BR>Magician - CoH only? While a great spell it is not the only reason to have a Mage along. Pets and DD's are.<BR>Monk - Highest melee damage. Most are very good pullers.<BR>Enchanter - Required if you pull more than you wanted. Not to mention mana replenishing spells for all casters in the party.<BR>Shaman, Necro, Druid and Ranger - I'll go along with not required but are very beneficial for buffs, DD's, DOT's, melee, pets, etc.<BR>Paladin - Not required but again, beneficial for their tanking/meleeing and even their secondary healing abilities.<BR>Wizard - Again, not required but if you're going after "big game" you want their DD's no doubt about it.<BR>Bard - The "Jack of all classes". Not required but have you seen how fast your mana regens with that 55th level song? 'Nuff said.<BR>And finally:<BR>SK - Not required but I will tell you this. THE best puller I've ever had the pleasure to group with was an SK. Throw in that they can melee and semi-tank and they make a great addition to any group/raid.<BR>I guess my point here is that I find all classes useful on the high end. Use what you have wisely and you'll be pleasantly surprised how effective you can be.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not all servers are controlled by uberguilds. I've level through on few and on different servers.<BR>However, and I speak from experience in a time when everyone above level 40 knew each other, clerics do get snatched up by uberguilds. <BR>It's easy to do and if you were a cleric why wouldn't you do it.<P>Uberguild gets ready to raid such and such a place. They invite Xcleric01 and Xcleric01 sees places and kills mobs that are all new to her. Xcleric01 might even get a Xphatl3wt01. A few of these trips and cleric leaves.<P>There are a few classes that are better in raids. Whether you believe it or not(and I do) that is the perception. And if people percieve ClassY to be better then ClassZ in the high game raids, then ClassY will get the invite.<P>The reason clerics stand out is that there are so few of them at the high ends that they are a prized commodity.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its guilds like that, who make me sick.  They are the farmers who tend to ruin it for the rest of us who want to go after something.  Not that everyone is that way, but alot are, and its real dissapointing, to bring a guild group in, only to see 2 level 60's camping something my level 45 to 50 group can take.  I'm not saying my guild is uber, hell, we have now "FINALLY!" three full groups over 46.  Two over 50.  Hell, our highest level member is 55.  I am looking forward to going into sebillis, and chardock, and charsiss here in the future, but I have to ask, what fun is it, if there is little risk to your guild, or character.  I mean, if you have all level 55 + going on a hunt, where to you hunt?  Do you farm stuff just so you can "twink" your newbie characters?  I want to know what your motivation is.

</FONT><HR>Slayer,<BR>Its an uberguild bashing post, not a cleric bashing post.<P>You can't really bash clerics or any class for that matter. That would be like saying everyone from France is rude. You could however say "I don't like clerics that watch me die", or "Rude French people are rude."<P>Uber is a prefix to a guild and in this specific context refers to the highest of guild. Even more than that (plenty of non-uber guild have level 60 people) it refers to guilds that organize and attempt raids into the hardest parts of the game that are known. Even more still, I would take this context to refer to the guilds, that like the one mentioned above in another post, choose/recruit/invite members based on the "what can you do for me philosophy."<P>The problem, and it is real on some servers is not that clerics are bad people or even the Uberguilds are wrong. The problem is that clerics are very hard(read - boring) to play to the highest levels and there are few of them. They are 100% needed on all large raids that the context of this post seems to refer to.<P>Because the Uberguilds have more to offer the clerics then the smaller guilds that Clerics get a choice between doing new stuff and getting new l3wt(which is why we play right? This isn't meant to be Visial ICQ and doing new stuff is the most fun I've ever had in EQ) vs doing the same little raids many times and chatting. <P>What would you do?<P>If you read this far, great. That was a tangent =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thats not the way I read it.  I read it as just another "clerics are too powerful" post.  Had I responded with something like "Yeah, lets let druids and shamen heal like a cleric" he would have applauded me.<P>And as you say playing a cleric is very hard (read: boring) until high level (for those that actually worked for it and not PL'd).  Now im finally reaching the levels my class starts to shine, and frankly im getting tired of people trying to nerf them.  All we friggin do (that is unique) is heal better than anyone else.  We don't sow, snare, teleport, evac, debuff, dot and dd.  This is why there is a shortage of clerics!<P>The real problem is there are too many druids etc! Now that they are all high level they are crying how unfair the game is and how clerics have a stronghold on the game.  That is total BS.<P>Also, I see many high level enchanters, monks, rogues, wizards etc leaving guilds to join uber guilds. Its not just clerics and warriors.<P>The problem is everyone wants that phat lewt and gets mad when their small guild cannot get it alone.

</FONT><HR>TrollerDaBoard says "bet that 52SK can make a cleric.."<P>Thats part of whats wrong with EQ IMO.  I can level up a mage, necro, or druid to 54+ pretty easy (even without twinking).  Many of these classes are very easy and fun to play throught almost all their life (well into the mid+ 50's).<P>Then once you do that you can easily twink/pl up an enchanter or cleric without having any idea how hard they are to play at low - upper levels.  Clerics for instance don't shine IMO until after level 44 (49+ really).  <P>I have no problem with powerleveling or twinking, but it is a problem when people post "how powerful" a class is.. Or claim that a class has a monopoly and they dont even have a clue just how unbalanced that class was for its first 50 levels!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Umm maybe you should play on a server without uber guilds.<P>Hmm guess what. Rallos Style pvp PREVENTS uber guilds!!<P>Hmm guess thats another flaw of the pvp switch to add up. No way to police other players. If someone does something like try to steal a spawn from you. YOU KILL THEM. Thats player justice.<P>As for clerics leaving their current guilds to join others. It generally DOES NOT happen. I didn't join my guild for power i join for friends<P>Oberan Lifebringer<BR>54th Vicar of Innoruuk<BR>Gankos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Umm if there were more people that would equate to more clerics so that explaination doesn't hold water.<P>The fact is that there arent ANY Uberguilds on rallos because by definition an Uberguild steps on the toes of other guilds to take what they want.<P>Unless that guild wants to be at war with half the servers it just doesn't happen.<P>Oberan Lifebringer<BR>54th Vicar of Innoruuk<BR>Gankos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053251-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053251-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053251&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053251&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
