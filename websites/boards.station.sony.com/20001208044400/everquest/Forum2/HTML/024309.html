</FONT><HR>here is a possible solution:<P>Ok, so no one really ever asks for anything from a magician unless they are desparate or so far from a vendor or foraging pc that they have to ask - with the exception of sword of runes.  Most of the time I hear the reason behind this being that if you go LD or camp, its all gone.  And so far, all of the proposed solutions have been declined by Verant as either unbalancing or technically impossible.<P>Solution?<BR>Give Magicians a new line of spells that allow them to imbue summoned items with charges.  The item retains its charge until the pc logs in (or re-logs in, in the case of LD) when 1 charge is removed, until there are 0 charges on the item, when it is removed from the pc.  The spell line would increase in power (more charges at each step) to a final, quest only 59 or 60 spell that would allow a mage to make summoned items permanent(that may be a bit much, unless the quest were difficult).  I think this would be feasible technically, and wouldn't cause too much of an inbalance.  <P>Granted, there are a lot of items that a magician summons that are of limited value, but it would make many of the items more valuable to other players, as they could at least make an educated guess how long the item was going to last, and plan accordingly.<P>Since some of the mage items, notably the staffs and ring of flight already have charges, those particular items could vanish when they run out of charges, and be permanent when summoned.  I think this would work, since the majority of the summoned items that have charges are summoned for the effect, not the weapon itself.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since you used the sword of runes as one of your examples I will comment on that.  If a sword had 1k charges on it (meaning you would have it for 1k logins if you kept it in your inventory) then it would remain just as effective as it is now.  Why you ask?  Because the only use I see people have for sword of runs is to give it to their pet.  Once something gets in the hands of a greedy pet you will never see it again.  If a pet's master goes LD the pet dissappears with the swords.  So you see, charges on a weapon mages summon are not going to increase the usefullness.<P>I am almost positive that Verant will never allow a mage to summon a permanent item so that point is mute.<P>As far as the ring and staff being charged items, I doubt those items will be changed either.  If Verant wanted the ring of flight to be better they would have done so.  It only has 2 charges for a reason....because they don't other levitateing classes to have no reason for the spell when they could find a mage to give them a ring with alot of charges.<P>I am positive that the mod rod will not be changed either.  The mod rod is a single charge item for a reason.  It is lore for a reason.  If the staff had lets say 10 charges and would stick around if a person goes LD, then what you have is something called a manastone.  Verant already said that the Manastone is a balance issue, and any modification to those mod rods would cause a balance issue.<P>*Disclamer* I am a Ranger, but I have friends who are mages.  I find that LD does cause problems for summoned items, but I would find it more of a balance issue if they were not no-rent.<P>-Uladar<BR>Luclin Server<BR>50 Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since my original post was misunderstood, perhaps I should clarify.  Items that have a proc, such  as the sword of runes, are already useful enough.  But how many people ask for a dimensional hole to hold stuff?  None, because they don't want thier "stuff" to vanish along with the bag if they go link dead.  Now if the bag had say, 3 charges, they would know that they could go LD, camp, etc 3 times before the item would vanish.  Items that already have charges would not have the amount of charges changed, but instead would persist until all of the charges were used(persistence could be a spell cast on an item that would also make it no drop, (ie - hand that warrior a ring of flight, then cast persistence on it - much the same way identify works).  So the ring of flight, for instance, would still only have 2 charges, and if you went LD after using  1 charge, it would still be there when you came back.  However, when you used the 2nd charge, the ring would disappear.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If it were only so you had a chance of getting back from a link death before you stuff disappeared I'd be happy.  I really don't think some elaborate chance to summoning is needed, but not let summoned items stick around a little longer after being "locked out". <P>My mage was traveling in Lfay...just traveling...and survived a brownie assault by gating to safety.  She had enough health to use her bandages to outlinve the DOT.  However, she went linkdead, her bandages disappeared and she died before she could rememorize the summon bandage spell and resummon some bandages.  Talk about bad timing.  I find this more funny than anything, but it does point out another problem with magicians and linkdeaths.<P>As for folks wanting summoned items...if I am in a group I get requests enough for various items, food, drink, arrows, throwing daggers, coldstones.  I think this is where these things are useful becuase it allows the group to keep adventuring without having to break up becuase someone needs to go buy an essential.  The dimensional pockets are problematic, but if someone has room, these are even useful to hold loot items worth a few plat that no one might be able to loot and carry otherwise.  If they disappear, well they would have been left anyway, if get to a merchant, then a few extra plat to play with.<P>I personally find all the resummoning of pet and essentials after a link death annoying, but my vote in the end is to work on the linkdeath problem.<BR>-msgnomer<BR>a.k.a.

</FONT><HR>NoRENT items were designed to disappear when people LOG and are supposed to work this way and the SUPER-OBVIOUS plan was for those things to not be subjected to LD but the REALITY is THEY ARE frequently and annoyingly which is really really an Enormous pain!  Lost Pet Lost Dim Pouch full of FS weapons Lost weapons handed to pet, lost food lost arrows, water, bandages and all NORENT items.  <P>This is a key point on the LD issue.  They used to leave your CHR in game unpiloted for like a whole minute or more which was enough time to log back on and have it drop you back into the character before it had been camped.  This was likely because they knew so many things were NORENT and for many LD people they would be trying hard to get right back ON.  So why remove the delay period and make no sort of attempt to adjust NORENT items to survive a 2 minute Linkdead?  There has GOT to be a way they just for some reason do not appear motivated to address this problem.<P>Since they did away with that chance to get back on before being auto-logged they very much need to find a way to tag the account with a logoff time and decide upon login if you have been offline for lest than say 2 minutes and if so not to wipe NORENT items and other summoned items on your characters.  They will say we dont write NORENT items to your saved character then they should ADD them and write them with a datetimestamp.  Or how about this brainstorm have all NoRent items drop to the ground where we are when we log LD so when we come back there is at LEAST a chance they might be there still to be picked up!  Anyone with a desire to find SOME improved solution to the way it is now would think of SOME way to make this very poor current situation BETTER!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually Gordon has explained this in several posts.. <P>1. items used to remain upon going linkdead and only poofed when camped out.. people started exploiting this by /q or pulling the plug on the modem. Verant changed this so items would poof when you went linkdead (instantly), then it was changed so they poofed when your character did (aka left the game coz you were linkdead).<P>2. a ways back Verant made a change so NPC could go though locked doors without opening them to fix an exploit of people getting past locked doors with out a key.  Again people began exploiting this by running at the door and doing a /q (go linkdead become an NPC) then connecting back in from server screen.  Sooo Verant fixed it so you Can't get back in the game till your character has finished going linkdead. This fixes the locked door exploit and screws Magicians.<P>The reason the No-rent items can't be made to stick around is.. the Database is not set up to monitor your character after its left the game. i.e. it doesn't put a time stamp on for linkdeath .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kohrd gave the technical reasons....but I must say after reading the clairification Acherat gave to my post, I kinda like the idea.  Expecially for the dim pocket.  If it had say 3 persistance charges on it and you go LD, you can still come back and have the pocket.  However, after the 3rd charge is gone, the pocket is gone with all contents.  I wonder if it is technically possible for the server to remove a charge on a no rent item?  If so this could solve the LD problems in some cases.<P>However, people pulling the plug on the modem still will be an exploit so the charges must remain small (1 or 2 charges).<P>-Uladar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Uladar  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>More clarification - under my proposed fix, summoned items (not pets) would no longer be "no rent" - they would just have 0 charges to start with.  So if you camp/LD, etc, when you log back in, the server checks your inventory, and kills the items that have zero charges.  If it had a charge, it would subtract one.  Items that have charges, like a staff of runes, for example, would remain because they are no rent...however, if you actually USE the last charge, then the item disappears (honestly, who would hang on to it after all the charges were gone anyway?) - Like a waterstone, it has 1 charge of enduring breath.  You use the charge, it poofs.  Just apply this to those summoned items that contain charges by default.  I haven't really seen any technical issues that would preclude this from being possible, and as long as the number of charges is reasonable, there shouldn't be any balance issues either.  Hopefully we can keep this thread alive long enough  for someone with some clout to respond.  I'll keep posting it and see what happens.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I thought it was a good compromise as the D-bags are the only thing that really concerns me about going LD all the other stuff is a nusiance to resummon but its not as aggrivating as losing a bag of FS weapons coz of a bug or technical glitch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You're missing the point.  Summoned items would cease to be no rent.  My suggestion is to REPLACE no rent with charges.  When the charges are gone, so is the item.  If an item doesn't come with charges to begin with, then a mage can, according to his level, imbue the item with a few charges.  If the item does have charges to start out with, then leave them the way they are, and have them vanish when the charges are gone.<BR>There would be no reprogramming of the no rent flag, they'd just remove it from the items in question and replace it with a charges value. If the item has charges, the no rent goes away again, but, like any other summoned item, it poofs when all the charges are gone.  I don't think this would require much reprogramming at all.<BR>(occasionally, however, I have been known to be wrong  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I remember at one time, where it was suggested that Summoned bags become regular bags on LD, that had no vendor specific value.  This would allow you to use the bags without having to worry about going LD.  Note that this wouldn't change the behavior on camp, just LD.<P>At the time, Abashi had stated that he would look into it.  Admittedly, it would be a low priority item, but I would love to find out if the conversation ever went to the live team, and whether they have put some thought into it.<P>As a mage, going LD is damned annoying. All that wasted mana and time just sucks.  Adding the insult of losing my summoned bags and the contents is even worse.  It's just too damn depressing to have 3 bags full of FS weapons, and have them all destroyed because you went LD.<P>In either case I would certainly like to see someone, anyone really, from Verant answer this issue.  I have been following it for quite some time (since the change actually) and have not seen a SINGLE RESPONSE from Verant on this topic.<P>If someone does have a post where Verant spoke on the subject, I would love to see it.<P>Surbus McBane (lvl 42 Mage, Bertox)<P><BR>P.S. As a side note, there was another issue with LD, that involved duping of items under certain conditions, which would be my guess as to why they are so adamant about not reversing their position on LD.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Acherat's idea about charges has some definite possibilities!  I also think changing summoned bags to normal bags upon going LD would be an outstanding improvement.  Both cases would fix the symptoms of a problem introduced by Verant when they made it impossible to recover from a LD situation.  I still think that the best solution would be to put a timestamp on your character when you camp, log, /q, go LD, etc (there probably already is one).  Then when you log back in, simply check how long you've been out of the game.  If it has been over some specified period of time (2 minutes, 5 minutes...something like that), get rid of no-rent items.  If it has been less than that time, keep them (pets would probably still poof for numerous reasons).  I realize that no-rent items are probably deleted at the time your character exits the game, but I find it difficult to believe that it is a huge change to simply move that code to the logging on process.<P>Thoughts?<P>Yallikin<BR>41 Mage<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My Proposed solutions:<P>1) Drop all no-rent items on logout/linkdeath.<P> If you log in quickly, you can just pick them up off the ground, or if nothing else, free stuff for newbies to snag to survive.<P>2) Summoned bags turn into regular bags on logout/linkdeath, except, they have zero capacity.<P> For example, when they nerf weapons to no longer be allowed in the range slot, if it is already in your range slot it can remain there. Apply this logic to summoned bags upon return, you can take items out of the bag but never put anything into them again. That is, the extradimensional space is slowly collapsing. rendering the bags usless as items are removed.  Only hard part would be dealing with partial stacks of items.<P>easy, easy fixes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I'm not an EQ coder, so I don't know if this would work, but...would it be possible to link no rent items to the caster?  If you log/LD and the item has been summoned by you, it stays.  If someone not the summoner is holding an item and they log/LD it poofs.  I haven't been around during a lot of previous discussion on this, so I don't know that this would fix the exploitation problems but it seems that way.  Also don't know how complicated it would be from a database point of view.

</FONT><HR>Verant is highly unlikely to modify the no rent tag at all.  Especially since it applies to items other than mage summons.  It would be easier in my belief to remove the no rent tag completely from summoned items (which now show as being summoned), and replace it with a charge counter. Since there are other items already in the game that use this feature, it is simply a matter of re-using existing code. Everything they need to implement the idea I'm proposing already exists in the game...thats why I believe it to be technically feasible.

Now, what will you do after you go LD or camp with this bag?<P>I would summon a NEW one and put the items into the NEW one with 2 charges and throw away the old one with 1 charge... <P>It only costs some mana, right?

</FONT><HR>Schue has a valid point-you could summon a new bag and put new charges on it - essentially replacing the old bag at the cost of some mana - granted. The counter-argument is that either way, it STILL costs you mana.  Summon a new one the way things are now, summon a new one under my proposal.  The other point I'm trying to make is if the item were going to be around longer, other players would be more inclined to seek out magicians for summoned items.  And if they wanted a new one, they'd have to find a mage to get one - the important point here is that when an item is "charged" by the mage, it also becomes a no drop. While a determination would have to be made as to whether or not an item could be "recharged", it increases the value of a mage to other players for something besides a backup tank and nukes, as I believe they originally intended.  A mages defining ablility is conjuration - as it stands now, that ability is limited by the reliability of your connection, etc., a non-Norrathian function, and a detractor from one of the coolest things a mage can be, which is a walking general store.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Schue, our point is that linkdeath (which is totally non-roleplay related) destroys the bags and anything in them.  You said "Nobody forces you to use these bags. You do it, because of their advantages and you know their dangers."  This is very true, but the only advantages or dangers that ANY item has should be within the context of the game.  No-rent items can poof for reasons completely unrelated to gameplay - lock-ups, ISP problems, cable/phone company problems, you name it.  Yes it's only mana, but it takes time to get that mana back - time that could be better spent playing the game I'm paying to play.  It costs me between 1 and 2 bubbles of mana to re-summon my items and pet.  What if a tank lost 2 bubbles of health every time he/she went LD?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

WHY WAS THIS CHANGE MADE?!?!<P>the silence is deafening.<P>directly to the locked door thing khord mentioned--i don't buy that one for this reason: even if you did the exploit by pulling the plug and then didn't plug back in/log back on for a whole freaking week why would you not still be on the other side of that locked door? would the server move you back to the other side of the door? as far as i know and have experienced in game, when you go LD your char can continue moving and when you get back into the game you continue at the point where the char finally timed out--not the point where you went LD, which may be far away from the last position you saw displayed on your screen at your end. how would not allowing you to get back into a LD char fix the locked door exploit?<P>i'm sorry to be so long-winded. the heart of what i'm saying is that there is far more to this issue than the mage summoned items part of it. while there is merit in that position, and there are many good suggestions to remedy the frustration and inconvinience that mages are currently suffering, i don't want anybody to forget that this is not solely a mage issue, and to address the mage problems specific to this change while continuing to ignore the rest of us that have issues here would be way out in left field. in the freaking grandstands behind the wall in left field even.<P>do not do that verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Slider-<BR>We all feel your pain.  Once you are declared LD, thats it...you're outta there, and have to log back in as soon as the server resyncs you.  Verant used the change to fix many exploitations with a single, encompassing fix, as most are wont to do in a large, complex program like EQ.  However, what they did not do is go back and address the individual issues that arose from this, which is what we are trying to get at.  Their stance has been "we're sorry, but this is a consequence of the fix".  Our reply is no, there are ways to correct these individual consequences that are no fault of gameplay, and they should be addressed.  Magicians have been the loud and proudest of these people, because summoning was our bread and butter, until you couldn't retain summoned items on going LD because people were forcing LD to retain the items.  It affects a lot of other people who are not magicians, or casters, even.  What we are trying to say is ok, you fixed the large issue, now lets go back and figure out a way to correct the smaller issues that affect the player through no fault of their own.  We have to bring these things up as individual issues, so they will understand what is actually affected.  If you have particular issues you want to address, start and maintain threads on those particular topics.  Your post says they screwed some stuff up, but never says what.  I am singling out the Magician problems because I play a Magician, and LD is adversely affecting an integral part of my class.  You've got to be specific, friend, or you'll fall on deaf ears.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But to have to pay a penalty simply because I chose to use the bags is unacceptable.<P>I suggested in another thread that the dimensional hole spells be changed from a summon type spell to an alteration type, where you cast the spell upon an existing bag. The spells would have specific durations and affects based upon the level of the caster. Upon going link dead the spell effects would vanish, but not the bags themselves. <P>Another idea would be to change the spells so that they require a normal bag as a component and the summoned dimensional hole formed around the normal bag. The normal bag would not be consumed by the casting of the spell. Upon link death the hole would vanish but not the bag.<P>These changes would affect game balance in any way, nor would they cause existing weight reduction bags to become of less value. In fact the only change would be that players would not be penalized by the loss of items due to link death which is something that should never have been allowed to happen in the first place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There's a simple solution to the summoned items problem that Verant has never commented on.  I'll give it for the fifth time:<P>1. Whenever a player disconnects (LD or camp, doesn't matter), the server should add an entry to an in-memory table recording the player name and the time.  60k of server memory would be enough to track the last 1000 disconnects, easily.  If the table is full, throw out the oldest entry to make room.<P>2. Do not destroy summoned items on disconnect.<P>3. On login, look the player up in the table.  If not found, or if found but the time is more than, say, 20 minutes, destroy all summoned items the player has.  Otherwise, leave the summoned items alone.<P>There.  No client changes required, so no patch to download.  No data stored in the player database, so no pwipe required.  Besides solving the LD problem, it also allows players to camp for short periods without losing their items (e.g., bathroom break, pay the pizza guy break, talk wife into not moving out because you play too much EQ break, whatever).  Trivial server resource usage.  Easy to implement, unless the server code is absolutely unmaintainable spaghetti.<P>If you like this idea, start new threads proposing it.  There may be something I'm missing that would make it impossible to do (e.g., summoned items could have a completely different format on the server, making it impossible to keep them across disconnect), but let's at least get Verant to acknowledge the idea and TELL us that it won't work if it won't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, since this post is at least getting some responses from other players, I will post an additional problem with the LD issue here:  No-rent items in conjunction with FA quests.<P>Since I get dumped 75% of the time while zoning, and since my quest requires my transporting a no-rent item from South Karana to Emerald Jungle, it basically makes my FA quest impossible for me to complete.<P>Verant, PLEASE address the LD issue!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kirilian also has a good idea, in changing the dimensional bag series to alteration, and that way the effect wouldn't be bothered by LD...and you just change the spell line to be a weight reduction percentage, rather than creating the item from thin air (of course, that is what mages do, but any improvement would be welcome).  I think this is a great idea for the bag line of spells ( for the bag spell line, this idea is better than mine ).  I would still like to see something done about the other summoning spells, because my problem is that the summoned items were meant to be useful to other players, not just the mage, and as it stands right now, the only things people are finding useful are : sword of runes, bandages, arrows and waterstones.  I frequently offer free summoned items to anyone in the zone.  Many times I have offered other items to players, and they refused because they didn't want any items that vanished on camp/ld.  I think a combination of Kirilians bag idea, and my charges idea for other items would dramatically increase the popularity of mages and summoned items in general. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
