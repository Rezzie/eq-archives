</FONT><HR>My main problem with most of Velious is the Risk vs. reward.  With the High magic Resist of the mobs and the absurdly high HPs of the mobs, it seems almost trivial to even loot a mob because you will more likely get 10g or a few silver pieces.  The loot drop is way to low.  You should get 5pp minimum up to and includeing a rare 100pp drop every now and then.  And as far as Items and Equipment, this too is way to rare, unless you are talking Velium weapons.  Which by the way, I think are way better then Fine Steel weapons but yet they sell for the same price to merchants.  It is too heavy for me to lug all the way back to Antonica to try and sell and the players in velious do not need them.  I generally end up giving any 1HS to my pet to wield.  The rest I sell to merchants.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is kind of a generalization of what I found in the Velious zones.<P>Most outdoor zones were not bad, but most dungeons were insane.<P>Most of the high level dungeons have way to high of difficulty.  You need a BIG group (way more than 6 people) most of the group should be tank classes as the mobs have ridiculous resistance to spells.  What is the point of having great spells if you can cast them on such a large number of mobs?<P>There are a few great new outdoor areas (POG), and a ton of crappy dungeons.<P>Overall I would give the whole expansion a C+, where I would give the first expansion a A-.<P>You can not raise the difficult of the mobs, and keep casters' power level the same (less powerful when you factor resists).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Velious zones feedback-<BR>.Overall feedback.<BR>1. Low xp ratio on mobs for mobs over 50 plus, possibly untended as the raid concept is expanded.<BR>2. Varying Risk vs Reward on majority of zone from Great like Iceclad,EW,Thurgadin,WW,PoG to Complete Crap like Sirens Grotto,Kael Drakken , Velketor.<BR>3. Excellent Icecandy in textures,new mobs, landscape and some wonderful quests / scripted events.<BR>4. Alot of Broken quests , Unfinished quests, Unfinished zones all add to the idea that SoV was rushed to beat the upcoming releases of other MMorpgs<BR>5. Increased mob  HPs on a general scale , Increased MR , Increased damage in line with the "raid" concept. Underconned mobs aplenty.<BR>6. Increased Mudflation mob stats lead to marginalisation of majority of classes due to lack of effectiveness in mob encounters. ( what happen to the dependency? Encouraged class variation? ).<BR>7. Increased Faction situation. Leading to unbalanced risk/reward situations. IE Skyshrine faction seems to be the least useful as equivalent loot from SS mobs and SS based faction mobs does not exist as questable or equivalently gathered . As the result many guilds choose against SS and there is no balance or fairness or reward in not choosing against.<BR>8. Wildly varying Loot rewards vs risk, IE Difficulty of Dain vs Tormax or Yelinek killing, Equivalent Loot from Kunark seems superior overall in many cases for less risk. Many items seem to be too heavy or less useful than expected. IE Black Blade of Torment, 1 handed sword with average stats and a good proc but weights 10.0, etc etc. OTOH alot of loot is balanced is some cases given risks vs reward IE necropolis items etc. Majority of Loot is however poor including many Boss drops like From Velketor, Yelinek etc. <P><BR>-Zone Feedback-<BR>1. Iceclad<BR>Zone in to Velious, made to seem vast and inhabited. But the Majority of the zone is a great big waste of server space and resources. Casual Mobs ( not humanoid or tied to the backdrop story ) do not drop cash . In comparison the majority of equivalent kunark mobs drop cash and are generally weaker to the velious. Nice quests,Great scripting, Lodizal and rare spawns add a spice to the zone. Dervishes designed to kill newbies present and often serve as a deterrent to exploring.<P>2. Tower of Frozen Shadow.<BR> As described earlier all the mobs are generally underconned in terms of difficulty and level. The majority of items dropped partly to encourage appropriate lvl PCs to come, does not . Higher lvl chharacters come hereonce and seldom return. The top lvls challenge PCs greater than the appropriate lvls while resulting in poor loot reward. The necessary collection of 8 keys to advance which are dropppd by random rare spawns also prevent casual exploring. The 8 keys are also soulbound which will explain why many PCs do not bother. All in all, its a waste of a zone.Cant we cobine the keys eventually and when u receive the top key be allowed access to all the tower rather than fumble with 8 soul bound keys??<P>3. Eastern wastes.<BR> Generlly considered one of the more sucessful zones in velious. General mobs do not drop coin, only the orcs/giants  do. Orc camp and various giant, dorf and ulthork areas as well as appropriate lvl drops make this a popular hunting area. Excellent quests/ scripted events exist here. This zon would eb more popular if the animals in this zone ( like many in velious ) dropped items which were more useful generally to the players of eq. Having Low Quality,Medium Quality and high quality skins/pelts which for msot part cannot be used by tailors, or having no coin or low value pieces do not encourage  widespread use. Instead much of the mob turnover is directed at the ORcs in the zone. Excessive mobflation of hps and resistances in comaprison to Kunark lvl mobs mean underutilisation.<P>5. Great Divide<BR> Nice zone, with problems in animal creatures as in EW. Tizmaks, Shardwurms also drop individual type of armor which franky is seldom useful at the lvl gathered. Even twinks turn their noses at them. MObflation evident here.<P>6. Thurgadin/Icewell Keep.<BR> Problems with doorway size, increased mobflation, varying reward vs risk all is balanced against great scripted encounters and generally a complete city for PCs. Unfortunately alot of quests remain broken, risk vs reward for oppsing the dorfs is generally good but increased MR, HPs and damage by NPCs means many classes are even more dependant on the core classes to survive. IE it would be fun if if all the various classes was able to contribute to the sucess of a raid in Icewell keep.<P>7. velketor<BR> Another zone which mob are underconned and lack of risk vs reward management. A mob who quads for 850, has tons and tons of HPs, estimated at 200k plus, should not drop items which cannot be pawned off to the twinks. Kobolds are incredibly underconned, being extremely MR, 5 times the Hps of a same lvl mob in kunark and fights like a lvl 55 mob, yet is considered green to a 60.<P>8. Crystal caverns<BR> Beautiful zone, bad pathing issues, nice risk vs reward ratio. One way zone makes life unnecessary difficult.<P>9. Kael Drakken.<BR> Easy access, great quests, some good risk vs reward drops. But generally this zone is a bad one. Named mobs which are even tougher than expected drop very little  reward for the risk. Some of the toughest mobs in the game are here , yet their drop is pathetic. Faction problems occur as well since The high lvl Tormax faction can be garned by killing mobs in Icewell but Dain faction nor Yelinek faction is not returned Vice Versa. Many top guild have sided with the KD gaints since the reward is substantially greater / easier then with the dwarves or dragons.<P>10 Wakening<BR>One of the ugliest zones around, terrible Frame Rate from even the BEST Hardware computers  resulting from the abundance of trees, lvl 60 mobs wander around, low reward vs risk in most cases.<P>11. PoG<BR> Considered by many great zone others call it too easy. Often this cry is reflected by the unbalanced drops and who has gotten them. Personally i think this is a great zone, individual faction gripes aside. However Drop loot vs quested loot is unbalaned as the drop loot seems easier and equally rewarding, yet quested is harder to obtain /shrug<P>12. Skyshrine<BR> Again risk vs rewrd is out of whack as well as difficulty of faction gathering. ( compared to giant faction ). Many unfinished and broken quests. Underconned mobs. No equivalent quest vs loot drops available.<P>13. Cobalt scar<BR> Great zone, but mobflation is evident here. Genrally not a much used zone due to the lack of named drops with the one or 2 exceptions.<P>14. Sirens grotto<BR> 100% voted by all as the worst zone in the game hands down. Insane mob power coupled with design and pathing issues as well as possibly the worst risk vs reward ratio in the game makes this easily the crap of velious. Worst, the designer who made this obviously was a sadist in making this zone a thruway to enter the deeper zone in velious. Mst high lvl parties just pass thru here as quickly as possible. Uber guild seeking a challenge avoid this death trap.<P>15. Western waste<BR> like Eastern waste is one of the top zones in the game.<P>16. Necropolis<BR> Another top zone with great risk vs reward. However genral zone bugs like pathng, traps not being disarmed and general niggles like mobflation make this still a great zone tho.<P>17. Temple of Veeshan<BR> Top zone with pathing and reward issues like many zones in Velious.<P>18. PoM<BR> Zone is unfinished, enuf said..<P>19. Sleepers Tomb<BR> No access yet...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My big complaint so far is how faction unfairly favors Thurgadin- I dont know of any race combo that is naturally KOS to the coldain dwarves. The dragons are also fairly willing to let you enter safely (though not all factions). Kael on the otherhand requires 3 seperate factions, and unles you follow Rallos zek, you have have 3 factions that must raise to be able to use Kael as a standard city. I have not heard of anyone who has been non KOS to all 3 (or even 2 for that matter) factions of giants in there. This turns Kael into one big dungeon- it's not a city- if you were to use Kael as your city in velious you would have zero player interaction as everyone but you in that city is killing giants, which brings up problems in its own about doing quests etc. It is also easy to be good with both dragons and coldain (in fact killing giants raise both factions!)while  it is difficult to get good giant faction without KOS'ing you with both others. I would LOVE to see faction looked into again for cities, as large races have a hell of a time living in Thurgadin, and using skyshrine as your main city is a joke- its just too deep into Velious (not to mention having to go through Kael to do it, and I already mentioned the problems of that zone) unless your best friend/sidekick is a wizard druid. I agree these two classes should be useful, but they shouldnt be required to go buy bandages from a merchant. What is a KOS to gaints and dwarf 40th level warrior to do?(just an example of a class who is utterly screwed in a very possible scenario- many more can easily be in this situation). Please look into faction again for cites in Velious- I think the option of choosing your city is a great idea, best use of the faction system I have seen, it should just be remotly as easy to get in with one city as another, and Kel certainly doesnt meet risk versus reward- raising 3 factions to become non KOS in a city without any other players doing the same?

</FONT><HR>I would dub Velious "The Big Empty".  The problem is, it take about an hour to get people anywhere in the first place.   Compound that problem with a guild composed of different time zones, sometimes across continents.<P>Aside from the "uber" gamers who seem to have bookoo time on there hands for this sort of thing, it's a logistic nightmare.  Velious adds yet another place someone can be that needs to be retrieved from to go do something or a place you need to get people too.<P>The whole melee bind thing "could" solve the problem, but I know how VI feels about that.  More ports may solve it..<P>Compound this with the corpse retrieval time and it's a mess.<P>As a more than casual yet less than uber gamer, Velious stinks.  It was designed with the 5% in mind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the most part, I like the zones I've seen in Velious. Some of them have had tuning recently and they required that as far as I can tell.<P><BR>The faction game is a downward spiral. IE.. if you have two separate opposing factions and you kill one side, Losing faction with them but gaining faction with the other side at a LOWER rate. Then eventually, as you go back and forth, you will become KOS to both sides. The answer to NOT kill one side is not possible. The race/class faction differences and the fact that even Uber guilds are rarely large enough to create 'faction' based raids prevent this from happening. So eventually, as I've already seen the trend, most people who raid at high levels will become KOS most places in Velious.<P>Some of the Uber mobs just plain hit too hard. Any mob that can kill a fully buffed warlord with melee in under 18 seconds is kinda ridiculous. Those mobs will still be killed, and they are being killed now. But they require everyone to kill. Another pool of talent that is crippled if it is limited to 'correct factions' (see above).  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
