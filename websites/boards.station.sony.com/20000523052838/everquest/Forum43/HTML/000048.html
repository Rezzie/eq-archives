</FONT><HR>I encountered my first real GM event last night and while it was interesting, it was actually the antics of one little gnome that made it all fun.  Heres what happened:<P>While heading to the city of Qeynos to hand in some bandit sashes I encountered some merchants dressed as I had never seen before.  They didn't look too powerful, and they were headed toward Qeynos hills.  Intrigued, I followed.<P>The merchants continued on the path toward Surefall.  I soon learned that they were trying to  bring much needed supplies to Halas for the Barbarians.  They needed guides and protectors for the trek.<P>Running all around the merchants was a Gnome of the 4th season who seemed the most excited of all about the quest. However, he voiced his concern that he would not be able to survive the trip.  Besides possibly being slain by the monsters of Everfrost, he feared the barbarian guards would kill him on sight.<P>Well, his enthusiasm was contagious so I offered him my aid to survive.  I cast a spell on myself to see the invisible and then cast invisiblity and Spirit of the Wolf on him.<P>We quickly caught up with the main guides (who kepy getting lost, making it easy to catch up to them).  Soon after entering Everquest, I lost track of my little buddy.  It seems he had gone linkdead.  When he returned, he found himself in some random part of Everquest and I asked his location.  <P>He gave me his location but told me to stay with the quest.  I asked if he could Gate back to Qeynos (so I could retrieve him for the quest), but he said that he was still saving up for that spell.  Then he excitedly told me 'hey, I found a great place to get experience' - and the loot messages started coming in regularly.  Still, knowing how much he was enjoying the quest I ran off to find him.  (Besides, I was pretty sure the guides were leading the Goodbuy merchants in the wrong direction anyway).<P>Finally, my gnome friend (Snark), the quest group and myself all converged in the same place.  I was thrilled to see my little buddy, and gave him a big hug.  We were still far from Halas, but as we continued down the trail, I turned to see my buddy Snark keel over dead!  There was a barbarian Guard on the path who had slain him!<P>I mourned his passing, but he only expressed a little disappointment when he reappeared in Qeynos.  I looted his corpse, and dumped some empty containers of mine to make room for his loot.  I was going to gate back to Qeynos to give him his stuff, but he insisted I continue with the quest.  He wanted to see what reward I would get.  (I was pretty sure I wasn't going to be one of the rewarded ones at this point).<P>I found my way to Halas only to find that most of the party was still lost in the Everfros.  Snark assured me that he was fine, as someone had provided him with summoned food and water. <P>Finally the merchants were all at the ramp to Halas.  They rewarded their guides, and I relayed everything to my little gnome friend waiting in Qeynos.  I ran up to the merchants, and mentioned that a young gnome had given his life to try to help them, but they were too busy to answer.<P>Discouraged, I finished watching the proceedings and the merchants left.  About to zone into Halas itself, I received a 'tell' from Blalron, the lead merchant.  He asked who had given his life for them.  Thrilled, I tried replying, but only received a message that Blalron was not online at this time.  I assume it has something to do with /telling NPCs.  <P>Finally, I shouted for all to hear about the brave Snark who had given his life for the merchants.  There was no response from Blalron, but cheers went up from the PC's gathered at the Ramp.  I wished my little buddy could have heard them.<P>Finally, I went on to Halas, did some shopping, and headed back to Qeynos.  There, my little buddy met me at the gate and brought me to his 'home' -  a little nook in the wall beside the gate.  I returned his items, some extra cash (since I wasn't sure how much his corpse held) and a Gate scroll that had been the object of my shopping in Halas.<P>He offered the extra cash back to me, but just as I was telling him not to worry, a high level dwarf offered 5plat for an SoW at the Qeynos gate.  Hey - Tunare provides.  And we both ended up ahead without getting rewarded by the GM's.<P>So if anyone sees a little Gnome necromancer named Snark - let him know that you appreciate his sacrifice for the merchants of Qeynos.  <P>(And if the GMs from the event read this - if Blalron could him a tell to thank him, I think it would mean a lot.  I have never seen someone have so much fun just running around following an event.)<P>Mike<BR>aka Suvillan of Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum43&number=43&thisthread=000048&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum43&number=43&thisthread=000048&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
