</FONT><HR>Well, folks...  I think I give up.<P>I posted once that I could no longer post here in confidence, but decided to stay and risk it because of the -Daezeroth- incident.  For the last few days, I have been very politely, but VERY persistently requesting that someone clarify, or explain, or apologize, or do ANYTHING to settle our minds about the warning that was applied to Daez's account.  Many of you have joined me.<P>The good news?  Well, I'm still here.  They haven't issued any warnings to my account that I know of.<P>The bad news?  We've been totally ignored.  I have seen MANY happy little "Verant Rulz!" threads that Abashi has posted in, but he and all the other Verant posters refuse to do anything to allay our fears about the direction the warnings and bannings have taken.<P>In fact, in this very thread, Brad has said "But we WILL control the signal to noise ratio. If anything, we'll become more strict."<P>So the only thing that even remotely approaches the issue we want clarified, seems to promise that the situation will get worse.  Mind you, I think almost all the warnings and bannings I've seen have been justified, but this issue is a real show stopper for me.<P>Every thread put up that has to do with this subject is ignored.  If this subject comes up in a thread that Verant Employees are already posting in, there are NO more posts from them after that.  In my opinion, they refuse to talk about it.<P>Now, for my part, I think they are completely reasonable people otherwise.  They seem to have a tendency to work harder at attempting to deny and hide fallibility than actually fixing it, but hey...  That's understandable.<P>The only reason I can come up with for them to leave us so intimidated is that they don't WANT to explain what their rules are.  The only reason I can come up with for them not to WANT to explain the rules is that they don't want to CREATE them.<P>I think that if they create a solid set of rules, and publish them, they will have a hard time not abiding by them.  Certainly someone armchair lawyer is going to find some way to be a pain in the rump without violating the rules, and they want to keep things vague so they can continue to issue warnings without having to abide by a set of rules.  <P>So, all they'll say is "Be courteous".  FAR too vague, and it leaves them able to do anything they want.<P>Really, I wouldn't have much problem with this if they hadn't shown themselves to be VERY fallible at making these judgements. -Daezeroth-'s incident however, combined with their complete unwillingness to even admit that they were wrong, combined with Brad's assurance that they will get MORE strict, combined with Brad's seeming threat to take down the board....  It just make me think that there's no sense in trying anymore.<P>They appear to be so entrenched they they don't even know who their friends are anymore.<P>You see, I AM a friend.  I WILL criticize, but I agree with them 99% of the time.  <P>In any event, as sad as I am to say it, I give up.  I will read, and maybe even post a little, but I give up trying to get the clarification that so many of us need on this issue.<P>They ain't gonna do it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad seems to be implying that having an internet customer forum and an internet relations manager is somehow unusual or is evidence of Verant going the extra mile. Simply not true.  These things are the standard now, not the exception. It would be unusual for Verant to NOT have these things.<P>All of the current MMORPG's have customer forums that are regularly posted to by representatives of the company.  All of the MMORPG's in development also have forums and in fact are doing whatever they can to build an online community around their game well in advance of release.  Warden of Shadowbane and David Allen of Horizons have put their games on the map because of their efforts at building an online community. The Shadowbane community was responsible for voting Shadowbane onto the top of PC Gamer magazine's "Most Anticipated Game" list with an astounding 24% of the vote.  And Horizons may well have been saved when their project was in danger of running out of money by the fact that the strong community they had already built rallied to their aid and support and an investor was found to keep them going for at least awhile.<P>I don't believe that Brad is serious about pulling the plug on this forum.  To do so would be disastrous public relations for Verant and would make it appear that they are unable or unwilling to deal with their own customers.  It certainly would have to give LucasArts some concerns about Verant's ability to deal with customer relations in Star Wars Online.  And the disgruntled customers wouldn't disappear; they would simply move to EQ fan sites, usenet, and rant sites like Lum's to voice their displeasure.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad, Abashi and players,<P>I have read every post thus far on this subject and read most all the posts on various subjects that have some plausible concerns to me and to the game. I believe this to be one of them.<P>I currently work for one the biggest ISPs in Houston, the 4th largest city in the U.S., so our customer database is not small. I work in tech support with our commercial customers so in a way I deal with a lot of same issues just as Abashi does. We have been in business for over 16 years. Our success isn't dependant on advertising but mainly word of mouth. We got our reputation from being fast, efficient and reliable and customer friendly and being personal. <P>I've been here for over 3 years and know my job well and how to deal with our customers. You would never see me skirting an issue. If I don't know the answer, I will get it from another source, like my supervisor or another tech or department. If I get 3 or 4 calls on the same issue, I do not ignore it. I think that if this many people call in on the same problem, there is a possiblity something might be wrong on our end. I bring it to the attention of the correct department to verify or deny the problem and promptly get back to the customer as soon as I can. If I didn't act on an issue that many people are complaining about, I promise you our company would be out of business. This is the problem I see here. <P>Abashi may be well versed in protocols and policies but his bedside manner at problems that a big portion of the players post is left to be desired. Double talk, skirting around the issue and giving out information without research is not good business and sometimes the posts come across just plain rude. Good examples of this is the ranger issues and recently the VP loot tables. <P>I do understand its hard to determine what are the important issues and what is merely unwarranted rant or just plain garbage. I also understand that there are many posts to read so perhaps some suggestions of getting Abashi help is reasonable. When I read the boards, I look at the subject and then at the amount of posts being made. I deem 20 or more posts might be worth reading if it is on a viable gaming issueor if the subject is interesting. I can normally tell after reading the first few posts whether its a legit gripe or just rant. Granted some rants are legit. You just have to read between the poster's frustration and grab the gist of the topic. <P>I think the main problem here is that the answers that are usally given to legitimate posts are, to coin the phrase used in these posts, "spin-doctoring". Just saying "Its not within the Vision" or " It will unbalance the game" without a plausible, reasonable followup as to why, just leaves the majority of us more frustrated.<P>&lt;&lt;Which is best? Blunt, no B.S., tell it like it is, objective posting? Or I'm your friend, I'll represent your side to those developer guys and seem all disappointed if they don't agree with you?&gt;&gt;<P>Why can't this be a little of both? Be blunt and no B.S only after you say you'll present the problem to whatever team and then come back with a reasonable answer? Is this so difficult? <P>&lt;&lt;Anyway, we'll continue to listen. We'll continue to post and to communicate. We'll continue to take good ideas and implement them if possible. And we'll continue to do our best to correct aspects of the game that could be improved.&gt;&gt;<P>I think this is all we are really asking but communicate with an answer with reasons as to why something can't be. You have a great game here and the majority of posters here are probably the hardcore players that care about the game and know the game well. Listen to them and do your post followups after the research. Keep us informed with the facts not with PR quotes that leave more questions. <P>&lt;&lt;So, in closing, I'd really recommend that those of you who are upset with aspects of the game and would like to see change to keep things constructive. If you don't, honestly, you become self-defeating, because were the board to degenerate into purely flames and insults we'd shut it down, eliminating a fantastic avenue for you to affect the very change you want. Really, you risk losing your account AND losing these forums, and, knowing that you're all paying customers who care deeply about the game, I really don't think you want either.&gt;&gt;<P>I agree wholeheartedly. The boards are the best way for you to listen to the voice of your players. Constructive criticism is the best way to get attention and I encourage each poster to follow Brad's advice here. And Verant, if you are seeing a lot of complaints about an issue, perhaps you need to look into it before making a statement you will later be withdrawing.<P>Thanks for reading.<P><BR>Grayvemark<BR>UDL Eternal One<BR>Husband to Darcphaze<BR>http://www.undeadlords.com<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>One thing I wish to clarify in my above statement. I chose the number of 3 or 4 even 5 for customers calling in with the same problem as a cutoff to  deem whether it is a problem or not. The reason so small a number is to nip the problem in the bud, if indeed there is one, before any more calls come in. That way I can tell the next customer calling with the same problem that at least the problem is being looked into. A company like Verant needs to set its own number to make this determination but not so high that if it is a real problem, its not overlooked.<P>Grayvemark<BR>UDL Eternal One<BR>Husband to Darcphaze<BR>http://www.undeadlords.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
