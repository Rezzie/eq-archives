</FONT><HR>goofu, I have to add this..<P>I burried my son 4 years ago, and it was the worst pain I ever felt in my life...  My X-Girlfriend's mother told me to stop weeping and be a man at the burriel site....<P>We all go through Thrauman, and the one you went through and hope everything turned well... does not give you a degree in judging people.  Not by a long shot.  I've seen woman cry cause their car broke down.  Have to admit, I giggled and though it was funny.  But never in my life would I have thought she was Messed up and needed help.  You goofu, have no clue what EQ or ManaGirl represented to this woman.  Judging and putting someone down for it...  what does it do for you.  When you got home last night, what more did that comment do for you.  Did you and your wife have a better night, cause you told someone they Had no reason to cry cause compare to what you went through... it's absurb.<P>God Darn people...  We are Human, and everyone places a differnet lvl of importance to different things in our life.  How many times I watched movies, and I would see woman cry and sob...  Should I tell them... Get a grip!  It's only a movie, it's not for real... Or say... "Damn you woman need help"...  well, it is just a movie then... why do they cry or sob ?  Cause something is sad to them...  Someone playing a character and having an Identity and friends... and being shocked by a rude GM and have her Identity taken away... Should be less painfull than a sad movie ?  Some people just don't think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hankerz<P>We could disect so many names in the game... Oceanus for example which I was having fun doing yesterday.<P>Problem will... everyone have different Interpretations and opinion about EVERYTHING.... so in that way, while we feel all safe and cozy... you can get Hit by someone elses Interpretation.<P>This is why the Rules need to be lifted a bit.  "ManaGirl" sounds like "Mana Girl"...  "Man A Girl"... is purposly trying to stretch what is is like "Oceanus" and I saying that it's a combination of "Ocean and Anus"...  But some people said that "Oce" does mean something.... Or better yet... "O ce Anus" would be sounding like "Oh see Anus"...  Becuase the rules can be so distorted... verant need to loosen this thing up.  If the name is Vulgar or Innapropriate as Mr. Oceanus mentioned yesterday...  Then fine, it should be lifted...  But the GM's need to stop acting like they are Gods...  That powertrip is getting pretty old quick.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hmm ... that is sad. Sorry to hear it. Names are important. I have one question though. What is the point behind the naming policy. Is it to prevent offense? Is it to promote realism? No one really role-plays much anyway. They can't legislate role-playing, so why try to control the names. A name is superficial. It won't make any difference if a person has the right kind of name but still shouts over the zone K3wl d00d.<BR>    I understand the offensive part of the policy, but if someone's name doesn't fit the mood, who cares. Why would a name as inoffensive as managirl beachbum be a real problem? i've read the policy, so don't quote it to me. I question the policy, not what it says. You cant make people roleplay by giving them the "Proper" name.<BR>As for those of you saying she got what she deserved, i have a question for you. Are you in middle management?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In all seriousness, how can the name 'Managirl' be interpreted as anything but a combination of 'mana' and 'girl'.<P>It reminds me of some loser on Veeshan who chose the name 'Supajeenyus' for his character. He tried to defend his extremely lame choice of name by claiming that it wasn't his intent for it to be interpreted as 'Super Genius'.<P>It's not offensive and it's a boderline violation.

But a game, my Fiancee would never cry over a game, in fact she thinks my level of seriousness and competitiveness is a bit extreme, there have been times when a game has gotten me upset, but to the point of tears? thats over the top.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>goofu & randonloggin<P>Get a clue guys.  This isn't a Verant Bashing thing.  It is saying that the GM is to be questioned, how many people from that server saying this guy is a Jerk do you need... or can't you read what goes against what you say ?<P>This was more than just a game for this person.  Get it!  Who are YOU to judge how anyone feels about any certain thing.  Clueless as it clueless goes.  All you two can say, it's just a game... Can you come up with something else ?  Nope... cause you two are so stuck up your butt, you can't see light a mile away.  Who cares if for YOU TWO it's just a game, or for a hundred others...  For many it's more than just a game, it's a place where you're worries aren't there... It's what most calls a HOBBY.<P>I love painting.  I used to paint Ceramic at least 8-10 hours a week.  And an X-Girlfriend of mine after getting pissed at me broke something I made for my mom... I put 4 hours on it.  And broke other things and flushed everthing in the toilet...  Then found out she was wrong, but the damage was done...  I didn't cry, but had tears in my eyes... why... cause of the lack of respect of something I put so much energy into... Haven't really got back into painting since...  It's been 5 years.  Well, this woman's hobby was "ManaGirl" in EQ.  She put 8-10 months in developing a character and a reputation.  She probably didn't read that rule, and neither did I... does that make you smart and her Dumb...  Like you two are good judge of characters.... hehe  too funny, I'm mean really.  This was HER Hobby, and her IDENTITY was stripped... like my worked was broken.  I can repaint a new one, no harms done... it's only 4 hours of work... but It disgusted me... and I lost total interest... I got hurt...  So did she.<P>You two are so Anal on the "This is just a Game"...  Have a heart, and use your brain...  I'm not here saying "Poor woman" or "Damn Verant".... I'm here saying, stop being total Jerks... and have a heart...  If all you come here to do is "Well you messed up with the Rules, what's you're problem"...  You two need help... If all you can do, is bring someone down when they are already down... Think what that makes you ?  "Eh.. well, she messed up... I'm just saying what's obvious"... can you say Duh!  The GM didn't have to make that change, cause it was lead to interpretation.  You have half the people here saying the name was fine reading the rules and the other half saying it was a stupid name and she violated the rules... Proble is....  The rules are screwed up, and let to too much interpretation.. and should be a bit more flexible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think the point behind his post was that she cried. I don't even think the point behind his original post was that she had to change her name. I think the point he was trying to get across and that I whole heartidly agree with because I've had to deal with this same GM in this same situation, is that he's not handling himself very well in the matter. He was extremely rude about and after reviewing the rules of conduct, I've come to the conclusion that he's also not following Verant's guidelines.<P>I'm not quite sure how the matter was handled in Managirls case...but I know in mine this GM changed my name before even speaking with me. A guildmate had said, while we were fighting a Mob, that he had been somehow switched to another group. I had no idea what he was talking about until I looked up and realized that my name had been changed. I had no idea why, or what was going on and continued playing. Close to death,  all of the sudden this GM blasted out "Your name is in violation...blah blah blah...you need to change it now." I said that it looked like he already changed it for me and then asked why it was changed. The GM didn't answer me for almost 10 minutes and came back with "you have 10 minutes to think of a new name." The GM was a complete jerk about the situation and frankly I thought it was some kind of hack that some kid got a hold of. I couldn't believe that a GM was actually being so rude. I made a comment to the my group and all those around me...they immediately asked what the GM's name was and when I told them...they all agreed that this GM was a problem and to just do what he says and then petition him later.<P>He didn't follow the guidelines set by Verant in that he changed my name without first opening a dialogue with me. My name was NOT offensive in the slightest so he had no reason to be so rude. The next day I chatted with another GM and explained what had happened. She said that there must have been some misunderstanding or miscommunication because there is NO way that a GM would be allowed to act such as he did.<P>*shrugs*<P>I think this GM has an attitude problem...end of story. It's only a matter of time before Verant catches him and sends him on his way...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Can I at least have you aggree with this ?  Real life, not real life... That's BS.  The time spent into EQ is Real Life Time and Energy, as much as the time I spent painting.  The pride I had with my results, is the same of some in EQ when they make a reputation and make friends...<P>   Time & Energy in any form is used into a Hobby.  But usually, you don't have others intrude into your hobby or cause dmg into your hobby...  Usually...  But This woman chose EQ, and Managirl as HER HOBBY.  It was not a game for her, it was more than that.  Who are we to tell people that play EQ for more than just the Game aspect.. that they are weird, or in need of help ?<P>   Since I've been born, I learned that there has been and will only be 1 real judge of what occurs in our life.

They've done that for Centuries if not Milleniums...  It's their Belief.  They in turn look at our lifestile, and think worse of us... Are they right ?  It's all about perception, and belief...  We have come on earth to judge people, we're supposed to help each other... and all some people did in this topic... is bash her for no knowing better when she created her car... tell her she needs help cause she cried...<P>Damn It!

</FONT><HR>The real problem is this, from what I've seen:<P>1. The friggin k3VVl D3VVdz get to keep their names 90% of the time.  Don't believe me, go check you local server.<P>2. Most GM's will change a name of a character based only on a petition, and sometimes even when it isn't offensive, vulgar, or anything, they will change it without a second thought, based only on a petition.<P>3. The sad fact is, it sickens me that Verant constantly harps on the fact that "You, the player, must abide by our naming policy, but we, the designers don't have to."  Gee, real nice.  Kind of like a parent explaining that you can't do something "Because I'm the mother/father, THAT'S WHY!"  Pretty much, this says to me that Verant is saying, "We are better than you, so quit your whining and grow the hell up!"<P>And to the people who have to beat someone when their down (make fun of/belittle the original poster), I'm sure you read a good novel and never get a damn thing out of it.  I'm sure you're only class of movie is one where the characters are 1 dimensional, and the plot is so dumb a 3 month old could grasp it.<P>Why do I finish with that?  Because I know that class of gamer.  You don't play things like RPG's to create a character with a background, a backstory.  No, you are the good old 'Min/Maxers'.  The Munchkins who try to find an out with everything, and try to make your characters so ghod-awful mighty that the GM finally gives up because you can kill a God with a snap of your fingers.<P>Geezus people, have a heart.  Some people create a character and build it much like they would a D&D character.  A lot of time and effort goes into it. Hell yes, it is ONLY a game, but some people enjoy role-playing, and most of the best RP'ers I've met happen to be the most well adjusted persons I have ever met.<P>If you can't deal with it, go back to Quake III, or UO.  1 and 2 dimensional characters are VERY wanted there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus & randonloggin,<P>    Still don't want to understand that people see EQ as more than just a game.  I guess you two have it all down path.  You two are right, and everyone else that play EQ for other reason than it being a game... are in need of dear help.  You two have got so up the lader in life that everyone else is clueless and probably beneath you.<P>Oceanus, You keep bringing Ignorance.  I remember the days where in Support the Keyword in our department was RTFM.  But you know what... The Majority don't read rules or documentation...  They just want to have fun.  That makes them ignorant ?  You really think highly of yourself.. I hope you don't get to fall off that pedastal someday and realize that like anyone else... You're human.  Or are you ?  Cause I surely wouldn't want to be insulting, wouldn't I...<P>randonloggin, I learned a long time ago... Everything is not Black/White... There are so many shades of grey... that most of the time.. we HUMAN don't get it.  They say that you can be with someone for 50 years, and still learn new things from them.  And you think you already know that this person Is being ridiculous cause this is just a game.  Well, you can't compare Apples with Oranges.  Everyone is different.  Some are More sensitive then others... does that make them a bad person, or someone to abuse when their down ?  Some think a plant is an incredible sensation to take care off at home and they are precious... others think they're just pretty but an Annoyance.  Who's right ?  Who's wrong ?<P>You two keep comparing this in a "Logic" sense... why, that's what someone kept telling me in the past... hehe  There is nothing logic as personality, emotions and behaviour goes.  And putting someone down for being different, and refusing to understand they are different is cruel.  All I've been fighting on today is just that.  You two take a rule, and just go for the kill...  "You should have known better, you were being Ignorant.  It's a damn game... You were stupid..  You need help for crying"... I'd be afraid to be a kid of yours...  Almost seems like a concentration camp.  Loosen up a bit...  Not everyone is the way you portray a "Normal" person to be.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Two elderly men sit outside of the Shop n Save in lawn chairs.  It is twilight.  The streets are empty.  A woman in a red pickup truck drives up.<P>Elderly Man #1: She's an odd one.  Never seen her around here before.<P>Elderly Man #2: Perhaps she expresses herself differently as a function of her personal feeling of self-esteem.<P>The woman pulls off onto the grass on the other side of the street.  She gets out and stares for a while at a giant oak tree standing alone in the small park that is the center of town.  She's dressed entirely in black.<P>Elderly Man #1: What do you think she's doing?  She looks a bit disturbed.<P>Elderly Man #2: She appreciates her freedom.  She is an artist.  Soulful youth reflecting on the world that reflects her inner spirit.<P>The girl drives off.<P>The next night she returns, pulls off at the same spot, gets out of the truck and starts to gather together objects from the back of her truck.  The elderly men are sitting out in front of the Shop n Save.<P>Elderly Man #1:  I think she might be in trouble.  We should do something.<P>Elderly Man #2:  She has a unique set of ideals.  She respects her individual perspective.  She understands the nature of a non-conformist lifestyle.<P>The woman throws a rope over a branch of the big oak tree.  She pulls up a tall stool.  She climbs on top of it.  The rope is tied in the shape of a noose.<P>Elderly Man #1: We have to do something!  She is going to kill herself!<P>Elderly Man #2: She is a product of a modern era.  She is the symbol of a progressive society.  She ignores people who condemn her, she condemns noone.  She knows inner peace.<P>The woman stares off into the distance with a solemn gleam in her eyes.  The noose is around her neck.  She leaps.<P>Elderly Man #1:  She is dying! She is dead!<P>Elderly Man #2:  Idealogy is the most important aspect of humanity.  It is what propells us beyond our natural restrictions.  Freedom to individual perspective and individual beliefs cannot be denied.  This is our modern era.  This is our strength.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus,<P>   You flaunt "Ignorant" and "Ignorance" the way I've been flaunting "Anal".  problem is, now you're generalizing everyone that jumps into something without reading all the rules... as Ignorant.<P>   I read all I needed as to how to play the game.  The rules of conduct for your information is common sense.  They put it there for those that don't have it.  I don't kill steal, Ninja loot or create a name that is Innapropriate (damn I'm having trouble with writing that workd... hehe).  Most people creating their character never thought that there was so much involved regarding Names as policy goes.  Bad names I understand.  But "ManaGirl" is open to Interpretation.  You've got yours and many other have another.<P>   So cut the Ignorance BS.  My kids make mistake day after day...  If I start calling them Ignorant because they should know better... What kind of father would I be... what kind of kid would they become.  Some people are Ignorant... but the way you put it here in the context of what happened, you're being insulting.  What a sad life you must have to get you're punches in this DB.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
