&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are EQ contenders coming soon after Scars of Velious (Wich I have ordered already, because I do play this game, though its hard at times to say I enjoy it anymore...<P>But competition aside, EQ is headed for a downfall if Verant maintains and develops EQ by current standards.<P>They game, nearing 2 years old, and patched monthly or so, is riddled with bugs, incomplete quests, and crowding issues.<P>The pace of the game is on a down trend from lvl one, excruciating even for untwinked characters.  Every aspect of play and system seems purposefully tweaked in illogical imbalance between PC and NPC.  There is no platform for roleplaying in the game, except as a humongous hurdle to progress.  One cannot explore until one has achieved leves, and in some cases equipment.  Most of the quests are a waste of time, a lot are broken, and many are down right insulting (Sap Sheen staff comes to mind). The NPC's come in 3 versions, all being over powered monks.  Some of the over powered monks can also cast spells.  Then there are the merchants, who can also be either of the other types of overpowered monks.  I find the official response to this issue detestable.  If advancing characters and aquiring items isnt the main point of fullfillment in the game, and Role-playing is near impossible, what is the point of the game?  Entertainment?  It dwindles severely, mostly held up by interaction with friends at later levels.  Fantasy is severely drowned in drudgery, and ultimately assassinated when the hero, you, can never slay a dragon without a huge raid lag fest, much less alone (define Hero here now), and all but the most seasoned and well equipped can be quickly throttled by a non-equipped vendor of baking goods, and any of the zillion other members of the coalition of trades folk.  Most of this tweaking is to make up for poor programming (pathing and AI are programming issues, plain and simple).<P>Customer Service in and out of game leaves much to be desired.  For not one issue I have had, has a GM or guide been of assistance, and like these boards, the frequent response to player issues is that of generalized and matter-of-fact condescension to the tune of "if its good enough for me...".<P>The server economies are completely backwards.  Maybe 1000 merchant NPC's, and most commerce takes place in East Commons. Vendor equipment is substandard and ferociously over priced.  Trade skill products are mostly worthless, and those of value are still substandard and overpriced (not to mention excruciating to develop).  The extreme end of these skills that do produce signifigant products (when they do, havent seen any race armor yet) is garnered by the highest level'd pc's in the game.<P>The game removes nearly any measure of player skill from progress in the game.  Especially in tactics is this venomous, where past 30, there are very few and very set ways to make progress.  Acquiring items is always opposite of acquiring experience.<P>The game story is set in stone, none of the dynamic events (beyond there other problems) alter it in a year or so, and there is no GM to player interaction.  Beyond that, its not original, and I think JRR Tolkien, TSR, and WW should snub them openly for their plagiarism abnd adulteration of the genre.<P>On top of that, if SoV is by proportion as laggy and connection trouble as Kunark is compared to nonKunark, they will need to limit zone size to Misty Thicket and zone population to 25.<P>From top down Verant has allowed their time as a virtual monopoly to atrophy whatever creativity, and novelty was left at their studios when EQ was released.<P>I mean really, the main interface with npc's is combat, consideration (near useless aspect as far as measuring an npc), and pidgeonholed nonsensical conversation which most of the NPC's are incapable of.  Since Combat takes on 3 forms after 25-35, then basically, all three facets of interface are mostly cosmetic.<P>Someone should start a players union.  300,000 people would probably get some questions answered and bugs fixed.<P>If they dont progressively deal with at least some of these issues, there will be a great deal of customer base for the next MMORPG that comes out.  It is sad that MS could not have done better with AC, but it seems that AC was more of a test of the MMORPG waters done by some insignificant segment of Microprose.  UOL is even sadder, they betrayed their customer base by relaesing a 1980's game in 1990's graphics and calling it new.  Hopefully future companies that want into this arena will look at these three and seriously consider implementing a very large amount of variation, dynamics, and Player-skill-based interface.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There have been many like you saying that EQ is about to die.  But what you will see is that in 2 years EQ will still be strong.  Sure there are issues but it is still fun.  If it wasn't you wouldn't play.  Even if there wasn't anything else you wouldn't play something that isn't enjoyable. <P>The object of the game to me is interaction with other players.  I can sit at level 51 and make 4 to 5 times the amount of xp solo that I can with a group with 3 others around level 54 but it isn't as enjoyable.  Some places you can't explore without a group.  Others just take being a bit clever.  Dungeons are hard to explore but outside zones are not.  I've looked around almost every outdoor area.  I even use my monk to explore places I probably shouldn't be.<P>My wizard isn't decked out and I have never been refused by a group because of my lack of gear.<P>Most things in EQ push us toward user interaction.  That is why Plate is SOOOO expensive from the merchants.  So you opt for the interaction with a real player to make you your armor.<P>The game does change and changes alot more than other games of this type.  In single player games there is usually only a few different pathes you can go down with a bunch of side plots out there but they don't change the overall story much.  In EQ it takes alot of work to change things and many people would get upset you'd find (which isn't a big deal to me).<P>Kithicor is an example of change.   <BR>Brownies expanding their territory.<BR>Paw getting Overrun.<BR>Black Burrow now merging with the SplitPaws.<BR>Qeynos seems to be going under a large amount of change these days with citizians being unruly.<P>The list goes on.  Norrath does change.  Some day Commander Bale may fall.  Or the trolls may reclaim Guk.  Or The Freeport Militia may be cleansed of its corrupt leader.  <P>Problem is that a single player can not effect the game for 300,000 people that would be alot of work just for 1 persons enjoyment.  If it does happen it will be through a dynamic event.  <P>Rollplaying is not optimal.  EQ pushes user interaction.  Players Opt for making their characters go out of character.  How do I mean?  Well let me explain.<P>Dark elves are basically evil.  Dark Elves can choose to perform deeds that over time will give them, as individuals, better reputations with the light lovers.  Some light lovers may never like them but players can effect their status (faction).<BR>Now the fact that most, probably 98% or more, of the dark elves make themselves non-KoS to light lovers is the players choice.  I have a dark elf that I play true as a dark elf.  He is still KoS at level 16 and always will be.  I play him when I want a dash of evil.  He will stand by and watch another player die if they are light lovers.  Probably Urg the Orcs on to.  I don't break the rules and train but I am not polite to light lovers while playing him.  He only groups with Dark sided characters.  He will group with Humans and Erudites but they must be evil or must suit a need he has.  I could take it to another extreme and be diety dependant but that is to hard to play.  Roleplaying isn't hard.  Makes leveling bit more difficult but its interesting.  Players ultimately have the decision on how they roleplay. <P>I'm sorry to see that you feel that EQ has nothing to offer.  Maybe its time you move on.  You've stated how you feel and no one probably can change the way your feel.  <P>Thank you for your view, even if it is negative.  <BR>May you future battles be more enjoyable then your current life on Norrath.<P>Reztarn Solarflare 51st Channeler Terris-Thule<BR>Master Tailor (115) &lt;- waiting for the upgrade<BR>Master Brewer (145) &lt;- Whatdya haven?<BR>Master Potter (172) &lt;- This is useful...how?<BR>Master Smith (166) &lt;- made my first set of FS with 35 attempts<BR>Master Drinker(200) &lt;- BuUuUuUuRrPp!!!!!!!<BR>Master Begger (189) &lt;- What a waste of time<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>I don't believe EQ will be strong in 2 years. Will it still be around like UO? Probably. Will 300,000 people still be being masochists in it when more anti downtime design games are out like Anarchy online, dark ages of camelot and possibly horizons? No, i seriously doubt it.<P>What will happen is that the first, or first couple, of GOOD anti downtime design games will cause probably half of EQ subscribers to leave. <P>Here is the thing: once you've had something MUCH better, its hard to go back. Example: i kinda floated around in UO for a while after really hating it. Mostly I just hated the old archaic game engine andhow just moving across the screen was laborious. I played EQ, in the beta, and even as a non sowing character running around with third person from behind view it was far smoother and more fun that UO. I just found it much more relaxing to move than the carpal tunnel inducing movement in UO.<P>So EQ did not even really "hook" me because it was a BETTER game than UO, it was just more tolerable and less painful to play. Similarly the game to first cause me to leave EQ probably won't be fantastic, it will just be more tolerable and less downtime inducing than EQ is. Eventually its not that you have SOME downtime in EQ, its that as you progress and more things are added to the game your downtime percentage goes WAY UP.. never down. It stacks up to an intolerable weight eventually.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>People complain about the xp and how slow it gets.  I know that I can get from level 51 to 52 in less than 24 playing hours (solo) if I wanted too.  Thats not to bad.  Sure I have 5 minutes of down time to every 1 minute of fighting (I nap inbetween fights).  But in a MMPOG that has a persistant world what do you do?  Have instant medding and healing?   When I play with a group we have no down time hardly.  Its Pull Pull Pull.  The other day I was grouped with 2 mages (level 55) and 1 cleric (53) and apart from the odd pull that brought to many we didn't rest between battles.  I often went to fetch another while they where still fighting.  Xp wasn't great compair to me soloing but being with the friends was still fun. <P>I still think in 2 years EQ will be strong.  players may stop actively buying EQ in the next year but if Verant keep up the player retention program they have going on many exsisting players will continue to play.<P>Reztarn Solarflare 51st Channeler Terris-Thule<BR>Master Tailor (115) &lt;- waiting for the upgrade<BR>Master Brewer (145) &lt;- Whatdya haven?<BR>Master Potter (172) &lt;- This is useful...how?<BR>Master Smith (166) &lt;- made my first set of FS with 35 attempts<BR>Master Drinker(200) &lt;- BuUuUuUuRrPp!!!!!!!<BR>Master Begger (189) &lt;- What a waste of time<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>aandaie,<P>    I bet that a minimum of 60% will still be on board in 2 years...  Anyone forgetting a few things Verant/Sony are working on.<P>There is an Attempt into converting EQ so that it would be playable on the PlayStation 2.  They are looking in Quirks right now.  Nothing is set in stone, but last Electronic Game Monthly said they were investigating the possibility.<P>Also, there's EQ2 which passes at times.  Even Verant's Blue names say little other than we can't say much on this yet.  But that's enough for saying that it's in the works.<P>Will a lot of people switch over to other games ?  Yes...  You think the other ones did a better game than EQ on the first try ?  hehe...  This is the software industry.  The hope is that others can come up with something better... but doesn't always happen that way.  Lag might be better, lag might be worse.  Skill/Trade system might be better and it also might be worse...  And worse of all...  If Other company gives everything the customer wants as Trade/Skill goes... it will Destroy the Economy cause Everyone wants the Easiest route to be masters...  Which is ridiculous.<P>Well, nothing wrong with having our hopes up.  But as SemperFi said...  EQ ain't dying anytime soon...  And if my server drops a few hundred people...  Less lag time for me...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>hehe...  had to bring my Ligh Lover (High Elf) to EC to buy stock before Patch... My DE Necro can't buy anything there.   Well, I got 1 Silk Swatch, 2 LQ Skins and 8 Rusty 2 Handed swords.  Can you say Bummer! hehe  Well far from being master, I'm happy where I'm at.<P>Baker (49)<BR>Brewer (26)<BR>Tailoring (36)<BR>Smithing (31) hehe, all 2 Handeds helped me max this.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Drinker (5)<BR>Begger (11)  &lt;== cool to use this on pets on downtime.. hehe  What a slow skill to improve though... yuck<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gordon posted a message today about the future of EQ on the everlore site, and my impression was that SOV may be the last expansion and Verant's efforts will simply be to fix the present bugs and then leave the game alone. They know that better games are on the way and will be working on their own new games (EQ 2?). This game will NOT be going strong in another two years. There going to make as much money as they can off us while they are on top,. then concentrate on other games. It's just business to them. They certainly aren't going to make major changes in the game engine to keep EQ alive. Most likely,. they will never fix all the bugs and make the changes we would like to see. You'll have to buy EQ two,..... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Arrowoody - It has been suggested that there maybe another Expansion after SoV (there is another continent available.  There are lots of possiblities with adding new zones and refitting zones.  It is not in VI's best intrest to just drop EQ after SoV.  They want to retain people.  There other products you won't see for at least a year.  People for a year and a half have been saying EQ is about to die and it only gets stronger.

</FONT><HR><BR>Yeah semper, but Verant has shown that when they enhance the game a la kunark they don't make it MORE playable with less downtime, they make it LESS playable with TONS more downtime.<P>Everything that verant adds is virtually always negative. Players know this.<P>I'd like to see you go from 51 - 52 in 24 hours solo ; ) <P>I don't think 60 percent of the people playing NOW will be on in six months even. I also don't think that the critical "new people trying it" will be coming to a game that they hear is high downtime when serveral other choices are availible. It comes down to what choice fits you the best. EQ fits me and a lot of other people horribly. <P>Do I expect constant pulling and zero downtime all the time? No. The thing is that in EQ that is not the only downtime, everything else in the game is downtime ALSO. Traveling time is one of the BIGGEST downtime enhancers, especially in kunark. The BEST choice you have is a port to kunark from a druid or wiz friend, one port, to a far off area from nearly everywhere you'd be going at 51 - 60 EXCEPT karnors. Your worst choice is the ONLY other way to get there, a usually half hour to up to 45 minutes or MORE boat ride. <P>Dying without a cleric on hand (which is not always availible ) equals more downtime. It can equal QUITE a bit more downtime in kunark to get one out there if you even can within 3 hours. Without a 90 percent res 51 - 60 playing gets pretty impossible. If you work it out so you ALWAYS have a cleric friend on the same time as you who ALWAYS groups with you thats good, you are one of the lucky ones.<P>Trades, which should be an alternative to constant downtime adventuring, actually INCREASE downtime a lot since the trade skills patch. Now if my char wants to be able to make a cultural armor, I have to kill something not worth xp for hours and hours since it hardly drops the item anyway.<P>Quests are one of the biggest downtime complaints in eq since they are often patience and downtime based rather than difficulty based. You go to a spawn and wait, and wait, and wait if you want the item. Wander by? No, that doesn't work since someone else would be there waiting OR someone else would have wandered by. <P>Verant's track record is bad. It shows undeniably that to them patience + downtime = difficulty rather than just the levels of creatures itself. They have shown this with quests, trades and item drops. If they mixed some of the stuff for patience and some not, it would have been better but their design seems to be when in doubt make it patience and downtime based. Put in new trade stuff, make it patience and downtime based rather than just doing the logical, fair and player requested skill based. <P>A new line of armor inbetween what drops on low stuff and high stuff which a player can make is a good idea to fill the hole. Making such armor need items so incredibly rare that the value of the armor shoots HIGHER THAN items which are BETTER and often sold is bad. It is a design flaw.<P>The cultural armor problems show me that Verant is continuing this method of downtime + patience design rather than getting away with it. Other games sound like they are going the opposite way, since they too have seen the mistakes in EQ. Meanwhile Verant is an old stuck in her ways figure standing on a hill lecturing us why we can't have it easier and how we would not really want less downtime and more fun. Well i guess Verant will find out.<P>Players will not play a stuck in downtime dinosaur when they have better choices.
