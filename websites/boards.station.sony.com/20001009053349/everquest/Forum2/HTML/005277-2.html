</FONT><HR>"and i let the classes that NEEDED the items for their mains have first shot at them."<P>Twinks that -really- do this, I have lots less problems with.<P>BUT.<P>1)  Most twinks will happily roll against a main, and be pissed at anyone that protests.  Enough that the few that don't are the exceptions, not the rule.<P>2)  I presume by that statement that if you were in the group, and a main in that group could use it, then you wouldn't roll (or give it to them if you won).  VERY cool, don't get me wrong.  I don't mind playing with twinks such as yourself - I don't roll on items I can't use either.  However, if there was someone else, not in your group, ooc'ing for a spot in that group that could use the item?  Do you leave the group to make way for them?  Probably not.  Either way, people who need the items are shut out all the time by twink farmers.<P>Oh, do I say that all the twinks are farmers?  Absolutely not.  But damn near all the good item spawns (just about all of LGuk and SolB) on Tunare server are over-50% camped by people who are just there for their twinks.<P>There's just not enough good items to go around for the high levels of each class that can use them, much less all the level 6 twinks of all those high levels.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bottom line is, they CAN'T stop twinking. At least not without serious repercussions that they're not prepared (or willing) to deal with. The anti-twinkers have their opinions and the people who twink (like me) have theirs. It doesn't matter either way. If I'm playing one of my twinks and you see me and get upset, so be it. Not my problem. That is YOUR issue and I leave it at that. Now, if you harass me, I will go through the proper channels to have the issue resolved.<P>For Twigglin- I have a Paladin. Level 15 now. Help me to understand in RP terms how a noble Paladin could find it in his heart to go KILL a fellow Paladin just because he covets that Paladin's weapon. The weapon said Paladin uses to stave off the further advancement by the Undead Frogloks that have been twisted by Bertoxxolous or Innoruuk. Just curious. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I have several chars over 40, I have been playing since March 99, and I pass stuff to my other chars as well as my friends.  I don't sell things I earn, I trade fairly for items I want and I don't use my chars to ruin others enjoyment of the game.  And worst of all, I only play 20 or so hours a week.  I bet if you looked at the majority of people that play, you'll find they're just like me.

</FONT><HR>"Full planar/bp is also EXTREMELY rare..."<P>Depends on the server.   Uncommon at best on Tunare.  Most clerics I see in LGuk are in full purple.  Quite a few pallies that look like they're wearing crafted too.<P>Netspecx:  Now you are being absolutely ridiculous.  C'mon.  You're telling me that seeing a level 7 ranger in almost full ivy that doesn't know rangers can't wear bronze isn't a twink?  Please.  Someone THAT good at trading would know the trade market inside and out, and know what classes can use what.  You know that it is 99% likely true, and the specific instance I mentioned is just an example of something that isn't even uncommon on Tunare.  <P>Besides, what the hell does your argument prove?  That I'm some anti-twink zealot?  Knock yourself out, you're obviously a pro-twink zealot.  Now, assume the extremely likely scenario that she WAS a twink.  Answer the question - are you going to tell me that seeing someone twinked in the gear I am wearing at level 43 isn't going to drastically reduce the aesthetic pleasure of having earned the stuff, and that it won't affect the pleasure and enjoyment of getting anything else down the line?<P>I'm sure you're thinking tons of witty retorts right now.  Here's one line that can stop 90% of 'em.  She was a twink.  I just asked how she got her gear at level 7.  Not in a nasty way (in case she was an awesome trader).  She was a twink.  Bought them with her upper level character.<P>Bah.  I can't tell you how close I came to quitting over that.  Playing in pickup groups with high level characters, twinking is 80% of the conversation.  Someone who wants to roll for their twink is given EQUAL priority to one that needs it for that character that is at the camp.  The game has become about nothing else.  It's just so sad.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First off IMHO, twinking is not bad for the game, in general. The only person it affects is the one that sees him and gets jealous. Other than that, it can actually HELP other players grouped with them. <P>Usually that twinked out player has a high level player, maybe several. I know that when I play my  level 18 magician and I group with others, my experience of playing for 45 levels and with all the other classes, I can give out advice that the people I am grouped with may not know or have even realized. My main is a ranger, and when I group with rangers with my mage, I can help out those rangers especially when I see them doing something really dumb, that I learned not to do after doing it and dying far too many times. My magician is twinked, I admit it. Not overly twinked, and sometimes its not even that noticable, but twinked nonetheless. My being in a group with others is good for them, because I have the mana to end the fights faster. Which means less downtime, less dying, more looting (of which I rarely partake), and faster leveling for all involved. Where is the problem?<P>Miladian Dratsaver<BR>45th level (non-twinked) Ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You probably notice it a lot less, cause you'll roll for any item too (I'm guessing - Ganus is the only twink here that's even acknowledged that rolling against a main for a twink is a crappy thing to do).  But when you don't believe in rolling against other people's mains... but everyone feels like rolling against you... believe me, you notice.  <P>And on Tunare server (with really nice people, don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about tons of asses here) twinking is so utterly commonplace that it's just become what's accepted.  It's like no one is playing high level to -be- high level anymore, except for the random anti-twink like myself.  Everyone there is there to twink their secondaries, cause GOD FORBID that anyone actually get their equipment from something that doesn't con DEAD GREEN.<P>By the way, in case you're wondering - in 43 levels, I have seen exactly 5 twinks (or rather, the primary camping for their twink) willing to pass up anything considered a "good drop" (say, 500pp and up) that their character couldn't use for a main in the group.  <P>And stop asking the bloody "How do you know they're a twink?  You must be jealous" argument.  It's not hard to know.  It's 80% of their conversation.  I don't even need to ask.

</FONT><HR>Thank you Shazariahl!  The "it's not good for RP" argument just makes me ill.  Besides that, as I said before, twinking makes the game for me fun again.  It took me a while before I found the class I like, and when I get tired of this one will I quit the game?  No, I'll twink another character and start again.  Why?  Cause I like the game.  And I like being able to go out and adventure w/o having to camp stuff over and over again.  So what do I do?  Buy the stuff in EC and twink my newbie.  Behold, I have a new character that can rush out into the world and decimate firebeetles!

If there was a way to limit people to twinking one uber item or two, I think it'd actually be kinda neat, and in line with what you describe here.

</FONT><HR>Argh... Nosesocks... I was almost about to compromise on Sha's point about the classical use of the uberweapon... and then you had to go ahead and destroy their argument.  Hehehe.  Oh well.  Good, keep me in line  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I tend to actually give a good argument a shot, I guess, heheh.  But you're right. <P>I've read every book Sha mentioned, tho not enough of Dragonrealms to know about Raistlin's staff.<P>Frodo didn't know much about the One Ring.<P>Thomas Covenant couldn't even consciously USE the white gold ring till like the third book.<P>Neither could Shea use the elfstones.<P>Rand's blade came from his adoptive father.  Power wrought, but not -that- good compared to everything else available.  Probably along the lines of fine steel, maybe a dragoon dirk in terms of comparative power.  Hardly an uberweapon.  Not something that would have a very high level limit.<P>And again, these are examples of ONE nice piece of equipment in their inventories.  Not having the BEST of EVERY piece in EVERY slot, like soooo many twinks on my server.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005277-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005277&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005277&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
