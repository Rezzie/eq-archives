You are also giving me the firm impression that you have no idea what you're talking about, with contradictory statements I've illustrated at the top, and also because you seem to think that programming experience relates to an ability to spot PR conspiracies.

</FONT><HR>"it's a huge waste of time"<P>There are more important things to work on than GEMS.  When you are on the Sony clock, nothing is "spare time".<P>Also, about GEMS... I noticed a few bugs in it. Some of the bugs even contribute to graphic glitches in the game itself!  So now we have a "spare time" usesless feature that will consume QA time!<P>I don't know what kind of software you worked on, but in reality you don't just "slip something into the game in your spare time".  It can have a negative impact and no matter how small it is (2 hours programming or less) it still takes time from other team members (that is provided they do QA stuff, and I suppose they don't).<P>This post is about non technical "impacts" gems has had on the game.  So now this "2 hour spare time project" has cut into Absor's time! It also cut into GM time if people really are pestering them over gem related deaths!  So you see it wasnt such a small change now was it?<P>I will say it again, the dev team has more important stuff to work on!  If you can't agree with this, I will just assume you are a VI employee trolling.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well Absor, I'd just like to say that frankly I have had enough.<P>Time after time players have commented about how there are alot of things that would make the game much funner and would save people lots of time, and make the game more enjoyable.<P>It sounded like a joke at first, a tetris type game inside another GAME. <P>What I'd like to say is that on an ongoing basis verant is misusing the resources which they have on making very pointless additions to the game. We pay our 10 dollars a month to play everquest, not gems. <P>I am aware that I am not obliged to play gems, but there are also people who just sit their playing this game just because they feel that they will make the most out of their time.<P>Gems did not even go on the test server, ask people on the test server about how hard it is to watch chat while playing this very pointless game. <P>Go ahead say 'yes, but it is your choice to play this game' and explain me all that but you also have to look at the fact that some people want to try it out, which in the end makes em lose concentration and then not go in for the big charge (assuming that this is an uber mob).<P>I know you people will not take this game out of a game, a pointless game for that matter which is just frustrating people who want to get stuff done, so all I request is you put a tag above everyone who is playing the game which says GEMS, this way the people who are hurting guilds by playing this game can be booted so they may sit in EC and play gems as much as they'd like.<P>The actions of verant has made many uber guilds crumble to pieces and most of them be eternally crippled due to the way clerics have been treated lately. There is no desire for them to play anymore is the words from most our clerics, they just play so we can enjoy ourselves. <P>I am switching over on my topics slowly, but I think that I am just gonna say this. Why not make the game fun for the players instead of trying to make it realistic. There was no problems with the hate status pre-nerf it made the game funner. How about you leave this game the way it is instead of changing the game after TWO YEARS of being out there. Now you guys should just be fixing up tiny bugs and tweaking some small parts not changing structures which the whole game relies on. <P>Noone has fun finding out a new strat, no clerics have fun dying about 20 times on a dain kill with the cleric nerfs. <P>Stop trying to throw us a bone to cover up the skeleton, get with the program and show us that we are actually the valued customers you say we are. <P>People spend loads of time getting items which just gets wiped away in a few seconds of verant thinking hey, we made this but I dont like it anymore swipe. This is not right, people have spent an upwards of 500 HOURS in plane of growht, ToV etc getting pieces to get this item.<P>I know I have gone off topic a bit and I am sure this post will get deleted just because I am voicing my views in a non-vulgar way, but I just thought that while I am talkign about how these little games are wrecking the big picture that I would mention how it is already hard enough with most guilds crumbling to the floor and other guilds losing an upwards of half their clerics.<P>Oh btw, when is the uber mob tuning gonna happen? was gems so urgent that it went before even this?<P>Well frankly I am just upset out of my mind, this is becoming more of a chore then a game because we have to suffer the fact verant wants to make the game 'real' but when it works in your favor you say it is a game, it would not be fun if everything was realistic.<P>Bandof Ravenheart<BR>60th Warrior of Druzzil Ro<BR>&lt;Seekers&gt;<P>PS,all my views are mine and are not those of the guild which I am a member of.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Anyone with any security about themselves wouldn't try to BRAG.. or SHOW OFF about what they do for a living, how much they make, etc.. especially assuming that you've been in the industry for 20 yrs, which would make you around at least 40 yrs old. Someone at 40 making those comments.. hehe, well, I know KIDS more mature than that. As for Verant hiring you.. I don't think they'd even consider someone with such a poor attitude, and I don't blame them.<P>Bandof_Seekers--<BR>To you I say... yes, it was on the test server. :P<P>To anyone else getting ready to go on strike in protest to Gems--<BR>Don't try to ruin another player's experience because YOU don't like the game. You want this buffed, that nerfed, blah blah blah. Cry a river. Pout. Quit EverQuest. I dont' care. But don't let your egocentric ME ME ME attitude decide what stays and what goes for the other 300k players. I hardly think you have ANY right to speak for them all.<P>Oh.. and hi Etnu!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065757-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065757.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065757-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065757-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065757-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065757&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065757&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
