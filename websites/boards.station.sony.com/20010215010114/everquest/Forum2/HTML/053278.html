</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944.html<P><BR>Author  Topic:   Donal's Breastplate -- some clarifications  <BR>Aradune<BR>Station Member   posted 01-30-2001 12:25 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>I just read through Absor's post and the replies to it.<BR>I wanted to clarify some things.<P>First, it didn't take 6 months and 300,000 people to find the problem. The problem was only made apparent recently, with Velious and the removal of the HP cap. The breastplate didn't appear as a problem until encounters started lasting much longer than they had previously. We made one attempt to address the issue, found out it wasn't nearly enough, and now are faced with having to do this change.<P>Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics. No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time. Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good.<P>That said, whenever we do change or add behavior or other significant aspects of the game, other unforeseen problems often surface. It's the nature of the genre -- these game's change and evolve, and every change, small or large, can have unexpected ripple effects.<P>A second clarification: less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases). We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly.<P>In summary, I'm sorry we goofed up -- it does happen. It will happen again. It's the nature of the beast, but we will always do our best to minimize these occurrences. And we will also do our best to react as fairly as possible when we are forced to act, attempting to do the right thing for both the individual player as well as the game as a whole.<P>It is unfortunate that the item was created in the first place, given its potential for problems, and it's also unfortunate that we didn't realize how much more magnified that problem would become when the HP cap was lifted. <P>That said, again, we're not perfect, and we will continue to make mistakes as long as this game continues to grow and evolve. And, no matter how dedicated our testing staff is, or how carefully we watch for problems on test, we will miss things that 300,000+ players will find. I don't see this changing, and I certainly don't think this is something unique to EQ, but rather something inherent to the genre -- no other type of game changes as often and as significantly, nor involves such a huge community of players who both work with and compete with each other.<P>I know that what I've said probably won't stop the flaming, and I know this is disappointing to both players who have the item as well as those who were planning on obtaining it one day -- I don't expect to post and have happiness follow -- but I did want to at least try to explain the situation in more detail, and to clarify it. And I also think it's important for us to try to manage expectations as they relate to the future.<P>-Brad<P>Aradune<BR>Station Member   posted 01-30-2001 01:17 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>I wanted to add a little more detail and some of my thoughts about ripple affects whenever significant changes are made to a game like this.<BR>When we increased the level cap, there were unforeseen consequences. And so we had to make adjustments. This understandably upset some players -- in fact, any change to the status quo can be upsetting to many.<P>Now that we've increased the HP cap, there are also some unforeseen consequences. The breastplate is just one -- the perceived problems you've posted about class balance and usefulness as a result of the HP cap removal might may well be other consequences (and we're already starting to debate and discuss them).<P>Undoubtedly, we'll have to make more adjustments, bringing the game back closer to balance. Some of these changes will probably be negatively perceived by some players, and hopefully others will be positively perceived. But, honestly and bluntly, the short-term happiness or disappointment is secondary in our decision making process. We fix and adjust and balance, especially after changes like this, to ensure the overall health of the game, because we fundamentally believe that our focus on the game's overall health and balance is what brings long term happiness to our playerbase. <BR>The alternative, really, is a static, unevolving game. If we don't try things out that we never planned to do, like increasing the level cap, or the MOB HP cap, then we risk a stagnant game. The genre is still new, and yes, in a sense, EQ will never be out of 'beta'. It's an experiment in many ways, because something like EQ hasn't really been done before -- there are very few games out there even close to EQ in terms of goals and scope. <P>The same goes for items. We've tried some new item ideas out in an attempt to make the game more interesting and varied. These include this breastplate, the manastone, mistwalker, etc. And yes, unfortunately, these also caused unforeseen consequences.<P>I submit, however, when considering the big picture and the game as a whole, it's better that we try this stuff than not. I also believe in my heart, all things considered, that EQ is a far better game today than it was 6 months ago, and waaaay better than it was when we launched. And, overall, I know it will continue to improve, and so also will our future games be all the more better given what we've learned, both from our successes AND our failures and mistakes.<P>I guess what I'm trying to say, or do, is manage expectations better, going forward. Perhaps another MMORPG will come along that never nerfs, never makes mistakes, but still evolves and expands, with a perfect dev and testing team, eager to try new things, but somehow impervious to failure.<P>But I really doubt it... years of MUDing and game development experience tell me otherwise. And, in any case, until then, we're going to march forward, doing our best, with a strong commitment to continue to both improve EQ and also expand EQ, be it with more content, more options, improved technology, etc.<P>Heck, we're already talking about some major additions to gameplay (not just new content) that we're going to make after we make a serious stab at getting the classes balanced in the next few months. I can't go into details yet, but I think they'll be great. But I also think, realistically, that we'll face challenges associated with the changes - in any case, though, we are going to continue pushing EQ beyond its original scope and vision.<P>I appreciate all of you who've stayed with us this long, and I encourage you to stick with us going forward -- we certainly couldn't have done it without you  And while I wish some of your expectations were a bit more realistic and forgiving, I'm at the same time very glad we have this board so you all can keep us on our toes -- it's an invaluable resource.<P>take care,<P>-Brad<P>Aradune<BR>Station Member   posted 01-30-2001 10:05 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Something else occured to me after reading through the posts....<BR>Our position is that 5 or so mobs need to be adjusted post-nerf. Others disagree and claim that much more of Velious 'requires' the BP.<P>Let's say we're wrong and there are many more mobs that are simply too tough without the BP. Think on that a minute -- that just overwhelmingly strengthens the argument that the BP needs to be changed.<P>The more Velious content that requires the use of this item, a rare drop off of Trakanon, the more it would be true that the majority of our playerbase could never enjoy Velious. We can't have one rare drop off of Trakanon be a gating factor for our player base to enjoy Velious (whether it's fewer mobs as we believe, or more as others may believe).<P>So, we'll change the BP, and adjust mobs as necessary. NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion... especially not a rare drop on a formidable dragon many players will never encounter.<P>-Brad<P> <BR>Aradune<BR>Station Member   posted 01-30-2001 02:26 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Another update  :<BR>One of the reasons we're saying there are only a few mobs that might need to be tuned is that we are ALSO looking at possible new abilities we could give to higher level classes to make fighting these long-winded battles more acheivable.<P>And I'm talking about possibly spells, disciplines, or some such, not a broken rare drop on a big dragon =)<P>-Brad<P> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've often wondered why people get so bent out of shape about EQ... it's a game, and constructive arguments, logically presented, are basically the only thing that sways VI... as it should be.<P>Suggestions for reducing casting time... well... not sure that that would be totally appropriate if under around 15 to 20 secs, as then you'd have a group of six with basically double their hp assuming they knew how to taunt off... and no mana used... this isn't something that makes the cleric job fun... it's something that changes the cleric's job drastically from one of healer and rezzer, which is what clerics are, and what MANY of them that play play that class for, to characters that use primarily their other spells, which aren't designed for heavy dependency...<P>*shrug*<P>I don't think the fault lies in VI changing the item, rather, it falls in them putting it in in the first place, 1, and us responding so violently to its removal, 2...<P>Let them gank down Donal's bp.  Let them.  Then have faith that they WILL give you something else to add an equal amount of spice to your life.<P>Oh, and as for that earlier hmmm post... I get exceptionally sick of all this first post bullsh*t.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune said, "Let's say we're wrong and there are many more mobs that are simply too tough without the BP. Think on that a minute -- that just overwhelmingly strengthens the argument that the BP needs to be changed."<P>Absor said, "It makes a huge difference. It's called mana. The breastplate is not limited by anything right now but it's 30 second cast time. The cleric is limited by his mana pool."<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Wouldn't this also imply that Complete Healing needs to be changed?<P>This breastplate is not overpowered. It's Complete Healing that's overpowered. Why should a level 39 spell be the most powerful spell in the game? 39th spells are passed out like candy as procs on weapons.<P>And why should a single class be *required* to kill these "many" mobs that are undefeatable without Complete Healing?<P>So Absor, you're saying it's impossible for a cleric to get back 400 mana in 30 seconds? I don't think any rational argument can be made to justify the complete healing spell. EverQuest will be eternally imbalanced as long as this spell exists. The fact that it was made into a right-clickable effect on an item demonstrates that VI has absolutely no idea just how imbalancing this spell is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>thanks Brad that all sounds reasonable.<P>The truth is the donals BP is overpowered but even after the nerf the uber guilds adjusted by simply using more clerics and rogues.<P>Now that you are recognizing that some classes cannot contribute in a meaningful way to raids and that rogues clerics and warriors are basically all you need I think the re tuning of SoV will be a very good thing.<P>I also agree that EQ is 10X better than release but as a high lvl SK right now there is no reason for me to try and lvl to 60 since i will never contribute in a meaningful way to a velious uber mob unless I lead the raid and tell everyone what to do.  <P>I am very glad to hear these issues are being taken seriously.<P>To all the n00bs who are going to tell me how great an SK is, yes a lvl 52 SK is a force in Karnors Castle, but a lvl 60 SK is a joke on a SoV raid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree EQ is better now that it was at release but I dont think its better now that it was 6 months ago.<P>6 or so months ago EQ was a great game, it involved tactics and teamwork.  Player skill played a huge part in sucess and failure.<P>As it is now with Velious its a numbers game again in my opinion.  Who can get the most people at once to do a target.  Swarm Tactics.  Resists are obsolete, Lure is usually the only choice (oh 4 flavors yeah), etc etc.<P>I think players are forced to swarm tactics due to Velious mob abilities and to offset the obscene amount of downtime for smaller raids.<P>Im curious as to the designers intended goal for large target raids.  Do you guys think 30 players is a fair number?  42+?  60+?  120? <P>My opinion stands that 24-30 should be enough to take down anything in the game with solid tactics and excellent gear (excellent gear is a paradox i know).  I dont think thats feasable now with Velious and the gap between mob ability and player ability, especially after the Donals nerf.<P>Sometimes I wish the ideal number would be like 12-18.  That way theres less sitting around waiting for people and less cancelling plans do to peoples time constraints and more having fun playing Everquest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Little question that the source of the issue is the power of Complete Heal... but indeed if that was altered, the entire post-50 game would be changed dramatically.  Some encounters would be rendered impossible.  I seriously doubt they are willing to enter a scenario requiring rebalancing the entire game.<P>Of course, on the flip side, that one spell probably caused the mobflation that we've seen... so maybe it SHOULD be thought about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is the SECOND nerfing of this Breastplate. I am neither for nor against it I suppose. The BP is nice but on CT we have killed Dain and Velkor without it.<P>This should set a presadence for Verant though. You all need to test the item's more. When you release an item and have it in the game long enough where people depend on it or enjoy it and then you decide to change it is unacceptable. That is simply nto fair people work to get item's have them for a while and then you say several months later it is overpower and it needs to be fixed.<P>I highly suggest if you have any other nerf on high end item's you do it all in one patch. You are already upsetting alot of people with this nerf and to do it over several isn't going to make anyone else anymore happy.<P>Oh and on the effect on the BP. You have got to be kidding. 7 minute's and 30 second recast time per person? Go back to the drawing board's.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In my opinion, the BP should be left as it is.  It is an extremely rare item and drops off a very high level mob.  Very few people in the game have obtained one and I hardly feel that this small number of people owning it can in anyway unbalance the game.  Perhaps the greatest thing that is causing a balancing issue here is how it compares to the other Kunark class specific armor.  As it stands the Donal's BP is one of very few which have a very desirable effect.  What should be looked into here is improving the other armors so that the Donal's does not make the others pale in comparison.  The balancing issue in my opinion is not that clerics have too much of an advantage but instead too many other classes have a disadvantage.  In order for people to want to kill these super mobs there should be significant reward.  For most actually being able to take down a beast like Trakanon is not reward enough to warrant the deaths that occur as a result.  Examine this idea please, as it has a great impact on the enjoyment of this game as a whole.

Complete heal is not the problem, i the problem seems to arouse when some of those solo classes noticed that with the spell a cleric and warrior could kill better and that made them jealous.....I want rest untill necros are nerfed to death (come on they can cast any spell heal,rez,mez,etc...) well maby just get there pets changed to be exactly like the enchanter pets.

Then you wont understand why the "active" cleric population drops so you will give even more to the Druids and Shamen.<P>Here's a note:<P>a Druid can SOLO!  a Shaman can SOLO! a cleric has to have a group.  so you find that the cleric has the advantage on healing and the BP helps with that.  So nurf the clerics and Beef up the Druid and Shamen?  How can you face yourself in the mirror every morning?  CLERICS need something, and when you find that 1% to 5% of the server clerics have found a way to get experience and not require your "pet" druid class you nurf it and make the druid more able to SOLO so the druid can get invites to groups that they arn't looking for in the first place.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I spent the last year and a half developing a cleric, and now the cleric class will most likely be heavily nerfed (or their power given to the druids and shamans, same thing) because of the rabid class envy of the high level druids and shamans, who are complaining about complete heal at this late date because they claim to have nothing to offer their groups in uber-encounters but healing, since the highest mobs have too much magic resistance.  Shame on Verant for caving in to the shamans and druids.<P>Druids and shamans have been demanding the healing role in the 55+ game so they can continue to go on raids and get the "phat loot".  I understand this, even though I find it very self-serving.  I hope Verant understands their motivations also.<P>To get the healing role, or to be viable in the 55+ game against uber-mobs druids and shamans must either 1) get a big upgrade to their healing power or 2) get the clerics nerfed (complete heal changed or removed) so the mob difficulty will come down and their usual role will be workable again.<P>Perhaps neither needs to be done.  Perhaps the magic resistance of the upper level mobs in Velious could be reduced some.  The druids and shamans would likely shut up if they could nuke and DoT successfully again, and we clerics can continue to do what we are designed to do.<P>The Donal's BP thing is, in my opinion, a tempest in a teapot.  The vast majority of clerics, those not in uberguilds, will not own a Donal's BP.  However, if nerfing the Donal's BP makes it tougher for uberguilds to farm ultra-uber-mega loot, I can't complain.  The haves won't have so very much more than the have-nots.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you wanted to give us something to reduce down time, this would be it. The changes that have been proposed to the BP effect are just silly and seem like alot of trouble when you could just give us something different but still interesting, yet not overpowering.  When Mark of Karn was nerfed, alot of people suggested that you simply remove MoK altogether, put yours heads together and think of something new and interesting for the clerics, rather than just ruin one of the nicer spells we had.  Instead, you decided to just go ahead and ruin it.  Now I see the same thing happening with Donal's BP. Instead of rethinking the item completely and replacing the effect with something nice but not overpowering, we're being handed what seems to me to be a pretty stupid kludge of an effect.<P>Durham Torvalds<BR>Templar of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Someone on another thread made a good point as to why this has "suddenly become an important issue even though they have known about it for 6 months".  With the new mobs in Vellious have 100k+ hps and 100% MR, complete heal isn't just an important spell, its the ONLY spell.  Wizards can mana dump on Lures and if they all land maybe do 5% of a mobs hps and no one else can even cast on the mobs.  That means that complete heal to keep the hitters alive is the only truly meaningful spell.  <P>Gee wonder why they want to remove it.  Its not because some group can use it to exp with no down time, anyone who has it doesn't need exp, its because the players are actually capable of conquering the game and doing the uber raids without 100 people there.  Its because places like Temple of Veeshan might actually be conquered some day.  Its because if players fail 6 or 8 times and have to keep coming back to try and conquer something they keep coming back.  It is an attempt to make sure that the secrets of vellious aren't completely uncovered in the first 4 months of its release.  Its prolonging the life of the game artificially by attempting to keep the players from discovering all quickly thus having to stay around longer and longer to achieve success.  Its because they don't have another expansion in the works already and when everything has been conquered repeatedly people will leave because there is nothing left.<P>Malase</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can certainly see the need to make some changes to the BP.  I'm sure those who worked hard to get it are the ones most upset by the change so would it be possible to do something nice for those few folks like maybe awarding them a nice item after changing the BP? (maybe a mask with decent AC and Wisdom/resists with clickable self invis?) I'll never see that BP myself but it seems fair to me. <P>Please note that many of the folks upset by this are clerics who don't have the BP and may never see it.  They see it as the latest in a long line of changes made to the detriment of clerics.  If you would do something nice for clerics once in a while it wouldn't be so bad but we are constantly told we are 'balanced' so we never get anything fun and every change is a takeaway.  Even the 'nice' things we do get are really for everyone else (rez stick, trak bp, PoG bp all help the group, not really the cleric). We get spells that don't work and are 'fixed' so they sort of work but at a much lower usefulness(elixer etc).  Spells that seem fun and sometimes useful (mok/pet) that are arbitrarily destroyed with no convincing reason given.  (I think the BP change has good reasons given but the mok/pet changes were done in a very high-handed and arbitrary manner)  And spells that look good on paper but can't be used since they cost too much mana and all the high mobs dispell them with ease.<P>I liked the lower level groups much better than the high level groups.  Clerics could fight a bit and then back off and heal.  Wizards could root and shoot and do a funny dance when the mob went after them.  Druids could snare, blast a bit and heal a bit.  Pallys would whack away and tank the mob during the fight and still have mana to help heal up folks during the rest time.  We had some options.  But at higher levels all fights are cast in stone and it is very boring.  Clerics should be able to melee to some degree (all classes should).  We shouldn't be as good as the established melee types in anyway but we should do meaningful damage and be able to out hit kodiak bears. I brought this up with Absor in the class discussions and he said upping cleric melee skills was not even going to be looked at.  <P>Mobs shouldn't hit so hard that all clerics can do is heal over and over from start of the fight to the finish, healing should be done towards the end of the fight or when one member gets frenzied on.  And, mobs should be stunnable so we can use different tactics and make cleric/druid/ranger/wizard groups viable.<P>Its not so much 'you nerfed the bp' that folks are saying as much as 'you give us broken spells/skills, intentionally break the few that did work, take away as much fun as possible by limiting what we can do and now this'.  Your job should be to create the online version of disneyland where everyone is smiling and having fun (this is a game!).  Someone at Verant should be in charge of making sure the customers are having fun but it never seems like it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(maybe a mask with decent AC and Wisdom/resists with clickable self invis?) I'll never see that BP myself but it seems fair to me. <P>Please note that many of the folks upset by this are clerics who don't have the BP and may never see it.  They see it as the latest in a long line of changes made to the detriment of clerics.  If you would do something nice for clerics once in a while it wouldn't be so bad but we are constantly told we are 'balanced' so we never get anything fun and every change is a takeaway.  Even the 'nice' things we do get are really for everyone else (rez stick, trak bp, PoG bp all help the group, not really the cleric). We get spells that don't work and are 'fixed' so they sort of work but at a much lower usefulness(elixer etc).  Spells that seem fun and sometimes useful (mok/pet) that are arbitrarily destroyed with no convincing reason given.  (I think the BP change has good reasons given but the mok/pet changes were done in a very high-handed and arbitrary manner)  And spells that look good on paper but can't be used since they cost too much mana and all the high mobs dispell them with ease.<P>I liked the lower level groups much better than the high level groups.  Clerics could fight a bit and then back off and heal.  Wizards could root and shoot and do a funny dance when the mob went after them.  Druids could snare, blast a bit and heal a bit.  Pallys would whack away and tank the mob during the fight and still have mana to help heal up folks during the rest time.  We had some options.  But at higher levels all fights are cast in stone and it is very boring.  Clerics should be able to melee to some degree (all classes should).  We shouldn't be as good as the established melee types in anyway but we should do meaningful damage and be able to out hit kodiak bears. I brought this up with Absor in the class discussions and he said upping cleric melee skills was not even going to be looked at.  <P>Mobs shouldn't hit so hard that all clerics can do is heal over and over from start of the fight to the finish, healing should be done towards the end of the fight or when one member gets frenzied on.  And, mobs should be stunnable so we can use different tactics and make cleric/druid/ranger/wizard groups viable.<P>Its not so much 'you nerfed the bp' that folks are saying as much as 'you give us broken spells/skills, intentionally break the few that did work, take away as much fun as possible by limiting what we can do and now this'.  Your job should be to create the online version of disneyland where everyone is smiling and having fun (this is a game!).  Someone at Verant should be in charge of making sure the customers are having fun but it never seems like it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm<P>Cheal is not the problem, though most clerics would admit we got it too early (should have come at lvl 44 if it was to follow the same pattern that all lvl 5+ heal spells follow.<P>The problem is hp + mr inflation of mobs, against the very highest mobs the ONLY tactic is chealing tanks, everything else results in death.<P>If mobs had less mr (all forms), then casters + particularly shamans / enchanters would have a much more viable place, slowing a mob would result in the total dmg output of the mobs to drop and would mean the requirement for multiple overlapping cheals could be eliminated.<P>If shaman / enchanter debuffs (other slow line) effected mobs by the same amount they effect pc's (when able to land), then, again the dmg output would drop.<P>The problem as I see it, is that if cheal is nerfed, verant will NOT reduce the hp's / mr / dmg output of mobs at all.  Instead they will suggest that you take more people to do the mobs, a solution that works perfectly well when running over at LAN speed, but that is almost impossible over a dial-in connection.<P>Nerfing cheal will add to the game problems, not reduce it.<P>Regards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>  I think this nerf is really a mistake. First off the donals bp is very rare and very hard to obtain. This nerf is gonna make other bps available to the cleric much better, and these bps are also much easier to get. I mean seriously there are bps out there with more than 40 ac and more wis that are hell of alot easier to get than killing a lvl 65 poison dragon (pretty rare on him too). I really wonder if anyone making these changes have even faced Trakanon. I know there are a couple bps out there that 2 tough groups of 6 could get that would be a better item now than the donals bp after this nerf. That pretty much blows out of the water the idea of risk vs reward.  The new effect on the bp is really a joke. I mean how many times do you think a cleric is gonna cast a 30 second casting time ch on a wiz, chanter, ... ect ect ect? Before you answer remember that the cleric cannot move or cast any other spell during this period. He's a sitting duck and all the group members are in jeapordy. It's either that or sit around for 2 minutes waiting for the bp to heal everyone up. The bp is really gonna only be used once every 7.5 min now. This is totally destroying the item, and the time and effort used to obtain it.<P>   I think that maybe some more creativity should be used in designing npc encounters. Wow i bet i could design some good monsters by their criteria. Ok he's gonna have 12398598 hp hit for 1478 and ch every 30 seconds! Bam! I'll call him "SuperVelka-snodojo"! It really would be nice to see some randomness in the encounter, or maybe something unique to the AI on these encounters rather than just beefing up hp, melee damage, ect. I think it would rock to run into a tough npc and find out that he ae roots everyone, shadow steps, and blows up the group with nukes. This kind of encounter would be a real challenge. Imagine how a ranger would be kicking tail in this kind of encounter with trueshot! It would be a great alternative to wow he hits for 850 and has a crap load of hp. By adding versatality to these encounters would make it so maybe the classes would be a bit more balanced. Relying on hp and damage output is only one way to make tough mobs, and if all these encounters are so-based it limits the usefullness of some classes.  Maybe if we rethink how the unber npcs should be designed we wouldn't have to worry about one item with a complete heal effect or class balance because all encounters wouldn't be a matter of hp and who can take big melee damage!<P>   Last thing, I really don't feel that if some ppl do use their brain in this game that we should punish them. Just because these "Uber" mobs die doesn't mean that one group is overpowered, one item is unbalanced, ect and start waving the nerf stick. It seems like that is done in most cases. I guess it's the easy way out (if all else fails wave the nerf stick!!). Maybe we just need to rethink how to design these encounters.<P>       Thx I do hope you read this,<BR>                Abinadab<P>Just a couple of other ideas I've heard ppl talk about-<P>   In the spawn tables along with having the placeholders ect able to spawn, have the npc to spawn same name same graphic ect but different stats. Have it have a different amount of hp, different spells available to be cast, in some circumstances even a different class all together. This would make some of these encounters more of a surprise and more difficult to prepare for.<P>   If you are worried about a warrior and a cleric out killing turtles and poorly designed npcs that should be out of their reach, do change the npc. If they can kill the npc, then it's an overall sign the npc is underpowered (no this doesn't mean to jack up his hp or make him hit harder). Maybe give the npc just one poison dot spell or something that will do enough damage to kill before the 30 seconds are up. There are probably a handfull of mobs that fall under this category and every time they spawn it's a friggin drama. Like 50 ppl all pop into the zone and everyone is trying to ks it.-Another sign it's underpowered.<P>Also pls don't post on this thread if you haven't ever used or grouped with someone with this bp.  You really have no idea what you are talking about.

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry to say, and you can kick me out or ban my account, I don't care anymore, but Brad, you have no clue what you are talking about.<P>You will NEVER downgrade the Mobs, and if you do, it will be in about 6 to 8 months.<P>You will NEVER upgrade any skills, and if you do, it will be in about 6 to 8 months.<P>You have a game where the zone crashes if there are 70+ people in it, and mass LD if you have a raid over 40+ people.  This has been happening since day one and not been fixed or changed.  Damn it, it took you guys three weeks to just fix a damn diretx bug.<P>There is not ONE mob in this game that can be killed by a warrior and a BP that CAN'T be killed by a Warrior and a nonBP cleric.  <P>Reread that last sentance over, and try to understand it.  THERE ISN'T ONE.  You can't name and if you do, I can show you that a warrior can kill it with a normal cleric or even a shamen or druid.  <P>You are taking away an item that less then 1% of the playing commnunity has, and the rest of us clerics dream about.  Instead of slowly tweaking the BP's cast rate down, you are in one bold slash, destroying the item.  <P>This kind of knee jerk reaction has happened way too often and honestly too many people are sick of it.  <P>You honestly think most people are going to sit around and wait for VI to come to their sences and redo all the mobs above 50?

</FONT><HR>Thoughts on long battles.<P>Long battles are fun, they add suspense.  The question is with current structure of classes is this beneficial for all or just a select few?<P>Long battle for int caster is a few dmg casts 90% resist 90% meditating, resistance especially makes it no so fun<P>Long battle for a wis caster little more intense with healing dmg casts 90% resist on dmg 90% meditating<P>Long battle for melee a whole lot of fun 100% dmg capable for unlimited time.  Stamina wears but still functional.<P>I've found that basically int/dmg casters are great for soloing but useless for groups, melee is more beneficial.  Melee can do continous dmg while the casters have long downtimes.  Also full resist happens a lot.  Which makes matters worse.<P>The point of the above is maybe the magic resistance and meditation downtime might be an area to look at for improved fighting and excitement in long fights.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
