</FONT><HR>uhh clerics nuke at many levels for more dmg than druids or shaman and their nukes are magic based not fire based so they arent useless in entire dungeons like the sols<P>also min you said "It refers to my respect for you mocking. Your too damn lazy to play a class yourself so you'd rather post your envy here and try to get them nerfed."<P>My CLERIC is higher level than yours =) <P>On top of that noone is asking to be NEAR as good a healer as cleric, but we would think that TWO of us should be able to do a little better than one cleric, right now it takes about 5 of us. That leaves room in the group for the warrior though so I guess technically it is possible. <P>If you cant solo your cleric in the 30's you got problems. Try aviaks to start they are easy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>And again I think the minimum refers to the amount of thought you put into things as if you knew enough about me you'd see that I have been a vocal advocate for cleric concerns on many issues. <P>PS ask burlok of the rathe if it's possible to solo a cleric to 50. He's living proof. And he got there just as quick as my druid did. <P>Also about the enchanter issue. There arent near as many important things that are impossible with a chanter as their are things that are impossible without a cleric. Bards for example do an admirable job playing chanter when needed. <P>Clerics dotn need nerfed, druids and shamans just need a bit of a healing upgrade to make them useful.<P>Noone is EVER gonan prefer having a druid or shaman, even IF they some day become 66 % of the healer a cleric is, as long as only clerics can res. <P>A group with a resable paladin and shaman though should be able to get by ALMOST as well as one with a signle cleric. Currently it a joke to even suggest trying it that way.<P>Clerics may as well be Verant employees for the amount of power they wield due to this imbalance. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didnt see anywhere in this post the phrase "Lets nerf clerics". I never said to nerf clerics. I simply stated my oberservations from reading the posts on this board. <P>Seems the ONLY ones in the game that dont want druids/shamans to get some other form of healing is...clerics. And it seems the clerics are deathly afraid that they will lose the ability to get groups. If shamans/druids were asking for CHeal then i would say yes. but let me say this again, they do not want to be the best healers. They simply want to be backup healers if need be. <P>At the current status - ive seen a druid fizzle 5 times with SHeal trying to cast it (Maxed out alt and spec alt). I bet that if you simply improved the fizzle rate of Sheal - they would be happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>you said "Druids<P>1. One of only TWO classes that can solo to lvl 56 with ease. -- this is total crap, enchanters, necros, shaman, wizzies with sow potions or jboots, and yes even clerics can all solo to 50 +, and all of them but wizzies do it better than druids when it comes to INDOORS, res alone makes soloing more viable for clerics than druids as they have NOTHING to lose. The fact is though that with teh overwhelming amount of power a cleric offers a group there is very little reason to solo.<P>2. Has the 2nd best nukes in the game. - actually we're pretty much tied with mages here. Their range of spells to counter resists and direct resist debuffs mroe than make up for our slightly better ratios.<P>3. Has the 2nd best DOT's in the game. ---Shamans and necros both have better dots. Plus dots are all but useless in large groups/raids.<P>4. Is currently the 2nd best healing class in the game.  ---- Yes but it's such a DISTAND second, all we are asking for is to close that gap enough to make it worth trying to contniue when the cleric leaves.<P>5. Is one of the top two PVP classes in the game.-  Druids are good pvp'rs for sure but clerics arent  too bad either. Stun's, fear, blinds and self heals come to mind. <P>6. One of only two classes that can teleport/evac.  --- Yup, but notice how they arent the ONLY ones that can port? Clerics are the ONLY ones that can heal well enough for it to matter. If a wizzie replaces a druid for teleporting guess what? you get tehre just the same, if a druid or shaman replaces a cleric for healing guess what: your DEAD. Oh well at least he can port you back to only 5 zones away from your corpse. <P><BR>7. Has a number of group friendly spells. - Yeah they are group friendly in teh sense that without a group they are utterly useless, but not in the sense that any group would need you for them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Speaking as a 36 cleric of almost two years-<BR>I welcome druids, shamans and others getting good heals. Maybe not at the same level that a cleric gets it, but I fail to see how I will be hopelessly crippled by other good healers being in a group. I can only see survuval advantages to a group to have others heal as well at later levels. And no, I don't ask for sow or tele's in return, I would have played a druid if that is what interested me.<P>While a cleric cannot solo everything like a necro, we can solo quite well if you stick to undead and casters. I have gotten quite a few levels soloing these types of creatures. If you try to take on a warrior type mob it usually has bad results, but stuning and wrath can do wonders once you learn how on casters. <P>And no, as everyone knows, clerics cannot melee worth a hoot. Better to equip a wis item than a melee weapon. I understand and accept that, and am happy with the trade off for the class.<P>If my advice does not make sense to those on Plane raids, then please forgive me, I have not played in those types of groups at all and I may be misstaken or missing the point. But from the viewpoint of a 39 or less, I would welcome others getting some good heals.

In my guild we have 2 50+ clerics.  And 99.9% of the time I never hunt with them.  Oddly enough, I can't recall the last time I went on a general hunt WITH a cleric! (asside from the last raid, in which we had 3 clerics, or maybe 4, for close to 40 people!)<P>All the other classes pitched in to heal, buff, melee (Even the clerics went into melee! hehe, was funny!)<P>I don't see clerics even havig CLOSE to 100% of the monopoly.<P>MANY times I (a paladin) am the ONLY healer in the group.  We knew this going into a fight.  If it got bad and I could not keep up, evac was always ready.<P>Now, should mobs have a TON of health like Velious?  No.  If you give EVERYONE heal, you are still going to have a mess on your hands with the hardest of the mobs.<P>There are all ways to look at this.  Its not that druids/shamans are crappy healers (I DROOL at the chance of grouping with them for the buffs!), its the fact that Verent throws mobs at us that are IMPOSSIBLE without a TON of 55+ folks.  A level 60 warrior should not need a support group of 2 or three healers to one melee.<P>THATS the problem.  I don't look forward to joining a 40 or 50+ member raiding party of 55+ levels just to take down one dragon, only to chance it poofing due to LD kill, lag, crashes, etc etc etc.<P>Geez, its nuts!<P>"The game is working as intended."

</FONT><HR>Personally, I think clerics are the true definition of healers.  Shamans and Druids have a much more diverse range of abilities with healing in a minor way.  Unfortunatly, this means that you would not be as usefull on a raid but I have been grouped with a shaman several times and find their slow/haste abilities help out very noticably.  Druids help out too with damage shields and the like but again, this does not help the big battles as, in my opinion, the big battles are more about weight of numbers than tactics.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hadesblood:<P>{I have seen a two druid combination almost match a cleric but not quite}<P>It should be a little better than that actually.  <BR>Why?  Because no one single group should have to depend completely on the presence of a cleric.  Two druids should have more mana then a single cleric would by the time the battle was over IF all they were doing was healing.<P>Right now that isn't the case.  A 60th druid would have to completely mana dump everything he had to fully heal a 60th warrior.  How many times can a cleric mana dump to do the same job? *cough CH*<P>If that was the way VI intended it then why give other classes healing abilities at all?<P>The answer is not giving druids/shaman enough to MATCH the healing ability and efficiency of a cleric but rather to lessen the complete and total VOID that exists right now.<P>A void that didn't exist pre-kunark/velious.<P>It's all about regaining lost ability, not nerfing  out another class or taking away from another class.<P>Reducing the fizzle rate and reducing the spell to a 49th level spell in combination would do wonders for everyone.<P>Druids/shaman would be a more efficient backup healer (less fizzles=more mana FOR that function as well as for snaring/DD if required).<P>Druids/shaman could now (in tandem) actually serve as healer until a cleric is available.  And when that cleric does become available the druids/shaman can take a deep breath and a sigh of relief because we don't want to be healer if we can help it.<P>We just want to be viable because that IS what our role is defined as where grouping is concerned.  Priest class - Healer.  Leave it the way it is now and druids/shaman are not even that<P><BR>Can't all you anit-druid/shaman get it?  You won't be invalidated by this small, simple change.<P>At best, it could let you put in that additional DD or stun or whatever that you say you can't do now because you have to sit/med/heal and nothing else.<P>As far as helping clerics out of their solitary group function goes I'm all for it.  Whater it takes to spruce up the clerics life is a good thing for us all.<P>At least you have purpose in groups throughout your careers as a cleric.  Druids/shaman do not.<P>I know your gonna whine about pre-39 levels for a cleric.  Yes your role was able to be filled by a druid/shaman.  But so was a mage or wizard as well.  You don't hear them griping and whining.<P>Price for being able to solo?  Initially upon inspection maybe.

</FONT><HR>Apollohades:<P>I changed my name firstly to inflate your overly-larged ego.  It worked.  And secondly to show that most clerics are whiners when it comes to their MONOPOLY on healing (that didn't exist Pre 50).<P>Yes fixing the fizzle rate and lowering it would be enough to quell the masses of druids and shaman wanting a little of what WE lost.<P>Naturally I can't say that it would be enough for Everyone but that's only to be expected and is only common sense.<P>I never asked for CH or divine light and don't care to have them thank you very much.  Neither do most of the druid/shaman out there of the posts that I have read so where are you spewing this crap from?  Please close your leggs.<P>This isn't taking ANYTHING away from you Mr. High-and-Mighty Cleric.  My cleric would welcome the help and how would moving Sup Heal (a spell we already get at 53) to 49 and reducing Fizzle on it be taking anything away from you??<P>Get some help...and no I am not LSB.<P>*want to talk about foolishness and greed?

</FONT><HR>Why the hell do clerics always say that "if dr00ds or shamans get better at healing I was SoW!"<P>How can you be so ignorant as to think your class should get improved because someone else does?  Did you see us warriors going "rangers got the increase in thier tanking skills, we should get SoW!" No warriors didnt do this, in fact we were right along with the rangers saying they needed it because it was sickening having to wait on resses because taunt was broken and the ranger was getting beat on and died almsot as fast as a caster.<P>I feel that dr00ds and shaman should get cheal at 49 and sheal at 39. This would let them function almost as well as clerics do past 50th as healers. They still wouldnt be as good because of lack of symbols and AC spells, but they would at least function. Your still screwed when **** hits the fan and you die because there is no one there to res you. I dont know where Brad is getting that they expect players to get resses at post 50th levels. That is just admiting you expect every group to have a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No I don't want us getting Cheal ever Kethlarexa.  I mean I wouldn't turn it down if they DID give it but that would reallly just be icing on the cake.<P>We need Sup Heal at 49 and lowering the fizzle rate would do nicely.<P>And your absolutely right, we still lack those wonderful symbols and AC spells.<P>It would take nothing away from the clerics (they are just mad because we are infringing on their monopoly, if you could call being viable infringing)<P>And Apollohades, you accuse me of being LSB...do a search on ALL of his posts.  Mine have less spelling errors than any of his...you got the wrong guy here.<P>He wanted hybrids to be as powerful as the Gods.  I only want druids/shaman to be *almost* as good as they once were.  Not only for their OWN sake but for every other poor soul that has to wait for hours because no clerics are on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047656&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047656&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
