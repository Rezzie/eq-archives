The important point that may not have been clear below is that there is a cap on the amount of hate that can be awarded for any particular heal spell. For a target below level 51, no heal spell can generate more than 800 hate, regardless of the number of hitpoints healed. For targets level 51 or above, the cap is higher, but does not approach the total hitpoints of a fully buffed warrior.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, let me explain something.<P>I'm a lvl 60 warrior.  I've played with the same cleric since level 1.  She's 60 also, we dinged on the same kill.  We're in a great guild, and we consider ourselves lucky.  We both have our epics, and she passed her Donal's bp down the line when she got her PoG bp.<P>We created these characters for many reasons, one of which was that a warrior and a cleric are a great duo.  We love to group, and raid, but we also really enjoy hunting quietly for experience on the road to level 60.  Warrior-Cleric is a great duo for this.  Neither of us want to solo, and there're always some low blues that we can take with just the two of us.  As long as we fight them one at a time, of course  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So we've done this for 60 levels:  Hunt with friends a few nights, guild raids a few nights, and then we we need to get away it's off to Lfay to kill brownies for brownie parts and very little xp.  But that's ok.  Cleric-Warrior duo is a good duo for single mob kills, but hardly the most efficient.  It takes longer, and you're limited to low blues.  <P>Now she's had her PoG BP for a few levels, and it's been very nice.  But I can honestly say, there's never been a time when she's chain casted it on me in the manner you suggested, Abashi.  It just doesn't make sense.<P>1)  When it's just the two of us fighting, say at the brownie camp, we're fighting stuff that we can kill easily.  Sure, she could chain cast the bp on me for that fight, but what's the point?  We did fine before the bp, it's not a determining factor.<P>2) A cleric-warrior duo, post 50, cannot take large risks when hunting for xp.  Why?  Because if you cut it too close, the warrior dies, everytime.  The warrior has no escape route when the mana is gone or if a timed heal fizzles.  So in general, all war-cleric combos fight the easy blues, like we do.  If we want fast xp, we find a HS or Chardok group.  <P>So let's add the PoG bp into the picture.  It can be chain casted, and by your calculations 300hps per tick.  What does this do to our low-blue encounters?  A bit less downtime, same outcome, we win the fight.  Could we use this effect on a high blue mob?  Not a chance.  Anything mid to high blue in the endgame can easily do more than 300hps of damage in 6 seconds.  So if we take the risk, and find this out the hard way, the warrior stays a live through one, maybe two chain casts, then the damage finally catches up and he dies (or flees) midway through the last 20-second cast time.  End of fight.  Hopefully the cleric can gate or zone or die in a convienent place for CR.<P>Point: The PoG bp does not allow a war-cleric combo to hunt something they could not otherwise hunt.  It simply lessens downtime.  And is that a bad thing?  An equipment upgrade should result in better efficiency for the team.  If I get a better sword, then I will kill a monster faster, which saves mana and downtime.  The PoG bp is not overpowering or unbalancing in the war-cleric hunting combo.<P>3) XP groups: For this example, let's visualize a standard balanced dungeon group.  War, Cle, Wiz, Enc, Ran, Dru.  The classes really don't matter to explain my point.  For a cleric to dedicate, in battle, 20 seconds to cast a Celestial Elixer, then the fight is not challenging enough for the group.  20 seconds is an eternity.  What if aggro shifts?  The chanter and the ranger both can die in that 20 seconds while the cleric is LOCKED into a CE on the warrior.  It's just too risky in any encounter except the safe, boring xp hunts.  The same safe, boring xp hunts that are just as easy without the PoG bp.  Again, less downtime with better equipment.  Hardly overpowering.  When we hunt for xp, and we get a fast paced, adrenaline flowing group together, the PoG bp is useful for one thing, and one thing only.  After the fight, my cleric casts CE on me and I heal as I head out to pull.  Again, it saves downtime but does not allow us succeed where we would not otherwise.  <P>4) Uber encounters:  As noted in many posts before this, the effect on the PoG bp can not be used in any manner that would effect the outcome of a high end raid or encounter.  The mobs just hit too hard, and too fast for a cleric to even consider a 20 second cast for 300 hps a tick.  It's only used after a fight to heal the wounded, and after rez.  Again, it saves downtime.<P>I've given examples of the majority of encounters a 55+ cleric will face.  In each of these, Ibelieve I've shown clearly that the current effect on the bp does not affect the outcome of any encounter, it merely saves downtime.  Is that really overpowering?  Hell, is it bad in any way?  If I change my armor, I'd expect an improvement over my old armor, or there'd be no reason to switch.  Risk vs Reward:  A cleric works hard to get this bp, and is rewarded with less downtime.<P>Like I said before, I'm a lvl 60 warrior that's spent every one of those levels and over 90 days of played time with the same cleric.  She's had the bp for quite some time, and the points I've outlined above are directly from our firsthand knowledge and experience.  Trust us on this one, we do know what we're talking about.  There is no need to make a change to the PoG cleric breastplate.  It is not overpowering in any way.<P>It's late (early?), tempers have flared, including mine, we've all said quite a bit.  Please just read my arguments above, pass them on to the Dev team and let logic prevail.  I'm going to get some sleep and hope this was all a bad dream.<P>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>lvl 60 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>[quote]<BR>1. The healing-hate cap is being reduced. (less hate max per spell)<BR>2. The calculation of hate is moving a ratio of less than 1:1. In other words, currently if you heal 1000 (assuming the target is over 51), you gain 1000 hate. After the change you'll gain less than 1000 hate.<BR>[/quote]<P>Yet it was said only last week by either you or Absor that the hate that can be generated from 1 heal was HARD CAPPED at 800.

</FONT><HR>I'm not even going to address the gameplay issues of this.  I just want to ask you one simple question, how many times does it take to dangle a piece of candy in front of a kid and then yank it away before the kid stops going for the candy?  You are breaking the spirits of your players all in the name of game balance, to which you have admitted is impossible to achieve in the high end game.<P>This item is not the only item that has been "nerfed" nor the only ability that has been nerfed.  The fact that we have a word for nerfing and that probably every person who is level 10 or higher knows the meaning of this word should tell you that you have got a serious problem!<P>Once this item was discovered by my guild, we absolutely dropped everything and busted our ass to get more of these.  We sacrificed many of our plans and our time because we realized the power of an item that was available.  By nerfing this item, you have devalued our efforts and demorilized many of the clerics in my guild.  How many times do you think you can get away with this and still have people who play the game?  I could go on... exquisite weapons, the WW gnome quest, soon to be gem drop rates... all the "good deals" are getting yanked away as soon as people figure them out.  This practice has reached the point where any time people see any kind of good item or good deal, the FIRST response is always "WOW, that's really great... we better hurry up and get some before they get nerfed."  <P>HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GONNA CHANGE THE RULES TO THE GAME??  Can you imagine if people changed the rules to a sporting game halfway through, or someone arrested you for violating a new law last week that was made retroactive today... It's absurd, it completely violates common sense.  There's just not much more that people of my age and experience can take, I wonder why I try to get anything anymore, who knows what the stats will be tomorrow?<P>Gnix Gnimblestan<BR>59 Gnome Rogue<BR>Lotus Cult, Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Is it just me? I am sensing a lot of hostility towards Clerics from these people. 1 minute casting time? Please! I bet you could cast the spell normally, sit and med up to full by the time you cast it with the BP. Frankly it pains me to see people treated like this. I can only imagine what it would be like to have an item like this, and then have it destroyed like this. I might well quit the game if that happend to me. The way I see it is that they just dont want to take responsibility for there own actions. Just watching this happen makes me wonder if this game is really worth playing.

</FONT><HR>Oh, love the little hate reduction post.  Kind of reminds me of a litle stunt Verant did with Mark of Karn.  Break it, tweak it a bit, call it fixed, expect us to be happy, nobody still mems the spell.  <BR>Screw hate aggro, break the bp, fix a little bit of hate aggro, expect us to be happy.<P>And to whoever suggested we get Aegolism on the BP: NO!<BR>The Druid spell Protection of the Glades has made both Aegolism and Heroism/Heroic Bond obsolete (whoopee).  Our class is defined by a level 39 spell.  We haven't gotten an upgrade to it in 21 levels.  Our primary AC/HP spells are surpassed by druids.  But this is all old news.<BR>At least we had cool equiptment we could look forward to. &lt;SNAP&gt;  Damn.  Well, we had cool equiptment.  Who wants to go make a rogue and talk about what it was like to be a cleric?  Good money says half the rogues made in the next week used to be clerics.<P>Simply put: Anyone who can get the BP of Stability does not fight mobs that do 300 damage every six seconds.  And that's also assuming you're always pulling single mobs, when a large majority of the mobs we're fighting in Velious now are unmezzable.<P>AND this doesn't justify the BREAKING of the BP.  If you absolutely positively cannot have that BP in the game, then give us a new BP.  Don't just pull a MOK on us and break the living daylights out of it so those of us who worked hard to get a BP get schluffed to the back of the line and have to wait ALL OVER AGAIN to get our Velious BP with an effect.  You are effectively removing the effect from our BP without any kind of compensation.  GIVE US THE RIGHT TO REPLACE IT WITH THE NEW ONE YOU BRING OUT even though even money says it's a lousy buff we already have that's made obsolete by a class that shouldn't be surpassing our hp/ac buffs.<P>Finnien<BR>(who has posted more here today than he's ever posted on the board before, total)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since there is such a level of concern about balance why don't you leave clerics alone for a day or two and do something about the level 1 warriors I see in full cobalt armour with wurm slayers?  Or how about addressing first level casters in 0 robes with steins? Or uber guilds who power level there rez mules and get them that silly manaless rezz stick?  There are blatant destructions of your precious balance every day but nothing is done to address them.  How can you possibly feel at this point that clerics do not feel singled out or victimized?  In rapid succession you nerfed donals, increased the healing of other classes, and now are nerfing these other breast breast plates not to mention the untested supermega AOE + healing aggro fiasco.  I find it interesting that in some of the class balance talks it was stated that the necromancer lich series is broken but that it would be left alone as fixing it would be seen as another "nerf".  It would be nice if you would apply this same logic to clerics.<P>But why do I even care any more?

</FONT><HR>What a load of rubbish Abashi.<P>Firstly, if you've played past level 50 you'll know that EVERY single blue mob and above does more than 300dmg every 6 seconds, most significantly more. Celestial Elixir cannot be stacked and so 'chain casting' is far far less effective than the Donal's BP. Currently the BP simply helps with downtime and gives the primary tanks a much needed hp boost. it in NO way, shape or form makes a tank virtually invulvernable (which a Donal's BP could maybe do). It simply slows down the rate at which the tank takes damage, it does NOT negate the damage. Have you any idea how hard and fast some of your ill-tuned SoV ubermobs hit for Abashi? Or are you still soloing Aviaks in SK with your twinked 'wonderful' necro epic? You have no clue and it shows.<P>You've already excluded the int casting class from the high end game and now you're intent on crippling the cleric class. Do NOT make this a 1 minute cast time - as even you have admitted this makes it absolutely worthless. At the very worst make it Celestial Healing with it's current cast time. If you fools can't work out how to tune stuff with mana free spells in the game then you shouldn't introduce ANY more.

</FONT><HR>Might i suggest you replace MrCleric-in-Uber-Guild who is designing all this rubbish with a shelf life of about 4 months, and get someone who understands the theory & dynamics of this game?<P>Look, it's not difficult:<P>Manastones - Removed for the mana regen they provided us with CH, locked from Kunark, Velious & the Planes, not the naff excuse about grouping.<P>MoK - Removed (ok not technically, but it's poo now) because it released so much mana to clerics through accesory healing, not the naff excuse about grouping.<P>Donals BP - Nerfed into oblivion due to manaless healing.<P>Velious BPs - Nerfed beyond oblivon due to manaless healing.<P>Now, given there's a timeline there of nearly 2 years (TWO YEARS), why do you continue to learn nothing from previous errors?  These are justifiable nerfs because of their unbalancing nature, but for the love of god, after the first, there should have been no more items even vaguely similar introduced!<P>It's not dificult to understand!  Stop putting this junk into the game, letting people get seriously aquainted with it (months!) and then removing.<P>God im annoyed, i really expected you to have learnt from the Donals BP before introducing an almost identical item with Velious.  It beggars belief.  Im sorry, i do not buy in the slightest that these problems are not noticed until they have been in circulation with the masses for some time.  Utter baloney - prop an item or spell up in front of any experienced cleric and they'll tell you what effect it will have on gameplay.  You niched us so well most will know mana costs vs downtime off by heart.  Apart from your item designer apparently.<P>After all the recent kicks in the groin clerics have received, you had better think long and hard about sticking something DECENT on that BP (Aegolism springs to mine - don't forget to give it a crappy cast time in case we accidentally heal someone with it).  Throw us a bone, thanks for the healing changes (and fix you seem to have coming), but i want to see decent item nerfs replaced with decent items - not balanced against gameplay changes with hate lists etc you make.<P><BR>Aunoa.<BR>57 Cleric<BR>Bristlebane.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>The only proper way to balance items like this is through recast delay. Not super long casting times, not gimmicky psuedo-buff icons.  We know that, you know that.  You have known that for at least 8 months, and probably back to the manastone nerf.<P>You say there's some programming difficulties involved.  OK. I accept that.  If it takes a few months to analyse and code, so be it.  Had you started when you first knew it was the proper approach, it would have been finished before Velious even came out.  You didn't, and now you're facing the consequences - angrying and demoralizing your entire customer base, and yes, losing quite of few of them because of it.<P>I'm realively sure that clerics would prefer the PoG BP to have a 4 second casting time and a 10 minute recast than the proposed (guess I'm still in denial) 60 second casting.  Even you agreed that 60 seconds make it "useless".<P>Come on. Bite the bullet. Commit now, publically, to do the work and implement item recast times.  Furthermore, commit to 'fixing' the various nerfed items (Donal's BP, PoG BP, etc.) once the code has been implemented.  (If I was doing damage control, I'd go so far as to state what the new numbers would be.)  <P>Sometimes the right thing to do isn't always the easiest.  But in the long run, it's almost always worth the effort.<P>It the right thing to do, and you know it.<P>Kendil D`Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Put the effect Invisibility on the new bp.  It'd be a great token compromise and give clerics a piece of armor that they'd actually cast from.  At the level a cleric needs to be to get this, we're already putting down a ton of platinum in invis potions.  We already have a huge money sink paying 1-2k pp per raid in peridots.  Lifting this money sink and annoyance would ease the life of many clerics.<P>Countering any "there is no precedence" or "clerics were never intended to invis":<P>- Warriors get invis on their cobalt legs<BR>- Wizards: motto used to be wizards don't get invis undead, why should clerics get invis.  Wizards recently got invis undead.<BR>- Rangers' tolan bp allows them to port to faydwer.  Rangers don't even have the gate spell.<BR>- Due to their single-minded healing role, clerics have a very, very low number of utility spells to help with the massive time sink of travelling.  As shamans and druids recently got a huge upgrade to their healing abilities, feel free to pass on to us any of their lowest utility spells for travel we sorely need.<P>I don't advocate muddying the class distinctions or making it so every class can stop depending on others.  I'm just advocating making a bp worthwhile and coveted for more than its stats which are arguably not that important.  Clerics at this level always carry invis potions with them, so it's not changing the game other than less trips to the bank/potion vendor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, 20 second cast, manaless CE can be used to do things which were not intended to be done originally.<P>I can understand that, although I still fail to understand how after years of QA this game still has things entering it that apparently were NOT fully tested.<P>Change it to 1 minute cast, and force it to never drop again, being replaced by something that we don't know about yet.<P>I do NOT understand this one bit.  For those of us with this bp, it is especially bad.  Now we have an item that has an effect we will use once every other week.  If the item that replaces it has a better effect (doesn't even have to be good to be better than 1 minute CE), then we have to go about getting this item ALL OVER again.  You might as well have taken it out of our hands if the new version is superior, because all of our work will goes down the toilet since we have to get it again.<P>Why not just remove the stupid CE effect since you have stated that you can't "balance" it, and replace it with something you would consider acceptable?  30 second Aegolism, 30 second Naltron's Mark, 20 second Bulwark of Faith, or maybe use some creativity and make something NEW like a group Bulwark or maybe one of those new cleric spells you claim to be working on.<P>This all could have been avoided though if you just TESTED the item before releasing it.  If this effect damages the integrity of the game so severly, then I simply can't understand how it was so easily missed by your QA staff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi stated:<P>4. Heal spells assign hate on what we call an "assisted" basis. In other words, any NPC that sees you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy (someone on their hate list) will add hate since they saw you doing that. They do this whether or not they are the primary target. This is why in multiple-attacker scenarios *everything* jumps the cleric as soon as he heals. This is also why everything that's mezed jumps the cleric as soon as mez breaks. We're fixing it so that critters that are mezed or stunned only add enough hate to prevent exploits of mez and stun, rather than the full load they do now when they see you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy.<P>Where in any high level encounters can mez and stun be used?  Why even give enchanters Kintaz or Rapture?  Kintaz is only used in lower sebilis.  I only use Rapture for some splits in sky.  Sure I can use charm to finagle some kind of crowd control.  But why even worry about hate added when mobs are mezd when they rarely ever are in the high level game and the system worked fine in the rest of the game.<P>Really though the new hate on healing is really super!  It has added to my fun in big battles imensly.<P>*fight starts*<BR>/who cleric<BR>5 players<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I actually read both threads. No one is saying clerics are useless without the PoG BP or the Donal's BP. What we are saying is that the effect on those items made the game more fun to play. The continual nerfing of all the classes has the opposite effect. We also spent a lot of guild time obtaining the items which is now sort of wasted and our faction is in the toilet. Hey - I will still wear my PoG BP for the stats and the look. I won't be using the spell on it any more due to the danger it would put my group in.<P>Mainly - for the first time in 2 years I am seriously looking for a new game to play. I do not feel like VI cares much if I am having fun any more. The game has become like a curse thing where VI tries harder and harder to defeat a couple uber guilds - meanwhile eroding a very large non-uber customer base. I don't log on looking forward to more defeats - more deaths- more endless hours of CR - more mindless hours wasted merely travelling to hunt - blah blah.<P>I would encourage CS to remind the team that even though it is tempting to engage on the level of defeating the small uberminority it is probably going to spell the beginning of the end of Everquest as a player in the MMORPG market.<P>I wont stop playing now but these last few weeks have pretty much cemented my decision to move to the next non-Verant, non-Sony game product that comes out. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
