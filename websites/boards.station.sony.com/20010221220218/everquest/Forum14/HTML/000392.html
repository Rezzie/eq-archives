&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P>Clerics: <P>ITEM:  Standing Meditation.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Either a spell or a 'discipline' that would allow clerics to gain sitting meditation rates while standing.  This would allow a cleric to wander around and perhaps fight (see other items on Defense Skills and Bash) rather than meditating.  One way to do this would be to make is a spell or ability that they can use that would be interuptable and would turn off when they sit down.  The drawback is that if clerics have this 'blessing from god' ability a lot of other classes will want it too.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Defense skills.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Higher dodge and defense skills.  This, in conjunction with giving the cleric bash, might allow them to get into the fight more often.  If so, it seems more appropriate to raise parry than dodge.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bash.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Combined with somewhat higher defensive skills, this might allow a cleric to jump into the fight more often.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Perhaps this spell should be re-evaluated as if it was a DoT.  But, as with the Wizard flaming sword pet, perhaps this can be made more interesting and useful DoT by making the hammer immune to AoE spells and riposte.  This way it will only die if it gets up on the hate list.  Used this way, it would allow the cleric to 'do something' other than healing…<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Stuns.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Stun spells, like charms and mesmerization spells, become useless on certain powerful creatures.  Perhaps stun spells could be made at least somewhat effective where they are currently useless, giving clerics (and a few other classes) something more to do in those battles.  The 58th level spell, Enforced Reverence, might be a good candidate for a ‘lure’ level of resistance on a stun spell.  Changes to the general Magic Resistance in Velious item might remove the need for this item.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bind Wounds.<P>DESCRIPTION:  As the primary healer, it seems that they have a less than maximum cap on their Bind Wounds skill.  It seems logical that, if anyone, Clerics would have the maximum cap.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Death Pact / Divine Intervention.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These spells are expensive to cast (5 or more plat).  These spells work too infrequently and don't have a large enough effect when they do work (they should heal more hit points).  In general the agreement seems to be that a percentage heal from these spells (25/50), and a much higher chance of it actually going off is a good idea.  These spells should at least be re-evaluate, since it seems that they are very rarely used, and that's a shame for such an interesting spell set.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Healing Over Time.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that the healing over time spells do not stack with poisons or diseases (one player also noted that Celestial Healing does not stack with Regrowth).  This would seem to be the kind of things that these spells are designed to work against.  Is this intentional?  Also, if the shadow knight epic weapon proc (Soul Consumption) is on a target, the healing over time spells won’t stick.  But if the healing over time spells are on, Soul Consumption will stick.  This seems like a bug.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Aegolism.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell might be too expensive (10pp) to cast.  It basically seems to do what it was intended to do, save time and spell slots.  But the players think the mana cost is too high.<P>STATUS:  None<BR> <BR>---<P>ITEM:  Symbol of Naltron.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Again, the feeling is that it is too expensive.  Perhaps moving the reagent for this spell to something that costs about half as much (5pp), or increasing it's duration would ease the monetary burden.  We should also look at the fizzle rate on this spell, it seems too high.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Shield of Words.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The complaint here seems to be that there is a double mana cost for a 6 point armor class increase from the previous spell.  This exactly follows the pattern of the spell line, though, and may not need to be changed.  Though perhaps it would be more appropriate to offer a larger armor class increase considering that the level increase, though the same, represents a much harder level range.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mark of Karn.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Perhaps a slight increase in effectiveness is in order.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Divine Light.<P>DESCRIPTION:  One of those spells that fizzles too much.  All spells that fizzle too much should be looked at.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Heroism/Heroic Bond.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It appears that Heroic Bond, the group version of Heroism, won't overwrite itself or Heroism.   It probably should.  As it is, it creates problems when people join a group late, or go LD.  The cleric can't just renew the whole group at that time with the group spell.  This might not be as much of an issue if changes are made to allow players to click off beneficial spells.<P>STATUS:  None<BR> <BR>---<P>ITEM:  Fortitude.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell gives lesser buffs than its predecessor, in exchange for a longer duration.  Shouldn't it at least give the same or greater buffs as well as the longer duration?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Hammer of Striking and Hammer of Requital.<P>DESCRIPTION:  More spells that never see use.  Players would like to see these improved somewhat, stat-wise.  They have suggested giving them some sort of proc, perhaps a proc versus undead isn't too bad of an idea.  But the concern is that just the weapons themselves are pretty useless.  At the level the cleric gets these spells, he is never going to fight on a corpse run, he's just not good enough even to take out greens.  So these spells see no use.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Abolish Disease.<P>DESCRIPTION:  They want the 49th level shaman spell.  The question here is, is the curing of disease the exclusive area of the Shaman?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Invisibility (personal only).<P>DESCRIPTION:  A cleric finds himself running to do resurrections all over the place.  This would be a nice addition that would make that easier.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Self-only Gate to Temple.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It might be too late for such a big idea, but here's the concept.  Set one temple up as the temple for each god.  Make a gate spell that takes the cleric to the temple of his god (might be one spell, might be a spell for each temple that you can only memorize or pick up if you worship the god of that temple).  It's a time honored idea from D&D.  And it adds a little mobility to the class (reducing downtime).  These could even be the object of another quest.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lull Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players feel that these are resisted too much (or, alternately, cause too much aggro).  Since these spells are used to break spawns and deal with things that will usually cause characters to run screaming to the zone, a high resist rate is considered problematic, so the spells are generally not used, and other targets are sought by the players.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Holy Armor / Spirit Armor / Guard / Armor of Faith / Shield of Words / Bulwark of Faith line of armor spells<P>DESCRIPTION:  This actually came up as part of the Magician Talks.  But it seems that this spell can not be clicked off by the recipient.  This causes trouble for the magician because it also overwrites his armor spells (with lower AC but they include a regeneration component).  Perhaps it would be a good idea to allow any character to turn off any beneficial spell.  I understand that there is a roleplaying reason for not allowing it (it isn't your spell, after all, and how would a warrior know how to turn off a clerical spell anyhow).  But for gameplay it might be too restrictive.  Or, allow the magician armor spells to overwrite them a lower level clerical armor spell.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Banishment of Shadows.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This level 60 spell does not work on targets over level 45.  It destroys the target, leaving no corpse and giving no experience.  It also costs a Star Ruby to cast.  If this spell was intended to help the cleric deal with annoying green, then perhaps the component cost is too high.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Group Resist Poison.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Since clerics are all about stopping poison, how about a group version of a resist poison spell.  A nice time saver for clerics.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Root or Mez undead.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This might be a good idea for new spell lines for the cleric.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Gate to Temple (personal).<P>DESCRIPTION:  A spell for each worshipable deity in the game that would take them to the temple to that god.  So, for example, Innoruuk followers would be have a spell to gate themselves to the temple in Neriak.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Deity specific spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Similar to the Temple Gate idea.  Create a unique line of spells for each god that can only be cast by clerics that worship that god.  They would have to be balance with each other and still be unique and representative of the individual god, so they might be very hard to balance.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a Wiz and not a Cleric but I think clerics are one of the most important chrs in the game and as they lvl up they dont seem to get enough resorces to make them fun to play. Rez and Heal are magor part the game and I feel it is important to keep Clerics happy and make them fun to play. <P>So what Im realy posting to say is that I hope Clerics get some good changes that will alow them to participate more in a battle without jepordizing a group by using presious mana that could go to heals and rezes. Regardless of what happens to the wiz class i think anything they do to decrease the down time for clerics and make them more fun to play is a good idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you had you would (or should at least) understand that this list is the concerns/ideas the the Dev Team is going to be considering - NOT the final decisions.

</FONT><HR>I like the option of the self invis, and the temple gate spell, but would like to add that for those of us clerics that have intentionally or UNINTENTIONALLY fouled our faction up, there should be some way of correcting factions to our specific gods in a more timely manner..So far with all my research, I have not seen one way of repairing faction to Servants of Tunare, and the Cleric of Tunare faction is not going so fast either.. since almost all the quests for the Clerics involve handing in items that I am kos to. I was one of those clerics that went to PoG and didn't know the faction hits till after about four kills by my groups, and now I don't think Tunare would welcome my presence.   Faction issues should be repairable if the temple gate spell would become a reality.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

For instance, the cleric line of HP/AC buffs (Valor, Resolution) doesn't seem to stack with the Druid Group Cold Resist buff.

</FONT><HR>Comments --&gt; <P>ITEM: Standing Meditation.<P>I would rather see a spell granted to clerics that helped them increase mana whether sitting OR standing.  But this is acceptable as better than nothing at all.<P>ITEM:  Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<P>Still a waste of mana unless hit points increased or it stays alive after fight.  Should be at least as "powerful" as the druid pet.<P>ITEM:  Stuns.<P>In addition to propsed suggestions, decrease recast time. 12-24 second recast for a highly resisted, high mana (240 for enforced reverence, 250dd+stun with 24 sec recast) stun is too high.<P>ITEM:  Death Pact / Divine Intervention.<P>Remove the pearl/emerald components or remove the charisma check. Increase duration on divine intervention.<P>ITEM:  Fortitude<P>I'd still rather see this as a group AC buff =)  <P><BR>ITEM:  Invisibility<P>I don't think clerics need this as a spell in their spell book, but adding it as an effect to our Donal's Bracer (instead of the completely useless pacify) would be wonderful.<P>ITEM:  Lull<P>Change to UNDEAD only for clerics. Make it un-resistable similar to the druid/ranger Harmony spell.<P>ITEM:  Donal's BP<P>Chestplate of Stability: Wt 8.00. +42 AC, +7 Sta, +13 Wis, +5 Int, +7 vsMg, +2 vsFire, +3 vsCold, +2 vsPos, +3 vsDis, +50 HP, +60 Mana, Celestial Elixir<P>or<P>Donals Chestplate of Mourning: Wt 10.00. +40 AC, +12 Agi, +12 Dex, +12 Wis, +80 Mana, Effect of Complete Healing<P>Stat-wise the Chestplate of Stability is sooo much better for a cleric.  Risk vs. Reward not happening here.  A group of 6 is able to get the Stability BP while it takes a dragon force to take out Trakanon for the Donals.  <P>Need to adjust more than just the EFFECT on the Donal's BP.<P><BR>***WISHFUL ITEM***  Undead Tracking  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <BR>Would be FUN.

</FONT><HR>As a non-Cleric (I play a 56 Ranger), I have always sort of resented the Mark of Karn nerf.<P>I already pay a penalty for Dual-Wield in sevaral areas, not the least of which is that every time I hit with EITHER hand, I take damage.  This I have accepted and lived with for a long time.<P>However, I'm not allowed to benefit from Dual-Wield by being healed when the off-hand hits.  Isn't this a double standard?<P>How come I am forced to take the pain, but am not allowed to benefit?  It seems to me this nerf was overly-harsh and not well balanced.<P>I understand that Knights don't like it because they can't Dual-Wield.  But Knights also don't have to take 60% more damage (and usually more because 1h weapons are often faster) against a damage shield.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow alot was missed from what I have read of the posts on the cleric talks.  You must have stoped reading after about cleric talk three.  What about:<P>Curse line of spells.<BR>-Where as we could lower the offending mobs ac or attack ability.<P>Expansion of undead Dot (turning of the unatural) line of spells.  The current one is very weak for the level we get it at.<P>Group resists being we are one of the few classes with all resists buffs.<P>Undead snare fear line called turn undead.<P>We don't even have the parry skill to increase.  An added skill would be nice but the skills are so low as to be uneffective at higher level for the type of work we are doing.<P>A "Bless" line of spells that increased attack skill.<P>If you have read all the posts it would be nice to see a list of what was turned down for consideration.  If you have not read all the way thru Cleric talk 6 maybe you should have a look.  There are more ideas that to me embody the cleric more than some of the ideas above.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've just posted this over at EQCleric, but here I'll expand on it<P>Initial Impressions:<P>Things that were shot down<BR>--------------------------<P>* Gate to Temple <BR>OK, bad idea, never been a big fan of it myself.<P>* Diety Specific Spells<BR>Sigh. The Cookie Cutter Cleric syndrome continues. I'm a Human Cleric of Mithaniel Marr. Why Should I be gameplay-wise exactly the same as a Dark Elf Cleric of Innoruk ? Perhaps just actually finish putting in the diety specific symbols into the game ? <P>Things that were ignored in the original thread<BR>-----------------------------------------------<BR>* Group Armour Class buffs<BR>CLERICS WANT THESE. I cannot stress how important this is. Make it a group version of our 39th Armour spell, at tripple the mana cost. Here is a major clue : BUFFING IS NOT FUN.<P>* Offensive Melee skill increases, such as 1 hand blunt<BR>Saying that Higher defense and dodge skills will " let us get into the fight more often" betrays a major lack of knowledge about Cleric Melee.<P>Clue : Clerics. Cant. Melee. <BR>Hitting for 1's and 5's on a mob with 15,000 hitpoints is NOT meleeing. It's not even amusing to watch<P>Things that have been worded so as to be unlikely to happen<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>* Standing Meditation<BR>Yes, our power is given to us from our god, many of whom now walk Norrath. So why should we have to sit and med like the other classes that use their internal energies to cast spells ?<P>* Aegolism changes<BR>The spell is too expensive manawise. Again - BUFFING IS NOT FUN Make it entire group for 2000 mana, which at least we can med back with bardsong, necro infusions, modrods. Rather then Buff / Med / Buff / Med / Buff / Med <P>* Shield of Words AC vs Mana<BR>The Armour class spells badly need a group component to get it all out of the way in one hit. Notice a trend about buffing yet ?<P>* Abolish Disease (49th Shaman Spell)<BR>Clerics and druids should get this spell, because we have always gotten the other anti disease spells one level later. You have already blurred the lines by giving Druids and Shamans Remedy and Divine Light, it's a bit late to get nervous about the minor issue of Diseases.<P>Shamans get cure disease at 1st, clerics and druids get cure disease at 5th<BR>Shamans get Counteract at 24th, clerics and druids get Counteract at 29th<P>* Invisibility (Absor is VERY against this in past comments)<BR>I agree with a previous poster, lets get rid of Pacify from the Bracer or Tremor from the boots and give us invisibility. Warriors can cast from their armour, why not us ?<P>Things that have a chance of actually being brought up at the meeting<P>* Parry and Bash<BR>Bash could actually be useful. After all, we have 6 stun spells, all of which have been made useless on your Magic Resistant Complete Healing mobs, so something else that we can fail with every time would fit in just perfectly.<P>* Unswerving Hammer of Faith Immune to AOE and Riposte<BR>For this spell to EVER be useful, it has to be able to do at least 1000 damage. Why ? Because at 54th level, we get a 240 mana 575 direct damage that gets +10 damage a level. The hammer is almost 3 times this mana cost 600 mana, so it's effectiveness should be at a minimum equal damage.<P>* Possible 58th level low resist stun<BR>Why not remove the double resist check from all our stuns, and revisit some of the higher ones ? I still use my level 5 stun, because it has no damage component, so it is twice as likely to actually land. <P>* Bind Wounds<BR>My bind wounds skill is around 5, at 59th level. Because, since I have to sit and meditate to get my mana back, it is more efficient for the group for me to sit down and do nothing. Every tick that I'm spending giving a tank thirty hitpoints from a bandage is another tick I'm not medding. <BR>This is the core issue with Cleric's - Because our mana is a major factor in group effectiveness, every tick we are not trying to get our maximum mana back is another tick we fail to do our job. <P>This means, to do our job best, we have to sit down and do nothing except watch our mana bar creep upwards, while everyone else gets to do things. You seem to have missed this point the first 300 times it was brought up.<P>* Death Pact/Invervention<BR>It costs money. It costs mana. It costs a buff slot. It should work 100% of the time, not some arcane formula based on the casters charisma. <P>* Symbol of Naltron 1/2 price or increased duration<BR>Increased duration is not the problem. The cost of the component is. An increased duration won't help us against dispelling mobs, or for that monk that dies a dozen times an hour on any average SoV raid.<P>* Heroism and Heroic Bond stacking<BR>If all else fails, why not make it so Heroism is 1 hp or 1 ac less then Heroic Bond ? It's a simple change, and Heroic Bond will always overwrite it then<P>* Fizzle rate of Divine Light<BR>And Mark of Karn, which is far worse then Divine Light. I cast Mark of Karn and Celestial Elixier all the time on raids, and Mark (a spell I got 3 levels ago) fizzles far more often then Celestial Elixier does, a spell I got at 59th. <P>* Fortitude<BR>Again, make it a group AC buff<P>* Summoned Hammer spells<BR>About the only way to actually make these useful would make them droppable and not lore. Of course, then we are cutting in on the Mage class summons, and we know how much you hate merging spells between different classes.<P>* Lull spells<BR>You mean that these arn't used to pull mobs ? I've been using Lull and Pacify as a low agro pulling method for when I'm the highest level person in a group. To fix these, make it so that if a person is more then half the normal agro distance away, the mob won't agro.<P>* Allow clicking off of beneficial spells<BR>PLEASE. Nothing worse then a Tank playing the get-dispelled and rebuffed because the best buffs are on him first, or he's run into the 15 buff limit<P>* Banishment of Shadows component cost.<BR>Why do rogues' assasinate( which they can do with their normal equipment) still let them get XP and the corpse, but our spell which has an expensive component remove the corpse and cost everyone XP ? The wizards would like to talk to you about Disintergrate also, I'm sure.<P>* Group Resist poison<BR>More group spells are good. Remember, BUFFING IS NOT FUN<P>Understatement of the Year <BR>--------------------------<P>"Mark of Karn - Perhaps a slight increase in effectiveness is in order"<P>NO. SIMPLY CHANGE IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS.<BR>If you continue to insist on the strawman argument that Mark of Karn is unbalanced because of the single wield / Dual wield complaints, here is my explanation again.<P>Complete Heal benefits Paladins, Shadowknights and Warriors, classes that use a lot of 2 handed weapons. Paladins and Shadowknights Cannot dual wield at all. <BR>So they receive minimum benefit from Mark of Karn, and maximum benefit from Complete Heal<P>Complete heal CANNOT be used safely on Rangers, Monks or Rogues, three classes that use a lot of dual wield weapons. <BR>So they receive minimum benefit from Complete Heal, and maximum benefit from Mark of Karn<P>Whoever designed this spell originally knew what they were doing, and was aware of the Ranger / Monk damage sponge comments, and introduced this spell specifically to counter that.<P>Don't destroy his brilliant idea, put Mark of Karn<BR>back the way it was. <P>Jimette<BR>59th Human Cleric<BR>Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think that we should get our DD's 5 lvls earlier, starting w/ smite at lvl 14, then Wrath and lvl 24, etc.  This would not make us into wizzies, mages or anything else.  It would give us a chance at soloing after 22, 28, and so on.  It just sucks after a certain lvl.  They do nothing to the mobs with ever growing hp's.  Whether you drop the damage and let it rise with your lvl as they do now.  But as most people will agree, smite sucks after 20 or so and wrath after 35 or so.  I think this would add fun to our class and maybe add more to our grouping.  I never use my DD's in a group unless something needs to die faster.  I will still save all my mana for healing, for the most part.  Unless i have clarity and fm, i wont cast.  <P>I would also love to have invis.  Look at it, Warriors/Pallys/Clerics.  Only class w/o a form of invis.  It really sucks when the damn greenies attack you and possibly kill you when you are running to a corpse w/o sow or invis.  These are my oppinions, and would like to see them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two notes:<P>"The drawback is that if clerics have this 'blessing from god' ability a lot of other classes will want it too."<P>And that's when you use the term clerics have learned to know and love:  NO.  Who cares if one class is envious of another?  If now Verant is going gungho into changes just to appease customers, I can see the end on the horizon.  If changes weren't made to begin with that blurred so many class lines, people wouldn't be so insistent on asking for abilities they don't deserve.<P>"The question here is, is the curing of disease the exclusive area of the Shaman?"<P>Sadly, it seems like the 'changes for the better' that have gone in (or are planned to go in), no realm of the game is exclusive to any one class.  Is healing the exclusive area of the cleric?  Nope.  And with the changes listed, it will be even less so.  Heck, ressurection, is that the exclusive realm of the cleric?  Again, a resounding NO.  I'd love to see how one can justify two other classes getting resses, but you can't get the primary clerical class a best disease cure.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Standing Meditation:<BR>---------------<BR>Very good idea. It would allow us to enjoy the game much more, even if our piddly offensive abilities don't really influence the battle.<P>I would suggest an ability that makes Standing mana regen=sitting mana regen. Stacks with clarity, and other such mana regen spells. Nothing that makes us regen faster while sitting, just that we don't have to sit.<P>--------<P>ITEM: Defense skills.<BR>-----------<BR>Umm. We don't have Parry.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It may be helpful, but not a huge deal that makes the class any more interesting to play. Of course, it would be good though, not complaining.<P>-----------<P>ITEM: Bash.<P>DESCRIPTION: Combined with somewhat higher defensive skills, this might allow a cleric to jump into the fight more often.<BR>------<BR>Only useful if we get standing meditation. Otherwise, there is no purpose to it.<P>-------------<P>ITEM: Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<BR>--------<BR>Great idea. Making it actually useful, and not instakilled would be nice. If it was mana effecient enough to use occasionally, it would be very handy. The way you describe it, it would be excellent in long battles, as long as you have a melee person staying higher on the aggro list.<P>----------<P>ITEM: Stuns.<BR>------------<BR>You mentioned a possiblity of reduced MR overall for Velious as a way to fix the stuns. That would help many classes in addition to clerics. I'd rather see that any day instead of a lure type stun.<P>-------------<P>ITEM: Bind Wounds.<BR>-------------<BR>Ok, logically, it does make sense to make clerics better at it. But even if you do, no cleric is going to use it, unless we get the standing med enhancement. Cause without that, it would be much easier to just med up. Unless you give standing meditation, don't bother with this one though.<P>-------------<P>ITEM: Death Pact / Divine Intervention.<BR>-------------<BR>Definate improvement needed. for a 5pp reagent, I think this spell should go off almost always, and be a lot more significant of a heal.<P>-------------<P>ITEM: Healing Over Time.<BR>-------------<BR>Fixing stacking issues would definately be nice. A lower level version may be nice as well.<P>-------------<P>ITEM: Aegolism.<BR>--------------<BR>Noone cares about saving a spell slot. A buff slot, yes, but not a spell slot. BTW, this spell should have some other advantage, as it is much easier dispelled than the other 3.<P>-------<P>ITEM: Symbol of Naltron.<BR>-----------<BR>Easy fix, change Peridot costs. This would fix the problems that enchanters have for Rune as well.<P>------<P>Shield of Words<BR>----------------<BR>6 more AC and a slightly longer duration isn't enough. Perhaps keeping AC the same, but doubling current duration would work. Doesn't imbalance things, just reduces downtime and monotony.<P>--------<P>Mark of Karn.<BR>------------<BR>Pretty please with sugar on top? Unless you intended this to be used only to remove Damage shields, there is a problem with its current implementation.<P>-------------<P>Invisibility (personal only)<BR>--------------<BR>We would love this. Although allowing us to invis others may work too. After all, the vast majority of classes can already invis themselves. That includes the vast majority who we may ever group with.<P>Self-only Gate to Temple<BR>----------------<BR>This would be incredibly nice. One of the biggest problems in the 50+ realm is travelling back to town to get the needed reagents for symbol spells. I don't know of a single cleric who wouldn't love this idea.<P>The standing med, Improved MoK and the pet would be excellent additions during combat. Invis and self gate to temple would help a lot with travel. We would still be a long way behind many classes, but it would make things a lot easier for us, without imbalancing anything.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>STANDING MEDITATION:<P>No offense to anyone, but I feel that this would be a severe gameplay issue.  All casting classes have to do it.  It's part of the game.  Meditation in itself is a reflection of ones thoughts, or focusing one's thoughts onto something so they can gain back mana.  The one thing I heard was that since Clerics derive powers from their gods they should get it, but druids also derive their power from nature by the aid of their god.  I think a curse line would have been better than the standing meditation.  Mana would just regen way to fast.  I'm not sure how many mana points a tick you regain, but if you could stand and med, couldn't you nuke a mob till near death then just back peddle with SOW until you gain enough mana to finish it off?  It totally destroys the risk factor in open zones!<P>Just my two coppers!<P>Alric Vanmorrison<BR>49 Cleric Karana<P>Baralo Horehound<BR>32 Druid Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still think a 50 cleric (or most any class) should be able to melee as well as a 20 warrior.  But Absor decided not to put this on the list so no one on the team who should decide this is going to think we need it.  We can't use it in a 'real' fight anyway, its just so we can kill greens when needed.<P>Also, I thought Aegolism's main issue was that it was a single dispellable buff, which when combined with its high cost made it silly to use when so many mobs at that level dispell.<P>Note for Drakewyn,<BR>I maxed specialization for evocation first (I was soloing mostly) and then at level 52 changed my specialization to alteration and maxed it.  I saw no difference in my DD's or healing before or after.  I could chain cast the same number of each spell type and got no more fizzles or resists either way.  I could heal just as well with evoc specialized and I can nuke just as well now that I have alteration maxed.  So I don't think specialization really does anything or maybe the 'changing your specialization' code doesn't really work.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  A few ideas to make a Cleric a more desirable player in the spirit of balance:<P>  Better armor combined with a parry skill, better dodge, or both.  I'd like to see Clr only armor have better ac across the board.  Perhaps + 2ac to +5ac per piece along with +2 wis per piece, including bracers.  Giving clerics a greater access to high ac armor that exist already would be great as well. I must decline to ask for better attack abilities, but parry and better dodge would indirectly increase melee ability, and just as importantly, the healing ability through most lvls compared to other healing classes.  No one should be upset if a Cleric's total defensive abilities are equal to or better than a Warrior as long as we do not get any increase in attack abilities.  <P>  If I understand correctly that channeling includes the ability to cast heals while being hit, then this ability per lvl should be increased as well. <P>  While I don't have a problem with paladans getting res, or druids and shamans getting better heals at a higher lvl, it would be uplifting to see an increased emphasis on clerics' ability to heal during a melee with really great armor during most levels in the game.  This would make the game more fun for me, and despite what my fellow clerics may say now, I believe more players would find clerics a fun class to play.<BR>  <BR>  Of the improvements I've seen clerics suggest, the only one that seemed like it might be a good idea is invis for high lvl clerics.  Auto - Med would open a huge pandora's box of class envy me thinks.<BR>  <BR>  A renewed overall commitment to emphasize what being a cleric is about would be greatly appreciated.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If the clerics are to get a version of this spell it should be later than 54th or not as effective. <P>Similarly they should get Abolish Disease - just as Shaman should get Abolish poison - both get all the earlier spells in the line, so why shouldn't they get the last one?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh PLEASE let someone from the dev team or EQLive or whatever be reading this post.<P>I'd like everyone to take a step back and look at Jimette_Bertox's post.  It neatly defines nearly every major cleric issue completely with rational arguments and most importantly HE POINTS OUT THE BS.<P>Quite simply it contains every issue of substance that needs to be looked into for BALANCE while dismissing the 'wishlist' items that other clerics have been posting.<P>1) More deity diversification with spells or COMPLETING the symbol quests (or adding more quests or deity only items)<P>2) All of our issues with stacking buffs / costs of certain spells / **group buffs**<P>3) The REAL deal on cleric melee.  We ain't gonna melee, raise caps that will help us not get hit as much.  Plate wearing class = can take the hit, right?  Wrong.  If we have to have the stygma of being a plate wearing class (along with the 'then why can't you take a hit from a mob for more than 3 seconds) at least let it mean something.<P>4) Cleric mana regen:  RP concerns aside, clerics need better mana regen to DO anything in a battle but sit (i.e. no 'tanking', no pulling, no bind wounds).  You've seen fit to spread mana regen across EVERY other caster class?!  Where is the 'balance' in making clerics sit around MORE when we are the class with the LEAST diversified role as casters.<P>Absor you've had to write and read a lot, and we all appreciate the work you've done, I believe that this thread is finally starting to sift out all the junk and crystalizing some of the necessary changes for clerics.<P>Thanks for your time and effort =)<P>--Cadsuane<BR>51st Vicar of Innoruuk<BR>Morell Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I highly doubt that verant will implement a standing while medding feature if it continues to be referred to as such. <P>What it should be considered is as similar to the bard mana song and make it either group or self-only. Call it a Chant or Prayer and give it similar limitations as bards songs. (eg. interrupts and such). If need be, set it up as a MOT - mana over time chant. A certain amount of mana quickly regened over a period of time either self-only or group. Make it so it has a medium refresh time or ability so it can't be abused.<P>And while i'm at it, you need to look into the casting time on some of our spells. They take forever to cast.<P>When taking these items to the table, please take into consideration that Clerics have the LEAST amount of spells in total as compared to everyone else. We could use a few new (and creative) spells to ADD to our arsenal in addition to the bug fixes.<P>thx for the response<BR>-Cenelron </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Paladins get stuns, the ability to melee and tank, heals, and resses.  Clerics were supposed to be able to melee and tank in return, not as well as a melee but should be far and away better than any other non-hybrid casting class.  However, all we ended up with is that pretty shiny armor that doesn't go far in allowing us to take hits because our defense is capped low and we have no defensive skills (aside from dodge I believe, which is capped even lower).  And our melee is pathetic post 30 (shamans are better, where's the reasoning in that?) and our ability to tank is 0.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will try to be as convincing as possible with this. The list looks great, however you are missing one thing that is very important for some clerics (namely erudites and humans): Ultravision<P>While darkelf clerics get it as a race bonus from lvl1, and most of other races get infravision so they can manage, Humans and erudites have none. Now, please take a look at the spell: Each other class excluding paladins and warriors has a spell or an effect that gives ultravision. <P>Bards get a song that gives it, not sure about the name but i tested it with a friend, and DE mask as well<BR>Rangers/wizzards/necros get chill sight<BR>Shamans/enchanters get ultravision<BR>Rogues get UV on mryo helm and DE mask<BR>Monks don't have it, save for the mempo of likato in hate<BR>Paladins neither, save for erudite paladins which get the shield of stalwart seas<P>You could always argue, get a glowing stone band, and you have infravision. True, but if you think for a moment about the high lvl game, wearing a glowing stone band is not only going to have you laughed at, but lose some useful stats. Eruds and humans already start with not as good stats as other races (especially eruds)and you're asking us to sacrifice another ring slot for an ability that each other race has?<BR> <BR>Same with a crown of king trannix, well, stats are good but only when you switch to MR gear<P><BR>Solution: Give us heat sight at lv24, chill sight at lv44, plainsight at lv60<BR>(kinda like D&D's spell Revealing sight) <BR>If you don't want to give us the heat-chill-plainsight line, then at least put those effects on our armor, for example POG gloves or donal's helm. (donal's is the armor which has the most pathetic effects that never will be used, now with BP nerf comming) If it was me, i'd put summon coldstone on the POG gloves<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000392&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000392&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
