</FONT><HR>Spend 30 seconds writing a silly question for which Gordon has the answer, and you WILL get an answer; Gordon even sometimes says "no" in a profound and interesting way.<P>Now, spend dozens of hours (hundreds, actually) off-line, discussing, amending and refining your topic over weeks and months, and go to Gordon with proposals you think are the most modest, the most precise, the easiest to implement, and what do you get ? Silence. You are ignored.<P>If Gordon answered: "Don't know, don't care, there may be something valid in your demand, but I advise you not to pursue, because this is such a low priority that you have about 1% chances of getting any fix, and not in a near future", then, at least, you would clearly have the choice of giving up the demand or giving up the game. But mere silence probably keeps you hanging on, with less chances that you quit. This has lasted too long (6 weeks I'm trying to lobby, plus occasional demands dating back to 1 year) and I'm disgusted.<P>I won't even give a link to my original demand, because I don't want to look like I'm trying to gather more specific support for my particular cause; this is a matter of principle: dishonest management of issues considered low-priority. I'll go on holiday, play a bit more on-line when I come back in September (just for a good-bye), and then cancel my account and post a good final bit of loathing here.<P>P.S. I have a lot of fun with my character, even without the fix I ask for. But what I ask for is something which I signed for from the start, and didn't get, and I can't stand being cheated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nicolbolas,<P>I'm sorry that I can't address all of your issues, but I can't address *every* issue here on the boards.  Besides the fact that there are 300-400 new threads per day, there's another 4000 posts to go with them.  This means that chances are your *post* won't be addressed.  However, if you stick around long enough, your *issue* probably will.  Of course, if your issue has already been addressed, it might be a while before I'll come back to it.  There are issues on this board that we could debate full-time for months and never reach any agreeable resolution.  I however can't devote all of my time to any one issue.<P>You might notice however that I addressed your post on the "Draught" line 20 minutes before you wrote this post. <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Now, spend dozens of hours (hundreds, actually) off-line, discussing, amending and refining your topic over weeks and months, and go to Gordon with proposals you think are the most modest, the most precise, the easiest to implement, and what do you get ? Silence. You are ignored.&lt;&lt;<P>The ones where you can toss out an answer get answered fastest because they're the *easiest* to answer.  It takes a few seconds and little contemplation.<P>When you're responding to an essay that someone has spent "weeks and months" working on or leading up to, you don't want to give them a toss-off answer.  For one thing, it doesn't do them justice.  For another, you don't want to get flamed for it being a brief response.<P>And often, those essays are on dead horse topics, are things that don't belong in Gameplay, or are (to be frank) too complex to deal with in a post.  Abashi could spend 40 hours a week on two or three of those--or he could spend it covering a *much* broader ground.  When they get him 3-6 assistants to answer the toss-offs, then he can work on the essays.  Until then, don't be suprised if a novel doesn't get a response.<P>Gordon is also not required to answer every single post up here.  A *team* of Gordons would be needed for that, and it'd wind up messier than it started out.  There's some things that I, too, would like to see answered but aren't--and a lot of things I'm pleasantly suprised to see addressed.<P>Gordon is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't on this, but I think his priorities are more in order than you realize.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is an insult.<P>I've been contacting tech support at eqtech@verant.com, eqops@verant.com and got nothing but canned responses to either my direct e-mails or submitting the support form.<P>I've sent an e-mail to George Scotto about the terrible customer service I'm (not) getting and got a very sincere sounding e-mail that my problem was given (and I'm cut and pasting from his e-mail) "I have forwarded your email to someone one of our senior technical<BR>representatives in hope that he can help to diagnose the problem and get you<BR>back Online."  This was received on 7/30/2000 and I have yet to here back from any 'Senior Technical Representative'.<P>I have posted my problem on the Bugs/Quality control bulletin board in the hopes that I might get some help there.  Result 1 deleted post, no response to the other (dated 8/1/2000).  It's not because Ester is not on the boards (she has posted to 76 different threads in the past 5 days) so the other reasons I can think of for no response is:<P>1. She is overwhelmed and can't read all the posts.<BR>2. She has read the post and feels that there's nothing she can do.<BR>3. She has read the post and feels it has already been answered.<BR>4. She doesn't care about the post (I don't think this is likely considering her other posts).<P>You've stated that you were going to be putting up a FAQ with issues that have been covered before, this could just be the answer you gave to the thread explaining the situation (this is not hard to do on a bulletin board).  Instead of having to search through all the thousands of posts you've made.  (yes I did a search on my problem and received only 4 responses dealing with disconnection, and none of them addressed what can be done to fix the problem, it only states that your not going to change what happens when you go link dead because people would pull the plug).<P>I really can't wait for another MMORPG to come out (AO, UO2 (gasp), Horizons, etc) cause I'm going to cancel my EQ account as soon as I find one that I like that has some Customer Service.<P>And you know what, I really don't care if anyone responds to this.  I've only been able to play maybe 3 days in the past three weeks, and I'm getting tired of trying to beg for help.  I just wanted to vent and maybe let other people know they are not alone with the disconnection problem.  Maybe if enough people complain someone might notice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>SeanW24,<P>Not asking for answering 200,000 all the time for everything they want.  Just asking for reasonable customer service:<P>1.  I've been posting to try and get help for the disconnection problem I've been having since 7/24/00.  The two responses to my post I've received from Verant was a closed thread (and I was being very patient to try and get help) and the second one was closed because I stated that the customer service was a nightmare and they took it personally.<P>2.  I've received an e-mail from George Scotto stating that a 'Senior Technical Representative' would look at the problem to help me get back on line, that was on 7/30, still no response.<P>3.  In the past 2 weeks when I've tried to call Tech Support 80% of the time I get the message that there are too many calls to be handled and I should either try to get help in game or go to the website or call back later.<P>4.  Not one of my e-mails to either eqtech@verant.com or eqops@verant.com have been responded to, aside from the auto-responder message.<P>5.  Even if all 200,000 people are asking for help at the exact same time (which is highly unlikely since not all of them are in the same time zone nor play at the same times or have the same issues) it's still not unreasonable to expect some type of response within a 1 week timeframe.<P>6.  If someone had responded by now (even with a 'go away you are bothering us, we can't do anything for you' message) I wouldn't even be bothering to post here.<P>*keeping fingers crossed that one day I'll get a response from Verant*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>KidF:<BR>"Is Abashi even around? Why does Verant even pretend this is some kind of company sponsored board?? He has posted like 2 or 3 times in the last week. He gets paid for that?? Serious, honest questions go unanswered day after day."<P>Hey, KidF, do you ever hear of a thing called calendar??? Take a look at it some time. August 11 and 12 are, believe it or not the _weekend_ and Gordon doesn't have to answer questions, but he actually _did_ get on and answered some questions. <BR>Before that, if you were to bother to use the search function, you will see how many posts he made within the last week or so. Seem to me you are too lazy to do that and just jump the gun instead. <P>Ahh, yes, indeed he does get paid for what he does. I personally think he works hard to earn his pay. From your offhand statements and judgements without really looking into the facts and all that, I wonder if _you_ are good enough of an employee to question his work ethics and if your judgement is a correct one. There is nothing worse than a customer who has the illusions that he can do a better job on anything than anyone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ...The best person to know about good work ethics are the ones who has them theirselves, which doesn't seem to be the case in this situation.<P>I see many threads that are serious and well thought out, but a fair number of them are discussion about dead-horse issues and between players without addressing to VI/Abashi directly. Some of them are directed to Abashi which had been told "no" but can't seem to take no for an answer. I don't know if these people don't know the meaning of the word or just so used to getting their way that they can't accept the fact that they can't get everything that they want everytime. <P>Don't get me wrong, there _are_ serious issues that Abashi haven't gotten around to answer yet, such as fixing all the bugs of bards' songs... etc... <P>Zowies:<BR>"Abashi:<P>Instead of spending one of your 19.6 posts a day asking text not to insult you, make a board or locked thread with just Abashis Answers and keep it at the top."<P>Hmmm, are you telling Abashi that he can't defend himself against insults? Btw, how about people on here stopping with all the accusationa and insults so that Abashi can do more work? How about _you_, Zowies, stopping with all the none-constructive but negative posts? None-constructive and negative posts just for the shake of posting don't add any thing to any posts. They are just a waste of space and time to wade through. Thank you very much.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Zowies:<P>"So basically you'd rather people go to other websites for your answers? We dont pay them 10$ a month now too do we?"<P>Yes, you pay $10, but that so that you can play the game. You don't pay to get answers and post on this board. In fact, Brad specifically said that they use this board as a communication line between VI and us, the customers. He also said that the day that the boards don't serve that purpose anymore, he will shut them down. You don't like it on here? Tough cookie  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>"_Okay_I_wont_put_words_in_your mouth_ since I could truly care less if people see all your<BR>posts, but you seem to spend a lot of time sighing over having to answer so many threads that are answered just previously. This would give people a chance to read one thread first for the answer they seek.<P>Guess thats just too easy, ie: against the Vision."<P>As soon as you finished saying "I won't put...in your mouth..." you went and said "Guess thats....against the Vison"  talking about putting your foot in your mouth... Since when did "The Vision (of the game)" has anything with this particular post? If I remember this correctly, this post is about customer service, or am I wrong?<P>darthsidious:<BR>"Abashi I'm disgusted with what you did about the Rallos situation. Posting a fony message about a possible move that was never even going to take place, then leaveing everyone hanging without any more input. I truly believe you are out to just mess with us for your own personal enjoyment."<P>Dude, get outta the "I want instant gradification and I want it now mentality". Things take time (gasp) to resolve. Last I heard, they still considering what to do about RZ. I can be wrong, of course  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Your conclusion that he's out to mess with you is totally baseless, and as Spock would say: "Illogical". So get over it and start controling your emotions and start thinking logical on this matter. Good luck  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pvaryen:<BR>"To which absolutely none of them were ranger or wizard threads which is probably what the original poster's subject matter was."<P>None of them on Rangers and Wizzies, I don't think this is true, but let's say it's true, what's your point here? You are saying that he should read and answer them? Hmmm, I didn't know that when Abashi accepted the job that he agreed to let you, Pvaryen, have a direct say on what posts he will read and answer...If that's not your point then what is it? Did you ever think that he already answered those questions, and people just can't take no for an answer and keep asking over and over again? Doesn't sound like you did.<P>In any case, this post of mine seem to be long enough, I will stop here.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>:bows<P>Flamiously Yours,<P>Flamer/DeFlamer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>PS: Just another note, I always put my money where my mouth is.

</FONT><HR>Zowies - You are totally unrealistic in your expectations of customer service. <P>It amazes me that you feel that you should get complete and utter satisfaction from a video game that costs you a whopping $2.31 a week to play. ((9.99*12)/52) No matter what Verant does, no matter what Abashi says, there will always be those that are not satisified.  Especially Trollers like you that are antagonistic and callouse with your broad, invalid statements.<P>I read these boards.  I also check other websites for additional info.  There is no LAW that says that they must sponsor a Board for EQ.  They offer this site, and are quite often abused by trollers that will never be happy so they want to make others unhappy.<P>Bottom line - Verant has a wonderful, dynamic, creative, realistic game.  Servicing 200k plus accounts from all over the world is no easy task.  Is there room for improvement?  Yes, as there is always room for improvement.  But will they ever be able to please ALL of their customers?  NO  Especially not for a whopping $2.31.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>He did respond to a wizard thread by just saying they won't do anything. The fact that he actually replied was in itself a surprise to me. But his response content was not surprising at all.<P>Gordon, I honestly don't know what is up with you and since other Verant people don't post anything about wizards I'm not sure if it is personal bias, party line or what. There are very real and measurable problems with a class where many, many very capable players cannot even get a group due to the class's stigma. Couple that with all the valid well-written arguments over the last year which go completely uncontested and it is truly something I want to read more about in prominent gamer mags. It is disgraceful the favoritism displayed and how negatively you are affecting many players because of it.<P>Note I said uncontested, not necessarily unanswered. Because an "answer" in the case of wizards is almost always "Move along, nothing to see here. Nothing is wrong with them." Sprinkle a few VAK support spews and you think it is suppressed for a little while longer.<P>Gordon, it will never die and never end simply because YOU ARE WRONG. You are going against a grain you canot "win" since it is just totally whacked. An entire class is being exterminated seemingly on purpose. Anyone can see that regardless of what class they are. Wizards, along with rangers and monks FD issue lately, get a lot of support from non-class players simply because they can see the unfairness and it has nothing to do with class envy or hurting their own causes to say so. When groups stay at 5 members instead of taking in a Wizard (many levels, although I am at 50) just in the off chance another "something else" will come along, that is just too much.<P>The crowning touch is you going so far as to actually change our class description to try to match it to what you want to turn us into, not what we bought and paid for, read about to entice us into the game and spent 100s if not 1000s of RL hours developing our characters for. And you don't see a problem with doing that? DO you honestly think anyone will ever forget that, or that somehow you can now just point to that silly "masters of defense" or "efficiency" or whatever crap and say "This is you now, forget...forget...".<P>Basic psychology show there is a bias at Verant, and prsonally don't think it is Gordon solely dictating anything. There is a Company Line he is well aware of though. It is a Vision thing coming more from Brad or something. But quite obviously there is some unspoken hushed rationale which Verant just doesn't feel it is in their PR interests to just come out and spill about the true reasons they have they stance they do. And yes, anyone with any knowledge of EQ knows it revolves around time sinks, leveling too fast or something similar.<P>The real unspoken and unsolvable problem (to Verant) is how to help a class whose primary and possibly only real means of salvation directly conflicts with their #1 desire to keep the game slow. My opinion from almost 18 months of playing time are Verant has chosen to destroy the Wizard class in favor of keeping the Vision of a very slow-advancing game intact. Our class because of its very nature of intense magical dmg dependence is most at odds with the Vision.<P>They do not want anyone past a certain dmg/tick ceiling, and have allowed other classes to all bunch up around that ceiling without pacing our one shining combat ability to keep up since it was the first to hit that ceiling. But they don't mind having many other abilities to vary the other classes, since each ability by itself does not breach the ceiling. So although the sum of other classes far outweighs wizards, they are concerned with singled out traits not surpassing their ceiling. And since we consist of only one real combat trait and share the same per-trait ceiling, there is no way at all to keep up overall.<P>Gordon, on behalf of Verant, I would love one answer about all this though:<P>At what point since Beta did you honestly realize "Wizards are going to hate us when they get wind of what is in store due to our overall strategic needs"?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004822&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004822&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
