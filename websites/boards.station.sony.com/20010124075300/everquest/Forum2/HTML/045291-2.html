</FONT><HR>Convergence is the only spell it'll ever be used for.. gaining experience back is the only effect worthwhile of causing experience loss.  I am personally of the opinion that we should never have gotten this spell and should have gotten something else malignant in it's place, but it's in and what's done is done.  The other two spells are worse than useless however, they are an insult.  I'm just saying to please, please, don't add any more in the line unless the effect is crazy powerful and you know that's not going to happen.  They will never get used and will annoy people in pretty much the same way the crappy epic weapon did.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's my idea, but it doesn't apply to just necros, it applies to classes that aren't considered useful during the actual fight.<P>The idea is to add class defining raid spells that require an expensive component. Not too expensive, but expensive enough to make it prohibitive outside of a major raid.<P>I play an enchanter, my girlfriend plays a cleric. I know that these two classes are essential for raids, even if the enchanter cannot do anything but buff/mana sieve. My point is that I don't have class envy, I'm happy with our raid abilities for the most part. Who I feel for are:<P>Paladins: They suck so bad, it's really painful to know that they get an experience penalty. They are so bad that even the Afterlife will not recruit them, the only class btw. I've seen a level 60 paladin with epic weapon get absolutely owned by a warrior without his. The warrior won with 60% of his life left, while the paladin went through his LoH and several sup heals. This gives you an idea of how poor paladins are when it comes to tanking relative to others. My suggestion is some type of group protection spell that reduces all damage inflicted on its members using an expensive component. Aura of Protection.<P>SKs -- Same story here as paladins for the most part, except are slightly better. I would suggest a group melee damage amplification spell using an expensive component. Aura of Destruction.<P>Necros -- A group magical damage amplification spell using an expensive component (nukes, possibly even heals are x% more effective) Aura of Magic.<P>Other ideas would be mana reduction aura, accuracy, etc. Making them short duration, and high component costs would reduce them to raids only. High recast delays (10 minutes) would prevent this spell from being cast in more than one group.<P>I can see the raid leader shouting for all to cast their respective raid buffs, followed by charge!!! I would suggest giving the best raid buffs to the weakest classes and perhaps giving them to other classes that have no or low raid use. Paladins, SKs, and Necros definitately. Rangers (they can dish it, they just can't take it), Magicians possibly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I am not a Necro, but from what I have read Varent seems to think they should be manna batteries, sound familiar Bards (sorry forgot they all quit).

</FONT><HR>Magic immunity seems to be the problem with lifetaps on boss mobs. How about a resistable/partially resistable lifetap spell at level 55 or 56 that has the same damage, casting time and mana as Deflux but is disease based. This will not impact PvP since players can't resist Deflux and it won't affect normal play since normal mobs don't resist Deflux and it will be used instead. I'd give up Enstill, Infusion, Trucidation and Immobilize for that spell.<P>I don't see why the mana transfer rates can't be increased. One cast of Regrowth and I can return more mana that it took to cast it. It's only the necro and cleric who can't get good conversion rates. Is there any way to check the target and vary the conversion rates then? Wizard gets a 1 to 1 but cleric gets 2.5 to 1? How about a larger transfer spell so we are not casting the thing over and over again to transfer 150 mana. Maybe a spell that costs 1200 mana and gives 450.<P>How about giving the pets the resistance of the caster when he casts a pet? This would still allow the pet to have decent resists and get a few rounds in before being killed. (Fear can't be used on you or your pet on the PvP servers anyway). If it's a duel you can still root a pet and that usually works better than fearing anyway. I like the un-fearable pet idea. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I wont go anywhere without him anymore. I know what his heals can do. Infact I dont think he used any of his spells from his level 39 circle. Celestial Elixr and Celestial Healing are his staple spells and they do NOT take 7 seconds to cast. They are awesome spells and Im glad that Clerics finally got some fast acting heals.

</FONT><HR>Give us a level 59 or 60 spell that does XXX amount of damage. Have it need a star ruby to cast, and only effective agaist level 57+ mobs. Put a 10 sec recast on it.<P>But seriously Absor, i think the reason none of the lifetaps can be changed is cause it cant be coded. Lifetaps are currently coded for all or nothing, the engine could not handle a partial resist without fully healing the caster. Kinda like when you cast a bond on a moss snake and heal for 800 pts even though the moss snake has 10 hps.<P>So make the spell thats a disease DD (i dont know anyone with one now) something unigue for the necromancer class since summon corpse isnt unique anymore....<P><BR>OH and i gotta laugh at your change on test with root and snare stacking, you just made the 34-53 necro 10x more soloable great fix i can solo things you haven't dreamed of now, i think you made more problems that you can ever dream of.<P>I cant wait to see these druids soloing without the dot penalty for a moving mob now, they will root, then snare dot.... let it die if it breaks root no sweat its snared your sow'd re-root it and repeat....<P>But a 60 necro is a joke still....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While this suggestion does add an entirely new line of spells, which you said you wanted to avoid, I think that it is highly in character w/ the necromancer, and would not add to the power of the necromancer in non-raid settings (as the cost would be too high for most players).  Each spell would last 3 minutes, would have to accepted by the target, and would kill the target when the effect wore off.  A character who died while this spell was in effect (or died as a result of this spell wearing off) could not reggain experience by being ressed.  This line of spells would not stack with each other.  These spells would be group only (and thus could not be used on pets).<P>Curse of the Zombie: +600 hp, +30 AC, Deadeye, +30 magic, disease and poison resist<BR>level 51, 300 mana <P>Curse of the Vampyre: +200 hp, +10 AC, Deadeye, +30 disease and poison resistance, 50% haste, target procs Drain Spirit (216 hp life tap)<BR>level 54, 400 mana<P>Curse of the Liche: Deadeye, +30 disease and poison resistance, +100 mana/tick<BR>level 57, 500 mana<P>Curse of the Demon: +1500 hp, +75 AC, Deadeye, +30 all resists, target procs Lure of Flame<BR>level 60, 600 mana<P>Yes, these are intentionally grossly superior to any other buffs in the game.

</FONT><HR>First, Absor, thanks for starting this thread. from your message, it looks like you've pretty much grasped what we are looking for.  Here are my thoughts on the matters you want addressed.<P>Re: Pets and Fear:<P>Is it possible to create a spell, like a pet buff, that is a fear resistance booster? If fear is simply magic based, then this might not be possible, but if it is made a short duration, high mana cost long LONG recast time (as long as harmshield or longer) PET ONLY Magic Resist buff, available at level 50+, wouldn't this be do-able? Then it would really be raid-specific only. No one would want to use this for regular hunting, or for regular PVPing on Rallos/Tallon/Vallon. This could also go to Mages, and maybe even Enchanters or Shamans. (I had come up with some wonderful necro-ish names for the spell, but they won't be good if it's a general spell.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> ) <P>Re: Ignite/Chill Bones and skelly effect:<P>I understand the reluctance to change them to a plain DDs, but PLEASE do somthing with them. Don't leave it as it is. I love Ignite Bones, and it pains me to not be able to use it except soloing or clearing greens and impressing newbies. <BR>Changing the color tints of the mob to red, brown or black when under effects of the spell was the obvious suggestion, and it's a shame that this would be technically difficult. I can't really come up with a better suggestion at this time, but here's a random thought:<BR>Would it be possible to keep a particle effect of fire around the mob for the full duration of the spell instead? It wouldn't be very obvious on somthing the size of Trakanon, but clear enough around most of the humanoid mobs.<P>Re: manatap and lich for raids on 100%MR mobs.<P>As was stated, our ability to be mana batteries on raids is hinged on our ability to lich our health into mana, meaning we need a source of health to tap up on.  The suggestion I have would effect ALL necros, but really only be of serious use on uber fights. <BR>Allow all taps or tap/DOTs to give full healing REGARDLESS of wether or not the tap was resisted by the mobs. In theory, this allows level 12s to tap up health on sand giants, but honestly, would you WANT to have a SG angry at you at that level? Necros already tap stuff far weaker then themselves for health, tapping stuff far tougher then themselves for health is done at their own peril. This would not allow any of the "6 level 20 necros killing a SG" that caused the lifetap nerf in the first place, as no damage is done to the mob. Just aggro and healing.  I don't see this as unbalancing.<P><BR>Thank you for your concern on our issues, I hope this can all be fixed!<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, A cleric is a healer from day one of his life. A necro is a damage dealer from day one of his life till level 50. Then his role is completely changed in Uber encounters. <P>Warriors, shadow knights, rangers, paladins,monks, rogues all have the same basic role from 1 to 60.<P>I didn't play a cleric because I don't like the role I would play. I played a necro well into the 50's to find out my role changes to something I don't like over 50.<P>I don't consider this fair or right. I did not see a box come up when I created my char that said " if you play this class you will be useless after 50 because you are so good under 50 ".  If it had I might not have wasted so many hours building a necro.<P>I don't want to be more powerfull in regular encounters or PvP.  I WANT to maintain the role I had from level 1 to level 50 in Uber and Epic encounters.<P>I have seen many wonderous changes in this game. Most I hated because they hurt the players in general in their ability to advance. But still ingenious in programming.<P>I am sure if Verant can give us useless spells that only work at night, they can program a spell that only works on uber and epic mobs. We could then do what you so grandly put as our new role in these encounters   MAKE mana and dump it into a class that can use it.<P>Very tired and soon to be gone 54 necro </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*** Moved from Death of Necros Part 3 ***<P>Ok, time to rack my own brain since i'm a necro lover and play one myself.<P>1. Sac & Res. Has anyone attempted to use this effectively? Cleric is out of mana, tank is dying and the mob still has enough hp's to finish a few tanks off before going down? My idea with this is that a wise warrior could chose to ask for a sac & res from a necro, where in he is sacrificed in the last 10 seconds or so of his life, and then the necro immediatly res's the tank back to life, and pacts him to regain some hp's (or even uses the mana gaining spell, then gives the mana to a cleric to do the res'ing/healing). The tank can then proceed to assist in finishing off the mob. Draw backs are timing on the sac, and loss of XP from a sac death. I'm curious weather or not the necro res would work on the sac target, or if it could instead be used on another already dead tank along with a pact to get him back into the fight to finish off the mob. Has anyone ever tried this strategy, and what are the thoughts on it? Is it simply better to wait until the cleric has mana again and give the tank an xp res after the battle, or would the immediate return of the tank be much more useful? How about tweakings along this line to make it a viable strategy. Masters of the undead would be very thankful if they were indeed, masters of the undead.<P>2. Necro Mana Battery. I agree with everyone here that as a caster class, people should be giving us mana to use our spells, not the other way around. I beleive that non-pure casters should be used as mana batteries, for instance all the other classes that complain they are also not very useful on raids could be given this job. The bards with their mana song are said to be mana batteries after lvl 32. How about a Druid be given the ability to "Draw mana from the environment" and pass that mana onto the "Mighty Casters". From a roleplaying, and class concept perspective, I beleive this would fit in a lot better with what people envision themselves to be as a class. On the other hand, as a mana battery, I would ask that instead of a 1:1 hp to mana ratio, we instead go back to our 32:20 ratio, and be given a 1:1 ratio on giving mana. Remember, that 32:20 ratio is only every 6 seconds, in other words, once i've given my 2500mp to another person, or persons, i'm done, and out. I have to sit and meditate for the 10 minutes or whatever to get all my mana back before I can do this again. Granted I get all my mana back faster than any other class, but I beleive the balancing issue should be "At what cost to my hp's do I gain this fast mp regen", not at what cost to the amount of mana I can give out. Given your ratios Absor, lets consider this. 2hp's per 1mp healing correct? So lets take away 2+ hp's for every 1 I gain, and make the mana transfer as simple as casting time. Remember also that natural regen plays a factor in that 1:1 ratio of hp to mp. Since i'm gaining hp's as I meditate. Every tick I actually only lose maybe 16hp and gain 24mp aprox. <P>3. As master of the undead, I command thee Spectre to not ruin our raid. Several issues here, one is pathing, another is aggroing. An undead pet in role playing terms is this. I have, with my minds power, summoned from the depths of hell, an undead being. With my minds power I give it life, and control it. Without my minds power it would falter and be destroyed. What I am saying here is this. Who here has some programming skills? We all know what a linked list is right? When the pet is given the command to follow, every render, push the casters current position onto the linked list. The pet should then go directly to a point between its position A, and the position just pushed onto the list B. This could be say 10 world units distance from point B along ray AB. Each time the pet reaches 10 world units from point B, B is then popped from the linked list and the pet is then given a new point B to go to, which would be the next point on the linked list that was pushed there by a previous render. Basically the concept is, every location B, pushed on the list, is a bread crumb that the pet follows. The caster is "in code" leaving a trail for the pet to follow. An implementation of some kind, with appropriate tweaking for memory requirements and error handling (object between point A and B stop the pet from advancing to B, Caster moving far faster than the pet, etc.) could very well be the solution to pathing for both mobs and pets alike. Now the aggro issue. Back to where I said that my pet is the pure focus of my minds power into summoning and controling an undead being. Who's in control here Verant, the summoner, or your code? When I assign a target to my pet, I expect my pet to attack that target until the bitter end no matter what else attacks it. If I tell my pet to run away, I expect my pet to run back to me, and completly ignore its attacker. If I tell my pet to attack an added mob that has aggroed on me, I expect it to take a time out from what it was beating on and help me out. This is how it should be from a concept of pet and a roleplaying perspective. The Verant vision currently leaves my pet only effective for single target solo'ing and can easily cost me my life and my pets life. As to this making pets a lot more powerful, e.g. no risk of a caster not having a tank to get things off of them, yer damn right it does, and thats the way it should be, not just for necro's, but for any pet summoning class. If pets can't do nearly as much damage as the PC tanks, then lets atleast make them as effective at doing what their master commands, saving their masters life, and not getting their master killed with bad agroing.<P>Those are the things I am most concerned about, and I hope you will find some merit in the ideas, and solutions.<P>Quitis Faer-Quarth,<BR>The Shadow Mage, Servant of Darkness, Maker of Chaos, Mad Wizard of Anarchy<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor,<P>First off, I would liek to thank you for taking the time to address this issue in the detail that you have. IMHO I feel that you are more attentive to the player base than Abashi was. <P>I currently play a level 52 Human Necromancer, and I can relate to the problems listed here. Just tonight I felt that I wasnt contributing enough to a raid. All I was able to do was DMF and mana transfer for most of the raid. I mean, I feel that I wasnt contributing as much to the grp as the Cleric and Enchanter were. I feel necros should be more of a benifit on raids.<P>I love the idea of group Feign Death. I know this sounds overpowered, but perhaps you could make it use some expensive component and exhaust a large amount of mana, as well as a very long recast time. Heck, you could even put in an intricate quest to get the spell. <P>Another suggestion I have is to lower the level for the sacrifce spell, rather lower the level of the victim of the spell, instead of having the minimum level of (is it 46?) perhaps make it 25 or 30? <P>Lastly, I would like to suggest removing this 100% resistability of our lifetap in certain mobs. This is a real pain for necromancers, as it makes our staple spell useless.<P>I hope you consider some of what I have here, and I thank you for your time.<P>Keep up the good work!<P>Antonn Marik<P>lvl 52 Necromancer <P>XEV<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I had a couple of ideas.. Not a Unresistable DoT, but a DoT like Lures, with a high sucess rate..<BR>   <BR>  Or a Series of debuffs that lower all the Mob's stats (Str, Dex, AGi, Stam, Wis, Int, Cha, and possibly Atk and AC)... Call it.. Atrophy or something...  If you made it pretty powerful at higher levels, the lowered AC and Atk might not make a huge difference on raids, but it's still good idea... <BR>  <BR>  Maybe a DoT that lasts until the mob dies, that removes mana instead of HP from the Mob... (I hope the game actually keeps  track of Mobs mana..).    This would be helpful on Epic Encounters, I thin..

</FONT><HR>This is my post on the old necro thread but it got closed.  so i'll repost.  Please read absor.<P>Okay, here's a good idea that will "fix" necros during raid time, but not give them any more power or be unbalancing.<P>First off I want to say that I agree with Absor on most suggested necro enchancements. Unlimited stacking dots, unresistable lifetaps, and so on are unbalancing, and increase our power not only during raid time, but during every other time as well. Necros are just fine during normal grouping conditions, and so dont need any enchancements.<P>However, we are less than useful during the actual boss encounter. A few mobs, we can land the occasional DoT, lifetap, and so on, but on the majority of mobs we are limited to dumping mana.<P>Mana pumping is just fine, in my opinion, but it is horribly inefficient. I can pump about 500-600 mana from FOM to OOM. That's using around 2k of my own mana. This translates into about one complete heal plus change. Liching, I can give 100 mana per minute. So during the 3 minute fight, I'll have given 800 mana total: two complete heals. Why bring a necro when you can bring anoher cleric, or another tank (a "complete heal")?<P>My solution is the following: make mana transfer efficient *only during raids*. How is this possible? Add a spell that transfers ALL of the necros mana to another class. Recast time on the spell: 30 minutes (or 1 hour, or whatever). The recast time makes this spell useless under normal conditions, as it will only add "free mana" (Absor's example of liching necro + cleric, ie infinite mana) once every hour,and it will take up a spell slot. It will only be memorized during the raid.<P>This spell benefits necros in that it lets a necro effectively become any casting class during a raid. A necro can make a cleric have twice the mana, or a wizard twice the mana, etc. It will still, however, be better to have the actual extra cleric there. Yes, a necro and cleric could have exactly the same mana as two clerics. However, two clerics can heal twice as fast. Two wizards can do damage twice as fast as a necro and a wizard. A wizard with a necro pumping him might get himself aggroed because he did too much individual damage, which wouldn't happen to two wizards. Basically, this new spell makes necromancers desirable on raids, and yet still lets other classes be more desireable.<P>You may be thinking that with lich on, we could start medding and pump even more mana after we "complete mana dumped". This is true, although I've found that I can only pump 100 mana per minute. This is almost trivial... During the course of a fight, I MIGHT get enough mana to the cleric for another complete heal. However, if you think this is "too good" with the necros new complete mana dump, make the new spell have this effect: decrease necros HP by 70%. Since HP = mana for a necro, this will effectively stop the necro from liching / pumping any more after he complete mana dumped.<P>Whew, I'm done  I personally think this is a decent suggestion, which is completely realistic. I'd like to hear your comments about it, as well as Alans. <P>Thank you, <BR>Wyvil<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Want suggestion on the pet fear thing Absor? Here goes...Why not include some new pet buffs that do different things? As it stands now, the augmentation line of spells are the ONLY real buffs we get for pets. How about spell buffs that do things like give pet immunity to fear, regen, etc. This kinda stuff would at least allow us as "pet casters" to be involved it boss mob fights. Long casting times etc might would certainly make these spells undesirable for PVP, something you mentioned as a concern.

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>With all due respect, I think this type of thread is genuinely counter-productive to what you/we are trying to encourage people to get out of the game.<P>EverQuest is designed on a class system.  Where you pick a class that has certain abilities, limitations, bonuses, downfalls, and usefullness dependening upon the situation.  This is how all class-based games work, which was first made popular in the mainstream consumer market with games such as Dungeons and Dragons (Notice: I said popular).<P>What this means is, you pick a class that suits your playstyle and needs.  You DON'T pick a playstyle that suits your class.  It's impossible in a class-based system, and any attempt to change it basically defeats the entire purpose of making it a class-based system.  We aren't playing a game like UO, where you DO mold your character into what you want to play.<P>It has long been stated that Necromancers lack in later levels what they have as extremely generous benefits all through their younger levels to mid high levels.  Heck, to make a Necromancer more group/raid oriented would be to completely deny the class it's born heritage of being a loner.  Necromancers can chain summon pets, give mana, heal, grant resists to deadly elements, and this is just the things they can do during a battle.<P>I don't see anyone asking for Magicians to get a mid-battle upgrade.  Versus mobs that are highly resistant (ya know, the same ones that Necromancers are having trouble with and feel they are useless because of it), all a magician is good for is modulation rods, and chain summoning pets.  Oh yeah, they can also summon tons of bandages and bind wounds during a battle.<P>Nor do I see anyone begging for Enchanters to get a mid-battle upgrade.  What can they do versus a highly magical resistant mob?  Why, chain cast Rune 5 on the tanks, and use that uber-taunting mana drain on mobs, which is also resisted easily.  Oh yeah, they do have a pet that is completely uncontrollable with less than 1000 hit points which can be chain cast during a fight, only to get killed 4 hits later.<P>I'm sorry, but if those people out there who are playing a Necromancer, but want to play a Wizard, Cleric, Shaman, or tank, then they should by all means play those classes.  There's no such thing as a Necromancer-Wizard, or a Necromancer-Cleric, or a Necromancer-Shaman, or a Necromancer-Warrior in EverQuest.  Giving people the idea that they can post here in hopes that one day they CAN play a class like that is only digging a grave (no pun intended) for yourself and EverQuest.<P>Masthis Splinthis<BR>50th Iksar Monk<BR>The Claw of Nagafen - Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Masthis, how about we make it so you can understand, ok?<P>Let's say, from 54th to 60th lvl, monks are only useful for FD pulling, and not for fighting. See, VI is going to alter mobs so monks will not be able to harm many high lvl mobs, with any attacks, their job will be to pull them with FD, and then run in an eat the death touch when it is up. Sound fun?<P>Or, how about mobs that totally resist all melee attacks, so tanks can come and work their bind wound skills.<P>Or, how bout we make it so there is only one place for a solo person to hunt from 54th lvl on, and on raids, they sit there and feed their mana to others. Course, in the rest of the game, they are damage dealers, but on riads, forget it. Oh, wait, that is the case for necros.<P>See, enchanters are a support class, look at the spell list, how many offensive spells do they get, as compaired to crowd control and buffing and de-buffing spells. The same is true for shaman and clerics. You look at the spell lists, and you get a idea of the class's focus. If you pick a cleric, and think you are going to be doing damage in a group, instead of healing and buffing, forget it.<P>The same is true for necros and wizards. Wizards got upset that they were reduced to taxis, when many upper lvl mobs would resist most of their spells. So, they got lures.<P>Now, necros are in the same boat, nothing to add, offensivly on raids, and reduced to support. Go look at the necro spell list, how many support spells do necros get  that they can use on a high lvl raid?<P>DMF<BR>Mana Transfer<BR>Summon Corpse<P>THAT'S IT! Basicly 99.9% of necro spells are useless on raids, since people will not alow DoTs to be cast, taps will not land, pet pathing is a joke, and the necro DD gives tanks fits.<P>So, tell me, do you think it is fair to basicly kill a class at 54th lvl? Soloing is DEAD, and the class is reduced to 3 spells, fun.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>So I thought I might add a couple cents to the deal here.<P>Idea #1 - go through and review/revise all of the pet AI/commands - add new commands such as the following:<BR>  /pet leash [short/long/off] when the leash is turned on, a maximum distance will be allowed for the pet - not sure on the numbers, but perhaps short being about 50 meters, enough distance for a normal encounter, or long, with about 100+ meters, to be enough for a larger encounter, or outdoor encounter. If the pet reaches the limit, it will immediately disregard all other commands and return to the caster's side, unless engaged in combat.<BR>  /pet whistle - a recall command that can be used at any range, (after all whistling carries...) and would cause the pet to return to the caster's side, *regardless* of engagements. It would also have the following effects - a timer would start, and if the pet takes longer than say, a minute, to return to the caster, it would immediately suicide. If a "leash" is on, and the pet, in the course of returning to the caster, is caused to exit the range, another timer of 10 seconds will start, and if the pet fails to come back within the radius, it will also suicide. (sorta like that reeely old nintendo game, formula one - you know the indy car racing game...)<BR> Thus, the pets become more controllable, without really improving the power of the pets significantly. the leash idea can be applied to all pets, not just commandable ones.<P>Another idea that I toyed with before is thus: create a series of spells that are identical in many ways to the 50+ necro(and magician, etc?) pets. Only the difference will be that they are targeted. The pet will be summoned, not out of the caster's location, but out of that of the target(A spirit of death seeks vengance on Trakanon, or an elemental destroyer...etc). these pets would have movement rates a bit slower than if they were snared. Upon summoning, the pet would immediately attack the target upon which it was summoned - persistently - the pets, like the wizard and cleric animations, would not be in any way commandable, and would follow their target doggedly until slain. Additionally, upon the death of their target, they would immediately suicide. The reason for the slow movement rate is such that the pets could not be used to fear kite, or be used effectively in pvp. These spells are geared toward simply substituting a pet suitable for raids for the current ones that cause problems. A slight mana reduction might also be in order, either that or a component removal (not sure if that hasn't already been done - I don't play any high level pet users).<P>Lastly, but not leastly - a neat idea for a necro spell: a spell that takes maybe 100 mana and lasts for about 30 secs or maybe 250 mana for a minute..., and is nothing more than an icon - for what you ask? a superior spell in the fear line. except castable on players, and with no effect other than that for 30 seconds, the target will be made immune to fear spells, as none can overwrite the buff. This could even be made into a series that last slightly longer, or, if coding supports it, an AE spell that affects players, and would cast a similar effect on 4-5 targets. call it deathly fixation or mind of the zombie or something like that. You might even have the spell do a little dot to the player, like removing their natural regen or lower intelligence during the short period - but nothing big. Also, the spell cannot be renewed until it has dropped.<P>All of the ideas above, I think could fit the bill for a fix that doesn't significantly increase power in any situation outside of special encounters, whether it be solo, group or pvp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So I'd go the whole raid lifetapping away at FGs and such, and my lifetap would never land on the main boss.

</FONT><HR>Ok here is my 2cp worth on some points.<P>Why can't ignite/chill bones be a straight DD?  It's not like I'm gonna be out nuking a wizzy or mage.  Just drop the illusion component, it serves no purpose except to annoy us and other raiders.<P>It seems a concern is that any spell changes would make us more useful in raids but also make us somehow more powerful outside a raid.  A simple solution I suggested in another post is to make plane-only spells.  Dead Man Floating doesn't work in all zones (Kedge, Hole, etc) so use a reverse concept.  Make say a mana feed spell that gives 250 mana for 400 cost but is usable ONLY in the planes (fear, hate, sky, growth, & mischief).  This way our power is unaffected in the regular world but enhanced in the planes where it's more useful.  The suggested Group Feign Death could also be Planar-only.<P>Now as for dots in raids.  Problem is that you can say it's fixed but no raid leaders will risk losing a potential very rare drop.  In 14 fear raids I have yet to see any blighted drop.  Now if I dotted a boogeyman and it happened to poof, imagine the flak I would get!  At best I would merely be asked to leave the raid, at worst I could be blacklisted.<P>Now as to pets and fear.  If I dueled and tried to cast Spook, Panic or Dread of Night on a wizzy pet it would have no effect as they are not undead.  The reverse should be true of necro pets.  Now if you want to give mobs the ability to cast undead fear well that's fine.  Considering that mages get better pets and variety, it would be nice to allow a simple thing as, say, 49+ pets are immune to fear.<P>Defoliation is useless as it stands.  Why we were given a plant-only DD in the first place is beyond me.  Since it's there make specific mobs in Plane of Growth be considered plants at least.  I have yet to ever use this spell as treants are rather low level compared to when we get it.<P>Out epic effect sucks.  Sorry but it does.  Anyone who knows how to play a necro uses Dooming Darkness exclusively once they get it.  Cascading is too slow to cast and too much mana when all we use it for is snaring.  In a group I only use dark if there is no ranger, druid or wizzy in the group as their snares are more effective and/or mana efficient.<P>That's my suggestions for now based on my experience playing a necro to 55.  When I think of more or see another post will throw in my 2cp as needed.  =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a variation on the pet possession idea. Why not give high level Necromancers a pet spell that is controllable, and the pet receives the caster's resists, AC, and HP, and level of the caster. (if that's not possible, just give it something that can make it reasonably resistant to dying/being feared away, and a good level so it will not be the first target thing targeted by the MOB.) not only that, the pet will also have a small lifetap proc that is unresistable. While you have the pet up, the necromancer loses life and mana slowly, per tick, just like lich (kind of). The caster of the pet can not cast any of his regular spells, but can hari kari the pet by clicking an icon to remove the effect so he may go back in regular mode. This would be so inefficient in regular group situations that it shouldn't be used, but would at least give us some kind of damage in raid situations.<P>I'd rather have the lifetap line be changed so the resist is somewhere between lure and what it is now, so we at least have some kind of chance at hitting a MOB with it, but the pet idea is the only other thing I could think of.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Keep in mind that I understand that many of you are not happy with a support role on raids. I'm fairly convinced that it is perfectly fine for a necromancer to act in that role during the final battle of the raid. But I'm open to ideas (barring the ones that I've already vetoed) that would make them more aggressive at that one final battle." <P>Alan"<BR> <BR>Necromancers wouldn't be complaining if they actually had some sort of 'support' role.  The point Necros are bringing up is why would a raid want a necro dumping their mana into cleric at a TERRIBLE transfer rate when it would just be more practical to bring along another cleric instead of that necro.    <P>Ok, lifetaps are not going to be unresistable. I think the necro community as a whole can live with that.  However they should be saving against uber mobs at a reasonable ratio for an adaquate level necro.<P>2 THINGS ABOUT LIFETAPS THAT WOULD HELP<P>1) There is a HARD CAP on lifetaps.  A Necero CANNOT cast on a Mob 6 levels above him regardless of resists.  It will be resisted 100% of the time.  This makes a HUGE difference when you get into Mobs that are higher level than a Necro ever can be.  This means a 58 Necro cannot hit a lev 65 Mob that has Tash, Malo, or any other resist debuff in it PERIOD.<P>This level limit makes sense at lower levels.  It is completely absurd at high levels when there is a much bigger level range of who can participate in an epic battle.  It also means that Necros can NEVER cast LIfetaps on a Mob that is over level 65. <P>2) Reevalute the resists on some of these uber mobs and what can or cant be resisted by them, as well as taking a look at how the lifetaps are resisted in the first place by these Mobs.  As it is now, Necro Lifetaps are either resisted 100% of the time or not at all.<P>LIST OF OTHER THINGS TO HELP THE NECRO:<BR>1) A lev 55 upgrade to Shock of Poison.  At least that way Necros can add some damage and have a spell that can be partially resisted.<BR>2) Better mana dump ratios. (Once again Absoor forgets to add in the time factor of dumping mana)  ANY class that has mana can make mana out of nothing.  Sit on the ground and med... Look at that the mana bar goes up! Mana out of nothing WOW!  The problem is it takes too much time.  Necros only cut down this time by a fraction for themseleves and hand back mana to a cleric at terrible ratios.  Even if Necros DID convert mana at a ratio of 1:1 it still would not make them more efficient than just inviting an extra cleric on the raid instead of that necro.  This is mostly because of the time duration of these fights as I mentioned previously.  It takes  TIME to dump mana not to mention drain HP into Mana.<BR>3) Keep BOTH IB and CB as is and ADD two new spells that are teh SAME level SAME mana cost SAME DD with no illusion that cannot be stacked with its like counterpart.  In doing this you will keep everyone happy.  those that like the skell illusion can still use it while soloing.  In large raids you can use the nonillusion version of the spell and do the EXACT same thing and not have guild mates pissed that they cant find a darkbone skellie Mob in a sea of necro pets.<BR>4) This is more of an afterthought than anything... Resistance Buffs for pets.  <P>END NOTE:  Summon Corpse is a great ability.  You do not have to be part of the raid to to it though.  Clerics are not wanted on a raid solely for their Rez ability.  They can do other things as well.  Buff and Heal, not to mention to some extend even DD.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><P>Absor Posted<BR>&gt;&gt;What things could be done to give necromancers more to do in that one encounter, without improving their power in other situations?<P><BR>   Well, is it possible to create a spell that is "reverse level resisted."  E.G.  A spell that is resisted *less* the higher a mob's level?  Perhaps, you'd have a base resist of 90% on a level 55 mob, 80% on a level 56 mob, 70% on a level 57 mob, etc.  <P>   This would certainly have very little effect on any encounters except the ones of which you speak, Absor, be this a decent direct damage spell, or even a dot or lifetap line.  With the spell being fully resisted by anything lower than the level verant can choose themselves, there would be absolutely no power gains for a necromancer except in this one specifically targetted area. <P>  I have no idea of the viability of the code, but if you truly break it down, this is the answer you were looking for when you asked the question, my friend.<P>   I would gladly give up any of my kunark spells to fill a slot with "Azrael's Instant Karma."

</FONT><HR>Some quick suggestions-<P>1. Dead man floating- Great spell, simply make a group buff similar to it. Possibly if you wanted to maybe improve it a little? I dunno maybe Ultravision on it? I definitly would like to see a group version, improving it would just make it that much more sweeter. <P>2. Reclaim energy- Im not suggesting make a spell that gives us everything back for casting a pet. However think it's at all possible to improve on it? Im not sure ill just take an example, if the current spell gives us 30% mana back when we use it to kill a pet, maybe give us an upgraded one that kills our pet and returns 60-70% mana? At level 40+ I dunno something be nice. <P>3. Make it somewhat easyer to get bone chips? I dunno, I was thinking throw in some more mobs that drop them? Or maybe give another class the ability to summon us some? I dunno at times I think it's almost silly, level 50-60 Necromancers ripping through newbie undead mobs for the bones that drop off the level 1-10 mobs? I think it would be a good idea to maybe give magicians the ability to summon us some, that disappear when we log of course? Maybe Necromancers could use magicians again ever since you took out Rune swords usefulness I haven't needed a Mage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>4. Change the skeleton form on Ignite bones to something like we could take off the affect and change it a little? Ignite bones doing 400 damage, and 300 over time as the bones burn? Cause I was thinking, you have DD damage on some DoTs like Ebolt? However the DD is NOTHING compaired to what the DoT damage is right? Well maybe make us a DD that does some DoT damage but nothing near the DD damage of the spell. If you liked this idea, you would have to be super careful you didn't do something bad so people decide it's not worth it and just use deflux or a Drain. I dunno just thinkin<P>5. This is a LONG shot- I heard Brad say something about how he was thinking about possibly lessening the travel time to some places without making it so easy it got so crowded? <BR>How about give Necromancers the ability to solo or group gate to something like Field of bones? Now hear me out, what better place then "Field of Bones" a zone with death everywhere it is the perfect setting for your average necromancer. Now, this would be a high level gate no doubt but look at any advantiges it would have? There aren't many dungeons a high level Necromancer could get easy access to, it brings you to a Newbie zone with many newbie zones all around, and it would give Iskar maybe an easyer chance to get home? (All other classes have gates to there home real close except Iskar) Now I relize Necromancer is NOT something you want becoming a total gater class like a druid or Wizard, but it wouldn't make us stronger, it wouldn't over crowd any zone I can think of, and it would just be a help to people while still staying completely in bounds of RP. I dunno, consider it but give it serious thought (If you even read this heh). <P>6. Defoliation- Possibly change it from plants to more nature oriented? Maybe change it to include some anaimals? From what I've heard other people talk about RP, isn't a Defiler or Necromancer supposed to royally screw up for example a druids grove? Or something nature of that affect? Well why do we do the same damage to nature now as we could to most any other part of Norrath? <P>7. I'de like to see Boogeyman added a little in the Plane of Fear. I've yet to see someone argue with me in my Plane group, on Rallos Zek that Necromancer armor is the rarest Plane piece. Now if you think about it, some other classes may be almost as rare but not many play that class anyhow. For example, we often times don't get much Paladin gear but guess what we are lucky to have a Paladin come along on our raides, if we have two then it's something to see. However look at something like Wizard loot, I've seen multiple times 2 Wizard Robes drop in one run and I've heard of 3 Wizard robes dropping in one run. You can say loot is all random but your wrong, in the end certain classes just get mad more loot then others and I think it's unfair for Necromancers because we have a good deal of Necro's to supply yet we are given like there are only 1-2 Necro's to a plane group. <P>8. Pet Jboots- Ever thought of adding a speed spell for Necro pet's? Or maybe make it for any pet? All it would be is something maybe like jboots, but a spell you cast it on your pet and he runs as fast as Jboots? Or SOW maybe? I don't see it overpowering much, just be another spell to keep closer to the front of your spell book. <P>9. Litterly a drain soul- Just thinkin, but would it be possible to make Necromancers a spell.... They could cast it on other players possibly there level? ..... What would happen is it would sit like a buff until the player dies then that players mana or maybe only a certain amount (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%?? Maybe all of it? No idea) could be transfered to the Necromancer. I think that would fit in perfectly with the role of the Necromancer. <P><BR>I can't think of anymore, it's getting late and Im sure some of those idea's can't be used but I was just spitting out idea's in maybe in the chance one can stick and be used possibly. <P>                         Laroux<BR>                        55 Defiler<BR>                        Rallos Zek <P>P.S. I find it very wrong that you say you know how we all feel about the Necro epic but you don't want to talk about it. If you know we all dislike it, I think it should be your number one priority for the Necro's to improve such a god like, uber like, hard item. It's one of the harder Epic's to get, yet I'de pass on my epic to get my focus item from Inny in Hate at the current stats and effect. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In all honesty, everyone posting here asking for Necro upgrades is just turning this post into one of Class Envy.<P>One of the threads said, "How would you feel if all the sudden monks were made useless after level 54."<P>I think what you fail to see here is, Necromancers weren't all the sudden nerfed into being useless at level 54.  Also, I think you fail to see that most Necromancers are still soloing and reaching level 60 totally on their own.  Please don't tell me you can't solo anymore after 54th because I know this is simply not true.<P>Monsters already have the ability to be totally immune to melee attacks...ever hear of a sebilite juggernaut?  For the duration of the mobs 100% riposte, they cannot be hit by any form of melee.  Does anyone complain?  No, because there's ways around it.  Tank the mob until the riposte wears off, or just nuke it.<P>How about mobs like the Maestro of Rancor?  Yeah, let me see you put 30 tanks up against him and see how well they do.  (In case you don't know, he SINGS an AOE lifetap.)  The best way to kill him is to have no more than 12 tanks.  As you can see, this is an uber mob where "more tanks is not merrier".  And monks usually die very quickly to the Maestro unless they somehow get away and feign death + mend.<P>No, I would also not be upset if there were mobs introduced to the game that are never fooled by a feign death.  You might not know this, but there's this thing about games that really gets boring when you can use the same tactics over and over and over and over against everything and win every time.  Sorry, but you saying something like this is pointless because it would affect Necromancers and Shadowknights as well...and isn't the point of this whole thread to show where Necromancers are getting shafted completely on their own?<P>Remember, you're playing your CLASS.  You're not playing your PLAYSTYLE.  You want to play your PLAYSTYLE, pick a class that suits your PLAYSTYLE.  If you can't do that, then please quit because I don't like whiners in my game.  Necromancers are a dang good class, I just wish I had absolutely no self esteem with no concept of socialisms so that I would enjoy playing a game entirely on my own.<P>Masthis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=045291&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=045291&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
