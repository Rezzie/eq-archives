</FONT><HR>My main issue with the Warrior class, this is probably sounding redundant from all the other posts, is their Taunt capability.  There needs to be a way for higher level Warriors to pull mobs off the casters and damage dealers quickly.  <P>Here is my suggestion:<P>Create a new Warrior only 'Greater Taunt' or 'Superior Taunt' in the abilities list.  Warriors could use this as well as standard 'Taunt' to keep the mob fixated on them(for the most part).  Certainly there is a way of accomplishing this.  <P>Vinere / 50 RNG / Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I will be the first to admit that my experence in this game is limited. (I have a 31 DE warrior)but the one thing I have learned is that for a warrior baised on Dex & Agi insted of Str & Sta that bezerker rage is death for my kind. Bezerker reduces my primary stats for two stats that are useless at that time. I would ask that bezerker be changed so that we can choose weather we want to use it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How 'bout adding the Berserker skill with an AoE & INCREASED pull for Taunt built into the "Bersker" skill. Mobs would surely be more apt to agro to a PC that is going wild and try to subdue that PC over attacking others.  Adding the "multi-mob" hits at normal damage (rather than increased damage) could be a possiblity for the proposed Berserker skill also.<P>I have enjoyed playing my Warrior (Alowicious Bladerunner of the Glade Knights, lvl 32) thoroughly!  I have found that it is more difficult to solo after 30, but with a good guild and great groups I am progressing as well as I did when I was of lower level.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Obsidian, I honestly do not see why any warrior would focus on dex/agi.  To begin, as a warrior, you should never have your primary focus as any stats.  Your primary equipment focus should be AC, followed by HP.  Next thing you should worry about is getting your AGI up to 100, and then your focus on your STA and/or STR.  Dex should just be a skill that comes naturally with your gear (granted, you may want to choose 3str and 2dex over 4str, depending on your equipment)<P>Verant has already announced the worth of each stat...for a warrior, I will paraphrase them for you:<P>STR: Weight Allowance, Damage Bonus per hit<BR>STA: Time able to hold breath, HP (at 53 I get roughly 5hp per point of STA)<BR>AGI: Chance to dodge/parry, AC.  3agi = 1ac for each point of agi under 100.  Past 100, you get 1ac for 9agi.<BR>DEX: Chances to raise melee skills, chances to proc.  Unless you are wielding proccing weapons, this stat could be at 2 and you wouldnt notice.  I notice zero difference between my skill at 98 and my skill at 198 (with boon of the gareau).<P>My stats, which seem to suit me quite well, are 1004ac 2400hp 233str 163sta 100agi 98dex.  If you put me toe-to-toe with a dark elf who focused on agi and dex, their stats may be something like this: 970ac 2200hp 120str 100sta 170agi 150dex...same level, same weapons...I would rip them apart.  If you put me in a group with the other tank, he would need more heals, deal less damage, and cause more downtime overall than I would.<P>Daabu Zugzugg<BR>53 Troll Warrior<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just got my epic this evening, and it's a lot of fun.  But soon after, I was browsing Caster's Realm and I saw that for the Baltimore Gathering the real life quest resulted in in-game awards.  Here's one of them:<P>Sword of the Gathering<BR>1hs<BR>Delay 22, dmg 14<BR>+7 str, +7 sta<BR>PRIMARY SECONDARY<BR>weight 0.1<P>I think it's a slap in the face to hand out something like this for an out-of-game event when it has a better dmg delay ratio then our epic one handers.  Ever since the epic stats were discovered, our primary concern has been the slow delay on our epic 1handers, and now they toss out better weapons at a Gathering.  Unbelievable.<P>At least we have great stats and a proc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Daabu:<P>You are quite incorrect on str. Str 200% above carrying capacity yields approx. a 2% overall damage increase. Str does not affect modal damage at all. You would win the fight not because of greater damge dealt but because you have more hps. Do a search by title on this site for "Lemme get this straight....stats don't matter?" I authored that post and had over 200 replies. Dex is only good for procs and whether it affects crits or not is questionable. One thing is for sure 100 dex is plenty. Agility should never be allowed to drop below 75 due to the huge AC hit ya take. As you pointed out 40 points in stam at lvl 53 is only 200 hps. Str does squat for damage. For warriors :<P>1) level<BR>2) AC<BR>2) hps<P>stats mean very little<P>Good day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That should have been written, half of the warriors arent uber twinked or don't have powergaming time so much that they could get their hands on the uber gear themselves.

</FONT><HR>Why should you nerf the invis on Cobalt Legs?<BR>Is is so overpowered i can now run thru a green con zone without getting aggroed?, or make my way thru Kael Drakkel without training half the zone.<BR>And if you nerf Cobalt Legs, don't forget Larrikans Mask, Invis potions and the Incardine BP, since they give us invis too.<P>Is it truly verants vision that we have to sit and wait for someone to invis us or port us. or even find a cleric to fight thru some zones?<P>And nerfing Defensive disc is plain dumb. if you going to nerf the dmg we do with it so much, then make us take less dmg than a 33% reduction from it. Ever realised that defense disc is a MUST on every uber mob in Velious, incase you havn't noticed you CANNOT kill those mobs without using it.<P><BR>Warriors get 0.1hp per level from 1 sta. L50 warrior gets 5hp per sta, L60 gets 6hp.<BR>IMO that faction should be increased to 0.2 or even 0.3 between 50 and 60. so that a L60 warrior would get 12-18hp per sta point. we kinda need this now when you managed to Nerf Donals BP, while there is mobs with 200k hp and quad melees for 700 with faster than a second delay.<P><BR>You[Verant] sees the error, and you remove them, but you totally ignore WHY that is an error.

</FONT><HR>Whoa, I saw the changes they're trying out on test.  Giving paladins and shadowknights the same defense skill as a warrior.<P>You realize after this a paladin/sk is going to have BETTER armor class than a warrior?  Full PoG gear for both, and throw in an appropriate level shield for the PAL/SHD, who have awesome 1-handers to use, and there you have it.<P>If the proposed changes go through, there will be NO reason to want a warrior from levels 1 - 54.  A shadowknight will be the same as us, except they do more damage after you add in spells, can prevent runners, feign pull, heal themselves, invis themselves, damage shield themselves, etc, etc.  Only our Defensive discipline at level 55 will make us worth anything at all.<P>This sucks.

</FONT><HR>Bottom Line is this. He and Verant made thier minds up about warriors before he started. If he'd have come in here with a open mind he wouldn't have read the first couple posts and stopped.<P>Warriors should never have had spells. However, they should have items available to them to get from point A to point B with out have to have some other player hold their hands. So if they are going to put invisibility on their Kunrak greeves, then tough. You missed the mark dont nerf us.<P>From your comments you said that we are a base class.  No magic is pretty base. Now you are making hybrids have equal defense(thus improving their ac). You've removed the exp penalty(never should have been there)and given them spell(new and upgrades). <P>So far all I've seen you do for warriors is make the disiplines that were already there work the way they were suppose to.  Big woop<P>We want:<P>1. New abilities between level 35 and 52(not discilpines)<P>   a. Battle(War)Cry - Not AE Fear like some say. that's garbage and this would kill the whole group. I like an AE stun though(this has a good taunt factor on it.  As long as it doesn't break a mez's. And will be another useless skill. This should be a single target stun. Should be a preprogramed hot key like instill doubt or backstab)<P>   b. Instill Doubt(?) I'm not convinced this is a good thing but it is a pure melee skill(monks and rogues). Following your agruement that we are a base class then it follows we should have it as warriors. <P>   c. And upgrade to taunt, either increase cap(which will be meaningless unless it's max'd at 250) or a new type of taunt.<P>2.  Not everyone play an ogre/troll/barbarian warrior. Give us more hps. Our hps do not keep up with post 50 mobs damage. And when you fight a level 60 mobs even buffed its not enough.<P>3.  Epic Quest is BS. The drops are too rare for the long spawn mobs we have to kill. Increase the drops rate of the FA items. There should be an FA quest item on these mobs each time we kill them. NO other class has to kill the mobs(most 55 plus) on each of the planes, 2 dragons(competing for one scale with every class). The mobs we have to kill are the most powerful in the game. To kill each one of our mobs we need to bring an army and sometimes clear all of hell and back to get to the mob. For that amount of risk the reward should be there.  Make the quest item drop more often. I've kill Innurok 4 times and have seen the ranger FA item drop twice.<P>The stats on the sword are ok. I don't want them faster cause you get into the speed damage nerf zone.(fast weapons damage is severaly capped)<P>4. Stun, kicks never seem to stun even low level mobs. Slam is a large race only skill. Make slam a warrior skill. All races all classes. Only good if your buffed(equipment and magic buffs) str is above 120.(Since your such a D&D fan make it's use based on strength). <P>5. From your post:<BR>===========<BR>(poster says)Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for. <P>(You respond)Ok, that's not such a bad idea. It has it's own drawbacks built right in. I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing). But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use. <BR>=============================<P>If a warrior attacks all mobs a once this will wipe ou the whole party. Why? Usually you have an enchanter/bard/necro. Trying to mez the mobs. I you hit this skill you will break all the mez's. I can understand you needing to kill a bucnh of greens in  a dungeons but this would mean certain death for the group.  why put in a useless skill(another). Go back to the drawing board on this or page up and make war(battle) cry and ae taunt. <P>6. Bind wounds. You recognized the most unreasonable request I saw posted. Increase the pre 50 cap such that we can BW at 200 at level 40(or 45)  but make it pre 50. We will still be stuck to a BW of only 50%. until level 40(45). I don't see how you can say we are power leveling. Remember hps? how many bandages do we require to  get to  half even at level 40? HOw many mobs can a warrior unbuffed solo at level 40 for experience?<P>7. Please don't Switch Level 56 and 59 skills. How bout do something novel and upgrade the level 59 skill?<P>8. Disarm: works. It is a function of dexterity. I have had boon and dexterity abuffed to a toatl dexterity past 255.(had to take off gear to get it below 255) And I can disarm any mob in the game. And even to off hands. I would prefer instead of dropping the weapon on the ground that the weapon fall into the mobs loot inventory. I think one night I disarmed the dracoliche(rogue knife was found on the ground.)<P>9. Beserker Frenzy need to have a longer duration after heal. But I don't like the button thing. It is not something that should be a turn on turn off thing. We go beserk cause we are enraged. Not something that we can turn on and off. If I get healed while beserk I should take a second to calm down.<P>We don't think warriors are a complete class. No class should be. But we need enhancements to enhance the fun of playing them. And make us better. <P>You have listened to all the other classes and buffed up all the hybrids. But warriors have ben left alone since you fixed them over a year ago.(Crit were nice, more hps are ok(not enough) and beserk good) But what you have done in the last year was make all hybrids more like warriors. <BR>+++++++++<BR>Having magic should be the trade off for warrior level skills. <P>Example: <P>Johnny Paladin/SK/Ranger stays after school to learn more about the ways the world works and joins the magic users club.<P>Bobby warrior/monk/rogue goes to the weight room and joins the wrestling team. Who should be a better at physical endeavors? Better defense, offense, weapons skills, hps, etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tildaor: If your gonna compare it with AD&D get the facts right. Warriors are not the highest dmg dealers in AD&D.. Casters are..<P>Slamz: If you gonna compare Paladins/Sk's with Warriors, dont view so one sided. With OWN buffs, Paladins should be able to get the same ac as a warrior. We get spells to counter your dmg output(not good enough yet tho) and should be the equal tank of a warrior. Not better, not worse.. Just different.<P>On the other side, a warrior have higher caps on all riposte,parry,dodge etc skills, and higher hps, so they will still be better dmg takers(which I think is wrong) even if they do up the sk/paladin defense.<P>Ppl tend to think that if paladins and shadowknights and rangers get upgrades, they will step on the warriors territory. And they are right to think so.. I would like someone to explain me why paladins and shadowknights should not be just as good a Tank(dmg taker) as warriors..<P>And before someone tells me; You get spells like healing,stun,etc.. blah blah.. thats why you do more damage.<P>Last thing.. Name ONE 1handed weapon for paladins that are not surpassed by plenty of easily attained warrior weapons, I doubt you can!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Due to the fact that Absor(Verant) thinks our class is allright and doesnt need improvment, id like to suggest every warrior feeling neglected to stop his work and start a Monk instead - cheaper faster better to solo etc. and also pure melee. I guess i gonna retire my warrior due to being underpowered (cant afford all those uberguild items & have no access to all that stuff), just started a monk and it rocks any level and is even more fun to play with all those destructive gadgets you get. I hope some others decide to do as well - maybe some will miss the warrior class but compared to the powers of hybrid classes and all the mega pets casters get i dont think that they ll miss our tanking caps. All in all Verants policy of neglecting Warriors will lead to the final destinction of that class - maybe not the next week or month, but wait till Shadow Bane(tm) is launched, i guess there are already tons of frustrated warriors out there hoping to restart within a new game that ,by chance, treats his tank classes better than Verant does.<P><BR>Mechanic<BR>Ex Champion on So Ro<P>PS: I dont think Absor will read this far anyway<BR>,if yes do something for your customers if you wanna keep them till 2002</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been reading a lot about suggested improvements and nerfs to the warrior class, as well as to the other melee classes, and thought i'd put in my two cents.<P>I don't play a warrior, my primary toon is a ranger, and while i like the idea of having offense upped to the current level of a warrior, i think if things progress as they are warriors will become next to useless in a very short while.<P>What is the main role of a warrior? It is to tank of course. Why can they tank? Because they have the highest HP and AC. However, with many of the things going on, we're going to be seeing shadowknights and paladins with near the same HP as warriors, the same defensive skills as warriors, same or better AC as warriors, plus they have spells they can throw into the mix.<P>Which would you rather have protecting you? A warrior with high HP, AC, Defenses, etc etc, or a paladin with the same HP, AC, Defenses, and the ability to root and heal? It's an obvious answer of course. While this may all seem fine and good to paladins and shadowknights, I think we'll see a drastic if not complete reduction in the number of warriors playing as well as their need in a group.<P>My suggestions are sure, up hybrid skills to current warrior levels, but then up warrior skills to make them what they should be, the best tanks in the game. DON'T give hybrids the same tanking abilities as a warrior. Heck, i'd even suggest giving warriors a new warrior only skill like damage soak. Give them a chance on each hit (post 50th level) to soak some of all of the damage.<P>I have many friends that play warriors, and while that's not my cup of tea, i depend on them a great deal to keep me alive and would like to see them continue to do what they were meant to do.<P>-Aerich Leib'Olmai<BR>-Ranger of the 45th Path<BR>-Proud Leader of The Lost Cabal<BR>-The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
