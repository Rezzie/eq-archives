</FONT><HR>Grim, I don't assume that. I too routinely have a lower level spell memmed to deal with aggro and cast time---yet another bogus 'balance feature' by the designers. Bah!<P>Also, note that our malise line of spells are resisted 75% of the time---and, if they do manage to hit, our spells are still resisted routinely. If you want malisement cast on your target, group with a Shaman.<P>Still, to this day, a fallacy keeps many a mage out of a group: pet and exp. I had to leave a group the other night in DL because two morons insisted that my pet was taking a full share of exp---inspite of long known facts. I finally had to ask the leader his level. When he asked why, I said: "oh, it's just funny that you got to lvl 47 and still believe that nonsense."<P>Mages have grouping issues, we have spell issues and we have epic quest issues. Our class was POORLY designed in the context of long-term playability, interest, fun and functionality. We're and ADD ON class--no theme, no rationale, no logic. We are completely and utterly unnecessary to any kind of gameplay (and I mean pre and post 50, Norrathian or Planar). The Magician Class has absolutely NOTHING that is 'required' by any other class or group. Yes, yes, CoH--but really, this was added on well over a year after release. It's 'nice' but not 'necessary'.<P>Wizards, at least, have a few necessary abilities.<P>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>The primary problem as I see it between the wizard class and Verant is where do they draw the line between overpowering the wizard.<P>They deliberately made the power of the wizard weak in the early levels then, for some reason, never actually increased them.<P>As I see it, this was to ensure they would not be 'overpowering' in those 2 or 3 PVP servers.  Give a wizard enough power to stay up with a mobs hitpoints and you would have a wizard that could own the PVP arena.  Give a wizard enough power to be a foe in PVP without it being a foregone conclusion and you have a wizard that can't keep up with mobs.<P>Ban all PVP!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alcarion, you cannot compare pre50 nukes with post50 nukes.  The best level 49 wizard nuke (Ice Comet) takes 6.3 sec to cast, the best mage nuke takes 7 sec to cast.  Both take forever to cast and when ever you have a nuke that takes over 5 sec to cast it's no longer a quick kill nuke IMO anyway.<P>Now look at the post 50 nukes.  Draught of Fire takes 3 sec to cast, and Char takes 4.5 sec to cast.  They both cast pretty quickly.  But it doesn't matter because 95% of the time if my nuke took 6 sec to cast it wouldn't make a difference.  So please don't toss the slow nuke argument out there.  It's has no bearing on the issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree that Magicians lack the 'needed' portion of grouping, although they do bring more to a group than Wizards do (since this is all about killing things).  The problem is with a Magician's summons, in my opinion.  I also think Call of the Hero should be a level 29 spell, personally.<P>Magicians would be best served with more useful summons and good ways for their pets to function well for the group.  Since lousy pathing was supposed to be the balance issue for pets being so powerful, remove it now that pets aren't as powerul and aren't NPCs any more.<P>Things like that would really help the class, I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Your resists are not observedly different as a mage than as a wizard.<P>Your 25% of the time that malosi hits is 100% more than a wizards malosi hits.  (ignore the bad math, you know what I mean)<P>A mage can summon, damage shield, and bring a tank to the battle (pet) which provides root, stuns and more damage.

</FONT><HR>My 1st post  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I was looking at the 2 new spells on Test and I see something lacking on it just on inspection. I remember a post a while back from Abashi that most people will never reach 60th level. Since both these spells are targeted at that level this is something for a minority of all players on EQ.<BR>I am a 53rd level wizard that has been at it for 18 months now (yes, I level real slow) and eventually I will get to these spells, probably near the 3rd anniversary of EQ. But is it worth waiting that long?<P>I also notice they are AE spells. Can be fun with an AE group, but I see this as insta-death being able to aggro that many dragons at once, IF you find a guild willing to fight more than one at a time. I would trade the AE effect for lowering the mana cost to 400, giving it a 5:1 damage ratio. I feel more casts on solo targets on an Uber mob raid will go further than the AE effect.<P>I am willing to stick with it, if anyone from Verant reads this. I see how just a little shift can dramatically affect outcomes on pvp servers, so you are trying to stick within certain paramaters. I also dont necessarily feel that wizards alone are the Bohemians of EQ. Got your tanks, cleric, chanter, so fill in the rest. <P>Have a good day,<P>Muldamai Heartseeker, 53rd wizard<BR>Brell Serilis<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

She does tell me, of course, that she still cannot face greenies even at 54, unless she's lucky with a root.

</FONT><HR>My comments are in terms of a group that is trying to pull mobs as fast as possible in a sustainable fashion - ie the experience group.<P>If I have clarity and I get no casting resists, I can sustain my share of the damage (1/6th of the total mob health) over time.  However the damage made possible by clarity represents the contribution of the enchanter and my spells are  regularly resisted.  Consequently I am never able to contribute my fair share to a group over time.  This is the argument for increasing the wizard's ability to deliver damage - particularly over time.<P>The desire by VI to make classes interdependent to encourage grouping can easily be accomodated by making any wizard enhancements buff dependent - like clarity.  However, if you make our abilities buff dependent, we must be able to deal significantly more damage so that groups are anxious to have us.<P>The idea of caster buffs analgous to tank buffs gives some ideas of potential improvements. Buffing increased casting speed, complete mana heals, faster mana regens (read better clarity) are all candidates.  These threads have also mentioned improved mob debuffs needed to reduce resists and otherwise enhance spell impact.  Root and snare are already debuffs at least as important to casters as slows are to tanks<P>VI has done a good job of creating a grouping need for tanks and healers and has found a good group niche for enchanters.  However, it has been less successful in finding a niche for necs, mages, and wizards.  It is not surprizing that much of our threads focus on soloing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So far, I have not seen any weakness in my wizard character AT ALL!!! Besides, If a there really IS a problem that big with wizards, then this message forum is NOT the place to gripe you should take it to the people responsible for it. And from what I've heard, it sounds as though nobody has done a single thing about it!  The people at verant WILL listen to you if you are persistant. TRUST ME!  And dont just /petition them. YOU GOTTA DO MORE THAN THAT!!!! Get on the EQ chat line, or even Email them. They should listen to that.<P>Oh and by the way, I tried playing a druid and it's not as easy as you say it is &gt;&gt;<P>1. We havn't been nerfed recently.. We've always been this way, That's why we're complaining, so we're not crying about nerfs.<P>2. Be Persistant? We have to be more persistant?!! GAH!  How could we BE more persistant short of waving signs around outside Verant in San Diego.<P>3. This message forum isn't the place to talk about Class Balance?  Oh, Absor, I guess you were wrong.. Malachite here says that we're not supposed to talk about Class Balance, so no more Class Talk-style Threads, Absor.  <P>4.  As far as you can see, you can't see any weakness in your wizard character?  What level is your Wizard, and what level and class is your main?<P>Don't tell us that we're all just fools, and imagining things.<BR>1-12 - I died constantly, I mean constantly, I sometimes had 6 corpses in existence at once, I figured it was just normal because I was a newbie... I deleted my wizard to try another class, a SK which got to level 19, deleted her, and made my current main, my Dark Elf Wizard, and despite the fact that I was no longer a newbie (I had learned ALOT of strategies, tactics, etc, more than most probably did at level 19), I still died alot, but I worked through it.<P>13-19 - Alright, this is awesome, Shock of Lightning and Flame Shock are cool. Root works!<P>20-28 - Alright, Self TPs! But... Root stopped working, Force Shock BITES, majorly.<P>29-43 - Alright, I am now a Taxi... I have Bonds of Force, so I can solo a bit if I can scrounge up a SoW or afford SoW potions.  I know it sucks, but it will be worth it, I'll get to 50, then just go on raids and hang with friends, and not worry about XP anymore.<P>44-48 - Kick... Started on Raids, Conflag rules..<P>49 - Ice Comet Roxors, I am now a Godess, I feel great.<P>50 - @#$%?!! What's this? They added 10 more levels?  <P>51-54 - Well, Ice Comet is still nice, it just doesn't work too well.. My AEs are worth using now. Velious sucks, too much HP on those mobs... Not a whole lot of use for Nukers anymore... I still go to Hate, though, because my guild needs me...  <P>  Saw a Ranger who's dagger proced Conflag.. It's a 28 delay dagger too... some High Dex and Haste, and it will proc constantly... Poor Ranger, maybe he will be able to taunt the mob off the cleric who just complete healed him, now...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps now everyone will believe me. I've been saying for over a year that the magick system in this game (and by default, the Classes) is poorly designed. There is no balance between the magick using classes---in 3 cases, the benefits outweigh any of the minor penalties, and in the rest, the penalities overburden the benefits.<P>This says to me a few things: lazy design, rushed design/production, lack of creativity.<P>Yes, I can see clearly that Wizards have justified complaints.

If you are a wizard going oom and getting your group killed.. learn how to play your class or change to an easier class because you obviously cant handle it.<P>If you cant get a group its probably because you have shown before that YOU are no use to a group. That doesnt mean the whole wizard class cant contribute to the group in question.<P>a good wizard knows when and how much dmg he can do without aggroing the mob. and a good wizard knows WHEN to aggro a mob if its needed without putting anyone in danger. <P>Sigh there will probably be no end to some peoples constant blaming their own playing disabilities on "bugs" in their class.<P>Let the people at verant do their job, its not their intention to make us useless ..they want to fix our class to be as good as its intended to be.

Soloing with bonds of force just gets easier and easier =) As a matter of fact I have solo'd thru every hell level since 35, so who needs a group?<P>I suggest spending less time worrying about what every other class can or cannot do and just enjoy the class you picked.<P>Murashu<BR>51 Channeler on Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is not a joke, casters DO NOT Mean much.  The problem is people don't realize ... they never did.  Pure casters add little to a good group, they never really have.  There are few times you even want one around, I should know I PLAY ONE.<P>Example: Monk, Enchanter, Druid, Wizard in Crystal Caverns, some of the tentacles are blue, the named ones are blue and white.  We take them down, some down time.<P>SAME Monk, Bard, Warrior... Bard and Warrior are 10 levels lower than the Enchanter, Druid, Wizard combo.  Tentacle terrors are white and blue and yellow, named are red.  Less trouble killing, less down time, faster xps.<P>Something is definitely WRONG here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know this is amazing. Mages need to stop trying to compare Wizards against them to determine if we are balanced or not. If you are not a Wizard us true Wizards dont wanna hear it. At least I dont. On the Mage thing.....While your sitting on ur butt your pet is wreaking havoc. Wizard sitting on his butt...his grp is getting pounded. Making people not want the "lazy" Wizard around. Then on the other hand you can summon as many mod rods as you can stand to get back into action. Wizards have to sit it out and hope like hell 10minutes go by and Harvest can recycle. I say that because how many mod rods can a Magician summon in 10 minutes?? How much mana will be gained from those rods?? My beef is not with Magicans its with our honorable design team at Verant. So people stop getting all upset about us finally about to get some bones.<P>All you "satisfied Wizards" you are part of the problem too. Why in the hell wouldnt YOU want to make this class better? This tells me alot here are talking outta their arses being trolls and what not. In my opinion there are no satisfied people in this class. Most have just adjusted to the garbage thrown at them. Due to our design team dragging their feet we have really had no choice but to adjust. This small percentage of *satisfied wizards* is what Verant has been using to push us further down the road to being looked at. If your not here to help us go the hell away. <P>If you've been around like most of the names I recognize in these posts you know this to be true.

</FONT><HR>Guys there's something very important to remember here.  And it's something to remember when looking at any change to the game.  Verant's job is to keep their revenue stream going!  Let me repeat.  Verant's job is to keep their revenue stream going!!!  Making us happy is only important inasmuch as it keeps the revenue stream, the monthly fees, going.  So what if CH nerf makes some raids nearly impossible.  The revenue stream sticks around while people try and figure out new ways to do the raids.<P>Do you guys remember when DII came out?  Boy did it seem things were getting better back then.  They had to make the player base happy so they could keep the money rolling in.<P>Anyway, on to this specific subject.  Getting groups, I don't consider that too much of a factor.  Make more friends early on and you'll have more groups later on.  Or if you don't just go solo, or make a twink I guess.  <P>The problem I see specifically is that on big raids in velious wizards cannot contribute to the same extent other classes can.  A 3.3 ratio spell isn't going to fix this completely.  The core here is aggro, we're painted into a corner because no wizard on a raid is going to chain nuke vs. a mob then go to the top of the aggro list when dragon fear hits.  Here's what I propose.<P>Give wizards an elemental focus discipline.  Once practiced it gives a chance, like rogue backstab assassinate, to do X% damage to a mob.  But ONLY if the spell cast is done in the proper 'house' of spells for that mob.  For instance if mob X has high fire resist then draught of fire isn't going to work.<P>tank_01 chops mobbie for 296 damage.<BR>tank_01 scores a critical hit (157)!<P>wizard_01 drops the bomb on mobbie for 825 damage.<BR>wizard_01 focuses his mystical power (157)!<P>As long as taunt works the same way as backstab we wouldn't have to worry about the mob plastering us after one crit.  The percentage can start at 1% at level 29 (make up for mages' better dd in midlevels), move to 2% at level 52, and go to 3% at level 60.  I think a variation of this has been submitted before, what nixed the idea?  PVP?  Just make the discipline mob-only.  Then you wouldn't have to adjust anything else in the game.<P>Finally, realize that part of the reason wizards don't get much in the way of adjustments is because we're often the baseline used when evaluating other classes.  If you change the baseline then you have to think how that affects all the other classes in-game.  Just some food for thought.<P>Grindel Truelore,<BR>Scribe of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok.  When I first heard about improvements to the wizard class, I told myself that I would not get involved.  I figured that since all throughout mythology the wizard has been the one that took forever to become any good and because I'm only 28th level, I must just not be powerful enough yet.<P>Then, I come in here a month or more after I heard this rumor of improvements, and read posts that were all made over the course of a few days from Master, and Grand-Master Wizards, and they are saying the same things I am thinking all the time.  These are:<P>1.) We have no real distinction.  We have the same (non-damage) spells as everyone else.  Shields, invisibility (which is a classic wizard spell) we get after EVERY other class that gets it.  Aren't we supposed to be damage, divination, and transport?  Invis is divination!  And what the hell is it with cheapo things like gobbies seeing through it?  Sure, when EVERY caster class gets a form of it.  And those sight spells ARE useless, especially when they are self only.<P>2.) Do the people who say they will make improvements even READ all of our posts?  I think not.  They never make references to some person's comment directly, and give us one-line responses.<P>3.) We have nothing to offer to a group.  Yes, I know many ppl. have said this already, but it's true.  I have been complimented many times as "finally, a wizzie that knows what he's doing."  -- Even by players that have wizzie alts!  Yet, it takes me hours to get a group.  This paired to the fact that I have extreme trouble soloing (that's if I can even find an open solo spot).<P>4.) Melee classes do melee damage.  They have AC, which protects them from melee damage.  Casting classes do magical damage.  The only thing that comes close to helping prevent that is our slight MR bonus on our shielding spells.  What the hell?<P>5.) I can understand the fact that wizards are supposed to have it tough to become super powerful, but it shouldn't be IMPOSSIBLE.  And if you are going to give us better spells, it should be gradually all the way up, not just a big clump at the top to leave people 1 level below that to suffer.  Power is gained gradually, not just "Whoop!  made lv 50  now i can do 700 more dmg then before."<P>6.) Why can druids teleport at all?  Druids are wanderers who love nature.  Not people who bypass the scenery by TPing where they want to go.  They wouldn't do that.  And for those who say druids aren't unbalanced because they have played one, they are just trying to prevent a long overdue nerf to their new favorite class.  I have also played a druid, and I can tell you.  THEY ARE unbalanced.  They are so powerful, I would play one if I didn't love the legendary wizard and feel the wizzie should be at least equally powerful.<P>7.) Don't think that because the occasional player comes in here saying wizzies are fine, that they are.  The majority of the people that posted here (and that will continue to post here) believe otherwise and have stated their reasoning.  The people who say we are fine may feel that way, or they may just be jealous that they played through hell to get there and they don't want us newcomers to have it easier.<P>8.) I run out of mana so quick and often it's not even funny.  If we are such bookworms who spend our life researching the arcane and doing mondo damage, wouldn't we be smart enough to research a mana regenerating spell?  <P><BR>Even if my points don't impress you, do SOMETHING to better us and make us more unique.  Like I said, besides our damage spells (which aren't too great, compared to melees and chanters/druids) all of our spells are also in the spell book of every other casting class.  And now that bind sight is nerfed, there goes one of our rare unique spells (at least I thought it was unique, I could be, sadly, mistaken).<P>I hope someone at the top reads my post, and at least thinks about it.  Something must be done.<P><BR>Tel'Collantae Tyaliein of Tarew Marr, 28th level wizard.<BR>-----The Masked Gamer-{-@<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     Just a quick point to make on grouping.  I always had a hard time getting groups, very rarely did I get one quickly and I had/have a good reputation, got complemented etc.  Now for my point.  I have a shaman as a alt that I rarely play so no one knows him hardly.  You know what?  At most I have ever spent looking for a group with my shaman is 20min or so, thats it.<BR>     So for those to say its my fault that I must have done something wrong, that I should have made more friends I say get real.  If I want to get a group I log my shaman on, not my wiz, plain and simple.<P>Malafon 53rd wiz Rodcet Nife<BR>Maladron 24th shaman Rodcet</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, i have only played this game for a month, got almost all the combinations to lvl 10 to see what was "fun" and i have seen one thing that Verant dosn't see i guess. Yes these changes to all the characters are nice, BUT, how many people actually make it to lvl 55+ where most of these changes are happening? the lower lvl people are the ones that are getting shafted in my opinion, we have to wait 55 lvls until we see improvments in our class. i think Verant needs to improve characters that are even lvl 10. add more quests that don't require killing a lvl 30 mob. i havnt found, although there might be, a quest that is completable by a very low level character that yields a decent item. again like i said i have only played for a month and my main is only to lvl 15, but us low levels need something more. oh yes, and i think it takes waaaaaaaay to long to get to lvl 60. verant must learn that people don't play a game forever and thats almost how long it takes to get there. <P>Maffer<BR>15th Dwarf Warrior<BR>Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know what I find funny is before velious came out, I was reading threads aboutt he most useful group combos and a wizard was included in almost allof the messages. So how did we go from being one of the most needed to not being needed at all. I cansee our limited usefulness on the Big BAd Monsters in Velious but nothing has changed to make us less useful in the other parts of the world. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You have got to remember that most of these game designers want to have their own concept or "their own brand" of magic. Even though the set standard in most people's heads is AD&D. Personally I think the Wizards could use a little tweeking. Not madd changing but maybe something like:<P>- Stop giving us those damn goofy vision spells and give us something actually useful. How many spells do we need to see 20 yards farther?<P>- Fix the lightning based spells. Personally I keep away from using them because of their inconsistancy. Nothing is more heart breaking then spending 200+ mana to do 4 dmg. <P>- Fix, yes fix, the spell Bonds of Force. Compare druid/ranger snare to wizzy snare and you will see the difference. So what, if our snare is AE? It lasts, or feels like it lasts, meer seconds then the NPC comes halling arse at us. <P>- Raise our SV Magic. So many classes have a higher AC then others, higher HP, etc... Why not give the wizards, who are suppose to have "No rivals" in the arcane world, a greater chance of resisting magic attacks. They are suppose to be masters of magic, so wouldnt they know better than anyone how to resist it. *rubs his chin* There's a thought, huh?<P>No matter what, please do something. Or else just call the game EverDruid.<P>Simethos Teirstorm<BR>Dark Elf Wizard<BR>Grey Dragon of the Dragonriders of Norrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
