</FONT><HR>Oh, I wanted to throw this in, but got lost in my rant. <P>Absor, I know you're fairly new at your job there. And I'm sorry you have to put up with things like this. But, honestly, you've walked into a storm. The relation between VI and it's players is becoming increasingly adversarial. I know it's not your fault, but you are the one that is caught in the middle of it. Perhaps you should take the small piece of advice I put in my previous post. Noone likes the feeling of being ignored, but noone likes a quick or, sometimes, patronizing answer either. <P>I'm also pretty sure that you don't know EVERYTHING there is to know about the game. That would be impossible. But don't be so quick to take a "working as intended" blow-off from someone else and pass it along. Not only does it upset the players, it will make them eventually upset at you personally. Much the same way that people became with Abashi after a while. <P>So, what I'm advocating here is for you to do your job as described. Be the advocate between VI and we, the players. As I said, I'm sure we'd be more than happy to hear "I did not realize that. I'll look into it and get back to you after we (VI and the players) can discuss it reasonably and come to an acceptable conclusion." Personally, I deal much better with waiting and knowing that something is being worked on than hearing an immediate but perfunctory and unsatisfactory response. I like ya Absor, yer a good guy. Use some of that PR mojo and keep yerself looking like one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is the real problem with communicating with VI. They see something that has been working fine for almost 2 years. They think, well if we can change it like this &lt;insert nerf&gt; we maybe can do something like this &lt;insert "enhancement"&gt;. The issue is that VI will nerf right away (and in stealth), and then get defensive when we are actually smart enough to detect it, and let the supposed "enhancement" slide for several months. <P>Never is there the consideration of "hey, why screw around with the customers for 2-5 months while working this out, when there has not been a balance issue to date". After all if there WAS an exploit or cheat this facilitated, I am sure we would have at least heard a hint about it. So, it was/is not only a matter of fixing what ain't broken, but also before you even ordered the replacement parts.<P>And you have lost the number for the parts warehouse. <P>And you forgot to pay your phone bill.<P>And you don't have a quarter for a pay phone.<P>And they express puzzlement when we get upset by this passive-aggressive behaviour...sheesh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here I go again...<P>Bichir, just a note on what you said. There is no "correct" way to play any class. Some might argue that clerics are given decent melee stats, big hammers, and plate armor with the intent of being able to step in and swing it out with a mob. Matter of fact, that was always the way in most other RPG, a plate-wearing cleric had good healing ability with marginal melee ability. In the real world of this game though, that cleric would never get in a group and wouldn't survive very long. Although, wouldn't it be fun to see?<P>Let's think about it a second though. What is more efficient and gives you a better chance of saving your group? Medding and hoping you can get enough to throw out a heal for 100 or 300 pts, depending on level? Or stepping in there, delivering a few hundred points of damage with yer weapon of choice, and hoping to help end the fight quicker so you don't need to heal back those 300 HP? I think they're both valid options. I do both on occasion. Or, until recently, I could med for the heal, cast it, frenzy, and go kick some arse. So, play your character as you want to, with the spells we were given to fulfill our role as the battle shaman.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>IMO the rage line is useless, scrap it and give us a 800 damage poison based nuke.<P>Also Avatar needs to be addresed, sure it has nice stat increased, but with a 6 min duration, and 3 minute casting time, and expensive regent, its a worthless spell.  Thats fine you want it to have an expensive regent, but it ought to last at least an hour like the other spells.<P>Drop rates on Pox/Tigirs/BoN.  These need to be increased majorly, we are the only class left sitting out in the cold missing our high level damage spells.  I play on Vallon Zek where TWO copies of BoN have been found in the months that the kunark dungeons have been being harvested, along with ZERO copies of Tigirs/Pox.  This is terrible, all the high level shamans have no kind of good DoTs to look foward to post 50, please fix this.<P>-Shakar<BR>-Level 60 Iksar Oracle of VZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, Ok, I've got some more thoughts.<P>My goal here is that the new spell should be useful as useful as the old one *IN IT'S ORIGINAL CAPACITY*.<P>That is to say:<BR>* emergency type situation<BR>* caster is low mana ("1/2 bub left")<BR>* effects are the same (buffs + duration)<BR>* occasional use (used to have to med to full after casting)<P><BR>So, can you do this, Verant?<P>1. NO MANA REGEN.  This is a biggie, as it prevents a lot of exploits.  Meditation, Clarity, all those are effectively "off" for the duration.<P>2. VERY SMALL MANA DRAIN.  It must be small to allow someone who is low mana on mana to cast this spell and keep it active for a reasonable period of time.  I mean like 1-2 points per tick for the level 19 (rank 5?) spell.<P>3. LONG RECAST DELAY.  Simulates medding to full before using again.  Should be like Spirit of Cheatah, 2-3 minutes.<P>4. NO SPELL CASTING WHILE ACTIVE  /  SPELL CASTING CANCELS EFFECT.  Simulates having no mana for the duration.<P><BR>Let me explain my test case.  Some of you shaman are asking for Torpor type spells at 34 as a replacement (or a better pet at 55).  I think you've all forgotten how evil the hump is for shaman 19-24.  That's when I used this spell the most.  I needed anything I could get.<P>TEST CASE:<P>Level 19 shaman<BR>Normal (&lt;100 Wis) mana pool<BR>1/2 bub of mana left<P>She casts Frenzy and what happens?  It should be roughly the same as before the "fix".  I'm especially worried about duration here.<P>If possible, can you, Verant, leave off #2 entirely?  I don't see the need for any mana drain at all if the numbered items above are left on there.  Leaving off #2 would fix the duration issues.<P><BR>Thanks for consdering this,<BR>NCD<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've noticed a lot of people suggesting we replace this *line* of spells with &lt;insert single spell that poster has the hots for here&gt;.  That's not fixing the line or even addressing the issue.  If it's going to be replace, replace it with a line of spells.<P>Personally, I would prefer to see the spells changed so that they work exactly like they did before, i.e. gave the same bonuses, had the same duration (yes, they had a fixed duration... they did not rely on mana drain to keep them going indefinitely), left you out of mana until it wore off/was canceled.  The effect it had doesn't need to be changed - it did what it was supposed to just fine.<P>Code the spell so it:<BR>1) Gives the same bonuses as before while active<BR>2) Costs the same initial amount of mana<BR>3) Makes whatever mana you have remaining after the initial cost go bye-bye (same *effect* as before, but no "constant drain of non-existent mana" that seems cause some people brain cramps.)<BR>4) Disables regeneration of mana while the spell is in effect (yet again, same effect as before).<BR>5) Lasts the same amount of time, with the ability to cancel the effect, just like before the "bug fix" (not actually a bug, just a design decision that the powers-that-be have decided they want to work differently now... let's be honest here.)<P>Very simple solution with no new game balance issues that would be generated by cooking up a new, different version of the spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, thanks for talking with us about this.<P>Can I just ask you or Gordon for clarification of two points?<P>(1) "Well, unless there are further ideas, it's really in the hands of the spell-type peoples."<P>Can you clarify this a little? Does this mean that we can expect a change of *some* sort? There have been many suggestions in this thread, and I'm sure your guys have their own ideas. It would just be nice to get a definite "okay, we agree it's a problem, and we will do something", even if you haven't decided what that something is yet. I'm sure more suggestions will keep coming in.<P>(2) This is related to point one, really. In another topic Gordon said, as you did, that it was a bug fix not a nerf. Now I understand that this is the case, and that we won't get Rage back the exact way it was. But his post seemed slightly at odds with your comments here, in that he didn't acknowledge the usefulness of the spell had been *drastically* reduced, to the point it was worthless, whereas you seem supportive of this claim.<P>Could one of you please reassure us that you're both on the same wavelength here? I'm sure it would set many minds at ease.<P>We appreciate the feedback from both of you, and eagerly wait for some news.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm feeling better about the response from Verant now.  I understand coding issues vs. customer relations and how it's not always as simple as it seems.  Anyway, I vote for fixing the spells to provide the same functional effect as before.

</FONT><HR>Yes, I think you can expect some sort of change.  How soon is up to circumstance and timing and all sorts of other things.  Hopefully soon.  I don't know if I would call it drastically reduced in usefulness.  It still works as it did, except it won't work once the caster is out of mana.  Now the way people were using it before (cast down to nearly no mana, then wade in and fight) really won't work anymore.  And as it is players haven't found a lot of uses for it in its new form.  But that doesn't make it worthless.<P>Less effective, and not useful in the way it was before, absolutely.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Again.<P>1) Easy fix lower the mana consumption of this spell.  The reason people wait to be almost out of mana is because the spell simply sucks you dry too fast.  Ask yourself this question.  Would you spend 320 mana on 1 envenomed bolt or a greater heal or would you spend it on 6 ticks with a bit more strength and regen ability?  I think the answer is simple.<P>2) A great fix would be the ability to cast this on other people!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I guess the point is, the only time you will ever use it is when you are low on mana. If you arn't low on mana you can do lot better things with your mana then casing this spell. I don't see a scenario where you would used it with a lot of mana left. Can you think of one? Since it now turns off when you are out of mana, it will only last a short amount of time and is therefore next to useless. If I'm missing something please clue me in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan<BR> If you cast this spell having only the minimum amount of mana to cast it left in your pool it has a virtually 0 duration time.If you cast  a sow a buff or a dot with minimum mana it has a duration time.With all due respect what part of 0 duration =useful? Also as stated before it did indeed have a set time and did indeed cancle itself.Also what appeared to power it is the mana regening into your pool that is the trade off.What is the diffrence between this and a necro life drain that continues on a dead looted poofed mob? There is no life left to drain let alone a mob to drain it from in livng or dead form.This is not a necro bash I have one myself.All of what I have stated of course has been far better stated by my brothers.But in regards to your comment of useful<BR>how do you define a 0 duration as useful?

</FONT><HR>Absor, Lets just cut to the chase, and stop with the beating around the bush.<P>I just logged on and cast rage. Then I clicked my bracer, THE JAUNDACED BONE BRACER, and wham, what happened, it went off just like normal.<P>So, with rage up you can have it, and nice damage w the bracer at the same time. BUT WHAT ABOUT IKSAR! or any of the LOWER LVL SHAMAN?<P>The bracer is the bane of Verants and my existance.<P>Shaman NEVER asked for a free nuke. Shaman only expected upgrades to all of our current spell lines w the expansion, and what did we get?<P>Crap spells, downgrades in efficiency to all of our spells, 20 our of 30 spells that are asically useless stat buffs, and a bracer.<P>How about you just do what you want, change the effect on the bracer to something else. Verant cannot stand this piece of equipment, they nerfed all of our spells just because of this piece of equipment and did not give us upgrades to all of our spell lines because of it, and now they are too lazy to code in a check for the item on this spell, so they are going to nerf the whole spell line for EVERYONE. <P>Ask the class what they want the effect of the bracer changed to, because that is your problem, and why Verant is constantly screwing the class.<BR>(even though mages have a staff that does more dmaage for free and druids get their free DoT, and warriors get a healing spell, etc, etc, etc.)<P>And if it is not the bracer, then there is nothing wrong PERIOD, and your just FoS.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, this is a repost from the previous locked portion. May have got lost, I wanted to make sure you saw it. Thanks<P>Turkeyshoot<BR>    Station Member <BR>                         posted 11-27-2000 09:57 PM            <P>                       Absor, I have the answer to this problem. PLEASE LISTEN.<P>                       Thank you for responding in a reasonable manner and not flippantly or summarily<BR>                       dismissing us out of hand. I feel we actually have a chance to work with you to solve<BR>                       this problem. That being said, no matter how you slice it this is a nerf. When I heard<BR>                       about, my first response was....there goes Verant again and without notice. <P>                       After some reflection, I thought about the spell line some. I came to the conclusion<BR>                       that at least in my experience, it was a spell I never really used much. Was good to<BR>                       have in a pinch, but when I needed it, it was never memmed so what was the point.<BR>                       This was considered by most to be a last ditch spell to either buy yourself some time<BR>                       or to help you clear greens or finish off a low blue mob. It would be used when you<BR>                       were out of mana, youre pet was dead and either you couldnt use sow to get away or<BR>                       you didnt want to waste the time you spent "almost" killing the mob.<P>                       Now with that being said, I thought about your offer about how to turn this around to<BR>                       an acceptable solution. What I came up with is my own opinion but takes the spell in a<BR>                       slightly different direction but one which has historical precedent. Im more of a group<BR>                       player, always have been, probably always will be. While in earlier levels soloing is<BR>                       possible, I think all post 50 shaman would agree that its a group game for shaman<BR>                       almost exclusively. So when I look at spells sets, I look at them in terms of what do<BR>                       they bring to enhance the group efficency to make me more attractive to a group.<P>                       If you look at our level 5 spell Fleeting fury, this is mid battle buff with a short<BR>                       duration. It is 18 seconds long. Its recast is 4 seconds. It increases str 15, increases<BR>                       Dex 20, increases AC 6 and has stam regen and is castable on anyone. <P>                       At level 14 there is a upgrade to this spell it is called Burst of Strength. It Lasts 18<BR>                       seconds. Its recast time is 12. It increases str 20, increases dex 20 and AC 8 with<BR>                       stam regen. Now these two spells mirror each other and have logical progressions<BR>                       right?<P>                       Here is where the spell line goes wierd. So you would expect there to be a next<BR>                       temporary battle buff that you can cast on anyone just like before right? However, the<BR>                       next spell line that is even close but has no prior spell is the shaman Rage series at<BR>                       level 19. Now, it drains the remaining mana from the shaman and last for up to 25<BR>                       minutes or when you cancel it. In the meantime you cant cast any spells. It gives<BR>                       approximately, 28 str, AC 11 and regens health 11. From that point on the previous<BR>                       mid battle buffs which are great from a shaman "grouping" point of view recieved no<BR>                       further upgrades. Instead, we received rage series upgrades. <P>                       So I ask you, why did the original series stop? Why did the rage series suddenly start<BR>                       at 19? Looking at the situation now, doesnt it seem more logical for a group based<BR>                       class to continue to recieve the mid battle buff series than a shaman only rage series<BR>                       that we hardly ever use...? Now I dont speak for all shaman. I know there will be those<BR>                       hardcore meleeing shamans out there that wil say they used this spell all the time. But<BR>                       I think I can say for certainty that most shaman didnt use the rage series regularly<BR>                       and that in today's climate the mid-temporary battle buff would be much more<BR>                       beneficial to us. <P>                       In fact, if you take a look at our spell line, this would provide a logical connection to<BR>                       our Avatar spell. From level 1-14 we recieved two upgrades that are similar in form to<BR>                       Avatar. Spells that were meant to be a short duration, high efficiency battle buff.<BR>                       From 15 to 59 we recieve no upgrades, then suddenly we recieve Avatar which is the<BR>                       only thing that even closely resembles anyting in our spell line besides Rage which is<BR>                       now completely useless. I think this idea would be an acceptable solution for all sides.<BR>                       Its a win, win situation really. Shaman lose a spell that was marginaly used and would<BR>                       gain a spell that would be used more frequently. With any or all of the two various<BR>                       spell set mixes that could develop over time. Increase str, dex, AC, stam regen, HP<BR>                       regen and finally if incorporated as a series which logically lead to Avatar would have<BR>                       ATK increases in a temporary mid battle buff.<P>                       So at this point, why not just have the rage spells mirror how Fleeting furry and Burst<BR>                       of strength works. Of course, twink the spells hopefully with some shaman community<BR>                       input with increased durations and increased recast time that eventually end up with<BR>                       avatar. Now maybe im missing someting but doesnt this seem like the easiest, simplest<BR>                       solution and one that has a precedent and is line with our starting spell series of this<BR>                       sort?<P>                       Please give this some thought, it would be a HUGE shot in the arm for the shaman<BR>                       community and what a HERO you would be...hehe!

</FONT><HR>I must say.. I like EQ and have played since it was available to the public.  I have a shaman who was my first character.  Each class that I have played in this game has spells that dont work or have an effect that is broken. Since starting this game more have been broken or reduced in effect.  When Kunark came out.. my first thought was that was gonna be awesome for all classes.  The reality of the spells that dont work over level 50 is something.  The spells that are rumored to be proposed for Velious do sound awesome..  Same was true for Kunark. Is this good advertisement for Velious?  Please do the cultural thing for our moral.

</FONT><HR>Well robert135, based upon Verant's actions in general and specifically to the Shaman class I think you are a little off as to Verants motives. While I would actually like to believe there was someone actually thinking about our spells, how new items would actually affect the class etc. I think you give Verant WAY to much credit. This spell nerf was brought about by the new Paladin spells for SOV. SOV is about to come out, I think we can agree its not a coincidence. As far as our post 50 spells I dont think the bracer had anyting to do with that at all either. Its either total ignorance or apathy but I doubt the reasoning for such a mess would be the bracer. Maybe youre right but that would be the most moronic reason I could ever think of. Look at the spells, they have no originality. Standard "cookie cutter" approach was applied in which the spell line up was good in "theory" on paper so to speak but has no basis in reality in the day to day needs of a shaman post 50. Im as frustrated as you, I mean I wish you, me any post 50 shaman could just have one hour of the verant staff time one on one and be able to explain this stuff and see the light go on in thier eyes. <P>To be honest, I dont think this consequence ever for one minute even entered thier mind. To make one class better at the sole expense of another and to make the shaman spell series completely useless is just completely (     ) fill in your word there, so many apply.  Many say "Stealth Nerf", hehe please, Im sure Absor and company were like *** are you talking about you crazy shamans. Which all goes back to....did you test these spells? If and its a big if they did....they sure as heck didnt have a shaman doing any testing. Im sure this would have come up, thats if he didnt choke on this SOV spells first.  The bottomline is Verant could care less about the shaman class. Its seen a steady decline in its power. Its seen everyone of its class defining spells given away to other classes. Its community is continually ignored by Verant and refuses to address key issues with the class. Look at your own posts about our healing post 50. The posts concering our spells post 50....all completely ignored. If and a big if Absor can reach back to his past and remember his playing days then he may take some mercy and help us out with this. Right now, it would take a freaking miracle for anyone to say....hrmm lets really take a look at the shaman class and see if it needs tweaking.....My guess it will never happen. God and I hate to be negative.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Im glad your showing some concern on any shaman issues, but this is a spell line that most shamans almost never use anyways.  I would appreciate it greatly if you could spend more time on the post 50 spells that we actually use or would like to use if they were adjusted properly. Such as our very weak 55 pet upgrade, group buffs, cripple spell (does this actually do anything, cant tell the difference myself), 56 and 58  dot upgrades (worse mana to damage ratio? drop rates ), using dots in groups causing unbelievable agro (while dd casters do more damage and have not problem),......<P>I understand you want to respond to VI's unintentional nerf, but there are so many more important shaman issues that need attention/fixes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>oks i did not read the secound page yet but here is my idea. if you want the spell to have the same effect as before ( i used it in fights, and die once right after the pacth where it got changed ) change the mana drain componet to the rest of your mana bar for the cost, would be simaler to haveing been rezzed. now to keep you from reganing mana there is code that after you have been out of food for a LONG time you will no longer regen health stamana or mana. well could you not tack on that it will simpley not alow you to regen mana, most poeple did not us this then try to cast spell thay just cast it as the last spell thay where going to cast for the fight so the amount of mana used is not really a isuee. you could keep the cost of the spell so you have to have a serten BASE number to cast it but anything else you had would disaper the moment you cast it. well it is just one idea anyway</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ideas for fixing Fury line -<P>1) Replace constant mana drain with a set amount of man to cast spell. Disallow casting any other spells while it is active. Keep mana cost LOW.<P>2) Re-place whole spell line with a line of Pet buffs that have similar effect as the orginal spell. I would guess that the shaman cummunity would even accept not being able to cast while this "pet buff" is active IF it is powerful enough. This would a) Make shaman pets more useful, and b) Make shaman buffing abilites (for pets) more useful.<P>3)Replace Fury line with some sort of "meele buff" that is not as powerful, but castable on others. This could be a short duration haste/regen/AC/HP (or some combination there of) spell that has a high mana cost (proportuniate to the buff power).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I first read these threads I started laughing at yet another nerf for the mediocre shaman class.  Its either the start of insanity or it just highlighting how uneducated changes to the game cause people to lose trust in VI and make it that much easier to lose interest in the game.<P>There has been alot of uneducated comments made about the spell line, obviously by those who never really use it.  But, there are those of us that do use it, and use it frequently.<P>The Frenzy line does have a duration, just cast it and sit down for ten odd minutes and you will see it fade.  It fades on me all the time.<P>This spell line was instumental for untwinked shaman of mediocre wisdom to survive encounters.  Not just for soloing.<P>This is just the nail in the coffin that signifies that shaman shall never be allowed to melee even at a mediocre level.  Removing this spell or leaving the effect as is will anger many people.<P>Alan, I understand that you have changed the mechanics to cater for the new paladin spell.  But frankly, if the coders cant manage to code a new routine to handle the new spells then they arent worth a dime.<P>You say that this is spell was not working as intended and that there was a bug that resulted in giving a free effect.  I think you are either uneducated about the effect or you have been mislead.<P>When i sit down (thus meditating) I am not gaining any mana.  Do you realise how much this spell is draining over a 10 minute period?  Do you realise in the grand scheme of things how pitiful the overal effect is for the mana drained?  Any other priest class would be insulted by this spell line as it was originally.  Not even a mangy dog would want this in its present form.<P>Some shaman that do like to melee have gone out of their way to gain items such as the rubi breastplate or fungal tunic which combined with the regen line and frenzy line of spells gave them a respectable amount of hp per tick giving them a remote ability to melee.  This comes at a huge cost, not being able to cast for a caster is a significant cost, almost suicidal now that all mobs run for their lives.<P>What worries me more is your statement that it was a mechanical flaw that has been left as is for two years because you just hadnt bothered to address it yet.<P>I also play a necromancer, all be it a low level one, but your mechanic statement implies that same reasoning to their lifetap/leach line of spells which either drain hp that are not there or continue to drain hp long after the mob is dead.  VI has posted before that its meant to work like that for balance reasons.  But so was the Frenzy line...<P>Is it VI's intention to also nerf the necromancer spells?  Please let me know so I dont bother wasting any more time playing that character.  If not then your logic is flawed and the spell should be reinstated to work exactly like it was intended previously.<P>As a low level shaman I lost count of the number of times this spell line saved my butt when poisoned and oom.  Its a shame it has had more use to blacksmiths than it ever did to the shaman fighting mobs.  Now its just a sad joke.<P>Your looking for us to give suggestions on how to fix it?  That is sad.  I actually wanted to play a shaman because of spells lines like Frenzy, your just too eager to flush it down the toilet for a quick fix.  I'm getting tired of quick fixes.  The quick fix to my Howling Harpoon was just as sad as this one is probably going to be.<P>I do not find it acceptable to alter this spell line.  Its just not good enough.  Its one of the only spell lines you havent given away to every other class at a whim.<P>It is painfully obvious that the VI team had no idea about this line of spells when they changed the mechanics to allow for the new Paladin spell. If it was intentional then it would have been notified, correct?  You changed the mechanics to allow for something new, not to correct a problematic spell line.<P>It is also painfully obvious that whomever has been appointed to address Shamanic issues had not even a basic understanding of the class.  Ever since Kunark the Shaman class has continued a spiral of decline.  There is nothing to look forward to.  I love playing EQ, but its just a game and thankfully I play other characters.<P>I'm not even going to entertain the idea of changing the spell line to something else.  For the genius at VI that has decided to butcher our class into oblivion and give us a necromancer dot as our class defining effect I congratulate you on a job well done.  I dont think I could of ruined a class that was fun to play more so even if I tried to do so deliberately.<P>Voice of the Berserker decreases mana by 65 per tick.  A level 60 Shaman with 200 wisdom will have approximately 2500 mana.  To cast this spell with full mana will heal 1330 hp over almost 4 minutes.  This is without casting any other spell.  Can you say this is how the spell was intended to function?  Obviously its not.<P>Your just looking to destroy the only thing left Shamans that melee had to look forward to by nerfing it to be so pathetic that people even serious consider a fleeting fury upgrade as a serious replacement.  Shame.<P>Here is my suggestion.<P>/retire<P>I've had enough of this nonsense.  Here is one less shaman to victimise.  This class is no longer any fun to play, it fails to entertain me anymore.  This is a major failure on VI behalf as I started playing a Shaman prior to Kunark and I had no issues with the class at all.  A Shaman is nothing like it was pre-kunark.  Its just a sick joke now.  Congratulations on butchering a fun class.<P>I'm not going to hang around for 16 months and whine like the wizards and rogues had to do in order to get some intelligent changes made to the class.  I have a shred of self-repsect and dignity left and I will quit EQ rather than resort to that.<P>Here is a clue.  When a patient is wheeled into ER with a major head wound they dont crack open the packet of band-aids.  We dont need band-aids, Alan.<P>Now I know why my Troll Shaman scratches his butt all the time, its just sore from being shafted all the time.  If your going to work on classes, then make them fun (not necessarily powerful).  To just take and take and keep on taking makes for a very unhappy player.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The mana not regening is what balances this spell, this spell was not unbalanced.  Let me ask this "were there a ton of people making shaman so they could go around and melee things to death with this spell?" No.  "why not?" because simply although it was useful most did not like the fact that you did not regen mana while it was going, that it took up a slot and was not that useful.<P>My suggestion would be to take away the mana drain, and make it cost a small amount but have a short duration, that way it could be used like yaulp, not unbalancing.  To have it have a short duration, drain all your mana, and have the same effectiveness as it did when the game was released almost TWO YEARS AGO, is just plain mind boggling.<P>Please use some common sense and a leave it a)leave it the way it was or b) make it like yaulp, low mana cost, short duration, no mana drain.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Old Rage Series:  Takes away at most X mana a tick and in return gives the user Regeneration, and Stat bonuses.  Spell lasts for 10 min.<P>New Rage Series:  Takes away X mana a tick and in return gives the user Regeneration and Stat bonuses.  If there is not X mana in the users mana pool the spell stops.<P>These are two completely different spells.  You keep saying the spell takes away mana the Shaman doesn't have.  Why couldn't the spell be "Keeps Shaman from regenerating any mana."  And the spells design be satisfied with taking between 1 (standing mana regeneration rate) and X mana from the shaman.<P>I for one almost lived on this spell between level 19 and 34.  As a class my DoT's hadn't matured, my DD weren't mana efficent, and my magic based spells (such as the walking sleep series) were highly resisted.  Any number of these factors may have meant I was low on mana fighting a typical monster.  And when I was low on mana I had the option of saying: "I want to beat the snot out of this gnoll."<P>Now after a year and a half of playing, you have removed this option from my arsenal.<P>No amount of tweaking this spell will change the fact a shaman could use this series when virtually out of mana and be a more effective melee... and now they cant.  Where as one class had to meditate, a shaman could still fight.  The statement a shaman didn't have to have mana to be effective in melee is now, protect the shaman while he meds.<P>You might as well call this spell Yaulp because it's about as useful.<P>My suggestion is to change it back and be satisfied that the spell just "drains the shaman of mana, and prevents the regeneration of mana until stopped."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
