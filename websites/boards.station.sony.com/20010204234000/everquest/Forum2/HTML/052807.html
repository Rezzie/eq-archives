</FONT><HR>Ok, I suspect you've been preparing for this, so I'll warn Akriss to be ready to split this thing…<P>So let's have it.  Tell me what needs balancing for bards.  You may as well give me bugs and broken stuff too.  But my focus is going to be on things that are needed to move bards closer to 'balanced' in the game.  This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that.  I am just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one.<P>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play.  And I have no problem with that.  This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes.  I'm fine with that too.<P>Please, be detailed where you need to.  Try to avoid abbreviations, my simian mind can't decipher many of them.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(Reposted from the Concert Hall.  Sorry Kaearia, couldn't resist  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )  -=B=-<P>This has actually gotten pretty long, and I'm looking for suggestions on shortening it. Version 3<P>Absor, I did a quick survey on the Concert Hall (the major EQ bard site) with the following vote tally.<P>44 Song/melee damage does not keep up with other classes.<BR>29 Ineffective mana drain.<BR>28 Resist songs don't have much effect at high levels.<BR>27 Haste/slows not increased by instruments.<BR>24 Singing Steel/Melodic effects are silly.<BR>19 Chain's duration is random, not guaranteed like snare.<BR>16 Ervaj songs not giving enough haste.<BR>14 AC on bard armor is incorrectly set at chain level.<BR>12 Pick Locks is useless.<BR>11 Lack of mid-level instruments.<BR>9 Lullaby is ineffective.<BR>8 Bards are just fine as is.<BR>7 Difficulty in obtaining a white scale for epic quest.<BR>5 Rune on Song of Shields is too weak.<BR>5 Weak haste/buff songs until level 36.<BR>5 Need a form of auto-twist to keep up 3 songs.<BR>3 Mana use on charm should be removed.<BR>3 Range on Accelerando/Song of Travel is too small.<BR>3 Psalm of Vitality/Purity do not cure disease/poison.<BR>2 Bard is weak at low- to mid- levels.<BR>2 Dirge takes too much mana/too much time.<BR>2 Higher meditate for memming songs faster.<BR>1 Lack of PoG bard quests.<P>The most common themes seemed to be:<P>- Bards feel less useful at higher levels, especially against large named targets.<BR>- Bards feel considerably less useful when grouped with enchanters and shaman.<BR>- Bards are continuously overlooked when it comes to design and testing.<P>Let me expand on the most popular choices on the survey.<P>----------------------------<BR>1. High level damange scaling<P>Bard damage doesn't seem to increase between levels 50-60 as much as melee or caster damage. Here's what Thott (guildleader of Afterlife) had to say on it:<P>For the curious, chant [of frost and flame] damage increases less than 30% from 50 to 60.<P>Rogue melee damage, by comparison, increases from 30 damage/sec to about 100 damage/sec in the same period, going by parser data from both levels. 30 damage/sec is with the best weapons available when we were capped at 50, 100 damage/sec is with the best weapons available now that we're capped at 60.<P>In general, melee damage triples from 50 to 60 and spell damage increases 50%. Bard "spell" damage is really a form of melee damage, since the damage is slow yet takes no mana. Yet for some reason it follows a lesser curve than regular spell damage. I have no idea why.<P>Regular spell damage actually increases by more than 50%. 50% is the improvement in the spells themselves from 50 to 60. In practice the boost is greater, because total mana and mana regen increases from 50 to 60 as well. This isn't true for bards.<P>--Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;<P>Thott has done some nice graphs that show the problem pretty clearly:<P>www.afterlifeguild.org/Th...urves.html<P>Most bard songs don't get upgrades. They're designed to get better with level. If you take our Chant series as an example (a targeted DoT), from level 40 to 50, the song increases from 39 damage for 3 ticks to 48 damage for 3 ticks (+23%). From levels 50 to 60 it'll go from 48x3 to 57x3 (+19%). You designed the level 50+ spells to represent a larger increase in power than just 10 levels. Unfortunately, the power of our songs increases based on a level-dependent formula, and so going from 50 to 60 is actually a smaller boost for us than going from 40 to 50. What was impressive at level 40 becomes so-so at level 50, and is approaching negligible at level 60.<P>Suggested fixes that I like: <P>- Introduce new high-level instruments with bigger song effect multipliers. (And no, requiring wood elf bards to kill creatures in Tunare's plane does not count. Considering there are no evil-race bards, if you're going to put bard instruments in a good plane as drops, at least make them questable too.)<P>- Introduce weapons that can also double as an instrument. Kinda like the bard epic weapon, but only specific to a single instrument.<P>- Tweak the formulae used for song effects in the 50-60 range, to accurately reflect the large increase in damage/effectiveness other classes get in the 50-60 range.<P>----------------------------<BR>2. Mana drain<P>Many high-level encounters are against mobs that heal or gate, and thus draining the mob's mana becomes an important strategy. Two classes in the game get mana drains - enchanters and bards. But for all practical purposes, only enchanters can drain mana.<P>Enchanters get one spell at level 34 which drains 214-370 mana (e.g. at level 57 it'll drain 352, has a mana cost of 150, and a cast+recycle time of 11 seconds. At level 55+ with Clarity 2, 150 mana can be medded back in 30 seconds. At level 57 these correspond to drain rates of 32 mana/sec considering only cast time, and 9 mana/sec if you factor in meditate time. As a bonus, it can't be resisted.<P>Bards get two mana drain songs, both of which are resistable. Both songs are instrument based, but an instrument does not increase the amount of mana drained.<P>The level 35 song (Denon's Dissension) is AE pulse based and drains 24 mana/pulse (i.e. you lose mana every time I sing the song). If I chain-sing this song (restart it every 3 seconds), I need 4x longer to drain as much mana as a like-level enchanter. It works out to about the same amount of time as the enchanter if you factor in med time, but you have to understand that an enchanter can haste and clarity his party before the fight, and mez extra mobs while he's draining mana. If I chain-sing this song, I can do *nothing* else except melee to contribute to the fight. Also, from level 37 to 57 this song only increases 9% in the amount of mana drained. The enchanter mana drain goes from 229 to 352 in the same level range (+54%). The way this song scales with level needs to be improved *badly*.<P>The level 57 song (Cassindra's Insipid Ditty) is single target and drains a laughable 1.5 mana/sec at level 57. The drain rate is so low that most bards mistakenly thought the song didn't drain mana at all. It is 21x slower than enchanter mana drain. I would need 4 minutes to accomplish what the enchanter can do every 11 seconds. If you factor in meditate time, in the 4 minutes takes me to drain 350 mana with this song, an enchanter can drain 2100 mana, sit down, and med back all the mana he used. If we haven't killed the mob by then. Consider removing or lowering the resist check as well so we can use it on level 63 mobs. Ditty has a wis/int debuff component so it will not stack with itself, and only a single bard at a raid can be using it on a target.<P>----------------------------<BR>3. The decline in the importance of bard resists<P>In the 55+ large target encounters, resists seem to be less important. Back when I was 45-50, having bards to boost everyone's resists could make or break a Nagafen/Vox raid. Raising resists was so important most bards at these raids chose to use a drum instead of weapons, foregoing doing any damage.<P>Against Gorenaire, Talendor, Trakanon, etc, having my resists at 255 doesn't seem to make much if any difference. I get feared and take full AE damage anyway. Giving mobs spells that are so difficult to resist diminishes the role of a bard in these raids. I currently only play resists because a lot of my friends enjoy seeing their resists in the 200+ range. Personally I don't think it makes that much difference from the 150-200 resist most players are achieving with equipment and spell buffs. I hear there's a "soft cap" at 175 after which resists make much less of a difference. <P>Solution: Remove the "soft cap" if it exists. Improve the player resist rate against these high-end targets with maximum resist, so that there's a significant benefit to getting up near 255. Double-check to make sure there's no roll-over bug when resists exceed 255 (or whatever the max is in your code).<P>----------------------------<P>4. Instruments don't increase haste/slows<P>This is really a bug, but a pretty major one. Berserker's Crescendo (42), Rousing Rondo (57), Melody of Ervaj (50), Composition of Ervaj (60), Assonant Strane (54), and Anstlich's Assonance (60) all have hastes/slows that are sub-par for their level (i.e. lower level songs are better). All of these are instrument songs (the better hastes/slows are singing-only). It seems like you guys designed these songs assuming an instrument would enhance the haste/slow. Problem is instruments don't do that.<P>20% haste - Celerity (level 36) singing<BR>18% haste - Crescendo (42) brass<BR>30% haste - Verses (50) singing<BR>45% haste - Celerity2 (54) singing<BR>22% haste - Rondo (57) brass<P>5% haste - Melody of Ervaj (50) brass required<BR>10% haste - Composition of Ervaj (60) brass required<P>Comparing Rondo (57) to our level 54 song is a joke. If you're singing Rondo, a mob hitting your party on average 1.5 times every 3 sec will take 4 dam/sec from the damage shield. For the damage shield to offset the 23% loss in haste, your party must be doing less than 12 dam/sec melee damage for Rondo to be better than Celerity2. A level 50 bard can almost do that much dam/sec solo. If the bard is using a horn, the party has to be doing less than 36 dam/sec - 20 dam/sec for bard melee = 16 dam/sec melee for Rondo to be better. This comparison is pitiful. There simply is no survivable situation in which it's advantageous to use our level 57 haste instead of our 54.<P>The same reasoning applies to our slow songs. Currently our first slow (level 20) is still one of our best (level 23 and 51 songs equal it). From level 20 to 60, a bard's slows scale from a 15% to 35% reduction in damage (a 2.3x improvement). In the same level range, an enchanter's slows go from a ~20% to 70% reduction in damage (a 3.5x improvement). A shaman's slows go from ~25% to 75% reduction in damage (a 3.0x improvement). Given that our slows are already the weakest to begin with, is it that unreasonable for our slows to at least improve with level to the same degree as enchanter/shaman slows? The level 54 slow if augmented by an instrument would reach about 50%, and the level 60 slow would reach 60%.<P>Thott has done a nice write-up on the history of hastes and the problems that led to the misunderstanding that instruments augmented them.<P>www.afterlifeguild.org/Th...cking.html<P>Please either fix hastes/slows so an instrument increases them, or change these songs to have double their current haste/slow (optionally making them instrument-only).<P>----------------------------<BR>5. The effects on our Kunark and Velious armor show a misunderstanding of the bard class<P>Singing Steel armor effects are still worthless (literally). Using a right-click effect locks us out of our songs for the duration of the cast.<P>- The BP is a self-only 100 point heal with a 12 second cast time. In 12 seconds, a level 50 bard using a Plane of Hate lute can heal 80 hp for each party member. I don't even know what the point is making the BP's heal self-only.<P>- The vambraces have an effect of Invigorate - a targeted stamina replenishment. Our level 3 song replenishes stamina for the entire party. Our level 34 song does it while healing and giving mana.<P>- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a time so it's at least useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2 minutes to summon a stack of water that'll all disappear every time I go linkdead.<P>- The greaves summon 1 food at a time. See boots above.<P>For the other classes that get it, Kunark armor effects give them something they didn't have before. For melee classes it's access to spells. For casting classes, it's mana-less spells. For bards... well we already had song-spells that were mana-less. In order for the armor effects to be advantageous to us, they need to do something we couldn't normally do (which is why the BP and vambraces are silly). Bards don't get long-duration buffs. That's what Singing Steel should do. The bracer (damage shield buff) and gloves (enduring breath) are perfect examples of this. Summon food, summon water, summon eye would also marginally fall under this category. Please change the BP and vambraces to do something that we normally can't do on our own.<P>I suspect the same thing is happening with the Velious bard armor effects. Currently the Melodic BP right-clicks Song of Travel. Song of Travel has 12 second duration and an invis component so it drops every time you right-click to re-activate it. Since you have to re-activate it every 12 seconds, it's dropping every 12 seconds. It's pretty silly to put this on an item as an effect (actually, it's pretty silly to make right-click effects out of any song that bards usually leave playing, since you have to refresh it every 12 seconds).<P>----------------------------<BR>6. Bard movement slowdowns are the only random duration movement slowdowns in the game<P>Selo's Constant Chain (level 23 song) was originally coded to have the largest movement slowdown in the game. You guys didn't seem to have a problem with the movement slowdown, but an interaction between it and fear caused a situation you felt was exploitable. So you capped movement slowdowns at the best necro darkness spell. This nerf affects us even when we aren't fearing, and you didn't compensate us for it in any way.<P>Chain, Largo's Absonant Binding (51), and Assonant Strane (L54 AE movement slowdown) are all random in duration. They could last the full 12 seconds, they could wear off immediately. No other movent slowdown spells in the game have a random duration, even though the spell versions last 10-50 times longer than Chain. It can't be because Chain has a slow component attached because no other slow spells in the game have a random duration either. I hear all the movement slowdowns except the level 1 snare used to be random duration, and were gradually changed to have a fixed guaranteed duration - except the bard ones. In light of the above one-sided nerf, perhaps you could give these songs a guaranteed 12 second duration?<P>There's also an infrequent bug that affects all the movement debuff spells. If you try to chain/snare/darkness a mob that's already begun fleeing, sometimes the spell/song will land but will have no effect (if this happens, repeated attempts to chain/snare/darkness it will have no effect). Due to the random duration of Chain, bards are the ones who get bit by this one the most.<P>----------------------------<BR>7. The Ervaj songs don't provide enough haste.<P>Melody of Ervaj and Composition of Ervaj (50, 60) were designed to stack with all other hastes. There's been much debate within the bard community about these songs, but Thott wrote something that made everything click into place for me: "Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level."<P>That in a nutshell explains all the problems with bard haste, as well as paladin and SK melee. Bards get only dual wield. Paladins and SKs only get double attack. All other melee classes get both dual wield and double attack. Both DW and DA increase by level, so melee damage for bards, paladins, and SKs rises proportionally to level. Other classes get both DW and DA so their melee damage rises proportionally to level squared. That is why paladins and SKs are so weak at melee at high level. Bards aren't quite so bad off because we get hastes (with upgraded songs coming every few levels and so our self-hasted damage goes up as level squared). But when we're grouped with an enchanter or shaman doing hastes, that benefit completely disappears and we're in the same boat as paladins and SKs.<P>The Ervaj songs were a mistake. By giving us haste songs that stacked with our *own* hastes, you put yourself between a rock and a hard place. The stackable haste had to be large enough to preserve the boost bard melee needed from haste to stay balanced, yet small enough to prevent a bard from single-handedly out-hasting an enchanter. <P>At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10% haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere close to giving us the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the other melee classes. CoE will only be used when there's a better haste spell available than what the bard can provide, so figure 50% haste (shaman Celerity). Worst case all the melee folks will have no haste items. The bard has to use an instrument so you lose 20 dam/sec right there. For CoE to offset that loss, the other tanks in the party have to be doing more than 300 dam/sec hasted. [300/(1+0.5)]*(1+0.5+0.1) - 20 = 300. The only way to achieve this dam/sec rating is to have 2-3 rogues in the group. It gets even worse if you consider near-best case. Quickening (64% haste) + FBSS (21% haste) = 85% haste. For the extra 10% haste from CoE to offset the loss of bard melee, the other tanks in the party have to be doing more than 370 dam/sec. Basically, you've designed a song that'll only realistically be used in a group composed of a cleric, bard, and 4 rogues.<P>Get rid of the Ervaj songs. Take the Ervaj haste code and put it into our normal haste songs, to make them all stack with haste spells. That eliminates any chance of bards single-handedly out-hasting an enchanter, while still preserving the haste advantage bards rely on for their melee damage to keep pace with other classes. The game survived fine for a year and a half with the haste bug putting everyone at max haste. It'll survive groups with enchanter+bard or shaman+bard attaining max haste more easily.<P>----------------------------<BR>8. Bard armor tends to have incorrect AC<P>You keep forgetting that bards are a plate class, not a chain class. <P>Imbrued armor - chain AC. Fixed in 2 months.<BR>Black enameled BP - bard unusable plate. Fixed in about 6 months.<BR>Lambent armor - plate AC. Kudos, you got one right.<BR>PoS haste belt - chain AC. Still unfixed after a year.<BR>Singing Steel - chain AC. Fixed in a month.<BR>Jarsath armor in Karnors - bard unusable chain. Unfixed<BR>PoG and Velious quest armor - chain AC. Unfixed.<BR>Royal Velium Frosted armor in Icewell - bard unusable plate. Unfixed.<P>(e.g. Bard boots in PoG are 19AC. Rogue boots in PoG are 19AC. Cleric boots in PoG are 21AC. The same discrepency holds for Velious quest armor.)<P>I could go on, but I think you're getting the picture. You need to make sure the people designing this stuff understand that bards are a plate class. Given the number of severe bard bugs that slip onto the Live servers, oversights like these just helps feed the impression that nobody at Verant really cares about bards.<P>- Double-check all the plate armors in the game to make sure they're bard-usable if they're usable by all the other plate classes.<P>- Check the AC on all bard-specific armors to make sure it's at least on par with the other plate-class armors. (You tend to give us cleric AC instead of paladin/SK AC, which is fine by me.)<P>- When we post an incorrect data entry on the bug board, please fix it in a timely manner. Not months or years or never.<P>----------------------------<BR>9. Bard pick locks skill is useless.<P>Only two classes in the game get pick locks - bards and rogues. Rogues get it at level 6, it caps at 200 at level 40, and 210(?) at level 60.<P>Bards get pick locks at level 40. It's capped at 100. The only locks in the game we can pick are in Befallen, some of the locks in Najena, the entrance to the Hole in Paineel, and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Except for the Tower, all of these areas are green to us by the time we get the skill.<P>My guess is that you don't want the high-level locks to be pickable by level 24 rogue mules (whose pick locks also caps at 100). My suggestion then is to raise the bard pick locks cap to 201. Make some of the high-level locks require 201 skill to pick. Make the rest of the high-level locks require 202+ skill so they're still rogue-only. No rogue mule problem, bards can pick some of the high-level locks, and rogues still have a monopoly on the rest of the locks.<P>OTOH, if you just don't want bards picking any high level locks, leave the cap as is, but give us the skill at about level 10. That way it's at least usable by low level bards in Befallen and Najena. I'm not sure why you'd want to do this though, seeing as rogues already have several ability monopolies (backstab, pick pocket, invis+invis to undead, poisons).<P>----------------------------<BR>10. Lack of mid-level instruments.<P>The game is sorely lacking in mid-level lutes. Yes there are two "mid-level" lutes that come from Mistmoore. Unfortunately, they only have a +5% modifier. The only commonly used string song until level 47 is Hymn. Hymn does not heal 20 hp/tick until level 54, at which point the lutes give the bard +1hp/tick. Since the game rounds down all fractions, the Mistmoore lutes operate the same as a store-bought lute until a bard reaches level 54. So a mid-level lute effectively doesn't exist. Please increase the modifier on the Gypsy Lute and/or Lute of the Gypsy Princess to +10%.<P>Horns (brass) are lacking. There's one off Vox, and one which is a random drop off sirens in Cobalt Scars. The one in CS would qualify as mid-level, except you have to get a shot at one you have to go through Kael, Wakening Lands and Wuoshi, Skyshrine (need a key), and past the huge AE cobalt drakes in CS.<P>Percussion instruments seem to be fairly well done. There are a wide variety available with different bonuses. One is even questable, which every bard loves.<P>Mid-level wind instruments are easy to get. The problem with them is that the wind songs don't really benefit from an instrument so there's not much you can do here.<P>----------------------------<P>Other gripes, bugs, minor annoyances:<P>----------------------------<P>Song of Highsun and Song of Midnight can only be used during daytime and nighttime respectively. A couple patches ago you included a message saying Song of Twilight would now be usable any time during the day. Song of Twilight never had a time-of-day restriction on it. Highsun and Midnight are the songs with the time-of-day restriction. Perhaps you meant to remove the restriction from these two songs?<P>----------------------------<P>Song of Shields (49) has no message. It went from bad (spamming us with a buff message for each group member), to worse (no message at all). Please put in a single line message (flagged bard song so others can filter it) just like all our other songs.<P>Also, a 40 point rune with lute is of questionable usefulness when you're fighting mobs that regularly hit for 80+ damage. This song either does not scale with level or scales poorly with level, so it becomes even less useful at higher levels when mobs are regularly hitting you for 150+ damage.<P>----------------------------<P>You seem to have a synch bug, where if a mob is mezed/stunned/killed an instant before its gate finishes, the gate still goes off. I've seen it happen with both bard and enchanter mez, with cleric and paladin stuns. A couple nights ago, we killed a mob with a druid DD, and its corpse finished the gate and appeared at its spawn point.<P>----------------------------<P>The "song ends" "song starts" "song ends" bug is still around. I understand you're aware of it and trying to track it down. I can verify that it's a server-side problem, not a client-side one. If it happens to a damage shield song, I do not get the benefit of the damage shield.<P>I also suspect the bug can also happen to mobs, who then unwittingly benefit. Several bards (including me) have noticed that sometimes we'll successfully re-charm a mob, get the "You don't have a pet to command" message, and 12 seconds later get the "Your charm has worn off" message. It sure sounds like the same bug only happening with a debuff on the mob.<P>----------------------------<P>Bard mez overwrites enchanter mez. The worst enchanter mez in the game is better than the best bard mez, but bard mez still overwrites theirs. I suppose this will/won't be fixed depending on what you eventually do with the way different enchanter mezzes overwrite each other.<P>----------------------------<P>Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec.<P>----------------------------<P>Lullaby (level 15 song). Many bards still feel the resist rate on this song is too high for it to be useful even at low levels. It is the only mez bards get until level 28. (Personally I feel you guys have reappraised the song enough, and the improvements to Twilight more than make up for the nerfs to Lullaby, but it got enough votes on my survey that I'm including it. So please don't shoot me for including it.)<P>----------------------------<P>Aria of Eagles (31, levitate) and Song of Travel (51) don't give any message when they're about to expire. You removed the message in response to complaints about the spam (we were constantly getting the message even with the song playing). The correct fix is to increase the duration of these songs by one tick so the message isn't generated for at least one tick, by which time the song's next pulse will refresh it. You had this correct fix in place with Aria. Then you removed the message entirely from both songs when you "fixed" Song of Travel.<P>Since both effects are short-lived, it's rather important for group members to know when they've wandered out of the bard's song range and they are about to stop levitating.<P>----------------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do like to play my Bard because he can do a lot of things. However, I feel the class in general is a little weak. We know a little of almost everything and master of nothing. Jack of all trades class. First off, the melee. I think that we should be able to dish out some damage. Not up there with a warrior but somewhere near a pallys damage output. When in a group, all the messages I see that are to me state: Play the mana song. That should not only be are main purpose in life once we make 32nd lvl. We should be about to tank a little. A mini tank if you will!

</FONT><HR>As a general view of balancing the bard, I think that the removal of the exp penalty helps a great deal.<P>But I found that penalty to be extremely unjustified for bards primarily because they are a VERY difficult class to play.<P>First of all, the way songs work is different from anything else in the game.  You can play a melee AND a spellcaster into the 40's and you will still need to learn some game mechanics to play a bard.  (I know this because the other night I was tutoring a guildmate who plays a 48 war and 42 dru in twisting.)<P>Second of all, we are the "jack of all trades".  Necros need to learn effective use of fear.  Enchanters must learn manipulation of charm and mez.  Druids learn the careful balance of footspeed and snare.  Bards must learn ALL of these, and more.<P>Finally, there is the "master of none" clause on that above quote.  We can do just about everything... but only briefly.  This adds another level of complexity, on top of that which is mentioned before.<P>The bard is seen as quite powerful, when you look at what they can do and the fact that it doesn't cost mana.  But until one has played a bard at LEAST in the mid 30's, it is difficult to understand the cost placed in mechanical difficulty.  This is an important balancing factor, and one that may have been missed when the Selo's Consonant Chain and Kelin's Lucid Lullaby changes were made.<P>I hope, Absor, that your team gathers some solid information on the actual level of difficulty and overall bard population (which is small, as a result of that difficulty) and takes it all into account when considering balancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Key issues that I've seen, heard other bards discuss in the build up to, rather than just as a result of the announcement of balance talks...<P>1 - Q.A of bard adjustments. This isn't a selo's thing, selo's just falls into this category. The bard-tuning expertise seems to have gone away about a year ago. New items, new songs, all lack the finesse of the original bard items. Most importantly, bards are unintentionally broken on a /regular/ basis. Selo's is just the most recent and most extreme example of it.<P>2 - Spell Icon Animation. A key part of barding is "twisting". Contrary to the vision of trying to provide all players a level playing field, a lower-spec machine is limited to twisting only maybe 2 songs because of the computing time resulting from the spell-icon animation. In order to twist three songs, such a bard would need to either not use hotkeys (disadvantage #1) or be less magically effective than a higher-powered box. Solution? Provide an option to disable it. No benefit to faster-spec'd users, because they can't twist any faster than the casting time of the songs.<P>3 - 49th level "Shield of Songs". This reflects back on item 1. We waited a long time for this song, and when it was added all the non-bards said "that sounds like a nice effect, a rune!". In practice, you had to remove more or less the same effect from Jonathon's Provocation to justify this song, rather than making them conflict and providing bards with the usual "either or" choice. The song was also implemented like a spell - it has a casting animation, a casting sound, and it originally spammed the party with casting messages - which weren't excluded by the bard spam filter. The knee-jerk reaction has been it now has no message, so bards on lower-spec machines without particles are at a disadvantage to those of us who can afford to have them on full and thus tell visually when the song is cast.<P>Also, the actual value of this song is dubious. Jonathon's had more "runic" value, and had been with us for a long time, and only lost the runic factor when it was pointed out that the new song seemed a waste because it was in all measures less powerful than jonathon's - a lower song.<P>4 - Dennon's Dissension. Very poor mana drain. VERY poor. I don't know any bards that use it other than when it is their newest thing.<P>You've said that this song would be great in long fights like vox or naggy. But infact on those kind of raids an ae like this causes linkdeaths galore and so it goes unused (see issue 5).<P>Given the changes to our various stun lines, what this song needs is a chance to interrupt. 10% without an instrument, 20% with a store-bought instrument, and 30% with a mcvaxius horn. Thus it might interrupt 1 time in 3.<P>5 - AoEs in big raid situations. Our AoE songs are more or less off limits in big raids. Dirge seemed like it might be useful as a last ditch aid on planar raids. But all you are going to do is linkdead people with the "you are protected" messages.<P>6 - Ervaj line. I'm sure other bards will explain the problems with these better, but basically they REQUIRE an instrument for whom the other song options are AoEs. It requires that the bard step out of mele. The result is 5% haste, barely noticeable, but you lose the percentage mele output that would be the mele generated by your bard.<P>7 - Distribution of stats. The bard is NOT a tank class. We are a hybrid (in the truest sense of the word), half fighter, half mystic. AC is most certainly not all. You conceeded this point when you reviewed bard issues, particularly singing steel, some months ago.<P>8 - Items. Various issues; bards seem to end up wielding the stock set of swords rather than piercing weapons; it was stated long ago that the vision for bards was that they were piercers akin to their rogue brethren.<P>PoH. There are a LOT of threads kicking about from bards like myself who have killed hundreds of banshees and not seen any armor drop. I've been going to hate since January 28th 1999. I've *logged* over 305 hours since I started counting in June of last year, and I've killed over 200 banshees since I started logging.<P>Around February last year you changed the drops in PoH, and the projected drop rate for banshees at the time would be reasonable, but we're not seeing it. Instead we're seeing Imbrued famines and then a bard will go up and come down with two items from one raid. This may just be down to a bad export or maybe a typo. But the PoH imbrued drops are NOT inline with the values talked about last year.<P>Many of the bard useable items are honestly questionable. I have some items in my inventory that are teriffic, but I feel guilty having them. They just don't seem right. Meanwhile the items with the kinda stats I do want all seem to be non-bard useable or attainable.<P>Instruments - there just aren't enough. The instrument lines seemed promissing, but again they seem to have been given up on and bards left to wield swords.<P>9 - Maturity of the character. Casters casting powers increase and buff durations get longer and tanks mele powers increase with expansion levels. Bards like myself, however, suddenly find ourselves at 55 with lower singing skills than bards at 46 and 47 because of the new caps being set pre-expansion. It would throw a major spanner into the bardly works if post 50 our song durations began to tend towards 4 ticks instead of 3.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the major midlevel concerns is Selo's Consonant Chain, a snare-type song.<P>It was accidentally nerfed because a 51+ version was put in that was overpowered.  The correction for the 51+ version broke the lower version.<P>Currently, Chains can be expected to break anywhere from 0 to 9 seconds after application, with about a 30-60% resist rate.  It also doesn't always stop things.<P>A higher level problem is that bard armor is frequently made with chainmail AC (though it's usually corrected a few weeks later).  The new Velious armors are no exception--all the other Velious armors are same as Kunark armors, but with stats instead of spells, same or greater AC.  Bard Velious armor has less AC...and the stats aren't too impressive either (2 str 3 cha?).<P>Also, there are STILL no mid-level instruments.<P>A HUGE thing I've been pushing for is for enchanter haste and bard haste to stack better.  That would encourage the classes to group.  Bard hastes are puny compared to enchanter's.<P>If an Enchanter is in the group, the Enchanter takes over all the Bard's roles but can do a better job of them.  Mesmerize?  Enchanter.  Haste?  Heh, twice as fast.  Snare?  Bah, Bard snare doesn't work.  Clarity/C2 stack with Manasong, sure, but the party would be better off ditching the bard for a tank since the Enchanter outdoes the Bard in all ways.  Haste stacking would allow for cooperation there.<P>Also, check back on the guy in the Temple of Solusek Ro.  He says to ask him later about a special bardic weapon; he never responds.  It's been more than a year.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I have a few key problems with my class.  I think that for the most part we are great, and it is one of the more innovative things that EQ has.  However, a few things are pretty messed up at the moment.<P>I think the number one issue with bards is the whole stacking issue.<P>1.  Songs stack very oddly with spells.  If a spell and song can co exist with one another, then the spell should be castable while the song is on.<P>2.  Haste/Slow songs should stack with Haste/Slow spells and items.  This is a biggie.  The main thing a bard offers during the fight is these two things.   He can haste friends and slow mobs.  This is a great skill, but as you get higher in level, 90% of the time you are going to be grouped with either a shaman or a druid that will do it, and do it with MUCH greater success then us.  I dont think we should be as good as them, but we should be able to help with this.  If a chanter haste is 50% and our haste is 30%, then make the haste 65% so that atleast we are adding to the group.<P>Make haste stack (somewhat, I think if they just stacked that would be too powerfull), and I think you make bards perfectly balanced.  I would like to see our animations fixed (like those annoying flute drums), and I wouldnt mind at all seeing some mez resist reductions, but I think I can see a point in the fact that those skills become much less usefull in the later level.  But a bard should be able to help a group, even if there is a chanter or a shaman in the group, nothing like being a bard and becoming a mana & resist battery because you do no melee damage and everything you do is done better by the chanter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The MOST important focus of Verant's own review of bard tuning and balancing, must be to review the interaction of our song lines with other classes.<P>I think it's fair to say that most bards believe our mezzes have been toned down because of complaints from enchanters that they should be the masters of messmery. Well, they always have been. There have been points at which bards got a half-baked version of a mez that enchanters would a few levels later come along with a much better solution to. A better point would be that bard mezzes *interfere* with enchanter mezzes.<P>An essential part of the way the bard class was designed is that the bard would require great skill in choosing the blend of songs based on his or her group and situation. This is broken by having songs like lullaby which suddenly become restricted to only being useful between 12 and 25. These songs were intended to be in the bards repertoire throughout the rest of their career. The "nerfs" made to the bard mez line were badly done. We have so many other options that our ability do limited mez/crowd control in an emergency means we don't replace enchanters.<P>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm.<P>If I had to pick one thing for bards, it's this: When certain classes are in my group, I feel rather useless. Most notably, Enchanters and Shaman. Bards, at least as most I've talked to play them, and as I play mine, focus on two things, mesmerization, and haste/slow.<P>Mez, with an Enchanter, it's obvious. Thier mez and Haste both overshoot ours by a longshot, and they don't stack.<P>Same with Shaman, thier hastes and slows r00l ours as it were, and no stacking.<P>Overall, we need more stackability. I think Kaeria's post (as posted by NORBard) outlines a lot of the troubles with the Bard class. Thott also posted an interesting analysis of bard power curves which I am sure he will point out in his next post since I don't have the url handy.<P>But my request: More stackability. Make our current hastes stack, or move the Ervajs down about 10-20 levels and make a few more higher ones, or just make our current haste songs that we have stackable. Since the stack bug is gone, This would help a lot of groups who might not nessisarily have the 00ber haste items/FBSS/CoF/what have you.<P>Stackability issues in general suck too. I'd like to see any bard song stack with any other bard song. Ervaj's stack with Guard rythms. 2 hymns of restoration work to double regen (With 2 bards in a group of course).<P>Barring that, or heck, adding to that, better melee skills. Beyond 25 or so, our Melee just isn't there. I'd like to see our Parry and Riposte skills learnable sometime in the 30s or 40s, and possibly add a small double attack skill.<P>Or declare us a caster class and give us bind and gate, either way.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Of course, if I was being really wishy here, I'd ask for Tavern Teleport.... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So, from the outset, Absor feels bards are overpowered and must receive negative changes to balance them?  Has Absor played a Bard?  Has Absor actually played EQ with a Bard beyond level 12?  I would be interested to know at what point you feel you have a grasp on the class or the complication that comes with playing it?  The bottom line as to why the Bard is the most underplayed class is simply complication.  The fact that the class is so complicated the Designers and Testers (if the latter exists beyond the players) have so little clue on the class they do not test changes that directly effect the class before implementing them, in fact in most cases there is no clue on their part they are effecting the class.  This is overall, the number one issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now that I got that out... here are the three top "balance" issues that I see.<P>- Damage output.<BR>- Usefulness of songs post 50 most specifically the Velious songs.  It "unbalances" us by making us less useful than other classes in a group.<BR>- Usefulness on large raids.  We are "unbalanced" here also as we contribute little.  This relates to mana drains / damage output / shields /resists.<P>Someone at the concert hall said it well.  We can mix 3 songs at once given lag / latency.  Think of each of these three songs as taking ALL of our mana.  That will provide a starting point for perspective on balancing bards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello Absor, thank you for listening to us Bards again.  The main part of my post is about HOW Bards are considered balanced because we don't require mana for 95% of our songs...  I hope you can make heads & tails of this.<P>First though I want to have my say about Haste Stacking - Since there is a hard cap on haste anyway, what is the problem with our haste stacking with enchanter haste effects? All it does it help out guys like me who have never rolled on a FBSS because the Warrior in the group would benefit from it a lot more than I would.  The role of a Bard in a group with an enchanter is greatly reduced, and many many Bards hold this as the most important issue.  I can honestly see how you want to control haste to make encounters difficult, but doesn't the haste cap do that allready?  This same argument can be made for Attack Speed Debuff (SLOW) effects.  If there was a hard-capped minimum attack speed why shouldn't a Bard and a lower level Shaman/Enchanter be able to stack their Slows to equal a higher level Shaman/Enchanter spell?<P>Ok, on to my ideas...<P>Song Power vs Spell Power (hybrid vs caster). Spells in general are either High Power/Fast Acting or Low Power/Damage Over Time. Buffs/Debuffs of all other classes have a huge duration compared to Bard Songs, so doesn't it stand to reason that our song SHOULD be more powerfull to compensate? Examples: Druid Snare lasts a LONG time. Bard snare 3 ticks (in general). Why isn't the Bard snare more powerfull to comensate i.e. Less resistant, Higher slowdown, etc.. Enchanter Haste lasts a LONG time, Bard haste 3 ticks and is much inferior at any given level. Why? Just because they don't want Hybrids to cast equal to pure casters? Because we don't have 'mana'? BAH! Sure we don't have mana but we can only haste 6 people. Period. And only as long as we keep singing. Enchanter can haste a dozen people long before battle and med up.<P>Think of it this way. If people had the option of:<BR>A - 25% Haste lasting 1 hour.<BR>B - 50% Haste lasting 30 min.<BR>C - 75% Haste lasting 10 min.<BR>D - 100% Haste Lasting 1 min.<BR>E - 30% Haste Lasting 10 seconds. <BR>(values are made up for example)<P>Which would you choose? See the Bard option (approx. level 50 song) is completely out of whack on the duration/power scale? EQ is an all or nothing game, people go for the most power possible and would all want the 100% Haste lasting 1 min and have the caster re-cast as needed. How many battles are you in that last more than 10 mins without a break? Not talking UbberMobs here, regular day-to-day fighting.<P>EQ runs on the theory that "Time" is the balancing factor.  XP is gained at X rate via MOB's killed in a given time , Mana is restored at X rate of time allowing you to be ready to kill more mobs, fighters deal X amount of damage compared to other classes in the same given time, etc... The 'time-limitation' for casters is their mana, so Wizards can't 'Nuke' forever, while Necros COULD Dot forever if that is all they did.  The 'time-limitation' for Bards is the 3-second duration.  If Bard haste at any given level was exactly the same as Enchanter haste the Enchanter haste is STILL better because if the Bard dies, goes LD, is hit with LAG, the effect drops.  <P>What does this all mean?  Instead of balancing Bards based on the 'no-mana required' model, if you consider the power vs time/duration of effect you will see how we feel very underpowered even though 'on paper' it looks like we are balanced.  We want to be viable alternatives to having an Enchanter/Druid/Shaman in the group, just like everyone has been talking about having a viable alternative for healing other than a Cleric.  Our songs are limited by our requirement to stand there and continually sing them, don't make them inferior on top of that.<P>****<P>Just wanted to post my idea's on one other song too *grin*<P>Denon's Deperate Dirge!  On paper this song does look powerfull because it's AOE, but honestly any Bard that cast it on a group of 4 mobs at the level you get the song is Dead in 3 seconds.  My MAIN problem with this song is RESISTS.  Out of several DOZEN attempts to cast this song on blue mobs it has resisted every single time except ONCE, all it is good for is nuking snakes/rats to show off in newbie zones.  That is insane!  If you gave Wizards a 10,000 point damage spell and said they couldn't cast any other spell for 5 minuites and it would get resisted 90% of the time do you think anyone would ever mem it? (well, for 10k damage they might try it *grin*).  The suggestion I have heard and like the best is this:<P>Make Dirge a 12 second or so VERY Hard to Resist STUN. Leaving mana requirement the same as it is now.  THAT would really be usefull as a "Desperate Dirge"...  Huge Train, need to buy the druid time to cast Evac - Use Dirge!, Second mob spawned ontop of you and both enchanter and cleric are OOM - Use Dirge!  Things are going very bad and it's either everyone dies, or run to zone - Use Dirge!<P>Because of the huge re-cast time from using up all our mana, it wouldn't be unbalanced, but the resist rate would have to be small or it would be just as useless as the current Dirge.  Comparing this to Bruco's Bombastic Bellow (level 55 song), Dirge would have no damage effect and recast time would be 10 times longer (5-min for Bruco's compared to 40standing/80sitting mins for Dirge), but would be AOE and available at a much lower level.<P>Thank you for listening to my ideas.<BR>Eolyn Trueblood<BR>52nd Bard - CT Server  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok here are the minor and major problems I see facing bards.<P>                    1. Our drum looks like a flute... minor been around forever pisses me off just fix it<P>                    2. Song sticking. Raids, Lag, etc break twisting and u have to repeatedly click the song<BR>                    to get them working again.<P>                    3. Song instance creation at the same point that old instance fades erases both old and<BR>                    new instance of the song. Very very annoying when you're selo's cuts out while kiting a<BR>                    mob.<P>                    Major Problems<P>                    1. Bards are not affected by mana regen yet we have 2 songs that use mana. When we<BR>                    die we suffer<BR>                    a greater penalty on mana after being ressed than<BR>                    any other class. <P>                    suggested solutions. Make it so bards dont lose mana on res. Or make bards able to be<BR>                    affected by mana regen effects. or Raise bards meditate to a reasonable level at 58 it<BR>                    takes forever for me to regain mana.<P>                    Long memorization for songs<BR>                    Please explain why bards take so much longer than casters to mem songs. I would<BR>                    appreciate smaller memorization times (this might be a small issue)<P>                    Level caps on charm and mez.<P>                    This is bogus I dont wish to charm gods but I would like to charm mobs 7 levels lower<BR>                    than me. Can you put in a hard cap at the bards level instead of at 51 and make dragon<BR>                    level mobs immune to charm regardless of level. Also bards should be able to mez any<BR>                    non boss mob of = or lower level. Fighting mobs past 54 a bard looses much of his utility<BR>                    in a group and this makes me quite upset. <P>                    Skill caps on defensive skills<P>                    I finally have parry and riposte and they are great, but they come too late and are not<BR>                    at a high enough level. I would suggest putting parry in at 40 and riposte at 50 and cap<BR>                    them at 75. Add 3 points to each one till you get 105 at level 60. This is not a huge<BR>                    boost but it allows bards to take some damage against uber mobs, and since they have<BR>                    passing knowledge of fighters mainly for use in defense I think this makes sense. I would<BR>                    also like to see dodge capping at the same level as a rogue. Right now bards are the<BR>                    worst hybrid tanks, and these changes wouldn't shift the balance between the classses<BR>                    significantly.<P>                    Epic Quest<BR>                    The entire bard epic is great up to the point where we have to kill 3 dragons. I dont<BR>                    believe any other class has to do this in addition to everything else we do. Also we must<BR>                    compete with paladins and warriors, (possibly others) for a shot at the scales. At least<BR>                    give us something unique. The real problem with the quest though is trak guts. This item<BR>                    has to be dropped more. Trak should have this item almost everytime... Considering all<BR>                    that bards have to do it is horribly unfair for one to drop every few months. I have killed<BR>                    trak several times and never seen his guts. Getting the epic should be about skill in<BR>                    defeating the encounter not about farming a mob forever in the hopes of getting lucky<BR>                    enough to get a drop.<P>                    Song stacking<P>                    You simply need to fix the stacking problem. I hate having to constantly stop cantina for<BR>                    clarity or regen songs. I hate playing level 50 song and having the enc wonder why sos<BR>                    isn't sticking. Quite simply make it so bard songs dont prevent songs from being casted,<BR>                    and prevent a slower bard haste effect from ruining a better haste effect. <P>                    Suggested Improvements<P>                    Bard Instruments<P>                    We need more instruments that are magical and more weapons that double as<BR>                    instruments. The whisteling sword type ideas. <P>                    Singing Steel Armor<P>                    Quite frankly there are only 2 good pieces the bracer and the gauntlets. These effects<BR>                    have a use. None of the other effects have any use at all. Summon stuff I have forage.<BR>                    Eye of zoom who are you kiding. And I can heal the whole group for more than the bp<BR>                    heals 1 in its casting time. <P>                    Some suggested solutions are to replace the dumb effects with stats esp charisma<BR>                    dexterity and strength. Or to replace them with useful effects.<BR>                    Certain human bards would love an infravision effect. A levitate effect would not be<BR>                    unbalancing. And a self only sow effect call it spirit of song but it does the same thing.<BR>                    Would be useful. Also a regen effect that stacked with all other regen effects would be<BR>                    nice for the bp. Or a permenant cantina effect would be nice if set to the level of the<BR>                    best lute. The legs would be good with spirit of music. The other idea will probably be<BR>                    less popular but an inn teleport item would be a great addition to the bardic class. Other<BR>                    useful effects would be a haste that is stackable with all other hastes. Or and item that<BR>                    gives everyone in your group +5 to all stats. Basically dumb little effects are no where<BR>                    near as good as a clerics bp that CH's bards help the group by singing song give them<BR>                    items that help their group or sing songs for them<P>                    The other thing I would like to see is a higher picklock skill for bards over level 50. And a<BR>                    musical discipline that would allow songs to last for a tick or two longer allowing the bard<BR>                    to do mighty 5-6 song twists. <P>                    Or perhaps post 50 putting in a skill called resonance that would increase the duration of<BR>                    all bard songs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First I should fess up I put my Bard into semi-retirment at level 17 because I was disatisfied with the class.  My concerns are mainly about low level Bards, but I also began to realize that the class wasn't shaping up in line with my expectations.<P>I expected Bards to be extremely party oriented, and to provide major benefits to members of their part with inspiring buffing songs.  I also expected them to be fairly effective in hand to hand combat.  From what I can tell, those expectations are wrong.  Bards are actually skilled at running real fast, and are excellent at kiting.  Kiting is boring! That's largely why I stopped playing my bard.<P>I would like to see Bards be more effective in groups, especially at low levels.  I understand that at high levels, they are very in demand for things such as the level 32 mana song.  At low levels, though, they have little to offer.  A party buffing song in the teens which stacks with Chant of Battle or Anthem de Arms, especially if it was percussion based, would help reorient the class towards group friendly skills.<P>The other major Bard problem is that they over agro like crazy!! Even when a Bard is trying to hang in the background, all of the mobs love to head for the Bard.  Contrast this to other casters who buff BEFORE combat, and thus take no agro from their buffs, and the Bard suffers from an often fatal embarassment.  Hey, can all of our voices really be that bad?  Sure, Chords Of Dissonance or other songs that directly attack a mob should irritate the mob, and I understand why heals irritate mobs, but buffing songs shouldn't.  I would recomend either reducing the agro effect of Bard songs, especially Buffs, or giving the Bard a low level song that reduces agro on those in range.  Wouldn't it make sense to give the Bard music to soothe the savage beast?  I would rather twist two beneficial songs and an agro reducer than to try and twist three beneficial songs while trying to avoid being pounded into dust by all the mobs my party is fighting.<P>Finally, I would suggest that Bard's should be given somewhat more leeway in inspiring their party.  For several reasons, the effect of positive songs don't always get to the apropriate targets.  Bard songs should buff the pets of party members.  For example, if a 17 mage and a 17 bard are in a group, there is little benefit in boosting the mage's strength, but if you can boost the pet's strength you are accomplishing something!  Also, increasing the effective radius of beneficial songs would be great, both on the battlefield and especially for movement related songs like sellos, levitation, and invisibility.<P>Bards are pathetic in melee, it seems to me they are much more caster than warrior, and in this are different from the other hybrids.  This is fine, but the low levels are very tough for a Bard.  More usefull songs earlier in the roster would help.<P>Absor, there seems to be a greater interest in balancing higher level characters, but I think there are some serious low and mid level issues with this class.  Does Verant keep statistics on what characters are being played, and what level they are?  If so, I suspect they will reveal a lot of potential Bards get discouraged in their teens.  And please, while it is certainly powerful to be able to run in circles around monsters while the monsters drop dead, is this really the vision for Bards?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bugs:<P>. In a sizeable fight, bard charm generally leads to mobs agro'd on the group. Much of the time this happens the bard will be unable to issue /pet commands to the pet; the group will be unable to defend against it, and necro or mage pets will begin to attack the bard, often refusing to respond to /pet commands themselves.<P>. Stick songs: 100ms or so of lag is enough to put the songs into a situation where one song is stuck casting, but the spell icons go back to "nothing happening". When you start singing another song, the normal cycle goes thru until the end of the tick (3s roughly) at which point your new selection simply stops and the "stuck song" casts itself. This can be hard to spot in a big fight. The solution, currently, is to type /stopsong and hit another song icon until you get "not recovered yet".<P>. When a bard stops singing, people see "%t's song ends". TWICE.<P>. Selo's Song of Travel doesn't sink as fast as other levitates, enabling bards to get themselves up into places they shouldn't.<P>. Neither bard levitate gives actual warning that you are about to fall. It used to spam everyone in the group with about to fall warnings which made them useless. They were removed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all, my background in the game comes mostly from grouping as a bard, and in comparison to playing an enchanter.  I'm  L50, and basically have stopped leveling in order to get a Vox scale (see #6).  I doubt there is anyone in the game that "dislikes" grouping with a bard (they're all crack hoes)... but in the end, when you weigh getting a bard against a cleric, a druid, a wizard, or an enchanter... the answer comes up as "sorry we don't have room".  I also doubt that I have ever heard any other classes "Gee... bards are uber and need to be nerfed!!!" (Which can be said for most other classes in a lot of situations). If we're supposed to be the "ultimate group oriented class", why the hell are people only falling all over themselves to group with ONLY on big raids as a mana pimp?<P>I have 4 main problems with this class, and a few other minor ones.<P>1)    Everquest's contribution to the increase in carpel tunnel syndrome in the US.  If anyone has played a bard, or hell, even knows a bard... they know that it is physically uncomfortable to weave songs for long periods of time.  When I weave songs, in the span of 10 seconds, I will hit a button at LEAST 6 times (plus fizzles). Typically spellcasters hit a button every 3-5 seconds and med for long periods of time. A tank will hit attack, maybe cast a few spells if they're a hybrid, but they hit bash every 5 or so seconds, then rest/pull between battles.  Bards on the other hand have to weave 3-4 songs from the minute they log on till the minute they log off... never stopping.  I will give you some examples why bards HAVE to weave songs:<BR>    Mana song -    A bard not weaving will give 13 mana per 6 second period.  A bard that weaves will get 2 pulses of 13 mana per 6 second period. By weaving, you just doubled you effectiveness.<BR>    Group based songs -  A bard using his drum will add +60 to all resists (or something like that), lasting 18 seconds. If he weaves, he can also do verses, +30% speed AND guardian for +60 or so MR.  Sitting there = +60 all resists compared to weaving = +60 all resits +30% attack speeds +60 additional MR.<BR>    Soloing - Post L30, it is IMPOSSIBLE to beat a mob without weaving. I mean impossible. Yes, you can not do it, you will not past go, you will not collect $200, you go directly to your bind point. Weaving, you can at least do selos + chant of frost + chant of flame to kite. Weaving you can melee with verses + the 2 dots. Weavin you can melee + verses + heal song + sing 80s showtunes.<BR>	My point? You are required to weave as a bard, and if nothing else, PLEASE HELP MY ARM!!!!!<BR>The second concern I have regarding weaving is the fact that IF YOU ARE A BARD, YOU MUST BUY A SIDEWINDER. Yes... you can weave for 8 hour sessions then can't fall asleep at night due to the pain in your arm, or you buy a sidewinder.  This $30 investment allows me to hold down 1 button and weave 4 songs at once... better than I can without it, and it aleviates all my pain.  Why is Verant REQUIRING me to buy the joystick?  (Will discuss this in #2 further).<BR>              Also, I have to add, that most GOOD bards, can swap weapons and instruments in and out as they sing. Now, unless you've done this for a 2+ hour period of time, you have absolutely NO CLUE on how annoying this is. <P>    Possible solutions to this problem - <BR>     A) I can stop weaving... and reduce my singing effectiveness to 1/3 of what it was.<BR>     B) Make it so weaving is not required.  I'm not sure if it's possible with Everquest, but it would be very nice if we could sing 3 songs at once. IE I can fire up verses, hymn, and nivs, and they repeat one after another so that I keep the 3 buffs up constantly.  This would require some sort of code or the creation of some sort of macro. This may be very difficult to do, or it might have be very easy. <BR>    C) Take out the 3 second "lag" between when a song goes into effect and my song finishes. This would allow bards to take a break while they sing mana song at the very least.  It would make simply singing a song as effective as weaving the same song over and over (which typically is done during all down time between fights, and even during a lot of battles).  I personally think this is the best option and the easiest to implement probably. <BR>   D) All us to equip multiple instruments so we don't have to swap. If we have a lute in one hand, let us put a drum or something in the other. Hell, let us pop one into our range slot too. It wouldn't be that imbalancing, besides for the newbies who don't swap stuff back and forth.  This is honestly removing the "twitch factor".<P>2)   A crapy bard sitting at his keyboard is about as effective as any bard being AFK.  With my sidewinder, I am more effective using the joystick and watching TV, than actually sitting there watching what I do.  So what is my complaint? I want to play this game, and my class is forcing me to NOT play the game so I can be better at the game. It is like the soloing vs grouping issue that was happening, in order to maximize my efficiency, people had to solo. In order to maximize my efficiency in a group, I have to watch TV. : P  This is really a hard thing to fix.  Bards by the nature of their class are singing to help everyone else in the group, but bards realy don't have much of an opportunity to watch the environment.  See #4 regarding not having to crowd control.  During a fight, tanks are always bashing, taunting, casting spells against stuff, watching their own lives. Casters are nuking, healing others, debuffing, or medding.  What do we do? Hit "a" and hold down a button ona  joystick... then go back to watching britney spears' new video.   I have often heard clerics complain "Oh all we do is sit and med, then get up and cast heal once in a while." Yeah, well try being a bard where all you do is hold down one button, and click another... never paying attention to anything that's going on.<P>      Possible solutions to this problem -<BR>    A) Fix the pains in my left arm.  Can we order some arm braces from the online store or something?<BR>    B) Make us more effective in combat (see #3). Give us some stuff to do!!! Make us more proactive during battle!<BR>    C) BACKSTAB!!! WOOT!!!  Even a 50 skill in it would be nice. ; ) <BR>    D) Let us hide AND sneak at the same time. It would let us scout out for the puller and such. Would be nice to ditch the mages begging for mana once in a while. <P><BR>3) Our combat abilities are just rediculas.  First of all, my L50 enchanter had as much HP as my L50 bard, not to mention he could tank for a hell of a lot longer because he could stun.  How are we a hybrid, when a L25 warrior has more hp than a L50 bard?  Wearing full plate is nice and all, but even with 900 AC, my 1200 HP (without symbol) isn't going to last long against ANYTHING in sebilis (where I hunt).  I'm not asking for 5k life, but I just think MAYBE we should have a couple more HP than a wizard? : P   I'm not necessarily saying we need moe defense, but Bards are by far the worst defense tank type. Rangers with their bark armor easily have more AC than a bard wearing full plate (not to mention the HP).   <BR>     I don't think there is a single other class that would complain that Bards are too good at offense.  While I may say our defense sucks.... it could be worse.  I will say that our offense is pathetic... and no bard will disagree with me.  A pure melee monk or rogue probably deals 5x more damage than a bard.  Hell, I would say that paladins and sks can WAYYYY more damage than us. I know one of the hybrids have to be the worst at everything, but why do we have to be comprable to pets 20 levels below us?  Add our crapy melee skills to the fact that most bards swap instruments in and out, and you end up with someone who melees just because he's going to die of boredom!  <BR>     While we are not intended to melee as well as a tank, we ARE hybrids, and let the warrior out of us!!!<BR>  <BR>      Possible solutions to this problem -<BR>   A) Give us some creatine. Let us bulk up some and get some HP.  I know this is a huge complaint of other hybrids (especially rangers)<BR>   B) Give us double attack.  (I thought I'd try).  Cap it at 50 or 100, or 250... any extra damage would be nice. Bards have a limited selection of weapons, and even more limited melee ability. I think everyone can agree that double attack is better than dual wield... all classes who get dual wield get double attack, EXCEPT bards.<BR>   C) Give us some skill that we can use during combat that can amplify our melee damage or something. Most hybrids get kick and/or bash as well as double attack. Rogues get Backstab. Monks get Kick. Bards get double attack, oh wait, we don't even get that.  I would definitely give up all my rogue skills for backstab.  Hell, give us the Carebare Stare, which adds 50 points of "love" damage every second. ; )<BR>  D) Give us double attack... err did I mention that already? Come on man!<P>4) At L50, our bard "jack of all trades, master of none" becomes "has a lot of worthless garbage, and sings mana and resist songs".  Post L50, almost every melee will have an enchanter speed buff and an item. What does that mean? Or speed songs which are so great become pretty useless since most melees are already at the cap, not to mention other classes' buffs are FAR superior than our songs.  Our charm and mezzes get resisted A LOT (have you heard of L55+ enchanters complaining about their inability to crowd control? Well imagine how effective an enchanter in plate armor with 1/4th the ability is).  Pre-50, we make a good replacement for an enchanter (and often used as one), post 50 in kunark, where root is often more effective than mez, we just suck. Our 30 damage a tick dots aren't going to do jack to mobs with 10k life. What're we left with? Good old mana and resist song!!!!  Of course, it just HAPPENS to be that we do those 2 skills better than anyone else, but we signed up to be a jack of ALL trades.  Personally, I think this is probably the easiest ot solve problem.  Everyone else has a role in the group, ours just is the most limited and the first to get cut. While DA song and all that is nice, none of the stuff makes a group of 55+ go "Gee, we NEED a bard!"  Some of these are "vision" problems, and technical problems... but anything would help.  Compare a L50 enchanter to a L50 bard. Bard is used for resists, mana, and attack songs. Aug blows our attack songs away (or hell sltw). Clarity is close to as good as mana song. GRM is often better than our resist songs. Not to mention and enchanter can crowd control, nuke, and has a pet. We can double attack for 4 damage per round. : P<P>       Possible solutions,  to this problem -<BR>   A)  Increase our offense buff songs to include larger bonuses to attack, str, dex, or what not.  We need some uber attack buffs.  I would even like to see something like "Ode of Omnipotence", which gives the target 50% attack speed increase (above cap), +50 str, +50 dex, +100 attack  while you sing the song. <BR>   B)  AOE BUFF SPELLS!!!!!! Maybe all PCs in the area get a bonus, however small. It'd realy really rock on raids to get a bard singing this, and give 30 people a 10% speed buff and +15 str and dex or something. <BR>   C)  Better nukes/dots.  We are one of the least damaging classes at high levels. <BR>   D) Make our mezzing OR charming a lot more effective. I tried mezzing in poh last night... 20 attempts, 1 success (5th try on 1 mob).  It would definitely help us wake up during battles.  Some people think we may start replacing enchanters if that happens.... are you kidding? Bards can ONLY mez 3 mobs (Weaving) with 0 resists. Considering the average krapnor mob resists 50% of the time, I really can't mez more than 2 mobs.  My L54 enchanter's mezzed 12 mobs in sebilis before... for 3-4 minutes (we killed 8-9 then evaced due to me being oom).  Compared to an enchanter, our crowd controlling abilities are like comparing our melee potential to a rogue. : P This would also help with #2.<P>5) Charm bug!!!! Charm, at least bard charm, has some serious bugs with it. I can easily show you how I could use it to pk people... and have offered to in game. Basically, bard charm VERY OFTEN goes into "effect", IE you get the message, and you can't charm anything else, but you have no real control over the creature.  The problem is that your pet will not attack you, but frequently attacks your other party members, and of course, your other party members can't effect your pet and you can't control it.  It is one of the most annoying bugs I've encountered, and it isn't being fixed.  The only way I can think of now to get this bug fixed, is to exploit it to kill people, or post the exact method of duplicating it. (Which I'd rather not do...)  I'm sick of my charm not working like it should, and causing serious problems whenever I use it (and a big reason why I don't use it). <BR>       Possible solutions,  to this problem -<BR>    A) Maybe fixing this bug?<P>6)  Our uber weapon quest.  Why do we basically have a level limit on our quest?  Right now I'm L50, and been so for a number of weeks (it took me 5 weeks to hit L46, give me a break, I'm on a new server). I refuse to go past L52 untill I get my white dragon scale.  I've been on 2 successful vox raids, and 3 unsuccessful ones (with 5 failed attempts). She hasn't dropped the scale. As my guild gets higher in level, we will stop doing Vox.  Most bards that I've talked to that are L50+ say that you should wait at L52 and get the vox scale before you think about leveling further. Why? Because the only other place to get the scale is to kill Gorenaire (white dragon in Dreadlands).  I'm sure verant knows the difficulty of him. He's basically impossible to do without 30 L60s, with the right classes. You need the firepower to be able to clean VP in order to do this dragon.  So, I'm left with a dilema... I can level up, group with friends, and wait 6-8+ months to ATTEMPT Gorenaire, or I can sit at L52 untill I get my scale.  The worst part of it is that as a server gets older, it's harder and harder to kill vox. Why? Because all the best players are well past L52. It gets harder to get the "right balance" of classes to fight vox. And worst of all, you start having to take a bunch of newbies to kill her.  We already have to kill Trak... and that's supposed to be our "uber mob" that we have to kill (and keep in mind that his guts are a rare drop).  Oh, I'm sorry, it gets worse than that. The white dragon scale provides THE BEST caster pre-velious cloak. Hello? Why not require a tooth or something, or a book like the pallies?  Also, if you are doing Vox with your MAIN, at L50, not many L50s are even considering their uber quests... and for them to pass up giving something HERE AND NOW, for someone to MAYBE get an item 3+ MONTHS from now is ludicrous. The rest of the quest is long, annoying, and boring... but it's doable.  The red scale has the same problem, but to a much lesser extent due to the fact that the red dragonscale vest isn't great, and the alternative to naggy, Fedaydar is a joke. He's considered easier than naggy, pops more often, and doesn't require the 1-3 hours of clearing FGs. (And I think the cleric uber naggy clone drops scales too).  I'm not asking for the white scale to become as easy (relative to it's current state) as the red... but I realy doubt the genius that came up with this part of the quest really thought it through. We have our uber mob to kill, Trak, why require us to kill gorenaire and fedaydar?<P>     Possible solutions to this problem - <BR>  A) Change the White Dragon Scale, to White Dragon Tongue, and have it drop off gorenaire and vox. Will fix the alternate use issue.<BR>  B) Put a mini quest on Gorenaire (he is after all non-KoS) that lets us quest for a scale. (And giving me a "have you tried such and such..." isn't going to work) : P<BR>  C) Change the item require to "broken scales" and have them lying around vox and naggy's layer.<BR>  D) Put a "A White Dragonscale Piece" on the priest of nagafen, and the red equivalent on Magi Rolki. <BR>  E) Increase the drop rate on white dragon scales.<BR>  F) Let L53-L60 bards go on vox raids. (Our function on those raids are to do resist song... a L60 bard isn't that much more effective than having a L50).<BR>  G) Make Gorenaire easier to kill.<P>I know these quests aren't supposed to be easy... but forcing us to remain low level just sucks. I haven't heard one person say this quest was "easy" or want to nerf it.  You know what the saddest part about the weapon is? Compared to most other uber weapons for support classes, ours doesn't help on raids. : P<P>7) Our singing steel armor is a joke.  Has anyone actually used ANY of the effects EVER?!??! Warriors get strength, shrink, and other stuff they might actually USE. I won't even mention clerics.  Why does our suck so bad?  All the kunark uber class armor has high AC, some stats, and a decent effect. Is ours the ghetto one? I know we gotta be the crappiest melee, and the crappiest caster t ype... but why do we have to be the crappiest armored as well?<P>      Possible solutions to this problem - <BR>  A) Give us some spells that are USEFUL. Something that isn't "overpowering", but rather is helpful. We are a jack of all trades after all, give us some abilities we don't already have.  Having Gate on the breastplate would be nice... even if it had a 60 second casting time.  Now THAT is a useful effect. 7 classes already get it... why not let some L55+ bards have it? We definitely are NOT a melee class... <BR>  B) Summon food? Why not let us have a self only bind which we can cast in a city? That's more damn useful. : P   <BR>  C) SoW on the boots? We already have a WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY more faster song... least we could cast it on some newbies wantin to do a CR. Then again, what could this replace? Summon water? Put a 10-20 sec casting time to make it so that we only bother with it when we don't have a shamy/druid/ranger.<BR>  D) Any number of spells that MIGHT be VAGUELY useful. : P  Regen, Invis, breeze, or  few hundred damage nuke ... anything to cut down on the number of songs we gotta keep up.  The only one that is realy useful occasionally is endure breath... and maybe the DS. <P><BR>8) "Look Ma... I'm on speed!" I have to try and end this on a positive note. I love selos. It is so damn fun to rip by those druids with their sow.   When the drum thing was broken a couple weeks ago, it was honestly DEPRESSING to play my bard (and I barely did).  I think the L51 song is cool and all, but the problem I have is that when I rip by people, I am floating... and invis.  Meaning, I can't go "WEEEEEEEEE" as I run by. : )  Also, by L50, you know, you really want to break the sound barrier... selos even gets kinda slow. : )<P>Possible solutions to this problem - <BR>  A) Give us a L60  selos that goes double the speed, requires a drum, and of course, only works outdoors. Would be sweet.  It'd also be nice if every time you passed someone, it went "beep beep".<BR>  B) Give us some nitros... I NEED TO GO FASTER!!!!!! NOW!!!!! GIMME!!! SPEED!!!! FASTER!!!<BR>  C) Let PCs see through L51 song!!! Most NPCs can anyway.... might as well show off some. : P<P>9) I had a few other ideas that I thought were cool, and maybe should be considered to be added to the bard class. -<BR>       A) Shrink/enlarge song. Should last as long as our song... which would rock if we could make ourselves HUGE and run around with selos scaring the hell out of people. : )    Of course, it wouldn't be permanent... thus wouldn't infringe on shamies.<BR>       B) We want a /sing  command, something like /say for bards only. Hell, make it like /ooc. : )    /sing I'm too sexy for my singin' steel, too sexy for my imbrued... oh so sexy it HURTS!!!! I'm a bardy, you know what I mean, I do my little songs on naggy's corpse...<BR>       C) I want a song that makes other people dance around similar to when we use our wind instrument. Non group members especially!!! DANCE GNOME!!! MWAHAHAHHA. Ok sorry.<BR>       D) Bard pets. We want a parrot that sings and talks to us. Now... or I cancel my account. : P  Hell, give us a singing monkey or something. Anything works... just has to follow us around and sing.  Also, if it made fun of the mobs you were fighting, and commented on how nice you looked in your armor, that'd be great too.<BR>      E) Quad 950s! Err nm.<P>That's pretty much it from me. Hopefully we can get some of our issues cleared up.  I do think thott's analysis clears a lot of it up. One thing you will realize quickly is the exponential difference between bards and all the other classes. At L20 we are a jack of all trades... at L50+ we're simply the master of none.<P>-Cueller Omnipotence<BR>L50 bard on Tholuxe Paells<BR>&lt;Ashes of Eternity&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's been quite a bit of discussion at the Concert Hall - the most active bard forum to date. The list above posted by NOR Bard and authored by Kaeria seems to be as close to a consensus as you're going to see concerning the primary bard issues.<P>I'm a little concerned about you starting this discussion off with the hint a nerf. As another poster pointed out, this class is "the red-headed step child" and it seems strange to me that you'd spend time and effort degrading it when there are so very many things about it that are just out of whack or overlooked or "broken as intended", etc.<P>Thanks in advance for taking a look at our concerns, Absor. I'm looking forward to seeing what's in store for bards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The number one problem with bards is that they just aren't goofy enough.  Pick up a dungeons and dragons players handbook and look at the bard pictures.  They look ridiculous, just as a fantasy bard should.  We're talking pink velvet hat with a nice feather in it.  Think of Sir Robin's minstrels in the Quest for the Holy Grail.  This is what bards should be like.<P>In EQ, they are just too cool looking.  In lambent they have what is probably the nicest looking armor in the game.  This is just wrong.  Please nerf bard gear to make them look silly, thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  I HATE MY INSTRUMENT SKILLS!  I don't think this is so much a balance issue as it is just annoying, but in order to max out my instrament skills post 35, I have to sit in a corner and sing for 2 + hours PER SKILL.  Now, I hate to gripe, and I really don't want to seem rude, but let me be quite clear on this.  I don't pay 10$ a month to park my character for 8 hours every time he levels.  And I am not even going to begin to explain my frustration with melee skills.  Like many bards, I have devoted a good ammount of my equipment to buffing my cha.  Now, it has worked well for me, but not nearly so well as buffing str works for other hybrids, or buffing int, or a mix of the 2.<BR>    Why then, would I buff cha?  Because it is bard like.  Bards make their livings (speaking from an rp perspective) from being able to ammuse and entertain.  It could also be argued that charisma is more important to a musician than his playing skill (dex).<BR>    What I suggest is this, give bards a GOOD reason to buff cha, which by the way, is a hard stat to get up there.  <P>1.  Change our instrament skills to Cha based skill gain.<P>2.  Base our mana off of cha.<P>3.  Make cha have a greater effect on our mind affecting songs.<P>4.  and finally make Cha have a higher influence on our fizzle rates.<P>This would at least give us more incentive to develope a stat that, as it stands, is really only good for mez and charm.  While this may be good for enchanters who get a ton of these types of spells, these only represent a small portion of the bard arsenal.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, please take the time to read the extensive post from Kaearia listed above.  The bards at the concert hall (www.attcanada.net/~reaper) have been discussing these issues for some time now.  Also, Thott of Afterlife seems to have your ear, and he has some good things to say as well.<P>I have only a few things to add myself, as a level 51 bard who has played since beta 4.<P>Please fix the duration of Chains (23) and Binding (51).  The duration of Snare type spells is set; I doubt that giving these songs a set duration would be unbalancing.<P>Singing Steel armor effects need some work.  I would suggest that the same mechanism used for the Breath of Harmony's effect (an instant cast of our level 48 Niv's Melody of Preservation) be used.  <P>If the SS Arms were changed to the effect of our level 3 Jig of Vigor, with the same instant cast time as the Breath of Harmony, they would indeed be useful.  As for the Breastplate, I think replacing the self-only heal with a right clickable instant cast Cantana of Soothing (level 34 song) would be appropriate.<P>Short and sweet, but hopefully you will consider these thoughts.

</FONT><HR>&lt;snip&gt;As a non-Bard I would like to see that Bard song icons appear at the bottom of the spell buff list. It's sort of annoying to group with a bard and than stop and have your buffs have a bunch of holes in them. I know it's not too important, but it would be nice if I could keep my buffs in order while grouped with a Bard.&lt;snip&gt;<P>While I can understand this want, it's actually useful on some occasions to have the bard buffs first.  Take Naggy with the AE Dispell for instance.  Wouldn't you rather have the Bard buff be dispelled (one that will be refreshed in a few seconds anyway) than the Symbol of Naltron your cleric blow 10 pp on?<P>Absor,<P>Please take a look at the Bard Epic Quest. Let me first state that I have no problems with Epic Quests being difficult.  I expect them to be.  But, there's a disparity in the Bard Epic Quest that's not found for other classes.<P>The 3 "Big" items we need for our Epic are a Red Dragon Scale, a White Dragon Scale and Trakanon Guts.  The 2 scales can be completed fairly easily at levels 45-52.  Once a Bard reaches 53, you have placed an alternative to Red Dragon Scale by placing an alternative spawn to Naggy (Ragefire) for the Cleric Epic Quest.  This solves the problem of a huge increase in difficulty between Naggy and Talendor (although Talendor is one of the easier Kunark Dragons).  You didn't place an alternative to Vox other than Goranaire.  Currently, the way Gor works, you pretty much have to be 58+ to be able to kill her.  This leaves all Bards who have reached 53 without getting a scale out of a chance at their epic until they reach much higher levels or trade for the Scale.<P>It is nice to be able to trade for the scale, but we should not be forced to wait around for a trade to happen, we should have the options (at ALL levels) to be able to go get it ourselves.<P>If the Epic Weapons were implemented before Kunark, I wouldn't have a problem with the current setup.  Every Bard would make a choice a) level up and take chances on a trade/goranaire or b) don't level until white scale is attained.  But, some of us were already 53 or higher before the Epic Quest imposed this level restriction on us.  We were not given a choice for doing it the easy way (Vox) or the hard way (Goranaire).<P>Possible suggestions for a resolution:<P>1. Add a Dragon in Velious that drops ONLY a white scale that's in similar power to Ragefire.  Possibly flag this scale as being only usable for the Bard Epic if you don't want to increase the rate of White Dragonscale Cloaks.<P>2. Add a triggered spawn in Permafrost that's similar to Ragefire.  Make this require EXTRA STEPS in the Bard Epic Quest to attain the items to trigger the Vox Clone.. make the quest doable for a level 53 player.  Give this dragon Vox loot, or even just the White Scale as mentioned above.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
