</FONT><HR>Don't get upset that we are not on the test server yet guys.  This class is messed up BAD.  I think Verant's problem is they are looking at it in terms of numbers...how much mana we have and the maximum amount of damage we COULD POTENTIALLY dish out.  And yes, at 49 Ice Comet is a big nuke, just looking at the numbers, but even against regular mobs, Spirocs for instance, it gets resisted or ,more commonly, partially resisted.<P>Right now, I have 2366 Mana.  Ice Comet hits for 1120 and costs 400 Mana.  That means, under the most ideal of circumstances I could potentially do 6,720 damage with it on a full burn and with C2 picking up the extra 34 mana I'd be missing from the mana I have available to start.<P>But let's be realistic.  Can I actually ever do 6,720 damage with that?  Maybe, but really doubtfull.  Even at L52 I still get fizzles on my spells regardless of the level of the spell.  Considering partial resists, fizzles, full resists, etc., there really is no way I'd achieve that ideal on a regular basis.  And this is against non planes mobs well below 50.<P>Now for Planes mobs, it get's so much worse.  I have easilly burned all my mana out on some mobs in Planes and not done even 200 damage.  Yes I know some are more resistant, but still.  This isn't commonly what we do though.  When we get OOM, we are worthless.  So we sit and med, nuke, sit and med, and maybe nuke once more.  Total damage per mob under these circumstances at 52?  1280 with Lure of frost.  4,480 would be the total without any resists on a full burn.  Less than Ice Comet, but fewer resists.<P>So if we had more mana we could just nuke and nuke and nuke, right?  No.  Our nukes have to be timed very well or we will aggro the mob, be summoned, and killed.  This is the same for all caster classes though.<P>However, as Wizards, we have no other use BUT to nuke.  All other casters have something that they can do outside of Direct Damage that let's them be an asset to the group, and not just some little bit of damage to finish off a mob.  <P>1120 may seem huge when you are a young Wizard working towards that, but the closer you get to it, you realize that it's just not all that.  I can do full damage on some mobs and not even be noticed.   When I was in my teens and 20's people were impressed!  Not anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To knall about enstill..<P>Enstill is not an upgrade to root.  Root and enstill are quite different where root, immobilize, and paralyzing earth are made to hold a mob down and let you nuke it a couple times maybe (although they arent very reliable).  Enstill is still in the root line but it works different, it is used to hold a mob if you arent interested in casting on it.  So if you are wanting the mob to just stay put, enstill does that better, but if you cast on that mob it will most likely break.. works good when you got to stick and run away, or when you need to hold a mob for an emergengy med..<P>Arkaan 45th Wiz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>the facts are that our class for the lack of a better sucks. the entire game is based on grouping. tanks are the foundation of the group. all other classes aid the group in some special way. all except wizards we can only do damage, but so can ever other class. the easy way to show how our frekin clas is so totally broken is that it takes takes at least 2 of the other healing classes to replace a cleric, or that a 40 cleric can do as good a job healing as a 50 druid, yet a wizard and his "speciality" damage can be easily replaced and improved upon by a monk, rogue, mage,nerco, warrior, druid and a cleric if u are fighting undead. the class is totally broken its a simple as that, it may function we have some solo abilites provided that u have the jboots or a pet druid and are above level 29 but within the context of the game and the class's intended purpose we are broken period.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizards, hrmmm.... close topic for me.  I have been playing a wizard since release (and as a casual player also, only level 31 after 3 years).  I think I am qualified to answer to some of our concerns.<P>When we were all pre-kunark, Wizards were THE premier class for damage.  The only class to break the 3 digit barrier (ice comet).  Now with Kunark and velious out, VI has answered most of the other classes rants about not being able to do damage.  Thus, we now have every other primary casting class doing 90% the damage of wizards.  Is this to say that I think wizards need another digit to their damge line (over 10k hp spells for those of you that arent following me)?  No. Here is what I propose.<P>1)  The first main problem with our class is identity.  We used to be the undisputed masters of damage (atleast in DD).  Back then, we didnt care that we couldnt summon, buff, debuff or heal.  We didnt care that our sight utility line was a joke and our gate/port line was more then bested by druids<BR>( many more ports with most going to better places. Hell, there aren't even any druids in Ak'Anon but they get a gate there when wizards dont).  Now that Kunark and the new levels are out and most casting classes break the 1000hp damage barrier (and the gap with most classes has closed with the<BR>wizard), we are no longer the master of damage.  Ok, fast damage then.  Maybe, but most wizards dispute this.  I am not there yet but I see some validity in their arguments.  How to solve this....  Wizards need an Identity again, and this time, dont crush it by making everyone as good as wizards at<BR>it....  some thoughts....<P>a)  make us masters of damage again.  Give us alot more mana or mana regen that is far superior to any other casting class so that we can nuke again.  Me personally, I am not for this one.  It would unbalance the game.  Maybe a good solution here is to cut down the recast time on harvest (even if it<BR>was 2 mins, I couldnt chain cast it and DD's).  Lower it to something like 3-5 mins and make it availiable at lower levels.  Just a thought.<P>b)  give us more defense (keeping with the original identity).  Should we be tanks?  HECK NO!  should we have some "cool" class defining spell with some use that would increase or D?  yes.  Hows about this.  Give us a spell line for defense.  Make us the BEST class at fighting casters.  some ideas -<BR>Magic Reflection (some percent chance that the spell hits caster and not wiz, graphic, one sprite that is a sphere that is largere hen the caster and looks like he is in side of a shell).  Jitter (another dodge-type spell that gives the caster some chance of not being hit by a mob, graphic - a clone<BR>of the caster standing 2 inches to his right that intersects his geo).  Stun shield (mobs are stunned on succesful hits). Phase siheld ( mobs are fade stepped on succesful hits).  I dont think all of these should be done, but some would really make the class viable.<P>c)  give us a new line of spells to create a new identity.  Some thoughts on the board are interesting.  ID monster (know the monsters stats to some degree).  Better sight spells, find monster (glimpse with the terrain not showing so we can see monsters around us through walls).  Wizard Eye<BR>(outdoors only,  set the camera at 200' up and let us see whats around us, usuable during med).  Allow bind sight to be castable by the bound creature, this way we can recon further into dungeons.<P>other ideas for new spells or abilites - a pet that acts as a caster and not a melee, kinda like a little dot.  make it a gargoyle that is 6 inches tall and have it cast spells that are 4 circles below mine (not a fan of this one either, but hey, I', grasping for straws).<P>2)  there is no two...<P>DaSkull<P>also known as<BR>Stic Stormwraith on Terris Thule (31 wiz)<BR>Bisbik Stormwraith on Terris Thule (21 warrior)<P>and various other under lvl 10 players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Trust me, i don't think Verant is going to see there way clear of giving us any type of faster mana regen or insta-mana like with Harvest then they have already and Absor is one that feels we shouldn't have Harvest to start with(not to sure why,maybe a "cheat" in some ways or a chance to unbalance the other classes). The "need more DD added to our spells" is still one that will not work souly based on the fact that if we did we could kill MOB's that were blue to us in no time and with a fare amount of ease, what is fare to say is that we can at the very least go to a few places that no other class out there can and thats  Hate or Sky so we do in a small way have a leg up on some people but still not enough to make us that group-needy.<P><BR>We as a class are more powerful then we're willing to let on and some out there know that, there is no class that gets a spell modifier(i think) but we get it after 34, for those out there that don't know what i mean after 34 we have a sort of built in debuf or "lure" for MOB's that give us a better chance to hit them even when there say 4,5 or even higher levels then us and still do full or close to full damage depending on the MOB in question, its not much but has come in very handy at times... for me anyway.<P><BR>Where we need work as a class is in some very touchy places for both us and Verant and were all trying (Verant included i beleive) to find the right balance between fare and helpful for all of us. Keep the posts up, there have been some great ideas and im sure that Verant will come through for us.

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's one that hasn't been said yet.  I've posted it in another thread, but it applies here as well.<P>If you look at the concern of class balance, isn't the big issue the damage output of the melee classes in comparison to the damage output of the casters?  And if you look closer, isn't the HUGE damage output of the melee classes generally caused by all the buffs given, both by spell and by item?<P>Let's see, there's haste to let the melees hit faster/more often.  Then there's strength to add to the damage per hit, then there's the higher and higher damage weapons for lower delays.  This, not to mention DD spells being put on armor a NON CASTER can use.<P>So, how do you fix this?  You add new buffs that lower casting time, lower mana cost, increase spell damage, and increase the duration of spells.  The amount of increase granted by these spells should compare to the increase granted to a melee.<P>The wizard epic weapon should increase the damage output over time that a wizard can do.  Not some stupid +3 mana per tick, it should be closer to +50 mana per tick, or to give us an effect that does one of the buffs I have suggested.  Let the epic lower our casting time and increase our DD spell damage by 25 petrcent.  Wouldn't that be for wizards what the epic for the melees does?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about a level 20 upgrade to the "Halo of Light" spell that not only is a lightsource and 5 AC headpiece, but is also a NO DROP and NO RENT +10 INT item, which would have the exact same effect as a Manastone.  Make it a round, high-peaked, almost conical graphic, purple with a silver crescent moon and a single star.<BR> <BR>With a self-only no rent manastone at our disposal, and a cool Wizard hat, we would have a lot of fun and do a lot more damage.  <P>Seriously improving the Staff of Temperate Flux so that it works for magic resists as well and debuffs 4 each at level 20 and one each more for every level after that would also go a long way to improving the Wizard class without much internal tinkering.  It should be right-clickable and with the same resists as Dragon Breath.<BR> <BR>There, one new-spell upgrade, and one old-item upgrade, and Wizards do more damage total and are still fast, but the class is essentially unchanged.  <BR> <BR>Oh, and switch the levels for the Cazic and Dreadlands gates and portals, no harm done there, but a Wizard needs to go to Kunark sooner than in the 30's.  I doubt any non-Kunark account owners will complain about losing Cazic for a few levels...<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>VI should greatly (like lower to 20% of current) reduce the cost of all DD spells wizards have.<P>This would make wizards the master of nuke, and if they end up sitting on there butts a lot, its cause they are hitting hard.  This would not be a big imbalance as casting times and agro would keep the wizard from really letting go with all there mana.  It would however leave the wizard with enough mana to be usefull in every fight, with some sit time between fights.<P>I dont care to group with wizards right now.  They suck experience, and add very little to the group.  They should be able to increase the rate at which monsters are dropped, reguardless of group make up.<P>My main is a shaman.  Give me an enchanter, a cleric and 3 tanks and you have an awsome experience group.  Replace one of the tanks with a Magician, Necro, Rouge, or Monk and its even better.  Add a wizard in, and it slows down the hole group.<P>I dont play a wizard because this is what I see in a group.  I would like to do one, but there broken.<P>Good luck to all you wizards out there.  I hope they fix your nuking ability and my buffs, but at least I have some other good stuff to fall back on (mob slowing) you poor wizards have nothing to replace your broken primary class defining ability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've flipped through this for awhile now, and I may have some ideas on Wizards.  I'm only lvl 21 right now, but I have gotten other characters up fairly high before the Expansions have come out.  So, I figure I don't know all there is, but some.  At any rate, here it goes, my thoughts on the Wizzie.<P>1)  Up to my level (21) I have been pretty good at dishing out a LOT of damage.  When I nuke, I visibly see the mob's health bar more MUCH further down that it was previously decreasing by.  This is good, and it's fun to be able to do so much damage.  However:<P>a)  I've noticed a problem with Agro'ing.  If I cast my big spell (whichever, as long as it is partially resistable) and hit for say, 6 points of damage.  Then cast it again, and hit for say 15 points of damage.  BAM, the mob is on me.  Even though I only did 21 points of damage.  This is VERY frustrating and diminishes my capability to damage the mob further.  Basically, I have one go at a creature - if it partially resists, I'm screwed.  I can't cast again on that creature or fear being classified as a "over-nuker".  Which brings me to another point.<P>b)  Overnuking wizards - This is a severe limiter to our ability to get in groups.  I've had people right when I get in say "You don't think you're a tank do you?" or something to that effect.  And basically say that if I ever get a mob on me - I'm gonna catch hell.  Now, I try my damndest not to tank - but it happens sometimes, like the cases above.  Usually, I take about a bub of damage, and then the creature moves back on to the tank.  No big deal.  (As any rinky dink heal with bring me back full)  However, apparently a few bad apples have spoiled it for us.  And people are VERY paranoid of this.  (Oddly more paranoid than roaming pets, or other problems, but I digress)<P>The first point I'd like to be fixed - it can be really annoying before you realize what is going on.  And after that - it sucks to have to sit out a fight because you got a crappy DD in.<P>The second one is just people's perecpetion I've noticed, nothing that Verant can do there.<P>But, on to balance issues:<P>1)  I've seen my DD's get less and less effective on Mob's as I grow in strength.  Right around lvl 16 was great, but the new 20 spell Force Strike is TERRIBLE.  It's an all or nothing spell, with a very high mana cost for it's damage, and it gets resisted a large portion of the time.  I've resorted to using smaller nukes that are partially reistable w/ better mana effectiveness.  (It doesn't seem to agro as much either since I am doing less instantaneous damage, and more over time)  Why not make the highly resistive all or nothing spells more mana effective than the partially resistive ones?  (Inverse of what it is now...)<P>2)  The only complaint that I really see here is that we are not wanted in groups.  Never have I heard someone say "We need a wizzie in this group"  or "Wow, thank god we got a wizzie"  We just aren't like that. Almost any caster can fill the "wizzie" spot perfectly.  Enchanters are special because they control mobs, but Mages and Wizards are almost interchangable.  Mages have slightly less effective DD's except they have a big fat pet waiting to soak damage and give out a bit.  Because of the "extra tank" many groups will opt for the mage instead of the Wiz.  I agree that Wizards need a defining feature besides Teleportation.  We need something in battle that can seperate us from Mages w/o pets.  Giving us a DD spell that is noticable better than Mages I would say would definitely do the trick.  I don't think we are so badly worthless now, just underappreciated for what we can do.  Let us be noticed as a more powerful version of a Mage w/o a pet, and then people will realize this and want us more.  (Atleast on an even footing as a Mage)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for the time you are taking to try to help the Wizards.  Please understand that if we get sarcastic, it's not you, it's our class.  I started a Warrior who has almost caught up with my Wizard now.  Every day that I play, I wish I could play my Wizard, but he's 52, and nothing more than a frustration now.  I spent a long time struggling to get my Wizard to that level, then Velious came out, and after a week, my Wizard was retired.  My Warrior has strolled through levels with ease.  No downtime, because health comes much much MUCH easier than mana.  No costs, because all you have to buy is food and drink.  Weapons and armor all but fall out of the sky for melee classes.  No annoying spellbook to look at.  You get to watch what's going on around you for your entire life.  You're never useless.  You can swing your sword for as long as you have a pulse!  When you run out of stamina, you still keep swinging.  Of course that's no problem because in 12 seconds or so, Stamina goes back to full.  People need you.  You can't kill a hard hitting mob without someone that has a ton of hit points to take the damage for the group.  My Wizard went to Kurns tower (to get the extra ultra-rare right-clickable Wizard wand that like 10 people in the world have seen) and killed a few of the level 10 or 12 mobs, then sat down to med for a while.  My warrior went last night and mowed down almost the whole zone, never losing a bubble of health.  I bring these things up to prove a point.  Wizards start out weak, and are supposed to be the most powerful class in the land, after over a year of struggling your butt off.  This is not the case.  We start off weak, we are weak in mid levels, we are weak in the end.<P>Absor, I get upset when I hear you or others worry so much about Wizards being able to solo if you actally make us the masters of magic damage that we are supposed to be.  But...who cares?  Who is so upset if we can solo?  Why do others have nukes that are 70-95% as effective as ours?  Clerics get nukes, do we get heals?  Druids get nukes, do we get tracking, damage shields, heals, sow, regen, animal chraming, and DOT's?  See, even WARRIORS get spells in the form of proc'ing weapons.  Why does the fact that we can solo well have to keep you guys from increasing our performance with everyone else's?  <P>Absor, make us what we are supposed to be.  Nukers, not SCUD's.  And if that means that I can solo even better than I could before, SO WHAT?  I paid my dues!  I was a wussy for a year and somewhat powerful for 6 months.  I have been left out of groups for the last 6 months.  When is the payoff for all the hard work, bro?  It seems to me that in trying so hard to keep us from soloing, we have been made useless to a group.  It's a double edged sword.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One more post of ideas, basically a summary:<P>1.  Reduce the mana cost of wizard damage spells by 20% or so.  Reducing the cost would be equivalent to improving mana regen and increasing the mana pool.  This would improve the wizard's ability to "keep up" while grouped in early and mid levels.  <P>2.  Make it so grouping with a wizard lowered the resists and fizzles for all spell casters in the group.  This could be an innate ability (always on), or a spell.  This would help wizards find groups, and would help balance all casters a bit more with the melee types.  <P>3.  Add high level creatures which can not be hit by weapons, normal or magic (possibly allow weapon procs though).  This would help satisfy the high level characters and would provide variety in the game.  The only other reasonable solution would be to add a percentage based damage spell.  Whether the percent damage spell is added or not, adding a more varied style of creature would improve the game.<P>4. Make harvest scale through the 50s better.<P>5. Another idea, which may be interesting:   Increase the chance of specialization going off based on how many people are in the group.  Apply this to all spell casters.  <P>6.  Scale the 6 level resist limit with # of chars in a party.  When soloing, it'd still be capped at 6.  With a full party, cap it at 11.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Doing some thinking on this, I have come to the conclusion that Velious screwed us more than anything else. High mob HP's coupled with pathetic spells (and I do mean PATHETIC).  IVU, improved invis, Okells (ROFL I mean come on) and a couple of gate spells.  Icy spear of the sololist is a ok but how many wiz's get to 60 anyway.  Translocate has its uses but thats about the only legit one of hte bunch.  From what I can tell, most other classes are fairly pleased with their spell upgrades- wizards... well we get the sololist shaft. <P>I hope the lack of any changes on the test server indicate that VI is really looking into revamping the class.  All I can say is my wiz has been 56 for over a month, due to his inability to find groups. I've taken to lvl'ing up a bard and a warrior- its more fun advancing in lvls, even at lower lvls, then it is shouting for a group for an hour in OS.  Hopefully, changes can be made to make my wizard fun again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wanted to add something, increasing our mana efficiency by 20% is a drop in the bucket.  If you think about it, it takes a bub of mana to cast a DD usually...I get 5 maybe 6 off on my current DD....ok, 20%, would mean what, an 7 or 8 blasts ?  (&lt;-- believe it or not, I did go thru Calculus 2 with good grades, basic math always is my bad point LOL  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Well, Einstein had problems w/ simple math too heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  ) One or 2 more won't solve it.  I believe we're looking at 120% decrease in mana usage on a full bar of mana for DDs is appropiate. (In case I stated that wrong...it means our DD spells would take a little less than half a bub to cast.  Making it 1/3 a bub for blast sounds like a right number.)  Now, it might seem much, but if the Wizard goes OOM now, you truly have seen 4 or 5 back to back mobs that you have contributed to...heavily, without sucking up mana.  But remember, your blasts are all tempered by timeing...u blast too fast, you get the newbie: "DON'T TANK STUPID WIZARD!!!"  <P><BR>I was saving someone's ass yesterday in Lake Rathe...killed an aviak guard for him...he fought another adn another popped....(I KNEW I shoulda gated, but had that ol' Enchanter "save his life" still ingrained in me)....I rooted both, had enuff for gate...told him to run...one broke since he stood there awhile fighting.<P>Against my better instincts, I rerooted....and told him i'm gone, no mana.  Ran to start swimming and zone as he was low on health.  Well, low and behold, at the bottom of that LONG silver pillar thing (at the 3 spawn with the green fire at Lake Rathe)...I met Webclaw.  I knew I was dead...oom but full health.  I jumped in the water hoping it'd somehow mess with his pathing or at least bug his spell casting.  Lemme tell ya, NPCs don't have that problem =/   Died easily  &lt;-- hey I resort to cheesy escapes when a class is broken  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P><BR>Also, I see like a Personal Gate/TP/Evac to every other 3rd zone on Antonica.  Now, I haven't been to Kunark yet (or Velious..I quit the game in April due to frustration...and when I get my video card fixed, i'm heading to Kunark)....BUT, I see one portal to Dreadlands in Kunark.  Is that it ?  I believe we need more TPs out there.  Also, 3 on Velious, dunno how large it is....but I hope to have most of Velious covered as in terms of travel time and TPing.  Point is:  We need more TPs  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   Oh, and don't put it between Innoruk's Legs, or under Cazic-Thule's butt or something  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Also, why can't we have all our personal TPs b4 24?  We start getting GGs at 29...now, Velious I can see, it's 30+....but there should be safe spots to Personal Gate into at 24 for Kunark...I wanna explore over there, and it does say Kunark is for all lvls.  Velious, we know, is not.  (Now, as it is, I am gonna bind in the zone i'm in and TP back to Fay to sell my stuff and buy food, however, i'm sure one TP there will eventually get tedious.)<P><BR>Krytal, soon to be 24 Wizard of E'ci.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They need to readjust the resist factor for Wizards.  I believe they should not be resisted.  If the mob is many levels higher than the caster the damage should be 1/2 max damage of spell.  I also agree the Wizard SHOULD BE MASTERS OF magic damage, they should far surpass any other class for damage.  Just a suggestion, maybe a FAMILIAR companion, for those of you that play RPGs know what that is :=)  Also, increase the damage of their spells and mana.  I think everyone will agree that a TAUNTER, DRUID, and CLERIC can take a mob 15 to 20 levels higher than the party, if the party is good (Depending on the mob of course).<BR>    For example, our party consisted of 22 druid, 23 cleric and 24 tank, we killed a Bloodgil in lake of ill omen (yes he was fresh). If a wizard was in that group, he or she could do NOTHING but sit, because the spells would be resisted and they BLOW in melee.  I believe the rule is that if the mob is 6 or more levels higher than you, your spells will not work.  It would greatly help the Wizard class if this was not a factor or AT LEAST make an adjustment.  The wizard class is BAGGAGE in groups where the mob is 6 or more levels higher than the casters.  Note: I know about tash LOL.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also, with the whole 120% more efficient mana, meditation would be a no-big to us.  Think of it, puller says: R U rdy?  You have 1 1/2 bubs of mana, u r set  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  While he's out hunting a mob, you can med back 1 or so bub of mana (especially w/ clarity....then you'll have 2 1/2 bubs of mana, as much mana or MORE than you have pre-efficiency...you have enuff to blast the monster a few times  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  <P><BR>But I STILL believe everyone should get a better meditation increase after 35.<P><BR>Also, another suggestion.  I was a caster (Enchanter) in L Guk, and I saw the pattern begin there...hopefully something will change, but....anyway, in L Guk it doesn't take long for something to beat thru your Rune III spell line and to start killing you (I was 42, btw.)  In Kunark and Velious and in the planes, I believe ALL casters need something other than Rune 5/Manashield etc to protect them against quad hitting 130 dmg monsters.<P><BR>How about (as has been suggested b4) a "Phase" Line of spells, basically being quite reliable that would "Phase" the wizard outta our world (appear as if a ghost) and the monster would do NO dmg to him for about 7 seconds while he's faded out.  Maybe this can proc 2 times, and if no one can get this off the wizard by then, the wizard just hopes ppl can taunt it off b4 he dies and Manashield drops.  THis would protect us from a "whoops, I mis-judged how much agro i'd put on it" and allow us casters to live thru a mistake.  Also, while the line if active, make it so that u can NOT cast any offensive spells...and Damage shields will NOT work on the monster while he's swinging at the phased wizard (Rune spells or Manashields also won't drop while the wizard is phased as the monster is just "Missing" the wizard.)  I believe each caster should get a version of this to help us at higher lvls.<P><BR>Krytal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, a lot of these suggestions are really unbalancing.<P>There are three things that need to be fixed in regards to balance:<P>1)  Sustained damage output.<BR>2)  Effectiveness against ubermobs in SoV.<BR>3)  AoE pre 50.  These spells are all over the board on mana to damage ratios and make absolutely no sense whatsoever.<P>Now, all these things have to be done in such a way as to not make us more powerful while soloing.<P>Problem #1 can be solved by making rains single target and dropping the amount they are resisted just a tad.  Currently, they are heavily resisted by anything high blue and up.  They should have fairly low resists for anything under a white con.<P>Problem #2 can be solved with a %hp DD (or something similar).<P>Problem #3 can't be solved so easily.  Verant needs to completely redo these.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
