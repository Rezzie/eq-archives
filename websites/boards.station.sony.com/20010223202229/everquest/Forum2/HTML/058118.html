As for Kunark, pick-up groups are almost gone there as well.

</FONT><HR>Since bards have their fingers in just about every spell ability in the game they tend to get hit by every single nurf that comes along. I don't think thats responsible for their shortage however as they are a very powerfull class. I think song twisting is responsible for the classes decline. I know i quit my bard after only a few levels for fear of permanent damage to my wrists. Bards are a great class consept and quite powerfull; i feel if Verant fixed the song twisting thing we would see alot more of them.<P>Simplest and i think best thing to do is have a way to automatically sing numorous songs at once. Perhaps gain the ability at certain levels for example 2 songs at lvl 15 and 3 songs at lvl 25. Maybe even throw in 4 songs at lvl 55. <P>Mysthyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm it is a hard class to play.  But your right I am seeing fewer and fewer of them.  <P>I've grouped with many bards in the last year and half but in all that time I have only grouped with one bard who was actually.  I honestly didn't have a clue just how awesome bards were til I grouped with a truly great one.  Problem was that wasn't until I was lvl 52.  This guy made every other bard I had grouped with look like a clueless newbie.  All that time and 1 good bard found.  Sad.<P>I think the answer to your question is that most of the bards have been sucked up by the big guilds and just don't need to do pick up groups anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(This STARTS to happen around 35).<P>Like an Enchanter, you have to learn how to group with a bard, it's as much a training for the group as the bard him/herself.<P>Actually, now that I think of it, how many female bards have you seen?

At this level I can still solo moderately efficiently and I can go almost anywhere on Velious (Siren's Grotto is the thing that makes it not literally anywhere...)  However, anytime I group with a caster who hasn't played with many nontwinked Bards, it's always "Play the manasong" and they sometimes don't stop ORDERING you to play it until you DO play it.  <P>If I have a choice between playing ONLY manasong and leaving the group, hasta la vista, BABY. <P>My favorite pickup group recently was actually kind of surprising to me.  It was a group of all tanks in Solusek B.  A ranger, a Paladin, a Warrior and a Monk (I think he was experienced at pulling in there)--and we were stomping everything in sight.  No downtime to speak of because little mana was used and I kept our HP regenerating.  When one tank got too hurt we'd just switch who was tanking.  <P>Hehe, little bit off the topic there.  <P>Essentially, we're tough to group with effectively so we tend to stick with groups we KNOW are good.  The number of Bards HAS decreased, though, because every few patches they break a song and take their sweet time fixing it. The recent Selo breakage is just one example.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Female bard here!  I know at least 4 others, too.<P>But overall, we're under 4% of the server population (on the Nameless).<P>It is a HARD class to play.  I've had the pleasure of teaching a couple of people who have high-level characters how to bard.  One friend of mine had a 54 enchanter and a 53 rogue on Test, and started a bard on my server.  I started telling him about the proper use of Chords of Dissonance, and he said, "I know... I know the lyrics: 'guards, come kill me.'"  But then, after he got mobbed by three widow spiderlings and four orcs, and I had to tell him to turn OFF Chords as we were running to the guards, he says to me... "Wow, this is hard."<P>Even so, some good macros can help the situation.  A series of 8 socials can cut the work of twisting in half:<P>/pause 5, /stopsong<BR>/cast 1 (-8)<P>Using these instead of hotkeying song gems means only hitting each button once to switch songs, and doesn't get you stuck if you miss a note or get stunned.  Just start back up with Alt+#.  Those with better computers than me will be able to cut the pause down to 3 or maybe even 2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I too play a 51 Bard, but am fairly disilusioned with the class after so many nerfs.  I have a 40 mage now, who is stronger than my Bard, in what matters most pure damage.  I love my bard, yet my usefulness at the higher end is pitiful.  I know most of the Bards I knew have all walked away. <P>Personally I would love to play my Bard on a full time basis.  Yet I agree with many of the posts I see here, pick up groups will get you killed.  Many of the groups try to tell bards how to play the class.  I think next time that happens I will invite that person out back of Karnors for a lesson in kiting.  <P>Well for what its worth, if Verant can breath life back into the class, I think you will see many bards revived at the higher level.  The jury is out and the bard community waits on the verdict.  I know I am watching patiently, but if the same pattern continues with very little improvement you will see one less Bard on my server on a regular basis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I have a 37 bard which I originally created back before the nerfs as an alternative to an enchanter because they really did have the ability to do crowd control. <P>I pumped everything into CHA, worked hard to get to 15 so I could start using the AE mez song, and right about then they nerfed it. Then they nerfed other stuff. <P>I was bummed about the AE mez nerf, but worked forward to the charm song. Charm song was fun. <P>Soloing gets boring though, and soon I found myself wanting to join groups more. Since my haste buff is not only less haste than an enchanter's haste at my level AND it doesn't stack, and most of my buffs have similar stacking problems, I found myself a useless 5th wheel in most groups. <P>Whee fun.<P>If there were ONE thing I could have changed to the bard, that is to have the AE mez become an AE stun that at least WORKS TO SOME DEGREE above level 30. <P>The whole idea of "We only wanted to use it under level 30" for the AE mez is stupid, frustrating, and frankly having my #1 reason for playing a bard nerfed has resulted in me playing my bard less. Single target mez doesn't cut it for me.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The reason you don't see many high level bards is because they are the hardest and most demanding class to play well. And at high level 55+ they are a joke. You literally can't do anything in a raid or well balanced group except you guessed it mana song pls. What few bards actually perservere to this level get turned off by our incredible weakness against 54+ mobs. Most of the high level bards on my server are played by their guilds and not by the character. On raids I regularly get asked 1. Are you the real Amrothe and when I reply that I am 2. What is the name of the songs I should play on this raid. Hehe then I answer play mana song and when random boss fight 23 starts play appropriate resist song. Bards are a dying breed our high level weakness combined with carpal tunnel makes bards the least played class at high level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I have a lvl 35 bard myself, and really enjoy the class. The biggest problem I have grouping is that  I have to die a couple of times before the group starts to get an idea about how to group with a bard. Also, it does get kinda irritating when people try to tell me what songs to play( eventhough they do not do it much).<P>  At lvl 35, I only group when I want to work on melee skills, or when I get bored of kiting. I honestly think that the bard is about the hardest class to play. I can outaggro anyone in my group with barely trying, and twisting songs can be tricky at times. This could be why bards are incredibly rare even at lvl 35( I know of only 10 bards from lvl 35 to 60 on Vallon Zek). <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Top Ten Reasons Bards Suck!<P>1:  You can easily max out resists and still keep decent ac unlike pre expansions.  <P>2:  Bards also cause massive amounts of graphic lag because vi has always refused to allow folks to turn off the graphics from songs completely.  With the recent bugs caused from high level mob lag where tons of folks get dumped off the server and killed the reasons for not including bards is obvious.<P>3:  Pixie strike is still hokey to take seriously.<P>4:  Chains is laughable because while it's great in a pinch it just takes one failure to kill the group.  And in the newer dungeons dying deep in is a bigger problem than experience loss.<P>5:  Clarity is good, but having to wait to 55 for C2 is sickening.  54 is a nightmarish level to be forced to overcome with a crippled class for 1 song that doesn't really make the class into a must have for anything.<P>6:  Mele .. hahahaha.. HAHAHAHHAHA...  hehe.. whew (clutches aching stomach)  My enchanters 39th pet outdamaged my bard at 52 easy.<P>7:  Defenc...Loading Please Wait<P>8:  Constant nerfs are disheartening.  I got tired of finding songs working differently all the time with no announcement.  By the way the whole root stacking with snare "enhancement" was aimed directly to nerf bards ability to break root with selos.<P>9:  Haste.. it's mostly worthless as it won't stack with any other haste casters better versions.  The party still gets the stat buffs, consult your local shaman to the usefullness of those.<P>10:  Pain.  Hurting wrists, constantly having to pound on the keyboard to keep 3 songs up is a carpal tunnel nightmare.<P>Vmlinuz Gateslayer 56th Templar<BR>Listener Luckytune 52nd Minstrel<BR>Vmlinux Gateslayer 45th Enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I had a level 23 human male bard once....<P>Hell, he was a lot of fun. He looked good in his twink armor (black enameled bp, silver plated legs, hero bracer, silver plated bracer, singing steel boots, iksar scaled gloves, azure sleeves, skull shaped barbute). He had good instruments (MM battle drums, lute of gypsy princess). He had awesome weapons (crystalline short sword 12/24 plus nice stats, and a Sionache's partisan 9/19).<P>He had HP gear that added another 200 or so hit points to his total. He had a runed bone fork to increase his resistances. <P>He had a lot of good stuff, in other words. And ya know what? I did a lot of research at the Concert Hall and Rokenn's Songs Analysis sites to make sure I knew how to play a GOOD bard.<P>But I quit my bard at level 23. Know why? I was in North Ro, and I decided I should pay Dorn a visit. He conned nice and green, and I decided on an all instrument attack. Hell, I'd trashed gorge hounds and undead reavers in East Karana with it. How hard could Dorn be? Well, I waited while a level 23 druidess pulverized him (in less than 20 seconds, mind you). Wow, I was getting excited.<P>When he spawned again, I pulled the Thug and killed him with no hp loss. Then I pulled Dorn, the green rogue bastard. He commenced to keeping me stunned so that my instruments were rendered useless. Hell, I couldn't even heal myself. Luckily I had hotkeyed my weapons, and I switched over to my twink weapons. I barely hit the guy. And he was walloping me, double attacking me, etc.<P>I ended up running for the tunnels like a newbie  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>The next day I started a female gnome warrior, transferred all my twink gear, and haven't looked back since.
