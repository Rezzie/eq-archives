        <p><font color="#000000" size="5" face="Arial"><strong>New!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Denizen Belov has written
        a very nice </font><a href="guide1.htm"><font size="4" face="Arial">Guide</font></a><font size="4" face="Arial">.
        Whether you're level 5 or 50, it's worth a read. =)</font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Beware!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">-Spirit of the Wolf (aka
        SoW) is a commonly sought after spell, and it is quite
        annoying that one of our old favorites, Selo`s
        Accelerando, will nullify the effects. Although the icon
        will still appear, the speed granted by SoW will not
        longer be in effect until re-cast. A pain at best, life
        threatening at worst, if the hapless victim is unaware
        they are no longer faster than those who follow.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">- A Role Playing switched
        has been added so that players may identify other
        characters who wish to make known they are Role Playing.
        To activate the Role Playing switch, target your
        character and type &quot;/roleplay&quot;, if the
        character is +PvP, the name tag above their head will
        appear as a darker shade of Red, whereas a non-PvP
        players name will appear purple. NOTE - There is
        currently a BUG with this switch. While in rp mode, you
        will appear as anonomous to anyone who does a /who on
        you. If guilded however, your guild title will still
        show.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>General Interest</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Frustrated trying to
        switch from instrument to weapons in battle, or vice
        versa? Here's the answer...Both Melee and Inventory slots
        can be drug down to your quick key boxes, just like
        spells. So...set up your quick key boxes with Both your
        Melee slots, and 2 Inventory slots, which are kept
        dedicated for weapons/instruments transfers. For Example,
        hot boxes 1 and 2 would be your melee slots, containing 1
        sword each. Hot boxes 3 is an inventory box, filled with
        an instrument, and 4, an empty inventory box. Now, it's
        just a matter of picking up the weapons from 1 and 2, and
        swapping them out with the instrument in box 3. No need
        to transfer screens, and the switch eliminates the chance
        of dropped weapons, while only taking a few seconds to
        finish.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">If the user drops a
        backpack containing spells on the ground, the spells will
        no longer disappear.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">'Procing' (items that cast
        spells) weapons no longer break Bard's singing.
        (specifically, this means the problem with Tentacle whips
        is now solved!)</font></p>

        Carillon appears to be fixed at last!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">The Bard spell
        &quot;Denon's Desperate Dirge&quot; will now require the
        use of Mana.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">No spell or effect that
        accelerates the process of mana regeneration will work on

        Bard appears to be strumming a flute =)</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">After the effect of the
        Lament is felt, it will flash up on the screen you need a
        target for this Song. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's a
        one use Song, which means after the effect goes off, you
        might as well stop the Song manually and restart another.</font></p>

        Accelerando will nullify the root spell on any party

        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">-Kiting is the simple act
        of running and using Songs (or spells) on your opponent,
        not weapons. Allow them to chase you, but don't stop to
        melee, let them feel the power of your Songs (Such as
        Bellow) and when you have wounded them to a degree you
        feel the fight is more in your favour, let them catch up
        and teach them a lesson in manners. I prefer to group, so
        I've not used this tactic often (usually when something a
        LOT larger than me decides I'd make a tasty snack) , but
        it is quite effective, and requires a bit of skill and
        practice to perfect. </font></p>
