Gordon kept busy this Sunday by making the following posts on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008505.html"><b>Coffee and Milo</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What coffee do you drink that hops you up so late at night]</i></font> <br><br>An espresso roast that I order from Seattle. I'm crazy about my coffee, and I've got a pretty nifty setup to make it up :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just find it interesting that you are up again another weekend making posts]</i></font> <br><br>I actually find it a lot easier to be more personable at night away from the office. I guess it's the difference that comes with doing it on my own time by choice rather than as part of my job, even though I'm still doing the same thing. Am I making sense? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any comments on Milo :/ Really curious, love his column as many others do]</i></font> <br><br>We had to come to grips with the fact that anyone who is known to be working here represents us in public, especially when writing for an EverQuest-related site read by EverQuest customers. Though I am very aware that many people enjoyed the column, there was indeed content that wasn't appropriate from a representative of the company. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008517.html"><b>Gone Campin'</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Too Crowded? I came from half way across the whole game planet just to get to a zone w 7(SEVEN) people in the zone, including me! SO i call ou 46 shaman looking for el groupo!]</i></font> <br><br>If the zone had seven people in it including you, chances are the other 6 were in a group together already. I know that you said later in your post that the other group had 5 members, leaving one solo person. In Lower Guk? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You tell me why anyone should leave a single spawn camp to just get slaughtered by greens waiting to get picked up in a group?]</i></font> <br><br>Because it's more fun than camping a single spawn? <br><br>At 46 I doubt that there is much green to you, and I don't think that there's anything 15 levels below you. I could be wrong about that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: while i stand invised at the enterence, what happens, someone shouts Train to zone look out, so i run down and to the left out of the way of the train. and stand by till things get cleared up, but no, a wanderer comes by drags the whole freeking train on me, and i loose 46 in less than 6 seconds]</i></font> <br><br>Why did you run from the entrance, deeper into the zone, when someone yelled "train"? You said there were only 7 people in the zone, which is going to make Lower Guk a pretty dangerous place. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is 2 hours, or more at higher lvls, of time wasted due to this meaningless crap acceptable "fun" for you? It sure the hell is not for me!]</i></font> <br><br>Come on Robert. You obviously made some poor decisions here. Why do you come to the boards and blame it on us? The game is supposed to punish you for making mistakes, most games do. You ran solo into a pretty rough dungeon when there were barely any people in there and died. The game worked like it was supposed to. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The game you have created at higher lvls is more about NOT DYING, than it is about playing the game and adventuring!]</i></font> <br><br>That's a decision that you as a gamer make. Why does it have to be about not dying? Why is advancement in level through the boring process of camping a single spawn for experience preferrable to having fun, and not advancing as fast? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You say alot that if there is no risk then it is not exciting, but my point is, when everything involves huge risk of time lost]</i></font> <br><br>This is the second time you've mentioned "lost time" or "wasted time" in the post. The entire concept of "lost time" suggests that there's an end to the game, achieved by advancement. I'm sure that's true for some players. Some feel that they have to reach level 50, or 60 and then they can "finally go out and have fun". Any thing that slows them down is costing them "time", or "lost time" in this case. <br><br>I'm not sure what to tell gamers of this type. I'm not sure that we could ever make advancement fast enough to their liking, but I am sure that we don't want to speed advancement. If all you play for is to advance in level as fast as possible then deaths will equate directly to wasted or lost time. Perhaps if leveling is more important to you than anything else, you should take the fastest and safest route to advancement, which will be camping a single spawn someplace. <br><br>However, if leveling is more important to you than anything else, and you choose to do whatever you have to to level as fast as possible, is it our fault that this is boring? Should not the quickest and safest route to leveling be boring? <br><br>I've said before that risk was necessary in order for there to be a challenge, and a challenge necessary in order for there to be fun. Excitement is one form of fun, and most would agree that boredom is roughly the opposite of excitement. If a gamer makes a choice to remove risk from an encounter, should they not be responsible from removing the fun from that encounter as well?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008521.html"><b>EULA</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just to let you know, you shoulda researched when you did that, it is starting to violate Federal Interstate Wire Fruad laws.]</i></font> <br><br>The EULA doesn't violate any laws, it just defines that you are allowed to do with our software and your access to the service. <br><br>I certainly agree that if player A sells the account to player B, and later steals it back, then player A has committed a crime, but that is between player A and player B, and really has nothing to do with us. <br><br>The extent that we get involved is to ban the account if player B calls us up and proves that he bought it from player A. We do not however compensate player B in any way, since he acquired access to the account through a violation of the user agreement by player A. It is then player B's option to file legal charges if they wish, but that doesn't involve us. <br><br>See, this is why we don't allow account transers, because we can't be responsible for all the fraud that goes on. Someone might look reputable on those auction sites, but takes only a couple of days and costs a couple of dollars to work up a convincing profile. There is more fraud involved in account and item sales than you can possibly imagine. I wish I could tell you how many calls we get every day about this.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008502.html"><b>Sharing Accounts</b></a><br>There's no problem if that person is your child, however if it's anyone else, it's not permitted by the EULA.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008372.html"><b>A Bug?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I play on the tribunal and informed a guide about the presence of this bug and was told they are investigating the problem. The bug is as follows, Normally i as a cleric could cast invis vs undead on myself and them have REGULAr invis cast upon and they would stack just fine. Since the last patch the msg "You are allready invisible" is given when attempting this. Could you please give an update so we know if this bug has even made it too the right people and when it might be completed. Thank You Much]</i></font> <br><br>It's not a bug. No class (except for rogues) can be invisible to both living and undead regardless of spells or abilities. So even though the spells would appear to stack, the recipient of the spell would only be under the affect of one spell. <br><br>A few weeks ago, I asked the coder to make the spells unstackable so that they didn't give the impression that being invisible to both is possible.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008422.html"><b>Tinnkering</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ther have been countless upon countless threads started to get some idea of when Tinkering will gets its upgrade.

PLEASE have mercy and give us an idea of when our skill will be addressed! =( =( =( =(]</i></font> <br><br>All I can tell you is the same thing that I've told all of the other trade-skill types, that being that several of them are being worked on currently. I wish I could solidify ETA's and project lists, but doing so wouldn't be appropriate given the sometimes volatile nature of the designer's workload. <br><br>We will be reopening the tradeskill board next week. The designer responsible for them will be a regular reader/poster there.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008501.html"><b>One-Way Dungeon Doors</b></a><br>Considering that the classes that can gate are probably grouped with those who can't, I'd have to argue that the one-way dungeons affect everyone. Who's going to group with a gating class if they bail out at the first sign of trouble leaving their non-gating brethren to take the fall? Also, I can't say that I agree that a dungeon design of that nature constitutes a penalty. <br><br>There are of course dungeons which don't allow people to gate out already, but there's really no point in expanding that to dungeons that already allow it by design. That would be a penalty.</UL>

I got the following in from Brokyyn:<BLOCKQUOTE>Invasion of Highkeep!<br><br>Nearly a year after our dear sister Lanys T'vyl and brother Laarthik led<br>an ill-fated invasion to capture Highkeep Hold, it is time for the Dark<br>Elf Army to come together again to avenge their deaths.<br><br>Rogue scouts have discovered that Carson McCabe was unsuccessful in<br>persuading the forces from Qeynos, Erudin and even Freeport to help him<br>protect Highkeep.  With a weak force, our scouts feel the Keep is<br>vulnerable.  We also have reports of a Teir'Dal being held against her<br>will inside.  <br><br>It is now time, brothers and sisters, to finish the grand plan of Lanys<br>T'vyl... to revealed a plan for a dark elf army to attack Highkeep,<br>capturing the fortress and cutting Antonica in half. Once this is<br>accomplished, we will have an<br>easy time of overcoming Rivervale and Freeport.<br><br>Our goal will be to infiltrate Highkeep and destroy Carson McCabe's<br>army.  We will then find his Mistress Anna and the Lady McCabe and let<br>them meet the same fate as Lanys T'val and Laarthik did.  We will also<br>free the Teir'Dal Tyrana Slil from her captors.<br><br>In the name of our father Innoruuk, unite and bring death and suffering<br>to the pale races which infect our world!<br><br>Brokyyn Deathbringer<br>(Sublime Darkness)<br><br>What: Invasion of Highkeep<br>When: Saterday, September 2  3pm EST<br>Where:  Highkeep Hold- Tarew Marr<br>Who: Any evil character level 25 or higher.<br>Why: To avenge the death of Lanys T'vyl and to wreak havoc on the forces<br>of the good races of Antonica.<br>Please join Sublime Darnkess in this event, perhaps the first invasion<br>of it's kind on Tarew Marr.

Gordon made a few posts today on the Gameplay Board.  For your information here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008239.html"><b>AoE Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Long promised, never delivered, non-class issue.  Well Gordon? When are pre-50 AoE spells going to be fixed?]</i></font> <br><br>What promise? I don't recall anyone promising anything in regards to these spells. <br><br>Furthermore, how are these spells "broken" in your opinion? I've seen a number of posts complaining about damage ratios, or regarding the number of creatures that they hit, or the types of creatures that are affected. It's all working as intended as far as I can tell. <br><br>Can you elaborate on "broken" and include what spells you are speaking of? Please be as brief as possible while explaining the situation. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008246.html"><b>Summaries of Weekly Discussion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A (the) conclusion(s) that Verant has come to in regards to the topic based on the discussion?]</i></font> <br><br>If whatever we are discussing has a solid conclusion, sure, but I think that most of what we'll discuss will be a little more intellectual and a little less tangible in nature. <br><br>As far as camping goes, about all we determined is that people differ widely in opinion on the issue. One of the most common suggestions is that we work actively to promote more rewards for playing the game in the preferred manner, and leave rewards as they currently exist for camping. <br><br>Unfortunately, doing that would require making playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable, which would in our opinion decrease the fun to be had from it. In our opinion, there is more fun to be had from playing the game in the preferred manner than by camping, and that fun should be the sufficient additional reward to get people to do it. <br><br>However it's obviously not, so we're left with reducing the reward for camping as an option. Of course, many made it clear in the threads they they prefer camping over doing anything else in the game. Hence our quandry. <br><br>I think that at this point we can continue trying new ideas going forward, but try to avoid making sweeping changes to the way existing things work. We'll of course have individual exceptions to the philosophy in both directions, but on an as-needed basis. That said, there were some very good ideas included and good insight offered within the thread. Even if those ideas aren't something that would work in EQ, they are still something that we can keep in mind for future products.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008308.html"><b>"Lets make that 10 slot bag 6 slots and dump the 4 items in the deleted slots!"</b></a><br>I'm not at all familiar with this change; I'll look into it Monday. That said, if the item was a combinable item used for a Quest, people are not supposed to store items in combinable containers. <br>--<br>Just a follow-up with this... One of the guys is still in the office, and tells me that our records indicate that the last time this item was modified was in February. When is the change supposed to have taken place?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008319.html"><b>New Dragons?</b></a><br>Dragons and deities are kind of a rite of passage in EverQuest. They are a goal that people aim for when playing the game. We wouldn't want to cheapen the experience by giving every level range their "own" dragon.</UL>

A new event was just announced for the Morell-Thule server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Friends at EQVault! <br><br>One night in a dream Dolumar heard a cry and saw the terrified face of <br>young and niave Elf waylaid by a vulgar, unscrupulous Orc. <br>He bolted up out of his retreating place, and drew us together for a special <br>meeting, we his friends and guildmates of Random Acts. <br><br>"We must away to the forest, and anon," he said, speaking of <br> the deep dark forest of Faydwer, home to the elves and other <br>folke. "I fear there are many young ones afraid to walk the paths between <br>Kelethin and Felwithe. Only the boldest venture forth these days, <br>and that is for the noble task of carrying the mail. "We must <br>hurry...there is no time to lose. They will perish soon if we <br>don't!" <br><br>"Yes, but Dolumar,"  Hamadryad, the guildleader, said. "We <br>must take time to plan a journey such as this...how will they <br>know we are coming? What of our reinforcements?" <br><br>"When the young and innocent are dropping all around you, <br>it is not time to plan. It is time to act! Are we not of Random Acts, <br>the Champions of Kind Deeds toward all in need! I have seen <br>it in my dream...they call us!" <br><br>Hamadryad sought the inner guide for the energies behind her <br>dear friend's words. She closed her eyes and saw Dolumar <br>standing on the central lift to Kelethin, raising his staff to <br>protect a young one from a pack of venomous Orcs, while the <br>guards stood idly by. Dolumar is bathed in light! she saw in <br>her vision. <br><br>"You speak the Truth," Hamadryad said to Dolumar, and grasped <br>his shoulder. "Let us leave now with no more planning. We will <br>send out messengers for reinforcements, and by Tunare's Will <br>they will arrive before we are spent. But if we must go down," <br>she said, looking around the room at the few valient and brave <br>fellows who were marching into danger for people they didn't <br>even know, "if we must go down fighting, then I am honored to be in <br>your company." <br><br>"Away to Faydwer! Let us start in Greater Faydark. Away!" <br><br>World: Morell-Thule <br>What: Greater Faydark First Aid Camp <br>Where: Greater Faydark newbie areas <br>When: Saturday, Aug. 26, 8:00AM Pacific <br>Why: Because people are dropping like <br>flies out there and it's our job to <br>help them. <br>Who: You! and bring a friend! <br><br><a href="http://www.stas.net/randomacts/">http://www.stas.net/randomacts/</a> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Ariel announced that Trakanon has met his match again:<BLOCKQUOTE>The undead dragon Trakanon has been the Nemesis of the Legacy of Steel for<br>several weeks now. On our first sojourn into his lair we merely sparred with<br>the mighty dragon in order to better guage his weaknesses. Another hazardous<br>adventure led to the zone crash of Old Sebilis. Undaunted, we traveled once<br>again down to his subterranean cavern. Fungal Reavers, Reet Knights and The<br>Sebilite Protector were all unable to deter us from our goal. With a sense<br>of dread and antipation, the forces of Legacy of Steel approached the bridge<br>to Trakanon's Lair and awaited the call to charge. From the ledge above a<br>raging tide of Sebilite Juggernauts rushed at us, attempting to knock us<br>from our precarious perch. After a quick and furious battle, the Juggernauts<br>were defeated and our companions prepared themselves mentally and<br>spiritually for what would be our greatest hour. <br><br>At the eleventh hour, I gave the order to 'CHARGE!', all the while hoping<br>that I was not, once again, sending my friends to their certain doom. At the<br>back of his cavernous lair, Trakanon caught sight of us and reared up to<br>envelop our fellowship with his deadly, venemous breath. Not one of us<br>faltered; but instead our entire company re-doubled its<br>efforts - Warriors, Monks and Paladins rushed the beast head-on even as our<br>green robed Wizards and Mages rained fireballs upon his gargantuan body. The<br>battle was short but furious. Yet, at the end, the raging beast that had<br>haunted us for weeks... had fallen. Some of our company felt elation, others<br>excitement for the treasures that were gained from the Dragon's horde. As<br>for me, I merely felt relief that the beast was beaten at last...<br><br>Ariel<br>GM Legacy of Steel<br><br>and some pic links:<br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Trakdead.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Trakdead.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/trakdead1.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/trakdead1.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/mudcrush.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/mudcrush.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Tolon.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Tolon.jpg</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Pickle:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi Guys,<br><br>Act 1 has finally been completed, but is now called the Prologue! You can access it by clicking on the "Completed Acts" link above. <br><br>After much discussion on what we should do re: dialogue and narration, we decided that it be best to keep it to a minimum. Thus, a small blurb is included in the beginning of the act, and the rest of the movie should tell itself. Furthermore, we've included a synopsis of what *exactly* is going on throughout the movie in the download page, and after reading this, the story should be clear.<br><br>Also added onto this act is the movie's opening title and credit sequence. I wanted to make some a bit bad-ass and energetic, to contrast from the 8 minute battle sequence, and hope this is a good compliment.<br><br>Also, if anyone can mirror the zip file, please let me know at pickle@eqmovie.com so I can add the link.<br><br>I hope you enjoy!<br>-Pickle<br><a href="http://www.eqmovie.com/">http://www.eqmovie.com/</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon has been making his normal rounds on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's a rundown of all of today's posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008205.html"><b>More Deletions on Offical Boards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I, for the life of me, can't see how "board" posts, have ANY THING to do with "game conduct" though]</i></font> <br><br>The ability to post on these boards is one of the privileges that go with having an EverQuest account. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you conduct yourself poorly here, why allow you into the game where you will conduct yourself poorly infront of even more? Flaming and name callers here arent welcome here nor ingame. Seems fine to me.]</i></font> <br><br>That's basically where we are coming from. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008235.html"><b>How is Damage calculated?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. We know each weapon has has a damage and a dely<br>2. But we also know there is a level bonus that affects each hit.<br>3. We also know that str makes max damage go higher and possibly make you hit for max damage more often.<br>What we dont know is exactly how these fit together.]</i></font> <br><br>That is as intended. As I've said before, we're not going to publish the formulae used to determine what happens in combat. If you need to know more, you'll have to extrapolate from the data that you do have. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think casters would be shocked if their 1600 hp nuke actually only landed for 800 and cost twice as much mana]</i></font> <br><br>Casters can see how much DD spells hit for per hit, in the same fashion that melee players can see how much their sword hits for on each hit. Information is given equally in that respect. If the casters however wanted to see the formulae that determines things such as fizzle and resist rates, we'd have to decline to give that info out as well. <br><br>DOTs are even more mysterious than weapons or DDs. In fact, the only reason people have a good idea of the way that most of these work is due to the parsing of the spell data file. This is obviously something that we didn't intend. Since that information is gathered via unauthorized means, we're not going to extend that out to a purposeful action such as handing out formulae. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Weve come a long way from damage/delay, but some exact formulas for calculating damage would be appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm wondering if this is leading to something else, as I know you've been here on the boards long enough to know what I'd say to this request :)<br><br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008197.html"><b>Retroactive Nerfs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are Retroactive nerfs EVER justified? <br>I used to agree with the idea of using nerfs to maintain balance in the game....but lately they seem to do more harm than good, (i.e. moss-covered twig / manastone / rubicite issues / Jboots) ]</i></font><br><br>Rubicite and Jboots were not changed retroactively. The manastone only had a small part of it changed retroactively (see below). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Heh heh....Verant seems to like retroactive nerfs....]</i></font> <br><br>Actually we really dislike doing them, however sometimes an item is so unbalancing that it's necessary. Here's some examples of where we haven't done a retroactive change: <br><br>Manastone (One component was retroactive with this, it being disallowed in the Planes)<br>Box of Abu'kar (This one started as a retroactive change that was then changed back to the way it was)<br>Guise of the Deceiver<br>Lusterous Russet Armor (We announced an intended retroactive change, then changed our minds)<br>Rubicite <br><br>Likewise, there are cases where a retroactive change was necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm starting to think that VI should just leave whatever mistakes they made in the game and end the drops if necessary. It just seems like something is innately wrong with retroactive changes, and they usually come much to the chagrin of the players.<br><br>What do you guys think? For better or worse, I'm of the belief that the policy should be no more retroactive nerfs]</i></font> <br><br>I think that you'll find people on both sides of the issue. Many felt that the Manastone and Guise should have been retroactively removed. Many feel that the twig and other low-delay weapons shouldn't be retroactively changed. I guess it depends on whether or not you are going to be a recipient of a retroactive change.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008182.html"><b>An Explanation</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So agian I was just wondering what is the different between the song and this.]</i></font> <br><br>The difference is that the NPC is moving. It is carrying out its commands and making progress towards that goal. Movement introduces a variable that injects some risk into the situation. Now where these particular people were fear-kiting, perhaps there is a pathing issue that reduces the risk, but that's something associated with a specific point in the world, not an ability that can be taken anywhere. <br><br>The "Fear" spell tells the NPC to flee. It's the same "flee" that they do when they run low on health and try to get away. They can't really *get* anywhere, so the only reason they flee is to inject additional risk. <br><br>An NPC that is fleeing, and is then rooted, will turn around and fight. An NPC that is fleeing, and then snared, will not turn around and fight, even if their movement rate is reduced to zero (an effective root). "Effective Roots" don't have the drawbacks of a root (e.g. fighting NPC, unpredictable breaking of the spell). <br><br>Our choices in this case were: Make it so all NPCs will fight back if their movement speed is reduced to a certain point, or, limit the ability of snare spells to reduce their movement rate to zero. We did the latter. I'm sure that some could make a case for the former based upon situation.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008188.html"><b>We Need More Abashi's!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyways do you think with all that EQ income that the players generate you could hire some EQ know it alls to respond to more posts??]</i></font> <br><br>It's not so much answering questions about how things work in EQ as it is understanding why things were set up as they are in the first place. It's my hope that some day I'll be able to convince everyone of our goals and get complete buy-in. I know that's not really possible, but I can hope :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive posted many times here, sometimes griping, sometimes praising, and sometimes role playing and my post has never been answered by you or any staff, it kinda makes me feel very small and unimportant, especially when i put alot of time and thought in a new idea or gripe or whatever.]</i></font> <br><br>The board gets 400-500 new threads per day with about 10 times that many posts. I think that the point that we can start answering everyone's posts will be about the same time that EQ has lost popularity. Until then we'll try to address issues if not individual posts. <br><br>Thanks for posting :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008181.html"><b>Autosplit Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) convert P to G and resplit (what they obviously don't want to do);]</i></font> <br><br>Autosplit used to work like this (beta), and people *hated* it. They always ended up with far too many of a lesser valued coin. Not to mention, it doesn't make sense that change can be made out in the wilderness. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) remove "feature" (what they should do).]</i></font> <br><br>Why remove a feature that people can just choose not to use? Personally, I've never had a problem with autosplit, as it works out in the long run. <br><br>Things you can do: <br>-Master loot. Have one guy loot everything with autosplit off. Split after you all are done adventuring. <br>-Alpha loot. Take turns looting with autosplit on. Everything will even out in the long run.<br>-Alpha loot with split off. <br><br>-or.. Just don't worry about it. A coin here or there isnt' really that big of a deal, and if it is for you, you can still choose not to use autosplit.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008144.html"><b>Anti-Roleplaying Server Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My server is tyring to change to all RPing. Well i dont agree with this. i like to powergame and not thing. <br>anyway i personally dont like to RP. i RP myself and enjoy it sometimes. but i feel out of place sometimes<br>Anyway. since my server is one of the newest two. (morell thule, torvantilus (sp)) i was curious if it gets to bad if i could switch to a more powergaming server like xegony. NOOO im not going to start over and play the next 5 months getting to where i am. i have 43 levels under my belt. if im not happy its not that hard to do. i mean the internal staff does it all the time.]</i></font> <br><br>Honestly this is one of the most unusual requests I've seen. <br><br>Frankly, we move characters during sanctioned server-moves. I don't think that we would want to expand our current moves to include those that want to move because there is "too much roleplaying" on their current server.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008141.html"><b>Low Delay Weapon Debate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I assume you are speaking of the low-delay weapons? Items attainable in the mid 30s should not be the preferred item at 60."]</i></font> <br><br>Oops. I meant weapons, not items in general. Many items have varying degrees of usefulness throughout the life of the character. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: ENTIRE shiverback debate was due to this exact fact]</i></font> <br><br>I'll agree that Shiverback isn't as good as some of the other more mundane stuff that is out there. However, we're all but certain here that the problem is not necessarily with Shiverback being poor, but with some of the mundane stuff being too good. <br><br>Jeff Butler is running some extensive inter-class defense tests, and the initial indication is that any defensive increase (including AC) for monks would not be appropriate.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008172.html"><b>The Missing Threads</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: HA DELETED MY CUSTOMER SERVICE POST!!]</i></font><br> <br>You mean the post at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008061.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008061.html</a> ? <br><br>It's several pages back by now. The thread index places the most recent post at the top of the listing. This board gets about 400-500 new threads daily, pushing things back about 10 pages. Your last post had it's last reply around 5am this morning. It wasn't deleted, you might want to check out the search function. <br><br>As for your issue, it certainly sounds a bit strange, but I can't look into a thing without names. I do find it highly unusual that a GM would accidentally summon you to your death in Fear 5 times while trying to help you. <br><br>Have you tried talking to the GM on the server since then, other than through email? Has the one who accidentally got you killed 5 times while trying to help you been on the server at all? I really need some more information<br>---<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: as long as we are discussing deleted posts...where are these? <br><br> <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007908.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007908.html</a>  Title: Abashi, Aradune, etc: Just how the hell was the song "over powered?" ]</i></font><br><br>The thread degenerated into rampant personal attacks. As these posts were the rule rather than the exception in the thread, the entire thread was deleted. They were especially bad since it seemed that people were trying to "one-up" each other with the level of personal attack being made. Personal attacks do not belong on these boards. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007933.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007933.html</a> Title: Abashi, Why Did Verant Ask for Our Opinion on PVP then Go Directly Against It?]</i></font> <br><br>Thread got corrupted. If the author will repost I'd be happy to repost my response there as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007119.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007119.html</a> This one discusses an un post that they have now wiped from the index as well (you can't search for it like you could the other day, and the post notes it)]</i></font> <br><br>The refernced thread was deleted because the original poster came back to the thread and launched a personal attack. The moderators are instructed to delete threads any time the poster of the thread violates the rules. <br><br>As for the index, the index is rebuilt regularly. The amount of time that a thread will be returned in "search" but not actually be on the board is variable.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008043.html"><b>Discussion of the Week</b></a><br>Hello all, <br><br>I was very pleased with the way the thread I started last week turned out. It offered us some some extra insight into player thoughts and feelings that will certainly contribute to our ability to make fun and exciting games. <br><br>I'd like to start a similar "Discussion of the week" thread every Monday, and come back to request ideas for the following week's thread every Friday. So here's the request for ideas! <br><br>Some guidelines: <br><br>1. No class-specific or class-type specific (melee/hybrid/casters) threads.<br>2. The ideas must be something of interest to a wide range of players.<br>3. I'd like to stay more on the course of broad gaming concepts rather than specific issues. For instance, I'd rather talk about concepts such as last weeks concerning camping than "Loot in lower guk". <br><br>Post your thoughts here, I'll pick a concept based on the responses here. </UL>

Here's a few more clips and excerpts from off the official boards that Verant's Gordon Wrinn wrote:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007918.html"><b>Cycle of Death</b></a><br>Thanks for the info. I've forwarded this issue to the programmer who is responsible for things of this nature. There have been quite a few reports of this. It sounds like the NPC in question is reacting to the race before information on your deeds has loaded. <br><br>Let me ask you this, how do NPCs in that area /con to you?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006598.html"><b>Losing Exp in a Duel</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lose of exp. in a duel Abashi please read <br><br>I think you should test a character who has very little exp. on the current level. It may be a bug or something. Maybe the exp. loss is so minute that you don't even notice unless you have <br>jsut gained a level. Thanks.]</i></font><br> <br>Though it's probably not the most desirable situation, it's not a bug. <br><br>Experience loss from PvP combat (including duels) on non-PvP servers has the potential to cause experience loss if you die in certain ways. For instance, if you are killed by a DOT, are rooted in water or lava, killed by a pet, or bleed to death, you will lose experience. <br><br>These issues do not happen on PvP servers because we've turned off all environmental deaths on those servers due to the fact that PvP occurs there more regularly. On non-PvP servers, it's the exception to the rule.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007974.html"><b>Voice Recognition</b></a><br>Don't mistake "Voice Recognition" for "Voice chat". Voice recognition is entirely client-side, and causes what you say in the microphone to appear as text in on the chat line, or execute commands that could only otherwise be done with the keyboard. <br><br>There is no transmission of voice.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007908.html"><b>Overpowered Song</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, Aradune, etc: Just how the hell was the song "over powered?"]</i></font> <br><br>You've explained it well just outlining what the song did: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It could stop a "SINGLE" blue from running at 25%<br>It could stop a "SINGLE" green from running at 50%]</i></font> <br><br>These stopped creatures would just sit there, essentially rooted, but passive, not fighting back. <br><br>Essentially, if the creature is fleeing, there is risk because he might flee into something that would cause the attacker a problem. If the creature was rooted, there would be risk because the creature would fight back. However, in this case he's fleeing and rooted, which is the problem.</UL>

Gordon made a big announcement on the Gameplay Board this evening regarding the implementation of voice recongnition technology in EQ.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007958.html">the thread</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>I see that word is filtering in that we've "Voice-enabled" EverQuest. I thought I'd open this thread to answer questions regarding the new feature.<br><br>To head off a few:<br><br>You must have a SAPI-enabled voice recognition engine installed on your system. We've tested with Dragon, and it works well, but if you use a different package, your mileage may vary.<br><br>The big question I can see is "why?". Plainly, we've implemented the technology to reduce keyboard dependance and make EQ more accessible to those with disabilities. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's post #2 in this thread:<UL>When you talk about SAPI-enabled clients, would clients like "Game Commander" work?<br><br><b><i>I'm not familiar with Game Commander. You might want to look into it to see if it supports the Speech API. If it does, it should work, but I can't vouch for any limitations that it might have. If someone out there with Game Commander would like to try it out and report back here, that would be great.</b></i><br><br>Also, how would do macros and such since you can't ALT-TAB out of EverQuest to set them up? Is there a way to "hook-in" and setup macros?<br><br><b><i>There is a specific supported command-list within EQROKManualSupplement.doc in your EverQuest directory. The extent to which you can customize individual abilities remains to be seen. I imagine that it will only be a short while before people start posting their VR profiles for the public.</b></i><br><br>Do you forsee the possibilty of client to client voice communication ever being implemented in EQ or are there other software packages that can do this now? It'd be pretty cool to have the option to connect to voice-chat via a simple command.<br><br><b><i>Voice-chat capabilities will most likely not be something that would be implemented as part of EverQuest. I have heard, however, that there are programs out there which work, and function independant of EQ.</b></i><br><br>I can appreciate extending the games features to assist disabled people, but really all you are doing is bringing functionality to frustrate even more people.. Someone needs to slap the tech manager over there <br><br><b><i>I do not agree that the implementation of new features that do not necessarily have any effect on those who choose not to use them has a negative impact. <br><br>Certainly I am sure that there are things that are more important to you, however everyone has a different opinion as to what is important and what should be worked on.</b></i><br><br>Voice recognition? Please see my previous post/thread I started today "Abashi: Your input on bugs / suggestions", but to make it short, there really are bigger problems in this game (mainly Kunark!!) that haven't been addressed at all since it was released (Anyone else been chasing disappearing monsters in Field of Bone lately?). <br><br><b><I>This is a completely different issue and is off-topic for this thread.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

When someone (or other small number of people) can't connect, it's a technical issue which can be handled in the technical support channel when someone is there and the channel is unlocked. When a bunch of people cannot get into game, it's best to be able to address them all at once, since it's usually the same problem. At other times, chat serves as way to call attention to an issue on a server, allowing the GM in chat to route a floating GM to the server, if none are online on that particular server at that time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) One explanation I've heard a lot is that the<br>problems with connecting to patch (1017 et al) are due to temporary server/network congestion right at the patch server. Well, how about hooking up two or three servers on DIFFERENT nets, naming them patch{1,2,3} and having the<br>game try one at random each time you try to connect? If that didn't work, try the next one the next time.]</i></font><br><br><br>We have a ton of different patch servers currently. The process of load balancing between these servers is transparent to the user, which might explain why some think we only have one. As for congestion on the patch servers, it only happens due to extraordinary circumstnaces. We provide as much overhead infrastructure as possible to deal with 99% of the things that can occur. The other 1% would take an additional infrastructure in lograrithmic fashion. That would only get 99% of that last one percent. The 1% after that would be an additional order of magnitude.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007679.html"><b>Ugly Robe from Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We said EschatonBlazar.

Such as more than 8 spell slots, everyone wants more, 10 would be good, But you all refuse to do it? WHY??]</i></font> <br><br>I can only address specific issues rather than something as broad as what "everyone wants". In regards to this, the 8 spell limit is one of balance. Spells are organized in many cases to provide an excess of spells that people would want memmed at all times. For that reason, they must decide what spells to mem given the limited pool. This provides tradeoffs and presents unique challenges in game. <br><br>On the broader issue of what "everyone wants", sometimes what people want is in conflict with other things that those same people want. People want to be entertained, and some suggestions, though being pleasing in the short term, would harm the "want" of long term entertainment. <br><br>To present a real-world analogy, I'm sure that everyone would like the government to give them a million dollars. However, were the government to do such a thing, rampant inflation would consume country leading to a lesser standard of living than what we have now. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007658.html"><b>/target (player's name) Command </b></a><br>This function will be in the next client patch.

Another tip for the EQClient.ini file was sent in by Ungwe:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings,<br> <br>    After several inquiries on the ability to customize our colors for actions, chat, ect... I decided to do a little experimentation with the following discovery.  If you will open your Paint program, which most everyone or their children have played with in Windows, click on the Colors button in the tool bar.  Than click on Edit Colors;  a small arrangement of colored squares appear with another tab called Define Custom Colors.  Click on that and you now have the color squares and a color pallet.  Under the color pallet is six areas with numeric values in them.  Notice the right column of numbers.  These are marked as;  Red, Green, & Blue.  If you click on the colored squares the numeric values in the red, green & blue boxes change;  ranging from 0 to 255.<br><br>    Thus the discovery of using the numbers the Paint program gives you to change the values in your eqclient.ini file to your liking.  You can of course further the customization of the color by moving the target around in the pallet or the arrow up & down on the slide bar to the right of the pallet.  <br><br>    Sure hope this helps someone.<br> <br>                    Ungwe Lonewalker - Eci'<br>                    Styyx Myythos - Rodcet Nife</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the tip!
