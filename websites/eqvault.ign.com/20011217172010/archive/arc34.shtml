Dewman sent me this report of a recent GM event on Cazic-Thule:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, that was a fun night folks. I was playing my Warrior in Lake of Ill Omen in the very early morning of Monday, Febuary 19, when things got out of hand with /ooc and /shout going across the chat screen. It got pretty nasty and someone /petitioned to the GM complaining about it since the immature ones would not keep quiet and let all the players enjoy the game. <br><br>Well, the GM got the /petition and decided to something about it. 3 GMs came in the zone in the form of Goblins. One was a Goblin Warrior, a Goblin Caller, and a Goblim Spiritist. They started slaughtering players under lvl 30 in the zone. Before the event began, a white text scrolled on the screen and it said... <br><br><b>"You noisy humans! Bad humans! We make you quiet now! Muhahahaha!!" </b><br><br>Initially I had agreed to this solution to teach the blabbermouths a lesson. I wanted to join in and aid the Goblins to slaughtered their enemies. I found the Spiritist and begged him to let me join them and heheh, no go, he rooted me and the Warrior came along hit me for 100s and killed me, heheh. No big deal there. There was no exp loss for me, but it was funny though. <br><br>I went back to my corpse and looted all my stuff and saw the Spiritist again and said hello to him and the Warrior snuck up on me and a trade window popped open. He gave me a Runed Lava Pendant. It was AC 5, Str +6, SV Posion +5. I was gonna thank him, but he was gone. I realized later he was invisible. He gave alot of people different prizes during the whole time. <br><br>This was my very first event and all the months I've played, I've never had the fortune to have been there until that night. Especially receiving a prize. I'll always cherish it. Unfortunantly, in all this excitement, I forgot to take screen shots. DOH! <br><br>In any rate, it was a night to remember and I thought I share this with everyone.:) <br><br>~Dewman~</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Sheesh, I've been at this since October, and still people get us mixed up. :)<br><br>Rangers are complicated. Give them enough offensive power and not enough defense, and they die a lot. Up their defense and they start to be more valuable in any group than a warrior. Neither solution works. Therefore, Jolt. <br><br>But if Jolt is too good, then the low defense of a ranger is no longer a drawback, and they again become overpowered... <br><br>It's very complicated. But I suspect that I understand it as much as almost anyone. <br><br>What you need to understand is that just because you have great offensive power does not mean that you can just use it as if it was a fire hose. Rangers need to learn the lessons that Rogues and Wizards learn early in their careers. Just because you CAN do a ton of damage, doesn't mean you should.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058045.html"><b>Feedback on New Spell on Test</b></a><br>Well, I just talked with the fellow that does spells. Due to other potential changes, it seems that this new Rune will probably not make it to the live servers. So you no longer need to worry about it being over costed or useless. <br><br>But the idea was a sound one. A very fast casting spell that any enchanter worth his salt would be able to get off, designed to help them survive an assault long enough to be healed or to get off a stun or for the enemy to be taunted off. <br><br>It was a good spell, and a great idea. But it's probably not going into the game. So there's no need to continue to worry about it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058411.html"><b>On Class Lists</b></a><br>Thanks. I seem to have missed a few for bards, though. <br><br>I ended up having to reformat them, the tables I used in Word make for really messy text posts... <br><br>I'm going to get the rest up today.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058397.html"><b>On Lute of the Howler</b></a><br>Lute of the Howler is not my primary concern, it's more of an example. I don't think that there should be items that grant out of class abilities, unless they are there for a specific reason. It may very well be that the Lute is just such an item. But I also don't like Invis on a warrior item, healing on mage items, direct damage on cleric items, summoning on bard items... <br><br>The Lute strikes a cord with me because the Werewolf form is probably THE signature form for enchanter, and giving it away seems wrong. Now I've heard there is an in-game story behind this that would favor its inclusion, and that's great. But that doesn't change my objection to the principle of giving powers from outside of the class, and especially signature powers, via items.</UL>The class lists will be posted in just a few moments.

Verant's Brad McQuaid was was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/cutting/20010215/t000013642.html">interviewed in the LA Times</a>.  The majority of the questions focuses on the EverQuest phenomenon and how it has remained popular for so long.  Here's a blurb:<UL><b>Q: What makes "EverQuest" so compelling? </b><br><br>     A: "EverQuest" has three primary areas of focus: character development, community building and an immersive world. Players build up their characters over time, acquiring experience, knowledge and possessions. And because of the social and interdependent nature of the game, players also develop relationships with other people. Both of these aspects create an ownership that compels players to keep playing over the long term, all the while exploring and experiencing a very immersive 3-D world. </UL>

Alan did drop by to write a few messages on the Gameplay Board today.  Here is what he said:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057632-2.html"><b>On Censorship</b></a><br>I've had my thoughts about the board format as well (shocking, isn't it). <br><br>While I certainly understand that some don't like the last post, time ordered format, it serves one distinct purpose here. It allows people to see what others are talking about. <br><br>If this was a first post dated board, for example, this particular thread would already be so far down the list that you would have received at most a few replies before your post was lost. People are too quick to forget the shear volume of posts that are made here. <br><br>Muttonchopps wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe "Bumping" threads is an exploit of the Official EverQuest message boards and will result in warnings place on your account and potentially suspensions/bannings.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, bumping threads IS against the rules of these boards, for the reasons that you have described. I don't know of anyone being warned for it yet, but that's certainly something we can do. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The "bump" is the only reason the more interesting topics get locked. I like reading those political threads. I like reading about the morality of dropping the A-bomb on japan. I like to hear the opinions of like-minded people on subjects like these. I could go to a hippie message board and debate that crap all night, but I don't won't because unlike those message boards I do care about what you people here think about it. Unfortunately the "bump" is keeping threads like those listed above from being discussed.]</i></font><br><br>Well, yes, I guess in a way it is 'bumping' that gets those threads locked. But only because such actions make those posts hang out on the front pages, rather than fading quickly away. If they were not bumped neither you nor I would see them at all (and you would not be able to read about the morality of dropping the A-bomb anyway).

Brian wrote and sent me this report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Today, on Xegony, a GM event took place in Freeport when a man named Torval<br>Rorson entered the city begging for help since he was being chased by two<br>Teir'Dal assassins.  The two assassins; named Zark Da`th and Valza`th, were<br>trying to kill Torval to keep him from giving his "information" to the<br>capatain of the guard.  Torval asked us for assistance in protecting him<br>from the assassins since the captain was out of town.<br><br>After gathering in East Freeport, we made our stand on the docks and waited<br>for the assassins to reveal themselves.  Our group of five managed to<br>vanquish both assasins and keep Torval from being slain.  Torval gave us 100<br>platinum pieces as a reward, and loot from one of the slain assassins<br>included a Stiletto of Bloodclaw, Enchanter Teir'Dal rapier, and a Goblin<br>Backstabber.<br><br>You can read a log file of the event here:<br><a href="http://www.buffnet.net/~camshaft/eventlog.txt">http://www.buffnet.net/~camshaft/eventlog.txt</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
