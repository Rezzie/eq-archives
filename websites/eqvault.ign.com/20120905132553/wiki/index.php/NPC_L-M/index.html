<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=NPC_L-M&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="NPC L-M">edit</a>]</div><a name="Lanys_T.60Vyl"></a><h3>Lanys T`Vyl</h3> is a Dark Elf avatar of Innoruk and arch enemy of Firiona Vie.  She is known as the “Child of Hate.” She has instigated many wars and evil deeds.
<p>The Moon of Blood is the most holy night for Innoruuk's followers, and occurs once every twenty-seven months. On this heinous night every follower of Innoruuk must murder a good being to honor his or her god. The dark elves have their own tradition on this night as well. The nobles choose a commoner to mate with and then sacrifice to their dark god.
</p><p>Nearly three score years ago, Vendela G`Kal, a high priestess of Innoruuk, attended the Festival of the Moon of Blood in the Neriak commons. As the festival progressed, she noticed an exceptionally fine looking common male in the throng. The high priestess bade him be her sacrifice to Innoruuk. She led him to her inner sanctum, where they copulated throughout the night. Spent, she fell into a deep sleep. When she awoke, the dark elf was gone. One year later, she gave birth. 
</p><p>The child born from this encounter showed remarkable abilities beyond that which any ordinary Teir`Dal possessed. Many saw this and tried to end her life, fearing her power and abilities. On the first such attempt, an ancient shadow knight saw the three would-be assassins and slew them as they made their attempt upon the Child of Innoruuk. After the battle, Innoruuk appeared before the Shadow Knight and assigned the Shadow Knight as teacher and protector of the Child, giving him a new and younger body as well. Under his tutelage, the child grew strong in both the art of combat and in the dark magics of Necromancy. She is now stands ready to bring hate across all of Norrath.
</p><p>Lanys T`Vyl is the Child of Hate. She is the embodiment of Hate, and carries herself with a deadly grace. Any who oppose her are subject to her unforgiving wrath, and those that follow her are promised glory. She is very loyal to those that follow her, as she cherishes her father's creations and looks upon them as her own, but mercy be felt for those Teir`Dal who would betray her, for their torments shall be everlasting. The Crimson Teir
</p><p>Innoruuk, God of Hate, created the dark elves by kidnapping the king and queen of the elves, who were created by Tunare, and twisting them to his own image. The result was a cruel subterranean dark-skinned race. The dark elves are the means through which Innoruuk plots to destroy the races of Tunare, Prexus, and Brell Serilis who made a pact to populate Norrath wit h the races they created. Innoruuk especially despises the elves and dwarves.
</p><p>The Crimson Tier
It is said that in the past, Innoruuk had a group of chosen Teir'Dal followers he employed to spread hate across the face of Norrath. These chosen were known as The Crimson Teir. Only the highest and most decorated followers of Innoruuk were chose to hold these positions. To each he entrusted a piece of armor that they were bound to, in life and in unlife. These relics allowed them to channel some of Innoruuk's power, and with their aid they sowed suffering and hate across the world. Though this pleased the Prince of Hate, he had ulterior motives, for he was already planning the coming of his Child.
</p><p>This armor, though it granted the owner incredible power, that power came at a terrible price. Each piece was bound to the soul of the owner, and slowly drained away the life essence of the possessor. These spiritually desiccated creatures would eventually serve as the tests he would pit his child against. The now physically ruined and mentally corrupted Crimson Teir can no longer comprehend their roles in the glory of their wicked master, Innoruuk. They know only bedlam in a hollow and endless existence of unlife.
</p><p>Acting on the advice of her teacher, Laarthik K'Shin, Lanys T'Vyl sets forth to reclaim the pieces of armor from the Crimson Teir, now scattered across the world. Her first test brings her to the old Teir'Dal city of Befallen to obtain the Abhorrent Bracers of Darkness. The following is a missive sent to Neriak by Laarthik K'Shin:
</p><p>The night began with a gathering of the Teir'Dal outside Neriak. They knew Lanys would appear, as it was her custom to do so at that hour. She was expected. I, however, was not. My arrival helped to unite the servants of Hate and defeat the heathens, which had dared to venture into Nektulos.  I was allowed to speak from the Great Rock, what we now call the Pulpit; I addressed those assembled with the following words:
</p><p>"From the time of my birth, in the age of the lost, I have seen our people divided by what has created us. I am an old, old man, given life anew by our Prince of Hate, and I was bade to teach young Lanys, the Daughter. This is now the time we join to change the face of Tunaria,  what you know as Antonica. The children of the weaker gods have been catered to and protected long enough! It is time for us to show our unified power! United, we shall make our name known that its merest utterance shall inspire unbridled terror. We shall stain the lands with heathen blood as a tribute to our Prince. Tonight begins the ascension of Lanys T'vyl!"
</p><p>Throughout my speech, many of the enraptured slashed themselves, spilling their blood upon the ground as personal offerings. With the arrival of Lanys T'Vyl, war chants and songs of praise rose throughout the crowd. A palpable energy seemed to flow from them, prickling my skin. What a joyous time for the Teir'Dal, one that shall not soon be forgotten. Now was the time to harness the rising tide of passion and hate, and direct it toward our goal. "We shall march on the Commonlands," I shouted, "and greet the first of the Crimson Teir. Young Lanys has determined their weakest link through her deep meditations, and tonight, we sever that link! Who will join in escorting the Child of Innoruuk to our common destiny?"
</p><p>We began our march on the Commonlands. There was one dissenter who decided to declare his own war at this time, trying to divide us. "The Crimson Teir have aligned themselves with the Freeport Shadowknights, and they are amassing a force outside the city!" We continued on to the Commonlands, however, not to be diverted from our goal. Upon entering the Commonlands, Lanys pointed, and spoke in dark-speech so all could hear, "We go to the western portion of the Commonlands."
</p><p>Defending the Daughter became a task, as many Kodiaks patrolled where we walked, but my sword arm never faltered. At last we reached the entrance to the lost city Befallen. The futile attempts on the life of the Daughter by paladins, druids and bards there grew tiresome. A druid in wolf-form brought a group of hill giants to attack, but knowing Innoruuk guided me that night, we were victorious over them. While we awaited the last of our army to reassemble, I shared a tale of our first encounter with the barbarians in their frigid land. Soon, it was time to mount our offensive.  
</p><p>Within Befallen, many light-dwellers employed the Guise of the Deceiver against us, but we saw through the glamour easily. The offending bard, enchanter and wizard were set upon by the throng and quickly dispatched.  We raged through the lost city to the third level, where we finally engaged Jerak T'Shir. 
</p><p>The battle lasted nearly twenty minutes. Many of the undead in that place joined in the fray, assisting their own against us. Lanys was badly injured, and I was unable to heal my student.  However, there in the midst of the chaos, one of our own brave clerics healed the Daughter, pledging to protect her. It was an inspiring sight!  The knight fell, and his Bracer latched onto Lanys as the new owner. She smiled grimly, then bowed her head in prayer. I took this opportunity to reward the fallen knight's barbed leg plates to the young cleric, promising that in time, she, too, would have a teacher, one that would show her just what her fate as a Daughter would be. Lanys saw fit to take the coin from me and give it to a young dark one. Methinks she fancied him, but perhaps I will see him on the sacrificial table before her work is done. I leave you with this tale of the battle, and return to my duties as Teacher. --Laarthik K'Shin
</p><p>Several days after recovering the bracers of darkness, Laarthik K'Shin again appears in Nektulos Forest. He tells those of the faithful that the time of Lanys T'Vyl's second trial is at hand. This one he feels will be especially hard, there's no telling what is in store when you enter the lair of Najena.
</p><p>Laarthik gathers a group of those faithful to Innoruuk. Lanys appears, speaking to her followers in a cold, heartless manner. The party, afraid of the power that she possesses, remains quiet in a bowing stance before the Child of Hate. Lanys, Laarthik and the faithful dark elves journeyed to Najena to face yet another of the Crimson Teir'Dal.
</p><p>After passing through Lavastorm Mountains, they make their way to the Najena's dungeon. In the depths of this dark fortress, Lanys and her followers find Tovin D`Rin, the second Crimson Teir`Dal. This skeletal magician is protected by Agony and Strife; his roguish imp pets that Najena helped him create long ago. They are probably the most powerful creations the twisted Najena has ever created. Agony and Strife are linked to Tovin in such a way that he cannot be harmed while these pets remain alive. Lanys and her party fiercely slay Agony and Strife, leaving Tovin D`Rin open for attack. Tovin begins to panic and shouts "Mortal... NO! Agony and Strife have departed me. I am mortal again!" Lanys and her followers begin their attack on him weakening him with each hit. Once Tovin has been defeated, Lanys finds herself in possession of the Abhorrent Boots of Darkness.  For his assistance with the battle, Laarthik rewards the most devout warrior of the party with his blackened iron bastard sword. Lanys and Laarthik then return to Neriak. 
</p><p>"Through magic, The Crimson Teir is bound. Through hate, The Crimson Teir is strong. Through age, The Crimson Teir is wise. Feeling the connection sever between their members, they flee to the far corners of the lands, in futile hope that they will be forgotten. If it were only so simple..." In his dreams, Laarthik sees visions in pairs: fire and stone, primitives and gnomes, and two faces marked in red. He awakes with a start, immediately knowing where next his path leads.  Laarthik K`Shin quickly confronts the dwellers of Neriak, the children of Innoruuk. He warns them of the difficult tasks that awaits Innoruuk's chosen child. As he explains to them the journey they must take, Lanys T`Vyl appears before them in her usual powerful and threatening fashion.
</p><p>The adventurers make haste to Solusek's Eye where the last of the Crimson Teir awaits. Upon entering Lavastorm Mountains, Lanys is attacked by a high elven assassin. He fears her power over the dark elven nation and what she might bring upon Norrath. He is no match for Lanys and her followers, however.
</p><p>Deep in the tunnels of Solusek's Eye, Enchantress Mydraa K`syk and the thief Talia K`syk make a hopeless effort to flee the coming of Innoruuk's chosen child, for they know that with each member of the Crimson Teir that falls, Lanys grows in power.  Realizing that they will not be able to escape quickly enough, they charm four inhabitants of the caverns to defend them. These Stolen Clockwork XDCV units are formidable warriors, but provide only a small amount of protection against the Child of Hate.
</p><p>Upon reaching the Crimson Teir, Lanys's followers engage the guardians. Many of them perish. "Defeat them!" Laarthik K`Shin shouts. "We must defeat them for the Child of Hate!" As the last of the Crimson Teir falls, the last pieces of the Abhorrent Armor of Darkness affix themselves to Lanys. At that moment, a circle of flame surrounds her, and she is rocked by waves of violent power. Lanys T`Vyl becomes the true child of darkness and hate. 
</p><p>The Search for Lanys T’Vyl
After the events of Bloody Kithicor, the Teir`Dal were left without answers as to what happened to Lanys T`Vyl. The King and Queen of the dark elves charged Vizier D`Kalz, a priest of great power, with the task of finding the answers to their many questions.
</p><p>Vizier D`Kalz calls a gathering at the skeleton stone in Nektulos Forest for all to witness the summoning of Laarthik K`Shin's spirit. The summoning is successful and Laarthik comes forward in a ghostly form. He tells them the story of Bloody Kithicor from his perspective, how his invocation to the mysterious stone opened a portal to the plane of Hate, through which Innoruuk snatched Lanys to save her. Tunare used the opening of the portal to her advantage as well, banishing Lanys's corporeal form from Norrath. 
</p><p>Laarthik also explains to them about the act of shifting spirits. Being an elder Shadowknight and a practitioner of the dark magics, he knows that spirit shifting is indeed possible. He speaks of a Gnome necromancer named Falrazim Zaftamor that has done this. He tells them the story of this powerful gnome.
</p><p>"Falrazim has successfully spirit shifted into the body of a drake to prolong his fading physical life. In the form of a drake, Falrazim's has found that the dragon magic is completely different from the arts of necromancy, and only those born a dragon can comprehend its usage. Unfortunately for Falrazim, the gestures and incantations necessary to the practice of necromancy are impossible in drake form. He struck a deal with Meldrath, where Meldrath would help change Falrazim back into a Gnome if Falrazim first helps him complete several tasks. However, Meldrath's tasks have lasted for over 300 years, and Falrazim is growing very restless. He now seeks an alternative to Meldrath's help."
</p><p>Laarthik informs them that they can find Falrazim within the Steamfont Mountains. He is needed for his knowledge to bring Lanys back to Norrath, and should not be harmed.  Vizier D`Kalz sends a party accompanied by Dolis Sha`vlal, a revered Shadowknight and survivor of the Battle of Bloody Kithicor, to Steamfont to speak with Falrazim. 
</p><p>In Steamfont Mountains, Falrazim Zaftamor is approached by Dolis Sha`vlal and the others. After hearing of what happened, Falrazim agrees to help them under one condition. They are to find him a new host as well, and use the stone to transfer his spirit into it. Falrazim would never be so eager to help anyone or admit to such weaknesses, however he is in quite an odd situation and has been for the past 300 years.
</p><p>Falrazim gives a note with the spell needed to seize the spirit and place it within the stone, and gives the stone itself to the highest-powered necromancer in the party. Dolis Sha`vlal and the party return to Neriak to get further orders from Vizier D`Kalz. Falrazim waits in Steamfont for their return.
</p><p>Back in Neriak, they tell Vizier D`Kalz of what they have learned and inform him that they need two hosts. Vizier D`Kalz sends them to the Plane of Hate to capture the soul of Lanys T`Vyl and bring it back to Norrath.
</p><p>Upon entering the Plane of Hate, they search for Lanys. Once they find her, a brief interaction ensues and the necromancer mutters the words. "Vethau N`Vac Reithos" he chants repeatedly as the other members of the party join in…."Vethau N`Vac Reithos" …"Vethau N`Vac Reithos" …“Vethau N`Vac Reithos" …Lanys's form collapses and her soul flows in a blood red stream of light, shot through with bolts of blue, into Falrazim's stone. Dolis Sha`vlal kneels next to Lanys's inert body and removes the pieces of her Abhorrent Armor of Darkness.
</p><p>After returning to Steamfont, the party sees that Vizier D`Kalz and Falrazim Zaftamor are awaiting their arrival. The two hosts, stripped of their souls, lie upon the ground with blank faces. Falrazim gives the necromancer a note containing more text that must be read for the ritual to take place.  The necromancer begins to chant, "Ver mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... Ver tev'Ve." The others begin to chant as well. … "Ver mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... Ver tev'Ve"…"Ver mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... Ver tev'Ve" …"Ver mitra tec piof... Ver ir ostryl... Ver N'Vac.... Ver tev'Ve"  … Dolis Sha`vlal lays the Abhorrent Armor of Darkness onto the ground next to the bodies. As the Child of Hate's soul seeps from the stone, traveling to the host, the pieces of armor attach themselves to the body. Falrazim's soul, in turn, is pulled into the stone and is transferred to the gnome body.  Thus, the Child of Hate returns to Norrath.
</p><p>===League of Antonican Bards===<br />
This guild is for bards across Antonica. They are known for delivering mail, and are being sought after by Mayong Mistmoore himself. It remains to be seen if Mayong's hatred for the Bards has anything to do with poor mail service.   The League has two guildhalls, one in Qeynos and the other in Freeport. In North Freeport can be found Marsheart's Chords, where Caskin Marsheart trains young bards. In South Qeynos can be found The Wind Spirit's Song where guildmaster Belious Naliedin teaches. The League supports The Knights of Truth and the Guards of Qeynos in their fight against corruption. In addition to Mayong Mistmore, the bards oppose the Ring of Scale. (Allakhazam’s Magical Realm)

Their tragic fate was a result of their involvement with the evil Vahlai Ka`Izal.
<p>The voices boomed from the city of Kelethin in a glorious cheer of celebration. Lorisyn Oakwynd shouted "Brothers and Sisters of the Forest! Come join the rest of your nation on this day. Today, the battle rests, and the Festival of Faydark's Children shall be held!" 
</p><p>In the small valley leading into the Butcherblock Mountains, a small band of dwarves marched into the forest. A mule pulling a wagon carrying three large barrels, each the height of an elf and the width of a dwarf followed closely behind the dwarves.
</p><p>King Tearis Thex, the high elven king, welcomed everyone to the celebration. "During this past year the Mother has shown much generosity to our people. The restoration of my daughter and your princess, Firiona Vie, has been only the crown of the Mother's gifts to us this year. To all of you, I give my best wishes and though I am your King, it is not necessarily I who has brought you here today. It is your hearts, your spirits… the very things that make you of the Fier`Dal and Koada`Dal nations, that have brought you here. To you, I raise my glass. May your blades prove strong, your bows aim true, your hearts remain pure and The Mother, may she bless you with every year being twice as good as the past. To old friends…" 
</p><p>Firiona Vie, Thubr Axebringer, and Sionachie reunited with their friend from long ago, Lorisyn Oakwynd. They also received the wonderful news of Lorisyn's twin sister, Lyirae Oakwynd. They all took in the celebration of the Faydark, rejoicing in their reunion.
</p><p>As the afternoon became the evening and the sun began to set in the purple silvan sky, long shadows were cast by the mammoth trees of the forest. The King took his leave for the evening. Raising his glass into the air and he nodded solemnly to the crowd. In a loud, regal voice, he said, "To you, I raise my glass. May your blades prove strong, your bows aim true, your hearts remain pure and The Mother, may she bless you with every year being twice as good as the past. To old friends…" 
</p><p>The King smiled to Firiona, raising his glass to her and her comrades. "And to old ones, may they remain true to their worth, and sharp with their tongues." Tipping his head back the King raised the glass to his lips and in one swift gulp finished the wine, his elegant stature remaining unchanged. The regal elf tossed the glass, shattering it on the ground at his feet. As the glass broke, the crowd did the same. The sound of shattering glass echoed under a blanket of cheers. The revelry continued long after the king made his exit.  
</p><p>Suddenly, lightning split the sky and struck the grass-carpeted floor of the forest. Two shadowy figures appeared between the four spires in the center of the ancient ruins from the Combine era and made their way quickly and silently through the forest, toward the sounds of the celebration.
</p><p>A large pasty-skinned ogre with square, chiseled features rose up from his hiding place, a crevasse between the gates of Felwithe and the hill the city is built upon. Firiona, her companions and the throngs of revelers took no notice of the Orc as he hefted an enormous boulder above his head. Ghargin Bumblok's face twisted with disgust as he hurled the boulder toward Lorisyn shouting, "Small elf, you die today under the rocks of Ghargin!"  Lorisyn Oakwynd was knocked forward as the boulder struck him, his shoulder dislocating as he fell to the ground. The music of the bards squeaked to a halt as a piercing scream echoed throughout the Faydark. The sounds of merriment ended abruptly as all stared upon Lorisyn in dismay.
</p><p>A female dark elven woman stepped forth from behind the crowd, her deep blue skin obscuring her from plain view in the twilight. Her ornate cape of blue and red flowed behind, and her hands began to glow with an eerie, pale light.  A troll towered behind her. Unlike most of his race, this troll's eyes shone with a wicked sort of intelligence that stood in stark contrast to the usual Trollish stereotype.  The woman was Vahlai Ka`Izal.  She bellowed, "Lorisyn Oakwynd! Your day has come. Rogkasth, Ghargin… kill him… And his friends should they interfere." Turning her hate filled eyes toward Firiona, she added, "If the wench assists, leave her to me."
</p><p>"Aaaaaaaarrrrrgh!" The troll Rogkasth let loose a ferocious battle cry. The enormous green skinned brute darted from the Teir`Dal's side. Charging into the crowd of people near the fallen elf, his weapons held high, he waded easily through the throng, toppling any whom would stand in his way. Pushing aside everything in his path, he plowed and bashed his way through the crowd ignoring the blows and small cuts he received in the process. Those strikes true enough to pierce his dingy plate armor and wound him were quickly healed, leaving nothing more then a hard wart-like growth and scar tissue behind thanks to natural regenerative properties of the Trollish race.   It was clear that Rogkasth wanted to make his way to the critically wounded Lorisyn Oakwynd. His twin sister Lyirae cried out, "Nooo! Somebody stop them!" Her voice shook with fear, "Lorisyn!"
</p><p>Vahlai raised her hands slowly as they pulsed with blinding light blue energy. Facing the palms of her hands toward each other and then moving as quickly as a viper, she swung both hands downward, crouching as she did, releasing the energy toward Firiona.
</p><p>Firiona was struck with the force of a thousand blizzards. Her whole body numbed and stinging, she dropped to one knee under the force of the blow. The now frozen grass shattered like crystal under her knee. Rising to her feet again, she ran toward Vahlai. Her legs were so numb, she could scarcely tell if they were still attached. She shot a quick glance at her sword to be sure it was still in her hand, as her arms had little feeling as well. As she ran, she noticed the Teir`Dal's hand held out, palm down, at her side. Energy of an orange-yellow color rose from the ground.
</p><p>A crowd surrounded Ghargin Bumblok, the Ogre who scored the first crippling blow to Lorisyn. Despite his enormous strength, the Ogre was unable to get any closer to Lorisyn. Rogkasth, on the other hand, was making headway through the throngs. Breaking through the final line of resistance, he looked Lorisyn directly in the eye. Lorisyn stared back bravely despite the weight of the malevolent gaze of the troll. Pulling forth another boulder, the troll raised it above his head.
</p><p>Firiona closed the distance between she and the Teir`Dal quickly but before she was able to get within swords reach of her, Vahlai swept her glowing orange hands forward toward Tunare's chosen. This time, Firiona was engulfed in flame. Her extremities, which had only a moment ago had begun to regain feeling, felt as if they were pierced with glowing hot needles. Fighting back against the pain, she raised her sword high and brought it down onto the body of the Dark Elf. The sword bounced back off the Vahlai's skin, the vibration causing the tormented nerves in Firiona's hands to scream out at her in protest. Ignoring their cries, she continued her attack against the dark elf determined to break her way through the wizard's magical protection.
</p><p>The final stone fell from the murderous hands of the troll Rogkasth onto the body of Lorisyn with a sickening crunch. A death cry issued forth from Lorisyn's lips, his head turning awkwardly to one side and blood streaming from his mouth. Rogkasth stood, his arms hanging limply toward the ground from the throw of his final boulder. The sea of angry festival attendees grew silent for just a moment.
</p><p>Noticing Rogkasth's success, Vahlai Ka`Izal shouted, "It is done! Rogkasth, Ghargin, come now! Firiona Vie, do not think this is the last you will see of us." With amazing speed, the three broke loose of the crowds each running in a different direction. Some folks ran in pursuit but despite their best efforts, the three were quickly lost in the darkened forest.
</p><p>Lyirae Oakwynd, her face paled, her mouth agape and eyes dull with shock said, "Lorisyn?" Shaking herself, she moved quickly through the crowd to her fallen brother's side.
</p><p>Turning her head toward the sky, she cried out, "No! Oh please… no no no!" Cradling the head of her brother in her arms she whispered, "Lorisyn… please don't… Please… dear dear Tunare, please do not let this… Lorisyn?"
</p><p>Firiona Vie walked somberly over to the elf, hunched over the body of Lorisyn. Seeing the elf gently cradling the body in her arms, Firiona stopped, her expression growing grim as she realized the truth.  Lyirae lowered her head as she turned the body over in her lap, cradling his head in her arms. "Lorisyn… please. They are gone now… you can stop pretending. They have left. Lorisyn… you can stop pretending… please…" She began to tremble as she ran her fingers through Lorisyn's sweat-drenched hair. Closing her eyes, she clenched her fist in his hair. She screamed, "LORISYN! No, please… Dear sweet Mother, no… Lorisyn," her voice trailed off into a whisper again.  Firiona Vie raised her hand to her eyes and wiping the tears away she went to Lyirae's side, placing her hand upon her shoulder. "I am sorry, Lyirae…"
</p><p>Lyirae Oakwynd turned swiftly, throwing Firiona's hand away from her shoulder. "You? YOU are sorry? He died for you… he DIED for you, Firiona Vie, and all you can say is that you are sorry?" 
</p><p>Regaining some composure, Lyirae Oakwynd turned her glare from Firiona, lowering her head to the twisted corpse of her brother. "Forgive me, milady. I have not the right to blame you," she said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. "Why? What reason did they have? That is all I wish to know. They called your name, milady. Why did they target him?"
</p><p>Firiona Vie raised her hand to her face and wiping the tears away once more said, "I am sorry, Lyirae, but I have not the answer for the question you ask me. I know that you need an answer and the truth is that I can not provide that to you. I am sorry for this, Lyirae. I am sorry for his death…"
</p><p>Looking up at Firiona once again, Lyirae asked, "Who were they, Firiona?"
</p><p>"They have been enemies of ours for… How long, I can not say."
</p><p>A gentle breeze swept through the forest. The leaves of the trees danced softly on the wind. Rushing quickly through the crowd, the strange zephyr slowed as it found the circle around the corpse of the elf. Softly washing over the elven woman kneeling at its side, the wind then faded leaving the forest deathly quiet once more. 
</p><p>It has been said that the wind carried the spirit of Lorisyn. That the wind spoke to Lyirae, strengthening her and urging her to take her his place at Firiona's side. Whatever was the case, the young and frail Wood Elf was never the same from that moment forward and indeed began to become strong and brave, as was her brother.
</p><p>Lyirae Oakwynd, reached over and gently took the bow from her brother's hand. Holding Rain Caller in her now steadied grip, she raised her head to Firiona. "I will accompany you to wherever it is you go, milady. It is his wish."
</p><p>Firiona Vie closed her eyes, tilting her head to the side as if straining to hear a voice. She lowered her head, slowly opening her eyes and locked them with those of Lyirae. "Are you sure you are ready to venture with us, Lyirae?"
</p><p>Resolved, Lyirae answered, "Yes, Firiona. I know nothing of your future, but I am ready to face that with you nonetheless. My brother's efforts will not go wasted… not like this."
</p><p>Nodding, Firiona said, "Very well, Lyirae."
</p><p>Firiona and the others then made their way to Freeport, in search of the wizard Al`Kabor. Lyirae stayed behind in Faydwer in order to observe the appropriate period of mourning and to pay her final respects to her fallen sibling. While the others made their way back to their lodgings at that late hour to rest for the trip they would take the following morning, Lyirae stayed behind.
</p><p>Lyirae's voice boomed strong throughout the forest, a new tone of strength in her voice that was not present until now. "Tunare, we return to you your child.  Shelter him well, as he has sheltered you." Lowering her head to the corpse once more, raising the bow to the air, she declared, "Lorisyn Oakwynd, your legacy shall live on. In the hands of your sister, I take upon myself the weight you carried for so many years. Rest now, my brother, your time has passed."

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=NPC_L-M&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="NPC L-M">edit</a>]</div><a name="Miragul"></a><h3>Miragul</h3> was the first necromancer.  He discovered the Realm of Discord.
<p>One of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and more extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted to one school of thought or another. 
</p><p>He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept secret from the majority of students. The council was morally and ethically opposed to much of the information gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created for himself four identities, four separate countenances and names, and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that matter. 
</p><p>It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing desire to know all there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference – they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. 
</p><p>Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake called Winter’s Deep and he hid there for some time.
</p><p>While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men. 
</p><p>Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul’s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories he had created. 
</p><p>Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best to extend his life using magical meansightenment when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul’s time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and
Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him, and his journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of death haunted him daily. 
</p><p>The mage’s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul’s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to create portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death. 
</p><p>The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant’s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select few respected him and were  willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to wreak revenege upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past. 
</p><p>One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic’s goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he was experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he was given in Paineel. After some
</p>
<pre>time he discovered that which he had sought, a way to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war once again. 
</pre>
<p>Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. 
</p><p>In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p>Mordavin Telase
An evil follower of Bertoxxulous, he plotted to take over Qeynos.
</p><p>Here is an account of his exploits:
Mordavin Telase, the mastermind behind a grand conspiracy to overthrow Antonius Bayle and take control of Qeynos, was apprehended today. A grand trial took place but alas, Mordavin managed to escape. Details of the trial are below. 
</p><p>Mordavin was tried and charged with Conspiracy to Commit Genocide, Treason, Destruction of Sacred Natural Resources, Grand Larceny and Murder. After lively testimony from Earron Huntlan, Al`Kabor, Athrin Tashir, Rykonis Sw`Vaye and a host of other citizens, Mordavin's plan was exposed. He unabashedly admitted to each of these charges, thumbing his nose at the jurors and prosecutor. 
</p><p>The Bloodsabres sought to destroy all life in Qeynos and the surrounding areas in an effort to take control of the city. Mordavin and the Bloodsabres sought to summon the Avatar of Bertoxxulous and use his power to unleash a powerful and virulent plague that would extinguish all life as far as the Karanas. 
</p><p>Athrin Tashir testified concerning the thieves that were ransacking the Temple of Life and attempting to steal their sacred scrolls a daily basis. Ironically, the Bloodsabres needed the research of their mortal enemies in order to find a way to become immune to the very plague they were to unleash. Though  most of the scrolls were returned, a great number nevertheless fell into the hands of the Bloodsabres. The research was completed and a way devised to protect them from the plague found. 
</p><p>Al`Kabor revealed that the Runed Branding Irons would have been used to brand all those friendly to the Bloodsabres and their causes with a certain sigil. This sigil would have rendered them immune to the effects of the plague. The strange, obsolete words people were finding, when combined with the hidden runes found on the prime numbered diary pages found blowing around the city produced one of several incantations. These incantations are part of the spell that would have been used to summon the Avatar of Bertoxxulous. With the power of the Bertoxxulous, a powerful spell would have been cast that would have released a deadly and virulent plague, the likes of which almost no one would survive. Finally, the strange building materials were to be used to construct a rather large shrine to Bertoxxulous, that would be necessary for the summoning. 
</p><p>Holly Windstalker took the stand. She told that the waters in Surefall glade became tainted one day. She and Cros Treewind noticed the taint after drinking from it one morning and immediately alerted everyone in the glade. Though the rangers and druids caught it quickly and were able to purify the waters again, the mate of Mammoth too, drank the water. He became mad with sickness and ran away. In order to prevent spreading the disease, she and Cros both went into the wilderness until they recovered. The bear, perhaps sensing the familiar smell of Cros, found him and in its madness, killed him. In his weakened state, Cros was unable to defend himself and died by one of the creatures he swore to protect. Mordavin admitted that tainting the waters of Surefall Glade was but a simple experiment to test the virulence of the plague that was to be unleashed. It was also a way to settle some old scores with a long standing enemy. 
</p><p>Rykonis Sw`Vaye, in order to clear his good name as a legitimate business man, took the stand. Rykonis said that he was contracted by Mordavin to supply the man-power to mine and deliver supplies to the Bloodsabres. Rykonis used his connections (it is rumored that Rykonis works for Donovan, the leader of the bandits) to obtain the manpower necessary to complete the contract. The men mined the high quality granite from the mountainous areas of the Karana near Coldwind Shore and also delivered large supplies of paints. 
</p><p>Rykonis admitted to even using gnolls to accomplish this goal, saying that the job was so large, he was unable to get the men needed to complete the contract. So he appealed to his gnollish contacts for more labor. Gnolls tend to work cheaply and are good laborers when properly motivated. He provided his very own stylish Brooch to those that worked for him as a form of identification so he knew who should be paid and who shouldn't. 
</p><p>Mordavin became angry at Rykonis for double crossing him and vowed revenge. It was shortly thereafter that several zombies, Rotting Sentries, crawled up from the sewers and began to assault the citizens. In the confusion, one of the zombies managed to free the bonds on Mordavin's hands and he gated away to an unknown location. 
</p><p>Lord Vegalys Keldrane, Magistrate and advisor to King Antonius Bayle was charged with the duty of apprehending Mordavin. 
</p><p>Calling for assistance from the local populace and relying upon the reports given him by the Rangers of Surefall Glade, Vegalys and the group set out into the Karanas in search of Mordavin. With the help of the tracking skills of the rangers and druids in attendance, Mordavin's hiding place was eventually found. 
</p><p>Vegalys demanded that Mordavin give himself up and was instructed to come along peacefully. Mordavin had nothing but insults for the Magistrate. After heated words were exchanged, the Arch Priest of the Bloodsabres became enraged and attacked Vegalys. 
</p><p>A battle ensued between the Arch Priest and those that were to be his captors. After several minutes of fighting, Mordavin was seriously wounded. Realizing that he was out matched and out numbered, he gave himself up. However, the words he spoke upon his surrender were eerie. He stated that though he may be captured, he was not defeated, saying that they were too late to stop the events that had been set in motion. Vegalys took the foul priest into custody and he was taken to Qeynos, where he currently languishes in prison awaiting his sentencing. 
</p><p>Antonius Bayle was so impressed by the successful and efficient capture of what was surely the most wanted and reviled criminal in the history of Qeynos, that he offered a title and his very own shield to the leader of those that assisted Magistrate Vegalys Keldrane in the capture of this fiend. With Mordavin captured and behind bars, Qeynos citizens and the residents of Karana may now sleep peacefully.
