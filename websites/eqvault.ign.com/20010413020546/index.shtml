Alan spoke for a while on the status of the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000087.html">Class Talk Threads</a> in a recent update on the Dev Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL><i>We have been receiving a fair amount of mail regarding the status of changes to classes based on the items brought up in the class talk threads that I started a while ago. Right now I have little new information for you, but let me spend a moment talking about this.<br><br>The team has read and reviewed the lists that I put together. We've had several informal discussions about them, and a few formal discussions about specific items on those lists.<br><br>So far you've seen a lot of changes based on your input. They have been going into the game as they get finished and tested. Things that didn't require a lot of in-depth investigation on our part, such as changing the Bread Pants for Bards, increasing the drop rates for many Kunark spells, fixing the Track Corpse spell and many others.<br><br>And even some of the more complicated issues have been looked into. Things like giving Druids and Shaman the ability to act as secondary healers, upgrading Mark of Karn (a very complicated spell to balance), the aggro created by debuff spells (and, yes, the aggro created by healing spells), and others that have required a lot of consideration have been added or changed.<br><br>We've also started on some of the much more complicated issues, such as Wizards and their ability to do damage against certain NPCs with the Bane spells.<br><br>To finish the lists we'll have to make the time to have some long and complicated meetings over issues that can't be changed without rather a lot of effect on the game world. We have not had those meeting yet. Recently we decided that we would put PvP issues to the forefront, considering that lack of attention they have had over the life of EverQuest.<br><br>I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten the issues that you brought to our attention.<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

If it is intentional, I guess it goes here, if not it goes in the bug board. <br><br>The panic animal spell gives no message when it lands. As it works now, the only way to tell if it lands is if it doesn't give a resist message. <br><br>The undead fear spells give a message, the regular fear spells give a message, and every other spell that I have ever used gives a message when it lands, so I'm guessing that this is an oversight and should be corrected. <br><br>This spell has become a very vital soloing tool for rangers since it has been put in, and I can't believe no one else has mentioned it. <br><br>If you guys can't think of anything creative to put in as a message, I would suggest just re-using the regular fear message. <br><br>Oh, and if it is supposed to be this way, an explanation why this spell having no message is the exception to every other spell out there would be nice.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, I have to admit that my first thought was, 'if the animal runs away, then you know the spell worked&#8230;'. <br><br>But for consistency's sake we've added success messages for those spells. You should see them after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000086.html"><b>Pathing Problems?</b></a><br>Normally we would want you to send your pathing problems to the Quality Assurance &#8211; Testing form, but I wanted to bring special attention to this for a while, and to respond to a comment that we received. First, the comment: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: Pathing at the Ry'gorr camp in Eastern Wastes <br><br>This has been something of a problem since I've hunted there. It can be avoided, but sometime it can be fatal or abused. Let me explain: <br><br>The pathing inside the main house at the Ry'Gorr camp in the Eastern Wastes is horrible! It's almost non-existant. For instance, if you pull anything from inside the house, you have to be careful not to outrun it and keep it in a straight line and lead it out the doorways. The orcs are programmed to run in a straight line towards you, no matter what. <br><br>If you do not lead them out yourself and they get caught in a wall or doorway, they continue to run in place trying to get to you. After about 15 seconds or so, they will "magically" drop from the sky and attack you. Most of the time, they get in a few free hits. I have found that it doesn't matter how much distance you put between you and the orc, whether you are running or standing still, or any other variant makes a difference. They WILL catch you. And these free hits can be fatal if you are a caster, especially if the Chief is along. Even if you survive, these orcs run at Jboot speed and are now in the correct distance to keep smacking you til you die. <br><br>Another problem area is the balcony in the chief/oracle room. If you stand anywhere close to that doorway but don't enter the room, you pretty much can assure yourself that you have aggroed the Chief and his Elites. Again, with the fact that they run in a straight line towards you and you don't see the message that they have aggroed on you, it's a rude awakening to have all 3 of them drop from the sky on you. <br><br>This also works for any orc that happens to spawn on the walls outside the house if you sit in the house. They aggro on you and drop from the ceiling and begin combat. Sometimes they land on the roof and continue to hit you. <br><br>There is only one time where these orcs follow any kind of pathing, and that is when you fear them. Then will run from whatever direction they come from, counter-clockwise around the bonfire room, and out the doorway. They then run outside the walls of the camp and continue up the hill and into the snow. <br><br>Another problem I had was I was fleeing from the Chief. I ran completely outside the camp and up a nearby hill. Being a level 51 necro, I always have DMF cast on me and I proceeded to run off the hill and float over the wall and back into the camp, making a break for the Crystal Caverns orb. Now when I made the wall, the Chief was close behind me but had not caught me yet. I get to the gate and try and open it. Now, this is the only gate in the game that I found hitting the "U" key does not open. In fact, you miss half the time trying to left click that gate to get it open. Can you also check into why you can't hit "U" and open it? Anyway, I finally get the gate open, just barely get inside when the Chief appears and slays me instantly. He managed to get by a wall and a second room wall to get to me in a matter of seconds. <br><br>Now the place where this can be abused is the fact that you can turn the orc tactics against them. This tactic is mostly used by wizards and druids. They run into the house invisible and target themselves an orc. Then they run outside the house and get as far as possible and snare the targetted orc. They can still cast at the orc even though they are outside and the orc is inside. This usually gives them many free hits before the orc appears and hits them. <br><br>So my question is this: Is there a way to fix the pathing in this camp? Possibly give these orcs a set way to run out of the camp and avoid getting snagged running in place? I know it's part of an outdoor zone so the "line of sight" doesn't apply it seems... but perhaps at least giving the orcs a way to stop dropping from the sky would be great. They already run very fast so I don't see where the extra time would hurt. <br><br>Thanks for looking into this if you can! I hope to avoid another 5-death day like I had a few weeks ago due to this pathing. <br><br>--Cy ]</i></font><br><br>First of all, I wanted to thank you for the detailed description. It helps us a lot in these situations when you give us all the details. The only item that you didn't send us that might have been useful would be a few /locs for key problem points. These make it a lot easier for us to find specific areas that need attention. <br><br>The bad news is that there isn't much that we can do to fix this problem. The code that allows the NPC to pop directly to you is needed in the zone to prevent exploits. And it seems that you know how to avoid the problem, it just requires that you be very careful when pulling not to get too far ahead of them. <br><br>Now, on to my request. <br><br>What I would like to ask all of you is this. Reply to this post with places that you've found pathing problems. We can't fix them all, but we want to know about them and fix the ones that we can fix. Like I said, normally we would want you to send such things to the Quality Assurance folks. And after a short while I'll probably just lock this thread and ask you to again send your pathing issues to Quality Assurance. But for now I'm hoping to generate a few more responses on this issue so that we can focus a little effort on it. <br><br><b>Please</b> be specific about the location and NPC names involved. But at the same time please try not to include a lot of extraneous information. We don't really need to know about the whole adventure that you had to get to the pathing problem, just the problem itself.

Raises interesting questions, if it's not a hoax. The essence of the rumor is that foods made with the Baking skill (didn't see if it was all foods or just some recipes) can now confer stat bonuses. They can also be right-clicked to be eaten immediately, but last half the duration of other foods (i.e. you get hungry again sooner). <br><br>1) Will you eat the food automatically if it's at the top of your inventory? If so, who would ever right-click on it if you could get full-duration effects by always eating baker-made food? <br><br>1a) If you do automatically eat the baker-made food, does that simply mean that consumption rate is doubled? Kind of a poor trade-off for first having to either raise your tradeskill or buy the food (at what will be sure to be inflated prices) from skilled bakers, then have it only last half the time a regular stack of food would? <br><br>1b) Does the food's effect last until you next consume food, or does it wear off sooner? Or does it possibly decline slowly over that period (decreasing the effect as you get "hungrier")? <br><br>2) Do multiple foodstuffs have stacking effects? For instance, could I click on three different foods to eat them all, and get three stacking stat bonuses, or would the second overwrite the first, third overwrite the second, etc.? <br><br>3) Any foods planned to affect not only stat bonuses, but saves as well? Something like Polar Bear Pie (just made that up) which gives +5 SV Cold? Edible Goo gives +2 SV Poison? <br><br>4) When will Brewers be able to make drinks that do something besides get you drunk? I'd like to be able to brew a drink that confers (albeit small) beneficial effects with no negative effects... even it meant that the drinks lasted half as long like baked foods. Brew some Green Tea and get a stamina boost, or Hot Chocolate to get SV Cold... You get the idea. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Feydakin ]</i></font><br><br>There is a patch message on Test server that explains most of this. Let me copy the pertinent part of the patch message: <br><br><i>quote: <br><br>Baking and Food Changes: <br>Now when you right click on a food or drink, it will describe how sustaining that food or drink is. *Note* The message and food values are subject to change over the next week or two as they are being balanced. <br><br>Now you can right click on a food or drink item to consume it just like alcohol. Currently consuming food this way only provides half of the sustaining value of the food. There is also a limit as to how much food and drink you can consume at once. <br><br>Some player prepared foods and drinks now have statistic modifications. These are once again most likely to change during the next week as they are being balanced. </i><br><br>So let me answer your questions to the best of my ability. Keep in mind that all of this is still being tested. It is entirely possible that none of this will go live, or that it will end up working differently when we're done testing. <br><br>1) Yes, you will still consume the topmost food and drink (excluding alcohol) in your inventory. You might prefer to choose to eat a food for a few reasons. Your character might be a glutton. Or, more likely, you might want to gain the benefits that can be gained from eating a certain food type right away rather than waiting for it to be eaten naturally. <br><br>1a) I'm not sure I understand the question, so I'll shotgun some answers. Each food item will have a duration that it feed you. Automatically eating them allows them to last that given duration. Forcing them down your throat will only allow them to last half as long as they would normally. The sustenance duration of player made foods will be set at whatever value seems appropriate. I doubt that all of them will last half as long as store bought foods. In fact, I would imagine that they will in some cases last longer. Remember, not all player made food will have some special bonus to it. <br><br>1b) I don't know how bonuses from food will be treated. I'll know more once we've fiddled with it a bit. <br><br>2) Much like my answer to 1b), I don't really know. We'll let you know more when we've finalized more. <br><br>3) Actually, the only food item that I've heard about so far specifically is the Scorpion Sandwich that was the first one created to test with. It gave (and might still give) a +1 to poison saves. <br><br>4) I don't know the specific plans for brewing. Again, I'll have more details once we've more testing time. <br><br>I'm sorry that I don't have more details on this. It's still early in testing and I don't have a lot of details for you. But I think you'll like the results. I'll get back to you with more information when we're closer to finalizing it all.</UL>

Alan kicked up a few of his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000074.html">thoughts and impressions</a> taken from the recent Fan Faire event in San Diego recently.  Here's the post directly from the Developer's Corner:<UL><i>As a follow up, I wanted to thank everyone that attended the Faire, both players and staff. It seems that everyone had a good time. It's always nice to meet people with similar interests. I went home with a few impressions:<br><br>Players on PvP servers are <b>not</b> mean in person. :) I don't know how it is that I gained, someplace in the back of my mind, the idea that players on a Zek server would be sort of dangerous in person. I'm sorry if I don't remember any names, but I wanted to thank the father-son team that spent so long talking to me and making me laugh.<br><br>Even the old jokes are kinda funny if you're in a room with a lot of other people that can groan at them with you. For a few years now we've been hearing the same camping, spawning and SoW jokes. They actually seemed a little fresher when in a room full of 1,200 people that understood them.<br><br>It does rain in San Diego. I know it's not my fault, but I'm sorry that it decided to rain on us all at the Faire. It doesn't seem fair&#8230;<br><br>I just wanted to let you all know that the Live team had a lot of fun. We talked a bit about it in the meeting today, and it seems that we all had a good time. I wanted to express their thanks to you all for making it so.<br><br>And it was nice to see people cheering for their GMs and praising their Guides. Those folks work hard to help people out, and I was glad to see that you folks were so kind to them, they deserve it.<br><br>But Fan Faire is about the fans. So I was wondering what you all thought about the event. If you have any non-dirty tales to relate, let me know. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Here's the round-up of the few updates Alan made to the Developer's Corner today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000082.html"><b>Plane of Mischief Items To Become No-Drop</b></a><br>There is a rather extensive list of items from this plane that will become No Drop with the next patch. I'm not going to list them all, as it's probable that some of these items are unknown to many at this point, and I'm not going to spoil any surprises. <br><br>So if you have any items that originated in the Plane of Mischief that you were thinking about trading, do so before the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000084.html"><b>Sit On & Off</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Subject: A Few changes <br><br>I have only two suggestions. First, since there is a /sit command, why not a /stand command? Currently I have to type /book and then hit "i" to stand up that way. <br>The second was more of a question than a suggestion. I heard rumors a while back about letting the players buy in bulk. That is to say, buy more than one of an item at a time, like full stacks if we wanted to. I don't see why this would be a problem. If it is the fact that maybe we don't have the money for it, then just let it buy as much as we have money for. Am I making sense? Anyway, I would appreciate an e-mail response if it is possible. Thank you. <br><br>Emoth Lasundi of The Guardians of Innoruuk<br>Karan Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, programmers are an unusual lot. When setting up the /sit function they treated it like any other function that just toggles between two states (in this case, sitting and not sitting) <br><br>The command is /sit on (which can be shortened to /sit) and /sit off (which makes you stand). <br><br>I just use the Stand/Sit button and turn it into a hot key. <br><br>We're still looking into purchasing in bulk. It's not that we don't want to do it, we most certainly do. It's just that it will take a bit of programming and testing to get it working properly. Selecting stacks in more complicated when you're talking about merchant inventory. We'll let you know when we get it done.<br>--<br>Bhalbert wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Ack. sorry to submit twice: <br><br>On the subject of commands: MANY MANY commands can be carried out using ctrl and alt keys.

Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000083.html"><b>Bard Chains Doesn't Strip SoW</b></a><br>Fendryl wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Selo's Consonant Chain & Largo's Absonant Binding while acting like a snare effect don't strip SoW from creatures. ]</i></font><br><br>This is intentional. In fact, we went to a lot of effort to make it work that way. Snare slows the target down, but when the Snare wears off the target gets all of his movement magic back. We changed this, in part, because players didn't like having NPCs cast Snare on them and destroy their movement spells. NPCs get the same benefit.</UL>

Our esteemed Mr. Shadoe has been busy as of late.  Aside from his normal duties as a columnist and author in the EQ community, he's also traveled a good chunk of the country recently.  His latest <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865696,81679,">report centers around the Fan Faire event</a> held in San Diego over the weekend.  It is most definitely a read not to miss as this clip will show you:<UL>So, after 750 miles and $1000 later we discovered what was once kosher had suddenly turned into the proverbial Sausage McMuffin with Egg in the face of the Torah. This, friends, is what two years of volunteered time and service amounts to in the guide program. When someone's word is checked, double-checked, relied upon and it still falls through in the end, something is definitely not right. <br><br>Doubly so when you consider the fact that Verant's own Mrs. Butler didn't even have the guts to fight her own battles. Instead of coming out and denying us access face-to-face, she opted to enlist our gracious host, a GM, and an elder guide to do her dirty work as she hid herself behind closed doors. Mrs. Butler effectively quailed away from facing down a 5'6" housewife in the same way a tobacco company quails away from cogent empirical evidence. Such cowardice speaks volumes to this member of the press, and it paints a vivid picture of the way things can often be in the guide program under her majestic rule. But to be fair, what does one expect coming from an employee who just happened to be dating (and later married) a prominent Verant staff member at the time she was hired to fill the position? </UL>As always, a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=10642205&start=10642205">feedback/response thread</a> has been activated on our General Board.

Hitting the Developer's Corner after a big weekend, here's all of what Alan had to say today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000081.html"><b>The Cat Who Walked Through Walls</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Forgive the Heinlein quote, I couldn't resist :)<br><br>I am a new player, so this question may be long since answered but I could not find it anywhere so thought I would ask it anyhow. Creatures can see and walk through walls. This appears to be common knowledge, something I found out the hard way. <grin> <br><br>I was prepared to simply shrug and live with it until a madman came in out of the desert and killed me through a wall while I was shopping. Is there a plan in place to change/repair this 'feature'? <br><br>Again apologies if this is a repetition. Oh, and thanks for creating a new addiction for me! :)<br><br>Alerius the (all singing all dancing) Bard ]</i></font><br><br>Quoting Heinlein titles is fine with me. A good bard needs to be aware of the great bards, after all. <br><br>Yes, that question has been asked several times. But I'm more than willing to answer it again. <br><br>Creatures walk through certain walls on purpose. The huts and inns you see out in the plains of Norrath, such as those out in the Commons near Freeport, don't prevent the passage of NPCs because if they did they would be easily abused. For example, Hill Giants would not be able to attack a player character through the roof of the inn, but you might be able to stab at his feet. And creatures used to get stuck against the geometry of those buildings all the time. So, while we certainly understand that it seems strange to have a bear wander through the walls of a hut, it's something that needed to be done.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000080.html"><b>New PvP Server</b></a><br>Jera300 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'ver heard references that the next server to be released will be a PvP server. I am very excited about this, would it be possible that this will be a new server, instead of a split server? It would be nice to start out with everyone on the same footing (ie:less twinking). Any information on this would be helpful. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I don't have much to tell you all yet. We did announce at the Fan Faire that the next server we bring up will be a PvP server, and that that server will have some new rules. I'll announce more when we've firmed up the details.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000079.html"><b>Support For Windows ME</b></a><br>Bullshmidt wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor- <br><br>I was wondering if Verant ws planning on suporting Windows ME for Everquest. I was wondering this because many of the large computer manufactures (Dell, HP, Gateway and Compaq for example) are begining to ship their high end home computers with Windows ME pre-installed. <br><br>Thanks. <br><br>Sperhawk Rocsword<br>40 Enchanter, Rabid Reich<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>While we don't 'officially' support ME, EverQuest runs on it just fine. Let me, once again, just quote Kendrick, who seems to be the featured Dev guy of the week. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Everquest works fine with Windows ME. Most of the (very few!) compatibility issues were from the days when ME required you to install DirectX 7.0 as part of the OS, and EQ was still using DX5. <br><br>Since we did the switch to DX7 prior to Velious, it's something of a non-issue. <br><br>There may be some older graphics cards that don't have DX7/8 drivers, but those folks can't play EQ now, no matter what OS they're using. ]</i></font><br><br>So if you are running ME and are seeing issues, make sure that you've checked the other potential problems (usually sound or video drivers) before thinking it's the operating system. It might be something you can fix more easily than changing OS's&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br>StormFront wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I happened to be looking through various posts and discovered the Role-Playing or Just Playing comments. I thought I would just give my thoughts. <br><br>First I have a High Elf Paladin, and have wondered about the way others would precieve my character when he comes across gruff with the evil races. Not wanting to party with them and such so I created a Dark Elf ShadowKnight just to see what the attitude of the land was towards those characters. To my surprise most people seemed to enjoy playing the DE and even though they were despied it never seemed to affect them. On a couple of occassions I have witnessed true DE tactics at work. Once I saw a DE ShadowKnight ask to join a group which sent these RPs in total hysteria, just to have the DE walk off gleeful he had stirred them up. Take it for what it's worth. <br><br>I also have a Wood Elf Druid, I understand the statement that we are to be the protectors of nature. However there is a fine line and others have asked how a Druid could attack a wildlife entity. My answer has been that of what most Native American believe which is how I feel the Druids must have been like(Though I admit I could be totally wrong). Druids wish to protect there environment but understand that they must live upon it and have no problem with the hunting of an animal as long as the entire animal is used and not wasted on momentary gain or sport. The senseless killing of many animals would get to them, but using them for food or clothing is acceptable as long as done with respect to them and not meaning a massacare of everything. I work with tailoring but kill only to equipment myself and for food when I am low and a town or merchant is not available.<br> <br>However I can see instances where role-playing becomes difficult especially when stakes are high. When your after that important item or you have lost your corpse and can not locate it and it has the offering you have to make to your god for a specific quest (just an example). Would you be willing to bend your character to accomplish these? In real life you sometimes have to swallow hard and deal with a situation. Perhaps allowing a character to be designed with regards to who they can group with and who they can not, dependent on their deity. If you were to lock out charcters from grouping solely because of race or class then you lose a bit of the reality. Maybe instead they suffer a faction hit and will need a way to correct for it, just a thought. A kind of atonement for their transgression. Having a instance where a character can deviate from normal can add something to the fabric that we call Norrath, making the area even more unknown. I have enjoyed RPing sometimes it is just interesting to determine why someone might act the way they do and come up with the reason even if they are wrong or not. I myself would like the ability to select the races or classes that I might fear or shun, granted there should be automatics, since I could have a quirky personality and noone is quite sure why. <br><br>Sorry to be so long but that is my thoughts about it, I think it would be fun to play on an RP server! ]</i></font><br><br>I think it's great that you've taken the extra step to play on both sides of the fence. A lot of people will play a single class or race for a long time and perhaps fail to understand some of the issues involved in playing one of the classes that they don't normally get along with. I'm not talking about 'my class is better than your class' stuff, but about how the communities work. For example, I've gotten the impression over the last two years that folks playing Dwarves tend to be more likely to roleplay than others. I don't know why, or if it's even true, but I've played at least a little as every race in the game, and I think it's true. Or I've noticed that it is a lot easier to be in-character when playing a good cleric than an evil cleric. As a 'good' cleric, it's easy enough to heal people when they ask. But for an 'evil' cleric this just might not be in-character (though it can be). <br><br>It is always easiest to abandon roleplaying when it comes to the 'high stakes' stuff. The temptation is great. And most of the time it's in-character to do such things as dealing with a necro to help get your corpse, even if your character might normally never do such a thing. High stakes for the player is usually high stakes for the character as well (your character doesn't want to lose his stuff either). But there are cases where you should sacrifice what you want for what your character wants. When the two desires are not the same, roleplaying means putting the character's desires first. <br><br>And I do agree that it seems that the best way to 'enforce' any sort of roleplaying (though I don't really like the idea of 'forced' roleplaying) would be along the lines of deity restrictions. How easy that would be to do in EverQuest I don't know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I specialize in Halflings, and role-play everyone to the tee. It is my favorite part of EQ. I am the leader of a Small Races Only Guild and we exclusively roleplay, especially the worshipers of Bristlebane. <br><br>I think the idea of a Roleplaying Only server is great...only, could it be a new server where everyone has to start over at level one, no switch-over characters and high level twinks from other servers. That way everyone can start at the same level, and grow as a server together. Just a thought. <br><br>This board format is great!! <br><br>Apathos<br>From a lot of Servers and a lot of Personas, all Halflings ]</i></font><br><br>I know of a few Trolls that specialize in Halflings too&#8230; <br><br>IF there were to ever be such a thing as a server with rules built with roleplaying in mind, then it's my opinion that it would have to be a non-split server. You're right, a server like that would need to grow up under the new rules. <br><br>Dulc wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Up until March, my husband and I had played on only non-pvp servers. We love to roleplay, but eventually gave it up for the most part, because too many players reacted in a negative way. We had a paladin and cleric couple, for which the paladin was my Champion. He played it very chivalrous and honorable, no thees or thous, but maybe the use of "m'lady, m'lord, sir, mistress" etc. made people feel uncomfortable. We had reactions ranging from disgust to apologetic. There were a few that jumped right in and roleplayed with us, but for the most part it was a struggle. <br><br>Anyway, a friend offered to help us discover Tallon Zek through a roleplay story and we accepted. What a difference! Suddenly we were fearing for our lives, not just from npc's but from characters for which we had no idea what they might do. We are playing "shorties" and the added threat of the "dark alliance" has just enhanced the roleplay. This make me think that a roleplay server should be pvp, but with a safety net around the cities. On non-pvp servers, people can say whatever they wish with no reprecussions for the most part. But if a "light" race challenges a "dark" race in pvp, you may have the whole zone on your back. So yes, I personally am enjoying roleplaying a dislike of the evil races on Tallon Zek. But I wouldn't do it on a non-pvp server. Hope that makes sense. :)]</i></font><br><br>Well, it can be argued that the use of thee and thou wouldn't be appropriate for roleplaying in Norrath, as none of the cultures really use it, as far as I know. I've seen the same thing, though. People getting uncomfortable with use of more, um, flowery language. But then, I get uncomfortable around the use of words like 'plz' and 'r'. :)<br><br>Fear is a useful roleplaying tool. I don't think that it can be the basis of roleplaying in EverQuest on its own, though. I understand your point, though. The idea that you can attack another character based on whatever rules are set up tends to improve the interaction between those characters. On a standard server a High Elf is limited in the ways that he can express his dislike for Dark Elves in exactly the same way that he can't express his dislike of a rude Wood Elf. On Tallon Zek the High Elf has the ability to be more aggressive to a Dark Elf than to a rude Wood Elf, and that tends to make the willingness to be aggressive towards Dark Elves higher. <br><br>Kingfish01 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: No, no, no. You are absolutely wrong, and that's what frustrates me about EQ. <br><br>Your idea that "pacifists make poor adventurers" is patently false, but indicates why EQ is a challenge for roleplayers. <br><br>Now, I've enjoyed reading these comments and your responses abou this, but I must take issue with you. <br><br>Because of its design, EQ has no room for explorers, historians, cartographers, merchants, sages, hermits and evangelists (is not faith an important issue for EQ characters?). Why can't these characters exist? Because EQ only tolerates combat oriented roleplay. <br><br>Why can't players be multi classed, changing careers later in life? Why can't they experience conversion and change faith? I enjoy EQ, but your gameworld exists in a narrow box. <br><br>Adventure involves more than killing things, but EQ is almost exclusively about killing things. EQ is fundamentally a "kill something so you can kill something bigger" game. It's quests almost always involve the death of an NPC. But it doesn't have to be this way!!! <br><br>EQ SHOULD have ways for player to gain experience in other ways. The easiest would be to award experience for successful skill development. It should be possible for a player to be a 30th level blacksmith, tailor, or whatever, and still not be able to fight their way out of a paper bag. In theory, this is possible, but is unreasonable. Tradeskills depend on high level spells and materials, making it necessary for Master craftsmen to be also master casters for the most part. <br><br>Personally I think it is a programming cop-out to make almost all experience gain related to killing things. A little creative thinking could expand the roleplaying aspects of the game immensely, without sacrificing anything that currently exists. <br><br>Sorry for the rant, but it frustrates me that EQ could be so much better, but I don't see that happening. ]</i></font><br><br>Pacifists DO make poor adventurers. There's nothing false about that statement. <br><br>What I think you disagree with is that adventuring is a poor focus for roleplaying. I disagree. <br><br>While the focus of EverQuest is adventuring (much like most pen and paper games), it certainly doesn't exclude the roles that you've mentioned. Explorers certainly have a place in Norrath. Explorers in a dangerous world are basically adventurers anyway. Historians, cartographers, merchants, sages&#8230; all of these are not roles on their own. If you are playing a cartographer that likes to sit around the house and read maps, or a historian that likes to read history but doesn't like to talk to others about it, then you don't really need a multiplayer game. Hermit is so much not a roleplaying idea (sure, the GM could use it, but as a player character a hermit would never, ever, be in a game&#8230; Evangelists would be something that would be hard to do in EverQuest. <br><br>Yes, you can play a cartographer in EverQuest, and play one well. But I won't argue that such a character is somewhat limited by the mechanics and content of the game. Most certainly you can't make and sell (or give away) maps in game. That is partially a design limitation, but primarily a technological one. EverQuest does not have any sort of automated map making system by design. But then if it did, who would need a cartographer. As for drawing your own maps in game, that is more of a technology issue than a design one (or, if you want, it was a design decision not to develop the technology to allow such a thing). <br><br>But none of the careers you mentioned are directly prohibited by the game itself. In most cases where they are limited the limitation comes from technology or time restrictions, not a desire to hinder roleplaying. The best example would be your evangelist. Despite the fact that you can't actually change the little word(s) on the character description that the player sees, you most certainly could 'convert' people. You could convince them to work for the betterment of your chosen deity. You could convince them to do things that would bring their faction in line with the factions best suited to your deity. You could convert someone to your religion if the player of that character was convinced that his character would be converted. <br><br>No, the game doesn't really support such activity with gameplay features. We can't support all such features. I wish it were technologically and monetarily feasible. <br><br>Oh, and it is possible to be a 30th level tailor and still not be able to fight your way out of a paper bag. It would be really hard, but it could be done. <br><br>There's no cop-out here. To program a game (and get it done before the programmers die of old age) a feature set must be chosen. Some things won't make it, everything can't make it. <br><br>We just work day to day to get closer to the perfect game. <br><br>Sorry, that was a bit long-winded. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Part of the problem with roleplaying is the designers don't always consider those that want to roleplay when they do the quest. <br><br>Example: Iksar monks have to worship Cazic Thule, yet to do their Epic Quest, they have to gain the respect of the human monk guilds, one of which is dedicated to Quellious. An iksar "properly" roleplayed shouldn't have to do human quest. <br><br>Azzad ]</i></font><br><br>Well you can look at this two ways. First, if your Iksar wants to trick the stupid Humans into liking him so that he can gain something he wants, there's no need to sacrifice any roleplaying. <br><br>But if your Iksar is not the type of lizard that would do such a thing (an honorable lizard-monk), then don't do it. I see people using the word 'forced' to get an item all the time. Your Iksar does not 'have' to do a human quest. That's one of those things that I talked about before. It's one of those decisions where you either choose to roleplay and not get something that the player wants so that the character can remain true. If your Iksar doesn't want to do the quest because it's not in his character, having him do it is a concession to the player. <br><br>I know that the argument here is that the Iksar should be able to get the item by some other route. That an Iksar monk should be equally able to get that item if his player is roleplaying or if he's not. I don't agree. I, personally, like the idea that some paladins (as this is the most common example) will be able to roleplay in a world where they get to make a hard decision. Fair isn't a part of roleplaying. So while it might be fair to argue that from a game design standpoint such a quest is unfair, it's wrong to do so from a roleplaying standpoint. <br><br>Anyway, keep in mind that a lot of my reply in this post is my personal opinion. <br><br>As a representative of the company, I will send your concern about the quest to the team. I know a guy that's interested in looking into that sort of thing. :)</UL>

A <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid986865403,64421,">follow-up to <i>Where Silence Reigns</I></a>, one of Shadoe's latest editorials, has been published this evening.  The message board thread spawned by the editorial contained some very intense discussions.  Here's a clip of what Shadoe thought:<UL>Needless to say, I was a fish swimming upstream with this one. The EQ Vault poll showed the public was against my standpoint by a margin of 17% at the time I wrote it. Knowing this, I was prepared for one heated debate to ensue on the discussion thread, and I wasn't disappointed. Posters waxed rhapsotic about my siding with Verant, asking if I was on their payroll, accusing me of deliberately skewing my viewpoint -- all of which were highly amusing to see unfold. It's interesting to see the extents people resort to when they're out of new ideas, even to the point of saying that "blaming the [players/customers/escaped mental patients] is the most absurd thing I've heard you utter." An easy thing to say, and it's flawlessly in line with my expectations. <br><br>You see, I recognized the poll results for what they were: a golden opportunity to express my opinion on the matter while at the same time allowing the readers to exemplify my point in the discussion thread. So please indulge me, if you will, and take a good, hard look at the conversation that took place there. Read both sides of the argument. Feel the controversy. Taste the controversy. BE the controversy! </UL>I also wanted to quickly plug in <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/shadoe.htm">Shadoe's section at the Otherworld Express</a> where he is currently working on an EverQuest novel called <i>The Pact of Zeranon</I>.<br><br>Check it out!
