The dedicated "talk" threads dedicated to individual classes continues to be the dominate issues tackled by Alan on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807.html"><b>Bard Talk</b></a><br>Ok, I suspect you've been preparing for this, so I'll warn Akriss to be ready to split this thing&#8230; <br><br>So let's have it. Tell me what needs balancing for bards. You may as well give me bugs and broken stuff too. But my focus is going to be on things that are needed to move bards closer to 'balanced' in the game. This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one. <br><br>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine with that too. <br><br>Please, be detailed where you need to. Try to avoid abbreviations, my simian mind can't decipher many of them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812.html"><b>Monk Talk</b></a><br>I'm starting this thread today because I'll be leaving for Baltimore earlier than I had expected. I will have little access to the Internet while I'm there, and I don't want to start a thread like this right before I leave. Also, for you Rogues reading, I'm moving you back to Tuesday next week, I won't be in the office on Monday. <br><br>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor&#8230; <br><br>So tell me what you think needs to be changed about monks. Keep in mind that I am primarily looking for balance issues, but give me whatever you've got. I am also not looking for suggestions that would dramatically change the class, or that would require an army of people to get into the game. I'm mostly looking for tweaks that would help to balance the class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html"><b>Warrior Talk</b></a><br>What is there to say about warriors? <br><br>The idea of this thread is to talk about how to balance the warrior class in the game of EverQuest. I must admit that I don't really expect to see too many suggestions. The warrior seems to be a well balanced class. And we have to keep in mind that the warrior is a sort of staple class, upon which the relative balance of several other classes hinges directly. <br><br>So this is the forum to talk about what is right and what is wrong with warriors. Go ahead and tell me about bugs you've seen too. I'm not focusing on them, I'm concentrating on class balance here. But I will also take note of non-balance concerns as well. <br><br>Have at it, muscle-bound-types.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html"><b>Enchanter Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>Here&#8217;s what I have as a sort of summary so far. Keep in mind that I wrote this yesterday evening (during Survivor&#8230;), so it does not take into account posts made after that. I am reading them today, though. <br><br>The first thing to think about is how enchanters work against the high-hit point creatures of Velious. Do they have enough to contribute over the course of a fight with such monsters? <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure that enchanters are in need of help in this area. Perhaps the addition of something like a DoT-pet would help. <br><br>Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells. As I noted earlier, I&#8217;m not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge). <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve seen an answer to this situation that will work. <br><br>Rampage: This line does not stack with other strength buffs. We should evaluate this, and decide if this is how it should be. <br><br>DoT Pet: Something not unlike the clerical hammer spell, to add more to the ability of the enchanter to help during fights with extremely high hit point enemies. <br><br>Illusions: Mostly, you want more illusions. There are also a few requests to add effects to some illusions. <br><br>Illusion, Wolf: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I&#8217;ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes. In fact, so much so that I don&#8217;t really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all. <br><br>Illusion, Gender: Seems like a good request. <br><br>Illusion, Group Elemental (or race): A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race) to the group. <br><br>Illusion, Change Size: Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller. This is something that I am against, assize change is really the area of the shaman. <br><br>Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion): a spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature. Faction issues will most certainly disallow this, but it&#8217;s listed. <br><br>Major Illusion: If possible, a high level spell (even 60th if needed) that has the functionality of the original minor illusion spells. One that brings back the enormous illusions that were possible with that spell. <br><br>Illusion face: Would give the enchanter a random face. <br><br>Illusion Races Bug: It seems that some illusions don&#8217;t resize the character properly to people that enter the zone after the illusion is cast. We should take a look for the giant gnomes and see if we can fix them. <br><br>Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn&#8217;t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer. <br>Phantom armor: It would be awesome to create an illusion spell that allowed the enchanter to look like he is wearing plate. Perhaps a new spell similar to the magician phantom line (perhaps just like it) that has this illusionary effect (and we should also think of adding this to the magician spells...)<br><br>Enchanting Items: I will add this to the list as a reminder. <br>Lull spells: These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group. There should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro. <br><br>Bard Lute: We should at least look at this loot. Even if we don&#8217;t remove it (it is a very rare item), we should keep it in mind when making new items. It gives a key enchanter ability to another class. <br><br>Voice Graft: We should evaluate the idea of giving this spell to all pet classes, including enchanters. <br><br>Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught: Players feel that these spells are too easily resisted and too easily broken. <br><br>Mesmerization spells: There are some targets that are unaffected by these spells, either due to level or race. Our anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells don&#8217;t even cast (costing the caster no mana). We should consider this approach for mez spells as well. <br><br>Mesmerization spells and overwriting: Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells? It seems that perhaps they should. Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite lower level mez spells. <br><br>Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator: I, personally, don&#8217;t really like this idea. But there is a call for a change of the color of a monster&#8217;s name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know by looking. <br><br>Low level Evocation practice spell: Enchanters don&#8217;t seem to have a spell like Flare with which they can practice their evocation skills early on. <br><br>Tiny Daggers: These items are unavailable in Qeynos. This needs to be fixed <br><br>Pet Positioning: Because enchanters can&#8217;t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way. There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master. This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something. Can we have pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master? <br><br>'Charm wears off': players report that this message is sometimes sent long after the charm has worn off, after the creature is dead sometimes. <br><br>Reoccurring Amnesia: The reports are pretty overwhelming, this spell does not reoccur. <br><br>Boon of the Clear Mind: This is a group clarity spell, and should probably overwrite Clarity, and it does not. Either spell should probably overwrite the other, basically just increasing the duration (and the same should apply to the clarity 2 spells). It also seems that this spell has a very short useful life span. Lowering the level of this spell would allow its use for longer before they get Clarity 2. <br><br>Failure Messages: Some spells (Lull series and stuns against giants are primary examples) give the same message on failure that they do on success. If it fails it probably should say so. <br><br>Mask Faith: Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while. I think this is a bad idea. But I have a logical argument in favor of it, so I&#8217;m presenting it. I like the idea of characters having to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That's something that I don't like at all. The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don&#8217;t have to enter dangerous cities (which they can&#8217;t get into if they have a religion), or making religion more valuable. <br><br>Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity: I was under the impression that clarity spells would stack with bard mana regeneration songs. There might be something wrong with the stacking of these two spells. It seems that the bard song will stack over the enchanter spell, but the song must be stopped or the enchanter spell won&#8217;t take. <br><br>Blanket of Forgetfulness: Is this spell supposed to be more effective than it is? <br><br>Collaboration: This spell does not seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal. Is this a bug? <br><br>Illusions and Link Death: Can we make it so that Illusions remain up during a link death (not during zoning, though). <br><br>The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered &#8216;essential&#8217; in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. <br><br>Resplendent Robe: The effect is Rune IV, but it requires a component? That seems wrong. <br><br>Rune IV: The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high. <br><br>Boon of the Garou: We should probably up the duration by thirty seconds or something, so that the spell can be kept up on two targets without it dropping (the duration is currently exactly twice the recast time). <br><br>Tash Line: The thought from the players is that this line causes too much aggro. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that way for balance or if it is perhaps an exaggeration. We should look at this. <br><br>Recast Bug on fast spells: After casting a spell, sometimes attempts to cast fast casting spells (Tash line, for example) will not cast right away, and will give a "this spell is not ready message".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html"><b>Donal's Breastplate to be Nerfed</b></a><br>We've changed this item before because we thought it was overpowered. Unfortunately, it is still overpowered. Let me explain why. <br><br>This item is a breastplate that is only usable by clerics. If you right click this item, it will cast a Complete Heal on your target with a casting time of 30 seconds. It uses no mana to produce this effect. <br><br>A group of two characters, one cleric wearing this breastplate and one warrior, can defeat any opponent, as long as that opponent can not kill the warrior in under 30 seconds. <br><br>Let me restate that. <br><br>One cleric and one warrior, using this one magic item, can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not capable of killing the warrior in under 30 seconds. <br><br>I hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone. If we allow this item to remain in the game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds. 15 seconds if the group consists of two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there... <br><br>Of course, if we make the world so hard that this breastplate is not overwhelmingly powerful, we would have to, essentially, rebuild the game, rebalance the classes&#8230; No single item should be so powerful that the balance of the game revolves around it. Adjusting the game to fit this item is not a choice. We need to change the item to fit the game. <br><br>We have had a fair amount of internal debate over this item. It really comes down to two choices. Eliminate the item entirely, or change the way it works. We would rather change the way it works. After much debate and some conversations with players that have characters that use this item, we decided on the following change. <br><br>The item will cast a new spell (to be named later). The effect of this spell will be to completely heal the target. The spell will also leave a buff on the recipient that lasts somewhere between five and ten minutes (we are leaning toward a compromise of 7.5 minutes). This buff will have some small positive effect (perhaps a 1 point regenerative effect), but as long as this buff is on a character, he can not receive the effect of this spell again. This buff will not be removable until its duration runs out. <br><br>In practice, what this will mean is that the cleric with a Donal's Breastplate will be able to heal anyone he wants every 30 seconds. But he will not be able to heal the same person twice unless 7.5 minutes has passed between healings. The breastplate will still almost completely eliminate downtime due to hit point loss, and it will no longer destroy the game dynamic of EverQuest. <br><br>There is one concern that we have as to this implementation, and I'd like your feedback on it. <br><br>There are some cases where a character would have all of his buff slots full and be unable to gain a new buff. This new Donal's effect would be, essentially, a buff. We can either have it overwrite a current buff, or have the spell fail if the character has a full load of buffs on him. I can see arguments for either implementation, and I want to hear your thoughts on it. <br><br>Yes, we know this is a 'nerf'. And, frankly, we're willing to nerf this item to save the game as a whole. We are sorry about ever creating an item that is so easily unbalancing to the game, and we're sorry that we have to change it again. For now, I can't tell you when this change will take place. It won't be until after we've finished the work that has us on hold for updating the game. When I have a better timeframe, I'll certainly let you all know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052728.html"><b>On Shadow Kights</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: From shadowknights being labelled a 'defensive' class when we see ourselves as 'offensive', to this latest blunder with the spells and what levels we gain them&#8230;]</i></font> <br><br>Well, actually, that was not a 'blunder'. It was a random pair of numbers that I made up by way of example. Not the use of the word 'if' in the original statement. <br><br>As for the perception that shadow knights are offensive or defensive&#8230; well, I think I can make a far better case for them being considered a defensive class than on offensive one, based solely on their skill caps. They are a defensive warrior with offensive spell ability. A paladin is a defensive warrior with defensive spell ability.<br> <br>And, yes, it may very well be the case that the double penalty of later and more expensive spells is wrong. That's why it's on my list of things to evaluate...</UL>

Sorell Oldewolf sent in the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Saturday night was a blast on Tarrew Marr for the Shadowdragons and Celestial Keepers!  I know it was only Befallen, wrong!  It was what a guild is all about! Friends getting together and having a blast.  We had 2 groups one camped the second level of befallen, and one the third level of befallen.  The undead quaked and fell by the score!  Handily our beloved Phlora (51 Vicar) stood by closely in case she was needed for the occassional res.  Special thanks should go to Rantu, Eigoud, Cymrik, Sulimon, and Goldenrod/Lhytebreeze for being there to help  watch over everything.  While this was not a high level hunt it was noteworthy as one of the finest nites on eq that I have seen in a long time.<br> <br>Sorell Oldewolf, 30 Druid<br>Officer of the Shadowdragon<br>Tarrew Marr</BLOCKQUOTE>Sounds like fun! :)

Neverly's latest editorial entitled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid980733951,70320,">2cp For a SoW? Anyone?</a> has been published to our Editorial section.  Here's a clip:<UL>Now, unbeknownst to me, there had been a commentary running for some minutes before my entrance. It concerned, predictably enough, the stupidity of &#8220;newbies&#8221;, and was voiced by two 25th level characters: one druid and one warrior. The druid had been approached by a young halfling in the same situation as my own &#8211; he needed a SoW (Spirit of the Wolf) to retrieve his corpse. His request, though quite common, was answered with a string of insults, digs, and shouts of &#8220;LOL!!!&#8221; that filled many a passerby&#8217;s chat window to overflowing. Walking in at the end of this, I just caught the druid&#8217;s concluding statements as he voiced interest in having all newbies systematically destroyed by a wayward &#8220;bug&#8221;. Being largely unaware of the situation at that point (I was filled in later by a compliant wood elf), I ignored the harsh words and within moments had sent a tell politely requesting an SoW from the druid in question. Needless to say, the response I received was less than flattering. However, after a bit of verbal dueling and some liberal use of my stress ball, I managed to wrestle a response that wasn&#8217;t awash in abbreviated giggling, which I now quote:<br><br>&#8220;SoW is my main source of income, so, if you can&#8217;t pay, don&#8217;t ask.&#8221;<br><br>His main source of income, he says. I read that line with eyebrows raised, unbelieving. Could it be true? Could this man have such a long line of impatient customers that to spare a bit manna and some time for a 7th level cleric severely crimped his financial plans? Of course not, he was simply being nasty. Realizing this, I complemented him on his dedication to character, remarking that there has to be some greedy scumbags in the world. I then left, sans a SoW, and made my way towards Halas once again, tottering along and finding my mind occupied by the entire idea of charging for spells.* </UL>Enjoy!

The highlight of this article is the comments obtained from an eBay rep:<UL>Both eBay and Yahoo cited their policy on canceling auctions that violate intellectual property rights.<br><br>Kevin Pursglove, spokesman for eBay, said that Everquest joined the companies VeRO program, which stands for Verified Rights Owners program. VeRO members list items that they own the property rights to.

The Enchanter class discussion was started today on the Gameplay Board.  Read all about it in the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html"><b>Enchanter Talk</b></a><br>Unfortunately, as will probably be the case from here out, I just don't have time to do any research before starting this post. I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters&#8230; :)<br><br>Again, the usual reminder. I am primarily looking for balance concerns here. But I am certainly willing to put bugs on the list. Also, though I really do understand the fact that you want to emphasize and back up statements by others, please, please try to keep the repeat information to a minimum. I'm finding that by page three or four on these threads I'm rereading the same suggestions by people that start their posts with "I didn't read this thread, so I don't know if this had been said&#8230;" I don't want to stifle any creativity. But I have to admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing good new ideas late in threads when they are buried among things that others have covered several times before. <br><br>So, please, let's hear what you think is unbalanced or broken about enchanters. Here are the few things that I had already jotted down: <br><br>Gift of Brilliance: When compared to similar buffs by Clerics and Shamans this spell doesn&#8217;t seem good enough. Sure, it will see use, but it could be a better spell. Quick comparison: <br><br>Aeogolism (60th level Cleric spell): Adds 1,100 to max hit points and 54 to AC for a single target. Lasts 2.5 hours. Costs 750 mana.<br>Focus of the Spirit (60th level Shaman spell): Adds 405 hit points, 67 strength and 60 dexterity for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 500 mana.<br>Gift of Brilliance (50th level Enchanter spell): Adds 150 mana and grants a mana regeneration rate increase of 2 points per tick for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 450 mana. <br><br>The Shaman and Cleric spells essentially replace other buffs. Gift of Brilliance stacks with Clarity II. It might be nice to have the mana regeneration be 2 points greater than Clarity II and NOT stack with it so that enchanters could use it to save a slot. And perhaps rather than increasing the mana bonus, give it an intelligence bonus. But perhaps at this level enchanters just don't need any more intelligence boosts&#8230; <br><br>Illusions drop when zoning: Is there a gameplay reason behind the fact that illusions drop when you zone? If not, can we make it so they do not? <br><br>More Illusions: I think it&#8217;s a good idea to dig through the list of current global characters and see if there are a few more illusions that we can give to enchanters. <br><br>I know there are more issues&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052156.html"><b>Apologizes Stupid?</b></a><br>Analogies are like socks.

Because it was an improvement. I don't know of anyone that thinks it was not an improvement. That's a bold statement to make, but I believe it to be true. Are you actually suggesting that the removal of the experience 'penalty' was NOT an improvement to the game? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just because you set things straight after two years, doesnt mean you can hold it against us when ballancing hybrids]</i></font> <br><br>I am so completely baffled by your comment, that I'm not sure how to respond&#8230; <br><br>I think I did mention that we have to keep the recent changes to the experience gains of hybrids in mind when we think about balancing, and that is certainly the truth. It was a major change in the game mechanic. To forget that it ever happened would be foolish.

Well, our membership keeps growing so we guess the word is not completely out.  Yesterday, we were served at our office to stop all EQ related auctions immediatly or go to jail for the eve and seek legal in the morning.  The only thing that saved our gear from being seized etc was that we did not make profit in the week we opened.<br><br>Again, we put a lot of time, sleepless nights and funds into EGA trying  to devote it to EQ.  All members thus far have been very supportive and we thank you so <br>much.  We have added 2 new categories for the upcoming online games that are  "Totally Fine" about us buying and selling!  They are Anarchy Online and Ultima Online 2.  We also added some console gaming categories to the list.<br><br>We hope EGA will still be THE site on the net for Online Game Gear.  And if the change arises one day or Sony Online sees there demise this action may cause them in the future. We hope to add that Category again.<br><br>We also wish the best to our competitors, playerauctions.com.  It seems the same may have happened to them.  I hope they hang in there myself, if possible.<br><br>Last thing, if you wish to cancel you account.  Please just send us an email to support stating please cancel me at  this time.  We will back-up the status and make it inactive in case you wish to rejoin in the future.<br><br><br>Thanks for the support<br><br>Robert<br>EGA (New Asherons Call) Gamer</UL>A few minutes later they sent this one out:<UL>Hello xxxx xxxx,,<br><br>Bad news all,<br><br>I just got a knock on the door of my office with court orders from the Alaska Attorney Generals Office to stop all Everquest related auctions immediatly or have all our items seized and we would go to jail (this is no joke).<br><br>EGA gave it a hell of a try, but it seems Sony Online Games has a bit more legal presence then we do.<br><br>We have to remove the Everquest category from our auction.<br>We apoligize for this but we had no idea that the courts in all states have already been advised of actions.<br><br> Hang in there all and maybe one day it will be our world.<br><br>Sincerly<br><br>Robert<br>EGA Head Gamer</UL>To discuss and comment on this issue check out this <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=8656472&replies=103">message board thread</a>.

Valeera Edhel encountered a unique Dark Elf last night:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night while adventuring in South Karana,  I ran into an evil yet strikingly beautiful Dark Elf. She said her name was The Negotiator. She claimed to be lost. I asked this poor soul how I could be of assistance. She said that she came from the Castle Mistmoore. Shocked by this, I asked how she ended up so far from home. She had chased someone from the castle and traveled beyond the boundaries. Chased him all the way past the great city of Freeport. Alas, she had lost him at some bridge. By this time many other adventurers had gathered to listen to her tale of woe. Many tried to offer her help, but she only shrugged her shoulders in reply. The Negotiator then became hostile turning on those who had offered to help her. She even forced the beautiful druid Ambur to slay one of her own brothers. Chaos ensued as we all tried to figure out what she wanted. But she had great powers, and could make herself disappear. Alas, the great enchanter Pooja was able to slay this foul being and send her back to the depths of evil in which she came.  I shall never forget my experience with the dark and beautiful one. And never forget that evil shows itself in many ways to the adventurers of Norrath.<br> <br>Valeera Edhel<br>29th Season Wood Elf Ranger<br>Torvonnilous</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for sending in the report!

Here's a couple of posts Gordon Wrinn made recently on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051296-2.html"><b>Server Downtime</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Blech!!! 36 + server farms (eg. Solusek Ro is 1 server farm). Now if each server farm contains at least 15 servers. You then have to do maintenance on at least 540 servers. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually it's nearly 1000 total boxes currently. We have to do continual upgrades to keep ahead of the technology curve. Frankly, I'm amazed that our Ops group can do system-wide config changes and down and up that many servers in 8 hours. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051570.html"><b>Making Items NO-DROP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: VI needs to make it a policy to give 3 days warning minimun before making items no drop]</i></font> <br><br>Well I think that my main apologies go to the fact that it wasn't mentioned in the patch message. We weren't planning on doing items just yet, and ended up needing to put them in last night for what we did in PoM. Testing was spending all of their time (at our request) checking that stuff out. <br><br>Still, I can't say with certainty that we would have pre-announced (e.g. given warning) the changes to NODROP. From gamers perspective, the zone just "opened" a few days ago, last Saturday as I recall, even though it's been available for a while. This was essentially the 3rd business day, and we've been known to move fast to fix mistakes such as that. <br><br>It's a very debatable subject. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: They ninja'd:<br>spawn rates<br>drop rates<br>spawn size ]</i></font><br><br>Just to clear up what we patched, we patched 3 zones and items. That's a very small patch as they go. It didn't include any executable files, or anything having to do with spells, so the perception about changes to combat mechanics, fizzles, resist rates, etc., certainly didn't go in. As for spawn rates, drop rates, and such, we don't announce those anyway. I belive the term 'ninja' has been applied to things that we should announce but don't. <br><br>Though I guess that's debatable as well :)</UL>

It was intended for exaclty what the topic stated. Unfortunately, too many people have taken this thread too far from it's intended purpose, and it has essentially become worthless for its intent. I find that a shame, really, because we were actually looking for some new ideas about summoned items. I can only hope that the developer that asked me to start this thread has found some use for it before it was sidetracked...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051824-2.html"><b>Shadow Knight Talk, Part 2</b></a><br>As a starting note, all of us, players and Verant staff, really need to keep in mind that we just recently made a huge improvement to all hybrids by removing the experience costs. That must be kept in mind at all times when thinking about any further changes to hybrids. <br><br>Foxglove1 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Number one. Quit sterotyping SK's as Ogres or Trolls when making items. You ever seen a Erud or DE SK try to wear a full set of BloodEmber armour. Weights a bloody ton!!]</i></font> <br><br>Are they heavier than warrior armor of a similar type? Perhaps they are not overly heavy, but Erudites and Dark Elves are weaklings&#8230; And we also have to keep in mind that, when making armor for shadow knights, Ogres and Trolls can wear them, not just Erudites and Dark Elves. I see your point, but that's the sort of argument that works both ways. <br><br>RunDMZ said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'd ask why we're getting Summon Corpse? I don't recall us ever asking for it and it only seems to be pissing the Necro's off. <br><br>The last HT fix took care of most of our problems.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, that's a good point. The reason for giving Summon Corpse was to make them more wanted in the big raid situation, more or less. Keep in mind, this is the Summon that requires the huge coffin. It's not like the shadow knight is going to be carrying a ton of these things. Having said that, I'm not real sure about that change either. And I may as well bring it up to the team. <br><br>-Dr wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Unable to tank any uber mobs at all , no defensive disc nor any legit offensive disc to use on any uber mobs.]</i></font> <br><br>At all? That's pretty dramatic. Shadow knights get plate, they have fairly good defensive skills&#8230; Are you perhaps exaggerating here? No, a shadow knight can't tank like a warrior, but they shouldn't either. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) lvl 60 disc is arguably less usefull then the lvl 55 disc (harmtouch disc)]</i></font> <br><br>If that's true, then perhaps we should reduce the usefulness of the level 55 discipline&#8230; Ok, just kidding. Along with problems, I also need suggested solutions. Ones that make sense. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) tied with paladins for lowest dmg output of any melee class by a VERY large margin.]</i></font> <br><br>Heh, not really. Firstly, shadow knights are hybrids, not a melee class. It's perfectly acceptable that a melee class like the rogue be doing more damage than a hybrid in combat. Rogues don't get spells. And rangers are the melee damage dealing hybrid. Paladins and shadow knights are far more defensive in their abilities. And, well, we could talk about how shadow knights compare in melee damage to bards&#8230; <br><br>Keep in mind that shadow knights are a hybrid, not a melee class. They will, therefore, not be equal to the melee classes in straight combat ability, that is the price you pay for the ability to cast spells. <br><br>But perhaps we should evaluate the level of combat ability, probably for all the hybrids. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) all spells resisted on uber mobs (other classes have this complaint)thus the penalty we pay for having spells (less melee) is negated]</i></font> <br><br>Ah, I guess I should have read 4 before commenting on 3. :)  Fair point. But you've also had the advantage of those spells all the way up to that very final uber encounter. And some of your spells still work (pets, for example) in a limited way. But, as I said, a review of the combat abilities of hybrids is probably in order. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Epic quest issues (not sure if you wanted these or not) <br><br>please see the many threads on this but basically drops off Cazic thule are rare not to mention CT is a farmed god not a triggered spawn, CT is not any harder than the general in Kithicor, in fact prolly easier to kill but because he is farmed you never see him]</i></font> <br><br>True, I don't really want to talk about Epic Quests. But I'll make note of your concern, and we'll leave it at that for now. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6.5) the illogical extra low cap on piercing <br><br>why is piercing a lower cap than slashing or blunt? (or was this fixed?)]</i></font> <br><br>I admit to being slightly baffled as to why you even care about your piercing skill&#8230; But I don't know why it's capped low. My guess would be that it was not considered to be a 'knightly' skill, and that shadow knights needed to have some limits on what they could do in comparison to warriors, so dropping the piercing cap seemed like the right thing to do. I can say that I agree with that idea (especially since it was my reasoning for it&#8230;) <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7)Cash sinks of SK quests. <br><br>Why does lifeleech cost 3kpp to do again? a lvl 50 spell that cost 3k pp AND items to turn in, <br>what makes people think SKs are so rich that they can spend 3kpp just to buy a lvl 50 spell? <br><br>Epic quest costs at least 1900pp to do.]</i></font> <br><br>I dunno. But, well, is this out of line with what other classes are paying for things? Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the costs of researching even the lower level spells for casters&#8230; I'm not sure that these costs are out of line. Especially for the Epic. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8) Skell form <br><br>not a major issue and i realize you can get skell form items but these are all/all items. The ability to take the form of a skeleton soldier is very cool IMO from an RP prespective necros can do it, chanters can do it, but knights of the dead cannot take skell form unless they have an ALL/ALL item ]</i></font> <br><br>*shrug* Dunno. Interesting idea, and I'll put it on the list. But since it's not a particularly critical thing&#8230; <br><br>Darkhearted wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But I would like to throw in with the PVP guys on this one: HT should be 66% nerfed just like other magics in PVP.]</i></font> <br><br>That may be true. But for now, let's stick to the standard game. I'll have to open a PvP talk later, but I can't do it now, not with all of this going on. <br><br>Rasker Sakarra wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Post 50, we have some issues. First, I would like to know (as many others) why our BASH skill cap is far below a warriors. Warriors rarely if ever use a shield after they get dual wield, however a Shadow Knight (and paladin too) often use a shield from level 1-60. Along with wanting a small increase (not to infringe on warrior territory) in our skill caps (offense, defense, etc), our skills are good ]</i></font> <br><br>I dunno.

Most previous posters were saying that it just doesn't proc enough. You come in and say that with a high dexterity it procs a lot&#8230; <br><br>In any case, no, the pure necro version of this spell would be out of line.

I think the trouble here might be that a shadow knight wouldn't get it until a bit later than a necromancer. So a fairly weak spell would seem even weaker. <br><br>But I'll add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Slightly higher level pets. Nuthin big here, I love having pets, and they are useful as an escape mechanism in a pinch, but make them just a bit more useful, raise thier rank maybe 1 more notch (Level 8 pet at level 9, etc) and they'd be a whole lot more useful]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, by overwhelming demand, I'll add a request for better pets. But keep in mind that, well, I can certainly see a reluctance to make them more powerful. Consider that they are primarily a soloing tool for the shadow knight, and we're not real excited about encouraging soloing. And the shadow knight can tank for his pet, using the pet essentially like a DoT. So they don't need to be all that tough. But I will add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You did Necros? When .. I had to post something about a spell no dropping in Kunark, but I never saw your "Necro Talk" thread.]</i></font> <br><br>I never started a Necromancer Talk thread. But I did have a very long discussion about them in someone else's thread. I've got, I think, enough data to start with for them. I intend to repost my lists when I've got them all done, and we can further refine them at that time. Right now, I need to get the rest done. <br><br>Xilith said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What we propose is a change of some kind to the level 60 discipline Leechcurse that will allow us to substitute for a warrior against raid npc's for a time shorter than a warrior and/or not as well. The leechcurse discipline currently lasts 20 seconds with a 72 minute reuse delay, during which 1 hp is healed for every point of melee damage dealt to the npc. When they hit for up to 2800 points a round, this does not extend our tanking abilities even enough to be healed once.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok&#8230; I'm listening&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Given the short duration and high reuse time on the ability, here is a possible solution I see (this is my personal opinion, and does not represent other players) that keeps the current flavor and would prove effective in letting us tank as a warrior using defensive for a short time would be to calculate a factor that scales with an npc's level, and multiply our melee damage times that to determine the amount leechcurse heals. Say for instance level/10. Against level 60 npc's that would make Leechcurse heal 6 points for every point we deal. This brings it approximately up to a warrior using defensive on large encounters, yet scales down on normal mobs to not be unbalancing. The precise factor would need to be determined after tuning.]</i></font> <br><br>That doesn't work for me&#8230; Firstly, it requires that the software look at the enemy to make calculations. It's always better to do these things internally, looking at the caster. After all, the monster level should pretty much scale with the character level&#8230; <br><br>Unfortunately, this is a level 60 discipline, so it can't really scale with the character&#8230; <br><br>Well, I'll add this to the list as is, unless someone comes up with a better implementation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. Bug: Vampiric Curse (level 57 lifetap dot) and Soul Consumption (The effect on the SK epic weapon) should stack with the cleric Regen-based heals, such as Celestial Elixir. This evidently is something due to be fixed for other such stacking issues.]</i></font> <br><br>Might be a bug, might not. I don't know. But I'll add it to the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Overall, most SKs are now happy with the balancing that has been done lately. If the SK (and Paladin) tanking ability against high level npc's is restored to original levels, the majority of the players would have no complaints.]</i></font> <br><br>This seems to be the primary thing to look at, the tanking ability of higher level shadow knights. Keep in mind that, to me at least, 'tanking' is the ability to take a beating without falling over dead. Damage dealing is a separate issue. And shadow knights should be good tanks, and not so good at damage dealing. That is, at least, my opinion (there may be a good argument that shadow knights should be moderately good at both tanking and damage dealing, falling between paladins and rangers&#8230;). Those that want to see more damage from their shadow knight would have to be willing to give up an equal amount of tanking ability, and most don't want that. I see the three hybrids (excluding bards in this instance) as the two sides of the warrior coin, so to speak. The ranger gets most of the damage dealing ability of the warrior, but trades out some of the defense for his spells. Shadow knight and paladins get most of the tanking ability of the warrior and lose some of the damage ability in exchange for their spells. <br><br>That's how I see it at least&#8230; <br><br>Malagen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My suggestions to enhance Leechcurse are these: 1) Make it so the SK never misses during that 20 second time frame (maybe lower it back to 15 seconds if you think 20 seconds would be overpowering), and 2) Lower the refresh time to 30 minutes, having to wait 72 minutes to reuse a basically useless discipline is rather funny, in a sick way.]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. Again, I'm not sure that this is the way to go. But I do see the value of making this discipline do more to make the shadow knight a better tank. <br><br>Protagonist wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Get rid of the casting penalty. <br><br>I honestly do not see the logic behind hybrids having to use more mana to cast watered down versions of their parent classes spells that they get at such a late level that their efectiviness is close to nil to start with. It just makes no sense.]</i></font> <br><br>It makes sense to me. The power of the spell is determined by the level that you get it at. Essentially, if a necromancer gets a spell at 24th level and a shadow knight gets it at 30th, that's a way to control the power of the spells the shadow knight gets. It's essentially 6 levels weaker. Increasing the mana cost for these spells is a way to control the volume of spells, especially since the mana pool for hybrids was brought up recently. <br><br>But I accept that we should probably review the way that all hybrids get their spells. Others at Verant have already suggested that. So it's on my list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The solution for SK's and paladins alike should be as follows: <br>Give SK's and paladins and across the board increase of 10 in all defensive and offensive skill caps. This would be one more skill increase per level from 51-60 and would result in bringing their tanking ability up just a little bit as well as their offensive ability (sk and paladin ofense is so pathetic that it is..well...offensive).]</i></font> <br><br>I'm in favor of increasing the defensive caps on shadow knights (and probably paladins&#8230;). I'm not so sure about offensive caps. Again, that's more along the lines of the ranger area. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also I would reccomend increasing weapon skills more than 10 points, should Knights really be so unskilled with weapons in comparison to wariors? Keep in mind that this is a balance issue and not a roleplay one. Do the numbers between the damage output of an SK vs that of a warior sometime and you will laugh at how pathetic the sk damage output is.]</i></font> <br><br>Laugh? No. From what I hear (and feel free to correct me), in the upper 50s, similarly equipped shadow knights will do about 2/3 the damage output of a warrior. That seems right to me. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Increase SK and Paladin BASH skill caps to equal that of wariors. <br><br>It boggles my mind that THE shield weilding melee classes of norrath are capped 40 points below wariors in bash. This is akin to capping rangers at 200 in archery while allowing wariors to have a 250 skill cap, it just makes no sense.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, if you say THE and 'melee' then you are talking about the warrior, hands down. And that's how it should be. But I'm certainly willing to suggest an increase to the bash cap for both shadow knights and paladins. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Give paladins and sk's a defensive type disc arounc level 57 or so. This will allow them to be usefull against big mobs (sk's and paladins are now the only melee classes who do not have discs that allow them to tank the big mobs). <br><br>Also do something with the level 60 SK Leechcurse disc.]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, it's my thought that Leechcurse really should be the defensive discipline that you are looking for. If it healed more, it would be. <br><br>Wyrdrana wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: To be honest, you should open a talk for "hybrid" concerns, or at least put paladins and shadowknights together.. a lot of their concerns are similiar.]</i></font> <br><br>It might have been a good idea to do paladins and shadow knights in one thread. But then there would be just as many people that see them as too different to lump together&#8230; *shrug* <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8230;add a few nifty shields that possibly proc something on a successful bash.]</i></font> <br><br>Nifty idea. Not really a balance thing, but I'll add it to the list because it's a neat idea. <br><br>-Jice-Virago- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8230;unerfing the normal (non quest) life taps might be a step in the right direction.]</i></font> <br><br>*sigh* 'nerf' is so overused&#8230; <br><br>But that's not the point. I'll add the life taps (non-quest) to the list. I wouldn't honestly expect a change. Life taps are very useful to a fighting class. They serve a shadow knight well, and I'm not sure they need to be better. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Suggestions? Move gather Shadows to level 22 and most of the heartache of playing the class is gone, since you can at least get where your corpse is after you die. This is the tough love range that seperates the real SKs from the twinks, and it would be kind of nice to leave it that way.]</i></font> <br><br>Ok, not a bad suggestion, and others have made it. I do think that invisibility is way too common in EverQuest as it is. But you've got a good argument to back up your suggestion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 49-52 I'm king of the world <br><br>&#8230; <br><br>Suggestions? The pet nerf you instituted indirectly tapered off some of the power of this level range.

Raise HP to match warriors on both Paladins and SKs (At least CH will still be useful on us) but leave the skill caps alone except a 1 point per level post 50 offense increase. You added SC to SKs this is a step in the right direction. Now add some mana pumps and screaming terror and you might see more SKs desired on raids/XP groups. Also, with discipline most BLUE CONNING boss mobs still resist HT totally. Is 1k damage that overwhelming? Lastly, un-nerf the skin line for us so we at least pretend to be useful against VS/Trak]</i></font> <br><br>Well, raising shadow knight hit points to match warriors seems very extreme. Let me think these suggestions over as I read more... <br><br>Nice level-by-level analysis, I plan to use it. :)<br><br>belize wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5)disease/poison spells. at lvl 9 we get a 9 point dd spell that diseases the target. ok, what happened to an upgrade at any point?]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>Buliwyk Shadowreaver said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also, as a hybrid with "battle spells" I would like to propose a change to the cast time of our spells.

A new event report was sent in by Snoweaver:<BLOCKQUOTE>One Lieutenant Marcs of the Qeynos guards offered a bounty for the capture of what he called a villain of his city.  Having helped these citizens before, I gladly accepted the challenge.  Lieutenant Marcs asked that I gather a group of adventures and apprehend the villain Danson Sliphand who was hiding in the farmhouses of Western Karana.  A small group quickly formed and headed out to meet Danson.  True to Lieutenant Marcs&#8217; word, Danson was in a farmhouse not far from the Qeynos Hills but he was not alone.  A large group had assembled around him, listening to him relate a tale of woe and sorrow.  As it turns out, Danson was forced to scavenge the streets of Qeynos for food to feed his young family.  Upon further investigation, we learned that Danson was in line to become another innocent victim of the Corruption that has settled in Qeynos.  Our pity for Danson grew and the gathered adventurers concocted a scheme to help Danson and his family survive.  Those of us with the talents to summon food and water did so and handed it over to the poor Danson.  He graciously accepted the gifts and handed his sole position, signet ring that we promptly took back to Lieutenant Marcs.  We offered the ring as proof that Danson was dead.  The lieutenant took the bait and called off his vendetta.  We managed to escort the Sliphand family out of Qeynos and back into Danson&#8217;s loving embrace.  <br><UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/ecigm1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/ecigm2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/ecigm3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/ecigm4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a></UL><br>Snoweaver <br>38 Barbarian Shaman<br>E'ci</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

These are the latest posts from Alan made on the EQ Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051603.html"><b>On "Talk" Threads</b></a><br>I just wanted to clarify a few things about the threads that I have been starting, the Class Talk threads. <br><br>The most important thing to remind everyone about is that I am just gathering ideas to bring to the team. Nothing suggested, either by myself or by you, is set in stone. Ideas that make sense to me will be brought to the team to evaluate. For the most part, it is unlikely that we will implement any majority of these ideas. Implementing any more than a few of them would most likely throw things even further off balance&#8230; <br><br>I also wanted to stress that the general idea of these threads is to look at the balance of the classes. As most of you know, we still intend to bring the game to a point where we are content with the balance of all of the classes so that we can stop expending our time worrying about the balance of classes and use that energy for providing new content and other cool things. My intent with these threads is, primarily, to be ready when that time comes, and to have a solid idea of your opinions on the classes. <br><br>However, there is no reason not to include bugs and other such things in these talks. So go ahead and give me those too. <br><br>Some have suggested that I should start these threads in the class specific boards. Well, perhaps I should have. But I don't want it to seem like I only want opinions from people that play the class being discussed. I actually want input from anyone that has ideas. <br><br>I am also getting a fair amount of e-mail with suggestions and ideas. While I don't really mind getting them, I would much rather that ideas be posted in the threads. I want everyone to have all the information that I have from the players, so it can be debated and discussed. And since I am now spending nearly every minute reading these threads, I find it harder to read long e-mails about those same topics&#8230; <br><br>I have created a hasty and very changeable schedule for these posts. I reserve the right to adjust this list at any time. And the order is pretty random, since I won't really be taking action on them until later. <br><br>Already started: <br><br>Shadow Knights (today)<br>Clerics<br>Wizards<br>Necromancers<br>Magicians <br><br>I know, some of these were not specifically Class Talk threads. But I do feel that I have a solid grasp on the concerns of these classes, as the threads about them (necromancers, for example) were the inspiration for this whole Class Talk idea. <br><br>Enchanters: Friday, Jan. 26th (I may very well be reading this one during the Superbowl&#8230;)<br>Bards: Monday, Jan. 29th<br>Warriors: Monday, Jan. 29th<br>Monks: Wednesday, Jan. 31st<br>Rogues: Friday, Feb. 2nd<br>Paladins: Monday, Feb. 5th (or Tuesday the 6th, since I may very well be stuck in Baltimore&#8230;)<br>Rangers: Wednesday, Feb. 7th. <br><br>Once I have all of the ideas I can stand for all the classes, I will re-post the lists that I have gathered. I might very well do that on the class specific boards. The lists will always be open to change, so it's not like I'll be posting a 'final' version. But the lists, at that point, should be pretty solid. <br><br>At some future date I hope to update these lists with notes as to the status of those ideas. If implemented, I hope to give you some details about the form of that implementation (though I don't plan to give out formulas or such things), and if they are not going to be implemented, I hope to tell you why not. <br><br>Again, I want to stress that NONE of these lists or talks include any sort of promise that the ideas in them will be added to the game. I will simply be providing the team with the lists. And when I give you my opinion about an idea, it's just that, my opinion. I'm just one guy. I have the ability to make suggestions and I get to argue with the team about the value of those ideas. But we look at these things as a team, and we make these decisions as a team. <br><br>That's why the game is as cool as it is. <br><br>I also wanted to apologize for not posting as frequently during the next few weeks. I am pushing to get all these talks done as soon as I can. I think they are important. But reading all these posts is eating up all of my time. Formatting and rewriting those ideas is taking up time that I don't even have. So my ability to post for a while will be reduced significantly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051586.html"><b>Shadow Knight Talk</b></a><br>Let's talk about shadow knight. I figured that since I've done necromancers, this would be a good next step. <br><br>First, let me admit that I have done no research about what shadow knight player concerns are. I just haven't had the time, and I probably won't for the rest of these talks. <br><br>The idea here is to present me with the things that you see as wrong with the shadow knight class. I'd like to focus on class balance issues, but it seems clear to me now that I may as well jot down any bugs or other issues that you have while I'm at it. And don't be afraid to tell me what you think is good about the class too.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051428.html"><b>Velious Wizard Port Spells</b></a><br>Sorry, that was totally my fault. <br><br>I found out yesterday that there was a mistake with those spell vendors. I told everyone here that I would announce it on the boards, but forgot. I was too steeped in wizard and cleric data&#8230; <br><br>My apologies for not telling you yesterday, and for not having those vendors in properly in the first place. I know how frustrating it is when we make mistakes like that.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051483.html"><b>Wizard Port Spells - Inaccuarte Info</b></a><br>Lying requires intent to mislead. <br><br>I goofed up. I made a mistake. And I'm sorry about that. <br><br>But I didn't lie. And you've eloquently stated why I wouldn't bother lying about something like this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051528.html"><b>Credibility</b></a><br>Tamria wrote: <br><br>>"If you're paid to give people answers then credibility is a major thing and personally I'd be more careful about keeping it."< <br><br>I agree with you. <br><br>Unfortunately there is little I can do to correct this mistake, short of saying that I am sorry, and I don't intend to allow it to happen again. <br><br>And I am sorry, and I do not intend to let it happen again. <br><br>It is my job to be correct when I say I am, and to make sure that you understand that I am not sure when I am not sure. And I shall continue to endeavor to do my job to the best of my ability. Because I represent a lot of hard working, sincere and brilliant folks to the public, I hate to make errors that make them look bad. That is as much motivation to me as it is to discover that I've made things difficult for our customers. I owe them an apology too.</UL>

Here's today's latest patch message:<UL>January 24th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*QA Openings*<br><br>Our Quality Assurance department is looking for some AVID EQ gamers to join us as testers at the San Diego branch. If you would like more information please visit www.verant.com or mail your resume to resume@station.sony.com with "QA Openings" as the Subject.<br><br>Applicants should include their time playing EverQuest, and their number of characters and their respective classes and levels as part of their resume.<br><br>*Small Patch*<br><br>The EverQuest Team is currently hard at work evaluating, planning, and documenting our project plans for the current year.  As such, we did not plan game updates during this period, forecasted to last a few weeks.<br><br>However, given today's server maintenance being performed by our Operations Team, we were able to include a few small updates.  These include some minor polishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard's Velious teleport spells on merchants.<br><br>Very soon, we'll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world.  We'll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>
