						<p><b>Barbarian</b><br />
During the Age of Monuments the last of the gods who came to Norrath, Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love, twin brother and sister, created a hardy race who settled the cold and rugged northlands, near the ruins of the Giant empire. Being the youngest race, they were generally unwashed and rugged, possessing very few social graces. And while they too had a warlike culture, there were those amongst them who began to believe in something more.
</p><p>While the elder races regrouped and reestablished themselves during the Lost Age, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed both physically and intellectually. Most believe this to be the last major and direct act of divine intervention, and perhaps the reason so little is known about this period is that the gods wish it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would have less to do with their creations. This small and enlightened group was the origin of the Human race, and they rapidly gained a foothold throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. 
</p><p>In the present age, Barbarians are a hardier variety of the human race that comes from the cold and rugged northlands. Though referred to as barbarians by the rest of the world, these proud people refer to themselves as "Northmen." Because of the harsh environment and their warlike culture, they are better suited to being warriors, and are generally unwashed and rugged - possessing very few social graces. Hailing from the city of Halas in the mountains of Everfrost, barbarians take great pride in their clan's lineage. Eating, drinking, and battle are their preferred pastimes.
</p><p>Although the vast majority of barbarians become warriors for the great honor that will bring to their clans, some feel the mystical call to serve as clan shamans, lending their magical abilities to further their clan's standing. Yet, there is one more class that a barbarian may become, and that is the class of the rogue. Barbarian rogues are usually loners who have decided to bring their clan honor through less respectable methods. Achieving honor is what is important, not how it is achieved.
</p><p>No matter their chosen profession, barbarians are a force to be reckoned with. The very love they have for a fight is what makes them a true danger. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><b>Dark Elf (Tier Dal)</b><br />
Dark elves are the evil brethren of the woodland and high elves. Their skin is bluish-black, their hair white, and they share the pointed ears and sharp features of their elven brethren. Due to their life under the earth and dedication to evil gods, they have the ability to see perfectly in the dark.
</p><p>Dark elves are a race filled with hate, created by the God of Hate Himself. They hate all other races, and even their fellow Teir`Dal. Their sole motivation is to please the God of Hate, Innoruuk. They will lend aid to one another, but only for their own selfish reasons. "I will help you now to use you later," is a common sentiment.
</p><p>Being of the elven race, the Teir`Dal have a natural magical ability. This magical ability manifests itself in professions of enchanter, magician, wizard, and necromancer. With their devotion to Innoruuk, they also may become clerics in His evil service. For those Teir`Dal who desire to spread hate and death in other ways may choose to become rogues, warriors, or shadowknights.  (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><b>Dwarf</b><br />
Dwarves are short but extremely strong (much more so than humans) and dexterous. They appear to be small, burly humans, and are never seen without beards and mustaches. Of course, dwarves do not see their lack of physical height to be a disadvantage. To them, it is just the way it is. Besides, it is just as easy breaking the kneecaps of a larger race and then punching them in the nose.
</p><p>Dwarves believe in many different things. Each, always willing to die for that belief. But, one thing all dwarves have a common belief in is a good, strong, ale. It would not be a strange sight to see a dwarf in battle, a weapon in one hand and a frothing mug in the other. Taverns across the lands have specially constructed stools that can take a beating. Their innate infravision allows them to be able to see if a mug is half empty or half full in even the darkest of rooms. For the safety of those around, the mug better be half nothing and always full!
</p><p>Dwarves have such a neutral character that even the Teir`Dal will allow them into Neriak, to a point. Of their professions, dwarves may choose to serve their god as clerics, take on the mantles of paladins, harry the enemy as warriors, or pursue the refined arts of the rogue.  (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><b>Elf</b><br />
The Elves appear somewhat human at first glance, but their very sharp features and pointed ears set them apart. Elves are weaker than humans, but more than make up for this with their amazing agility and superior dexterity. They equal the High Man in their intelligence and wisdom, but are  much more fair and charismatic. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><i>Of Caerthiel:</i> 
The Dragons had relinquished their hold over Norrath, and what are now known as the elder races, the Elves and the Dwarves, stepped out from under their gargantuan shadow. The Dwarves sprang forth from the earth, to hold dominion over their mountainous kingdoms. The elves took to the primeval forests of Norrath, creating a vast empire that spanned several continents. Ruling from the city of Caerthiel , the Elves lived in peace, under the guidance of Innoruk, the elven god.
</p><p><i>Of the rebellion and the outpost of Wielle:</i><br />
As the corruption in the empire grew, so did the unrest in many elves hearts. They wanted more and more power for themselves. They grew suspicious of the strength of Innoruk, choosing to destroy his works, and kill his servants. At first they were small in size, and weak in power. But as the years went by the rebels grew in leaps and bounds, using treacherous methods to slander the leaders of the Elven Empire. The first sign of the growing rebellion came at the Elven outpost of Wielle, located where the city of Freeport is today. Wielle was loyal to the empire, and therefore, enemies of the rebels. A rebel army under the captain Paetroen savagely attacked it. The citizens of the outpost were killed.
</p><p>That action shattered centuries of relative peace. Suddenly the Empire had to face a new enemy, a darkness in its mist. The Emperor, Kel'anthinstion, called on all of the citizens of the Empire to fight for the cause of Innoruk. He sent his most trusted advisers, all disciples of Innoruk, to the far reaches of the empire. They were to gather support to fight the rebels and support the unity of the empire. The rebels had sent their own recruiters using underhanded tactics to undermine the populace’s faith in their god. The war droned on for countless years.
</p><p><i>Of the battle of Aerignon and the wild elves:</i><br /> 
The war was a stalemate. That changed with the battle of Aerignon, named after the province of the empire where it took place. The loyal forces of the empire thought to catch Paetroen and his rebels unprepared. They attacked him at his home base, just north of Elizerain Lake. Forces were massed and placed under the direct command of the Emperor himself. He was to lead the army of Innoruk to destroy the rebels once and for all. As the army encircled Peatroen's military headquarters, a victory for the blessed forces of Innoruk seemed assured. Out maneuvered and outnumbered, the Rebels could not get enough forces to turn back the impending assault, and escape by any means, was impossible. 
But the imperial victory was denied that day, as a third player in the war, the wild elves, tipped there hand. The wild elf was a term used by citizens of the empire for the primitive elves the lived beyond the borders of the empire. They had remained neutral throughout the war, but had succumbed to the rebel’s promises of victory, and had joined the war on their side. What was supposed to be a day of victory for the Empire turned into its greatest defeat. The emperor himself was killed when an wild elf assassin slipped into his tent and killed him from behind. On that day the Empire was doomed.
</p><p><i>Of the fall of the imperial city:</i><br /> 
The war lasted for several years after the death of the emperor. In desperation, the remaining loyalists sent messengers to the Dwarven Kingdoms for aid against the rebels. They returned, saying the Dwarves were fighting their own war, and would send no help. With the help of new fiendish magic, the Rebels pushed the loyalists back to their capital, Caerthiel, which was in what is now known as the loping planes. Inside, the last of the loyalists huddled in their homes, holding on to the last remnants of their shattered empire. With out a leader to rally them, they were as good as dead.
</p><p>Help came in the form of a priest of Innoruk, who rose up as leader. His name changes with every telling, but the fact remains that in the dark of the night, the day before the final assault on Caerthiel, the priest led the last of the loyalists in to the earth. Through a chasm that was opened and closed by Innoruk himself. When the Rebel army assaulted the city the next day, they found nothing but a ghost town, devoid of any life.
</p><p><i>Of the elven schism (Dark Elves-High Elves-Forest Elves):</i><br /> 
As the loyalists took refuge underground, the rebels thought themselves the winners of the War of the Broken crown. They took on the moniker "High Elves", while the wild elves became more commonly known as wood elves. Without the loyalists to guide it, the Empire fell apart. The elves that remained on the surface, the high elves, could not stand the symbol of Caerthiel, and in a fit of rage they destroyed it. They created their capital of Felwithe on the very spot where the emperor was murdered, in the battle that destroyed the empire. The loyalists fled east to the wild and uncharted continent of Antonica. There they established the well guarded and underground city of Neriak, where they stayed for many years trying to rebuild their once great empire and all the while plotting for revenge against the rebels who forced them from Faydwer. Having been exposed to decades of low light in their underground kingdom and to harsh conditions, the skin of those elves still loyal to Innoruk has become darker and the elves themselves have been made into warriors guided by the power of their god. They are feared by the denizens of Antonica, who call the loyalists "dark elves." 
</p><p><b>Erudite</b><br />
Being the exact opposite of the barbarian Northmen, the high man prides himself on his intellectual abilities and social graces, to the almost total exclusion of the physical disciplines. They pride themselves on being superior to all other races. Any obstacle can be overcome with intelligence and wisdom. Pick up a sword? Bah, leave that to the lesser, unsophisticated beasts of the land. The only exception is for Erudite paladins and shadowknights.
</p><p>Erudites have very few friends outside their own race. Others find them very hard to associate with. Their snooty attitudes and overblown egos can be said to be the main factors in this. But, only a party of ignorant adventurers would turn an Erudite away from joining them, for their high intelligence and facile use of magic come in handy, especially when facing a powerful enemy. Clerics, enchanters, necromancers, and wizards, Erudites excel when magic is needed.
</p><p>During the Lost Age, humanity was conquering the land of Norrath, often in a violent and aggressive way.  A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. Others reminded them of their former glory and the might of the Combine Empire. These leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals to which all had agreed. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.
</p><p>A small, frail man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies. The first human mages since the Combine Empire were born – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge. They created schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and assigning themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Thus began the Age of Enlightenment.
</p><p>It came to pass some years later that a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of Necromancy. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference – they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. In one final battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense hole leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of this chasm the heretics built their own city which they called Paineel. And while both sides still seethed with anger and hatred towards one another, their fear of what the last battle had wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age of Turmoil.

</p><p><b>Gnome</b><br />
Gnomes spend most of their lives in their underground burrows and rarely come to the surface. They resemble dwarves to some extent, but have a ruddy brown skin and are more wiry and gnarled. Their hair is white, and somewhat sparse. Yet, their appearance is not what gets them noticed. Gnomes believe that building contraptions ranks right up there with saving the world. Renowned for their tinkering abilities, gnomes delight in the fact that they can build the right machine for any occasion. The many catastrophes, explosions, and traumatic amputations of limbs are not seen as tragedies, but rather--learning experiences.
</p><p>Gnomes are an easy-going race. Most always have a pleasant, carefree attitude. They do not believe in failures, only temporary setbacks. Their fascinations with gadgets, sprockets, springs, doodads, and frighteningly enough, explosives, provide gnomes with an abundance of healthy respect (from a safe distance) from others. Not ones to waste time on such things as revenge, gnomes just do experiments. They can't help it if an experiment goes bad on someone who just happened to offend them in some way. 
</p><p>Gnomes follow the standard occupations of cleric, enchanter, magician, necromancer, rogue, warrior, and wizard, but in their hearts, they are tinkers.
</p><p><b>Half Elf</b><br />
Half elves, being a blend between humans and elves, share some of the strengths and weaknesses of both races. They most closely resemble humans, except for their slightly pointed ears and sharper facial features. Although scorned by the more closed-minded individuals of their parent races, half elves received the best attributes of both parents. From the elves, they received the much-valued ability to see clearly in the dark, good agility and good dexterity. From humans they received better strength and stamina. With these abilities, half elves make good bards, druids, paladins, rangers, rogues, and warriors.
</p><p>The other races are limited with regard to places where they can begin their lives. Half elves have more options. They can choose to originate from the cities of Qeynos, Freeport, Kelethin, or Felwithe. This benefit helps in establishing half elves throughout the world.  (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><b>Halfling</b><br />
Halflings are stocky little people who most closely resemble humans, but they are extremely agile, dexterous, and very light of foot, not like those clumsy humans. Halflings hail from Rivervale, a quiet little hamlet smack dab in the center of Antonica. Their mischievous, jovial natures make them fun people to be around. Male halflings take great pride in their foot hair and strive to ensure that each hair is properly groomed. 
</p><p>Possessing naturally high dexterity and agility, halflings are viewed as quick little buggers who smile a lot. They have a love of travel, and their professions of cleric, druid, rogue, and warrior lead them on many an adventure. With their innate ability to hide, halflings make great pranksters, sneaking up on an unsuspecting victim and poking them, causing a bladder-loosening scream.
</p><p>All is not fun and games for halflings, however. They take the encroaching goblin horde as a serious threat and defend Rivervale and Misty Thicket with all of their might. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><b>Human</b><br />
Humans are average. Oh, they may be above or below average in deeds and duties, but on the ability side, they are average. Humans are the most abundant race. Some would say only rats outnumber them, but then again no one has taken a census of either humans or rats. Good, neutral, or evil, humans run the entire gamut. 
</p><p>Being average allows humans to pursue the professions of their choice undeterred by racial shortcomings. From bard to wizard, they can do it all, but if they are doing it at night, they'd best have a good light source or they will have to camp until dawn in order to see their hands in front of their faces.
</p><p>Humans are an accepting lot. They are an open-minded people and accept almost any other race. They occupy and dominate the two main human cities, Qeynos and Freeport. In these bustling metropolises, humans begin their journeys. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><br />
<b>Iksar</b><br />
First introduced in The Ruins of Kunark expansion in April 2000, the Iksar are a lawful-evil race of intelligent and religious reptiles. They follow the teachings of the God of Fear of the EverQuest pantheon, Cazic-Thule. They possess a long history of conquest and enslavement, and were among the first races to discover and spread Necromancy. They are hated across the world, and often at odds even within their own ranks.
</p><p>In term of gameplay, their scaled skin give them a great armor bonus at the drawback of not being able to wear plate armor. Adding their innate regeneration they make great monks and more than decent necromancers. Owing to their reptile nature they also possess exceptional night vision, foraging and swimming abilities.
</p><p><b>Ogre</b><br />
Created in the elder age by the god Rallos-Zek, Ogres are incredibly massive beings, with their average height being about 10', and weight well over four hundred pounds, they are truly immovable objects. Due to their size, they are the strongest of all the races and are tied with trolls in pure stamina. Conversely, they are the least intelligent race, whose lives consist mostly of smashing things and eating them. 
</p><p>An ogre's strength is its strength. With the ability to use heavy weapons, ogres become either warriors or shadowknights. Whether they truly understand their vocations, the smarter races have not yet been able to decide. But, with the mystery of evolution, an ogre is sometimes born with a bit more smarts and may decide, or fall into by mistake, the profession of shaman.
</p><p>Never let the ogre's dull personality and lack of intelligence mislead you into thinking they are harmless. Ogres are ruthless killers, and like trolls, will eat what they kill. The best way to make friends with an ogre is to feed him your left hand. He'll stay with you until he gets the rest.
</p><p>They were not always so stupid.  In the Elder Age, several of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became part of their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres who quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and their empire grew outward from their mountain home until it eventually encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known continents. Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they became weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and dimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride as his creations challenged the gods of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and angered the greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and forced back to his domain.  In reprisal, the gods cursed the Warlord's creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed around them. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><b>Troll</b><br />
Created by Cazic-Thule during the second gods' alliance during the Elder age, Trolls typically stand about 8' tall, are extremely strong, ugly, stupid, dirty, and green of skin. With such characteristics, one can only assume that trolls are not pleasant folk. That assumption would be correct. 
</p><p>Trolls bask in the glory of killing, eating their kill, and killing some more. They do this not out of instinct but out of purely evil motives. Their dark hearts pump with malice and the need to destroy that which is not troll. They won't mess with ogres though since ogre meat is not good eating. If they could get away with it, they would dine on dark elves too (though dark elves do not let them get away with it). Being such evil beings, trolls pick up the weapons of a warrior, or follow the dark path of the shadowknight. Occasionally a troll with a minimum level of wisdom may become a shaman.
</p><p>The troll has the natural ability to regenerate which make them troublesome to kill. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><i>Of the ancient trolls and the dragon Trakanon:</i><br /> 
The present day kingdom of Grobb has always been fairly secretive about it's heritage, but common trollish lore tells us that the kingdom has it's roots in the blasted continent of Kunark, a land of venomous rivers, gray wastes, and seething deadwood forests. It is written that here, nestled on the banks of the Murkdweller river, Innoruk chose to taint the bodies of man with cruel magics in his attempt at further having a hold on the prophecied surge of human power in the third age. But with the advent of the war of the broken crown, sages tell that Innoruk eventually forgot about his trollish abominations and left them to die on Kunark. What followed for the trolls was decades of brutal combat as they struggled for the scarce natural resources of their dead continent.
</p><p>It was at this time that the ancient dragon Trakanon took notice of the slowly dying race. To call the ancient one a dragon is purely speculative, as no one has ever seen the terrible beast many think is reponsible for the present condition of Kunark, but the garbled texts of the trolls describe him as one. The dragon is said to have gathered the entire population of Kunark onto one island in the broken teeth chain and there offer the trolls a pact: Trakanon would supply the forgotten children of Innoruk with food and water from his personal jungle lands if they would become his servants. The trolls agreed, regarding Trakanon as a powerful savior, king, and god. Trakanon organized the trolls into separate tribes each to occupy a certain part of eastern Kunark so he could control them better. It was at this time his servants adopted the name "troll" which is a shortened form of the phrase "troll quel'dom gik Trakanon" which meant "the green children of Trakanon" in dragonish.
</p><p>Of Trakanon's seclusion and the wars of the seven tribes: 
It has never been in the power of either man or troll to determine the great dragon's reason for his abandonement, but we can't hope to understand the ways of the immortals. Every text simply states that Trakanon may have just changed his mind. Nevertheless, after centuries of relative peace and harsh rule under their godlike king, the twenty-five tribes of Trakanon entered the second age with their food supply dwindling and shipments coming in less and less frequently. At first there was no panic, the tribal leaders sent messengers to their king to ask forgiveness for whatever they had done wrong, but the messengers started to come back with word that they had been denied an audience with the great dragon. Trollish caravans by the hundreds started to crowd the dark hills of disdain, waiting for the gates to open into Trakanon's hidden kingdom, but that day never came. When word of Trakanon's seclusion started spreading throughout Kunark, each tribe began to move closer and closer to the east where food had once come through. They arrived next to Trakanon's kingdom only to learn that the great dragon king had not been seen for more then 50 years and just recently had closed his gates to all messengers and caravans. The trolls were confused, distraught, and starving, and so they waited in the Kunark east for some word to come from their god.
</p><p>When that word never came, the tribes of Trakanon started to grow restless. Battles started to erupt haphazardly and tribal villages were attacked and plundered. In the shadows of the mountain range "Trakanon's teeth" a new trollish war erupted. The 25 tribes of Trakanon attacked eachother viciously for food and water, and for ten years they battled nonstop until only 7 tribes were left. These 7 tribes retreated to every corner around what is now called the field of bone, named for the countless trollish skeletons which cover the ground. For centuries more the surviving trolls would fight what has been called the war of the seven tribes in their attempts at stealing whatever they could for food and drink, even the flesh and blood of other tribal members. Trollish shamans say that every day while the war raged beneath him, Trakanon sat perched high above his jungle throne, watching his trolls die with a grin on his face. The war would almost cause the complete destruction of the troll race.
</p><p><i>The Troll Migration</i><br /> 
Of Chief Nalikor and the end of the tribal wars:<br />
In the middle of the third age, the tribes of Trakanon were all but completely destroyed. The wars had continued for a century or more and when the seven tribes began to finally die out, mostly from starvation and disease, the trolls moved completely to the north of the field of bone and away from the swamp of no hope, the spot of their creation, forever. There the starving tribe of chief Kateera and the desperate followers of chief Nalikor squared off in one final confrontation. Across the northern shores of Kunark raged a battle so terrible elven bards dare sing of it only in the dark hours of the night. Troll was pitted against troll in the end of a war that would prove what tribe would rule Kunark, and each tribe fought with the single goal of completely destroying the other. Slowly, the two tribes began to die. Trolls began to consume the flesh of slain enemies, as was the accepted custom of the tribe wars, but also the flesh of fallen comrades. In fits of madness, trollish warriors would attack their own tribesmen and then commit suicide. The fights degenerated into scenes of utter insanity as trollish warriors started attacking anyone around them, friend or foe, to eat whatever they killed and to steal whatever they could grab.
</p><p>The two most unaffected by the insanity around them, being veterans of the tribe wars themselves, were the two chiefs: Kateera and Nalikor. Realizing that the battle they had begun would be the beginning of the end of the troll race, both leaders met face to face with a host of their most trusted warriors on what is named Nalikor's Mound by the ancient trollish texts with the simple intent of ending the war once and for all. Every text says Kateera was the one who issued the challenge, and some troll shamans describe Kateera as a foolish, rash young leader who could have never stood a chance against the older Nalikor. Others, however, say that Nalikor and Kateera entered in on an understanding that in order for the trolls to stop the war the young leader had to die. Either way, while the rest of the trollish camps settled down from the war if only for a brief rest under a new moon, the young chief Kateera was run through and beheaded by the old Nalikor. Rather then carry out trollish customs and consume the bodies of his enemies, Nalikor only took Kateera's head as proof of his victory, then buried the young chief and his fallen guards on top of the highest hill in the field of bone, the one most stained with blood. Here the old chief stacked the weapons of warriors that had been dead for centuries and the place was called Nalikor's Mound, a monument to the old tribes of Trakanon and the mark of a new age for the troll race. No one has reportedly seen the mound, but the texts speak of it as a horrible site: a small red mountain with spears and swords thrust through it, surrounded on all sides by the endless troll-skeletons which cover the field of bone. At it's top Nalikor set Kateera's severed head, grinning as it hung from a metal pike.
</p><p><i>Of Trakanon's chosen and the fleet of bone:</i><br /> 
The tribe of the now defeated Kateera surprisingly did not put up much of a resistance when they were told about the death of their leader and their loss in the war. For a week, the survivors of both tribes rejoiced in the end of centuries of warfare, feasting and dancing over the corpses of the dead, but many questions still remained unanswered and many problems were left unsolved. For decades troll shamans had prophecied that the tribe to win the wars would be given unimaginable riches and power by their dragon lord, but Trakanon never revealed himself to the last tribe even after the war was over. Kunark was now completely a blasted land and a graveyard. All the creatures were dead and the undrinkable rivers were red with blood. The tribe of Nalikor thought themselves the sole rulers of their continent, but their continent was left with nothing they could use to survive. When tensions started to rise again among members of the same tribe, Nalikor realized that his followers were ready once more to destroy themselves.
</p><p>Powerless and desperate, the old chief then decided to commit an act of trollish blasphemy: he would cross Trakanon's Teeth, steal his way into the jungle kingdom of the great dragon, and speak to the king of the trolls personally.
</p><p>Many different stories are written about the month-long journey of Nalikor into the forbidden territory of his once-god Trakanon, but all have these few things in common: It is said that the old chief did actually meet the great dragon and that he told Trakanon all but one of the tribes had been killed. The ancient beast obviously admired the chief, as he awarded Nalikor with a magic blade and a key into his eternal kingdom, but the dragon also told Nalikor bluntly that he would give no aid to the trolls. It was then that Trakanon told Nalikor of the other continents and the other races, and that the chief could either lead his people away from Kunark or watch the last tribe die. Nalikor was especially outraged at the mention of more fruitful continents and the elder races, and it is speculated that the hostility trolls have towards all other Norrathians is spawned from this scorned jealousy, like a grown man emerging from a troubled childhood. When Nalikor returned to his tribe he found it in chaos, split among five different leaders each with different plans for Kunark. The old chief killed each would-be-leader quickly, his flaming sword easily cutting them down, and when word of Nalikor's new-found power spread the trolls once more united behind him and gave him the title "Trakanon's chosen."
</p><p>The old chief told all four hundred of his remaining followers what Trakanon had told him, and quickly began to lay out the plan for an escape off their island-continent. With a very limited supply of natural resources, Nalikor and his men built a fleet of five massive ships entirely out of wood, steel, and the bones of dead trolls. With nothing left on Kunark, the trolls gladly boarded the fleet of bone, leaving behind them their entire culture of war and death, and sailed aimlessly for many weeks until coming to the broken skull rock off Antonica, in the middle of the Gulf of Gunthak.
</p><p>Of the Ogre attacks and the treaty of the burning blade: 
Even before they had landed, the ogres of Oggok knew of the formidable and ivory ships sailing for their borders. Thinking they had something to fear from the mysterious troll fleet, which was landing next to the weakest part in the natural defense of Oggok, the ogres immediately gathered a large force of warriors to stop the trolls from advancing. To their complete surprise, the ogres found the strange trolls to almost be their exact equals in combat and the warriors were turned back by the massive tribe of Nalikor. Over the next few days, the ogres would continue their attacks on Nalikor's tribe. The fierce troll warriors, still homeless and starving, were able to fight off the ogres many more times but were only barely keeping Oggok at bay. The Greenblood river is named for the many trolls who died in it's waters as a result of ogre raids. Nalikor, not fully understanding the ogre race or these recent skurmishes, sent word of a treaty to Oggok. To the surprise of all the other races, king Gharn, the eighth warlord of the ogres, whole-heartedly agreed.
</p><p>The ogres and trolls shared a mutual respect, as much a respect as members of those two races can possibly produce. The ogres saw the trolls as merciless warriors with strange powers, but with a harsh and warlike attitude the ogres found pleasing. The trolls, also, respected the strength and kill-or-be-killed ways of the ogre kingdom. Soon the two races found themselves fast allies. On the very place where Nalikor and his followers first landed, broken skull rock, the ogres and trolls signed an agreement that neither force would attack the other. Instead, the ogres would help the trolls establish a kingdom and routes of supplies on Antonica in exchange for troll military support and magical aid. To seal the kinship between ogre and troll, Nalikor gave his own magical blade as part of the arrangement. The sword is still kept on broken skull rock in that same secret meeting place, encased in a magical field of crystal. On it's surface is etched "Here the great alliance was formed between king Gharn the slayer and Trakanon's chosen. May death come to those who seek to disrupt it." Thus the alliance was called the Treaty of the Burning Blade.
</p><p>With the aid of the ogres, out of the ashes of the last tribe of Trakanon sprang forth a new kingdom for the trolls. Nalikor chose the edges of the Innothule Swamp for the trolls to live, which most closely resembled the place of their creation: the swamp of no hope on Kunark. The ogres taught the trolls how to hunt in their new land and how to build fortifications. Nalikor himself was deeply involved in creating the new hierarchy of the troll kingdom and ending the old tribal system of Trakanon, but he died before he could completely achieve his goal. His death resulted in many days of troll mourning, and the burial site of Trakanon's chosen was made the foundation of the new troll city of Grobb- named for Nalikor's successor and the first official king of the trolls. It is said that somewhere deep inside the temple depths of Grobb the trollish shamans still keep watch over Nalikor's key: the only remaining link between the trolls and the ancient kingdom of the dragon Trakanon. 
</p><p>Wood Elf (Fier`Dal)
Wood elves appear somewhat human at first glance, but their very sharp features and pointed ears set them apart. Elves are weaker than humans, but more than make up for this with their amazing agility and superior dexterity. They equal the high man in their intelligence and wisdom, but are much more fair and charismatic. Wood elves make their homes high up in the trees which provide them not only safety, but a view of their cherished woodlands. 
</p><p>Being in tune with nature, wood elves gravitate toward "nature" professions. Their high charisma, dexterity, and agility come in handy for those who hear the call of the muse and become bards. Their admiration and respect of nature allows them to serve as druids, or become rangers. Of course, a strong arm is sometimes needed, so some Fier`Dal become warriors. And of course, it would be such a waste not to put that high dexterity and agility to proper use, so the wood elf makes for a very talented rogue.
