<span class=dateline>March     19, 2003</span> - There comes a time when a tale of an adventurer&#8217;s life must be told. Perhaps now it&#8217;s time for mine.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Connavar Demonblade, a Wolf of the North and Guild Officer of the Swords of Rhigante. A burden lies across my soul and only through sharing it with all of you can it be lifted. Have you ever asked yourself the question &#8220;Why am I here?&#8221; or &#8220;What is my purpose?&#8221; Until recently, I did not understand the importance of those questions, meaningless babble from those educated, well-mannered nobles.<BR>
<BR>
It was one of those nobles, that drove me across Norrath on a quest that would change my life and that of those with me. Are you settled? Then let me begin.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Chapter One: Ascension<BR>
<BR>
It was dark in Halas that night, a mere sliver of moonlight escaping the clouds that enveloped the silver orb. All around the barbarian town was quiet, few were active in the after-hours, gaining rest for the day ahead. The pack of sled dogs were huddled close together in a corner of their pen, occasionally looking up and sniffing the brisk, night air. One of them had his ears stand up, glancing to his left. He stared at the shadows along the wall and sniffed once more. Growling softly, it padded over to the far side of the fence and leant its head through trying to focus on the sound. A sibilant hiss was emanating from the wall and growing slightly louder.<BR>
<BR>
The brief yelps from the hounds that followed could be heard from the lake.<BR>
<BR>
<><BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Of course, Talvaren. I will see that the shipment is delivered. You have my word on that,&#8221; said the merchant.<BR>
<BR>
He cast his gaze at the tall warrior opposite him, noticing the stern features and the dark, brooding eyes. He was big, bigger than the usual Northman, slightly taller and wider in shoulder and chest. The man was currently unarmoured, but as was the norm, carried his Ringed Mace strapped to his waist, the Charred Guardian Shield slung over his left shoulder. Talvaren was one of the holy men of Halas, a Luminary of the Northmen. To other races, he would simply be known as a shaman, to his own people, he was one of the leaders of the community, a religious man charged with much responsibility and also a protector of the land and it&#8217;s people.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Understand this, McGarrin. If the delivery fails to reach Qeynos, we will not be paid. If we&#8217;re not paid, then we cannot afford to buy any ore. If we cannot buy ore, we cannot make armour or weapons. If we cannot make armour or weapons we cannot hunt for food, build homes and shops, or fight back the encroaching gnolls or goblins.&#8221; Talvaren paused for moment.<BR>
<BR>
The merchant was sweating, he knew the man opposite him was infamous for his temper. It was said that during these rages, small particles of ice formed at the edges of his eyes. He glanced up at the shaman&#8217;s eyes and noticed that tiny motes of ice had settled around the sides. He swallowed.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Of course, my lord. I shall ensure that the vials are despatched swiftly. You have my word on it,&#8221; stammered McGarrin. He turned away briefly away from the icy glare of the shaman opposite him.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Stake your life on it, man. Then I might cease to doubt you. Anyhow, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll acquit yourself well,&#8221; said Talvaren. &#8220;Although you are new to our flock, you have gained a reputation for excellent service.&#8221; He turned to glance over his shoulder through the window of the shop. &#8220;But remember, the delivery is vital. Halas depends on it. The Tribunal knows why the Council entrusted such a task to a Southerner, but if they&#8217;re satisfied, so am I,&#8221; he said gruffly.<BR>
<BR>
Glad for the change in subject, McGarrin relaxed slightly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Why did you leave the Council?&#8221; The merchant&#8217;s face blanched when he saw the expression on the shaman&#8217;s face. &#8220;I mean, you don&#8217;t have to..that is. It was just a &#8211;&#8220;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Quit your babbling, man. It&#8217;s a simple question and fair one too. Aye, I left the Council because of many reasons. One of them was because I wanted to spend more time with my family.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Connavar and Ruallen, yes?&#8221; prompted the merchant.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Yes. My boys. Although Ruallen is near sixteen turns now and near the time for Initiation. Conn is only fifteen turns, one short and yet he already shows the signs of greatness.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Connavar. That name rings a bell, if you don&#8217;t mind me saying sir. Isn&#8217;t he the boy who &#8211;&#8220;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Killed a vengeful composer,&#8221; interrupted Talvaren. &#8220;Aye, he&#8217;s the one. But he did have some help though. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve never had the time to pursue further.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Might I enquire what happened?&#8221; asked the merchant, genuinely interested. His fear of the great man had almost gone and he was keen to curry favour.<BR>
<BR>
Talvaren motioned towards the chairs in the corner of the shop. The merchant reached under the counter and brought forth two clay goblets and a pitcher. The two men sat and McGarrin poured half-measures in both goblets.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;To your good health,&#8221; toasted the merchant. Talvaren nodded and raised his goblet in answer.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;My son was out one night searching for his hound. Pesky animals at the best of times, but that night had escaped his leash and run out into the canyons. Conn bless him, ran to my room and drew forth a blade, a great weapon, but one with a fearful history.&#8221; Talvaren sipped his drink.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;The Gigantic Zweihander,&#8221; said the merchant softly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Aye. The very one. It belonged to my cousin&#8217;s husband, until he was slain and was given to me as a gift. &#8220;It was once called the Blade of Wars, y&#8217;know.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Yes. The only blade that survived ice, fire, fog and acid, the blade that had travelled across Norrath in search of its true master,&#8221; confirmed the merchant.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Well, the lad could barely lift the damn thing, but took off into the night after his beloved pup. I blame the wolf-breeding, personally,&#8221; Talvaren chuckled. He drained the goblet and re-filled it. He glanced at the merchant who was completely entranced by the tale. He chuckled again before continuing. &#8220;The boy grabbed a lantern on the way out, his ma taught him that, before tracking the animal to its resting place.&#8221; The shaman&#8217;s eyes grew dark again.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Resting place,&#8221; enquired McGarrin. Talvaren nodded slowly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;The hound had been torn apart, claw marks were apparent all over its body and judging by the distance of the,&#8221; he paused, &#8220;head from the body. It must have been a powerful creature to inflict that kind of damage.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
The merchant said nothing, merely gazing at the shaman opposite him.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Conn then noticed a dark, lithe creature, standing nearby. It was covered in perpetual shadow and moved swiftly without effort. If I weren&#8217;t a scaremonger, I&#8217;d swear on Rallos that it was an Iksar,&#8220; stated Talvaren.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;What would an Iksar be doing this far into Everfrost? They hate the cold and much prefer a dry heat.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You&#8217;re well informed, McGarrin&#8221; said the shaman softly. His eyes narrowed and his frown returned.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You forget,&#8221; began the merchant, &#8220;that I served in the Antonican Lancers for six turns. We fought almost everyone, apart from you Northmen,&#8221; he chuckled.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Aye, you&#8217;re right there, little man. No force on Norrath could match the fury of the Wolves,&#8221; said Talvaren. He poured himself another cup and offered to re-fill the goblet of his companion. McGarrin shook his head in polite refusal.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;And yet, the numbers of Iksar, Ogre, Troll, Goblin, Orc, Gnoll, Kobold and Tier Dal are innumerable, compared to the small forces of light,&#8221; replied McGarrin. &#8220;Thank Brell that they have just as much enmity with each other as they do the good races,&#8221; he continued. He glanced outside through the window and saw a number of carts and wagons being prepared for the journey south. The carthorses were strong and used to the winter cold, covered in light blankets only, and heavily laden, it was important for the beasts not to sweat. In the cold and icy wind, the animals would perish of hypothermia long before they reached the caves of Blackburrow; the home of the Sabretooth Gnolls. The human shivered at the thought.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Well. As much as it has been entertaining, I must be off,&#8221; stated Talvaren. &#8220;My son Ruallen will be accompanying the caravan on its way to Qeynos. It will be his Initiation. I&#8217;m sure you will take good care of him.&#8221; Both men stood and shook hands, in the warrior&#8217;s grip, wrist-to-wrist.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I will, lord. Leave him to me. We will return in a month with the coin that you desire,&#8221; replied McGarrin.<BR>
<BR>
The shaman smiled then strode out of the cabin into the snow-covered street beyond. The air was fresh, and the sun was up. He turned to glance one more time at the merchant standing in the doorway, waving farewell. Just for a brief moment, a sudden movement caught his eye, his honed skills and heightened senses alerting him to a presence nearby. Talvaren closed his eyes and re-memorised a vision spell, chiding himself on how long it took him. &#8216;You&#8217;re getting too old for this&#8217;, he chided himself. His eyes flickered gently and when he opened them, the snowy world of Halas was a tinted green. He turned on the spot, looking for a spirit, undead or invisible demon but could find nothing. He glanced at the still form of McGarrin and noticed a slight aura of purple and blue surrounding the merchant&#8217;s head. Turning once more to the caravan, at where the merchant was looking, his feeling of unease was enhanced. Talvaren walked towards his home, his good mood evaporating with every step.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;A storm is coming,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Hope the pups are ready for it.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
<><BR>
<BR>
The arena was strangely quiet for the middle of the afternoon. A serene calm was placed over the entire site, only the soft background noise of the busier merchants and customers from beyond the archway could be heard. Connavar enjoyed the harmony immensely. It was only here that he truly felt at peace. He chuckled to himself, realising the irony of his feelings; harmony in an arena of discord and chaos.<BR>
<BR>
The youth was tall, even for his age and had already begun to show the signs of a powerful swordsman. His shoulders were broad, hips narrow, biceps, thighs and calves immense from the forestry of his childhood. He had light blonde hair, deep-set hazel eyes and a stern, yet boyish face, Connavar was virtually the mirror image of his father, Talvaren. The one distinguishing feature that set Conn apart from the other boys was the long scar on the left side of face, a memory of the fateful day when he defeated an undead being called a vengeful composer.<BR>
<BR>
He thought back to the folklore lessons at school, recalling that these beings were the physical embodiments of a group of bards who played in the area. However, it was soon discovered that the bards were using their songs to hypnotise their audience and rob, abuse or even slay the unwitting listeners. When the Council were informed, they set about hunting down everyone of the troupe and sentenced him or her to entombment, in ice. Conn laughed at the thought of a lute playing &#8216;veng&#8217;, as they were more popularly known as and pictured a band of vengs together playing the Spring Dance.<BR>
<BR>
Sitting on the top step of the auditorium, he studied the structure of the arena in proper. There were four main pillars at the corners of the pit, a selection of tiered stone benches leading down towards the centre of the arena and at the centre, a ten-foot deep pit, sawdust-covered floor and downward-facing spikes to prevent combatants from climbing out. The young warrior looked at the markings on the wall behind him more carefully. He noticed that a name was meticulously carved into the surface of the stone. He shivered when he realised that the names belonged to those who had been slain in the pit; men and women. Duels and executions, all were here.<BR>
<BR>
Hearing footsteps he looked over his shoulder to see his friend come bounding into the arena.  He was lighter in frame, more lithe like a fox, compared to the powerhouse of a bear that Conn would grow to be. Rizal or Riz to those close to him was training to be a rogue and doing a very good job of it too. Riz had caught the lash from Conn&#8217;s father more times than either of them would care to remember. As was the culture, seeing as Riz was Conn&#8217;s guest in the house, so Riz was his responsibility and the young rogue had a penchant for &#8216;borrowing&#8217; items that did not belong to him. Still, for all his shortcomings, they were the best of friends and nothing short of death would stop that.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Hey Conn, top of the morning to you!&#8221; called Riz. His long, brown hair was tied back in a ponytail. The rogue was carrying a leather backpack slung over his shoulder.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;And to you, my friend. Why are you so cheery this morn?&#8221; asked Conn, an ominous feeling seeping through his bones. Whenever Riz was this happy something was afoot.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Well, my grand warrior. I have a gift for you. And for me of course,&#8221; replied the youth. He dropped the bag on the ground and reached inside. Withdrawing his hand, he slashed a blade of silver through the air, narrowly missing Conn&#8217;s outstretched hand.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Watch what you&#8217;re doing, you little whelp!&#8221; exclaimed Conn. &#8220;By Rallos, that&#8217;s a Langseax! What are you doing with that?&#8221; demanded Conn.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I found it,&#8221; Riz answered. He looked down at his feet that, he noticed, were shifting uneasily left and right. Connavar&#8217;s temper was almost as short and furious as his father&#8217;s was. &#8220;In someone&#8217;s cart,&#8221; he added hurriedly. &#8220;By McGarrin&#8217;s!&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Well, you little thief. You had better just go straight back and return it. Have you learnt nothing from the many layers of skin stripped from you by my father?&#8221; retorted Conn. His brows furrowed and his head leant slightly forwards. &#8220;I have no wish to suffer anymore lashings because of your misguided actions.&#8221; He looked at his friend, now thoroughly miserable.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I was only trying to help. You know, because of your ma-&#8220; Riz stopped short when he saw the pain in his friend&#8217;s eyes. His friend&#8217;s mother had died only a few months ago, slain out of hand by a passing group of raiders. Since that day, both Connavar and his father Talvaren had changed, a blanket of ice and cold protecting them from the outside world. So far, only the lifelong friendship of Riz permitted his closeness being tolerated. All the other youths of Halas had realised long ago to stay away from the Bear and his Cub.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;It&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Conn. &#8220;I&#8217;ve long forgotten about it.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;But you can&#8217;t lock away the pain. You should try to share it, perhaps you can. Lessen it somehow?&#8221; suggested Riz.<BR>
<BR>
The young warrior said nothing, but his eyes held all the sorrow, emotion and rage building in the heart. At last, he breathed deeply, the fire dying from his eyes. He nodded once slowly, took a deep breath, then grinned.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Sure. You&#8217;re right, little minx. Now show me this sword, might as well wield it for a while seeing as we have it, &#8216;eh?&#8221; Conn mused. Riz reached into the bad once more and produced a rapier, but the blade was strangely shortened. It was also blood red in colour.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Tada! A Dragoon Dirk!&#8221; said Riz proudly. &#8220;The weapon of choice for naughty people like me.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Really? I wonder how a rogue stands up to warrior?&#8221; asked Conn, malice glinting in his eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Turn your back and let me show you!&#8221; replied his friend.<BR>
<BR>
Before Conn could answer, Riz launched a blistering series of attacks, thrusting the deadly point of the Dirk at Conn&#8217;s face and chest. Parrying two thrusts and dodging the third, Conn stepped back and grinned.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You sure you want to do this, little fox?&#8221; he asked.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Definitely, I&#8217;ve always wanted to show the bear that strength never defeats guile!&#8221; Riz attacked again, only to find his blade turned and the edge of the Langseax slicing towards his neck. He ducked the blow, then rolled to his right and rising, stabbed out again. Conn saw the move and hopping to his left, blocked Riz at the wrist using his forearm. He stepped forwards into reach and grabbed his friend by the collar.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;When I learn how to dual wield, that move would have killed you, little fox,&#8221; said Conn. Riz motioned towards his belly and saw the point of his Dirk poking into his belly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Is that before I gutted you like a fish, or after?&#8221; said Riz smugly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;How about I gut both of you together&#8221; called out a distant voice. The two youths span around to face the newcomer. The dark, swarthy looks and shaven appearance of Conn&#8217;s older brother could never be mistaken. It was Ruallen.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Nice weapons you have their pups. Mind if I try?&#8221; he asked arrogantly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Come and take it!&#8221; challenged Riz, lifting his Dirk in anger.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Hush, Riz,&#8221; said Conn. Chastised, Riz brought his arm to his sides, and mouth set in a tight grimace. He hated Conn&#8217;s brother, the older youth had bullied him for many turns now. &#8220;What do you want, Ru?&#8221; he asked his half-brother.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Me? I want nothing from you, boy. Father requests your presence at the Hall. Now. But the runt stays here,&#8221; motioning towards Riz.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Fine, I am on my way. I&#8217;ll see you later Riz.&#8221; Conn handed back the Langseax and walked after his brother.<BR>
<BR>
Riz tucked the weapons away. Two of the same father, and yet completely different. Conn was the fury of the storm, brief and powerful, Ru was the raging waterfall, lasting and enduring. The young rogue shook his head, destiny would never let these boys become close. He gathered his belongings and left the arena.<BR>
<BR>
Cont&#8217;d&#8230;<BR>
 <BR>
Chapter Two: Fortunes of War<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You have defiled our lands for too long, barbarian! Die!&#8221; screamed a gnoll. It was standing atop a small cliff-face overlooking the canyon. Behind it were three others armed with various rusty weapons, one gnoll, position behind the others was armed with a bow and had an arrow notched in preparation.<BR>
<BR>
The lead warrior Cavane stepped forwards before the caravan. He was a warrior of medium build and average size only, but was famous for his skills in dual-wielding a pair of Barbed Leather Whips, trophies from a previous encounter during his adventuring days. Now, Cavane was the primary caravan guard, leading a group of six other hardy men and women. Although not the most charismatic leader, he was renowned for obeying his orders to the very last letter.<BR>
<BR>
In this case, it was his duty to see that the caravan and its contents arrived intact at the Arena in Qeynos. That having been successful, he wasn&#8217;t going to let a group of scrawny gnolls stop him from getting home. He looked around and appraised his group of three warriors, two shamen and a rogue. Although young, they were well on their way to their tenth ranks and flourished under the leadership of his twentieth rank skills.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Come on in and die, my beauties,&#8221; challenged Cavane. &#8220;I will not mourn for you when you pass into the next world.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
With that, the gnolls leapt to the ground and engaged the group. Cavane slew one with a combination of three slashes to the chest and head and kicked the dying gnoll firmly in the temple. Hearing the neck fracture he let the corpse fall and turned to watch the progress of the younger members. They were battling bravely, one of them had slain one gnoll and turned round to aid his fellows. Cavane recognised him as Talvaren&#8217;s eldest boy, Ruallen and nodded in grim admiration of the youngster&#8217;s killing ability. The two shamen had cast several spells into the foray, one of them enhancing the abilities of the fighters and the other launching deadly strikes of poison, disease and shards of ice. He couldn&#8217;t spot the rogue, which he assumed, was a good thing.<BR>
<BR>
Ruallen felt the power rise within him. Every thrust, or slash with his sword found their mark unerringly and he often smiled in amusement as his blades felled his opponents. Although one of the youngest caravan guards, he was the only one who had learnt the ability to double attack. Ruallen stepped back from the gnoll engaging him and appraised his enemy. The creature was slightly taller than a southerner, dark-blue skinned and humanoid in physique. However, it had claws on its feet and paws, sharp teeth and distinctly canine features. Ruallen saw that the necklace worn around its neck denoted the creature as a &#8216;guard&#8217;, one of the more powerful gnolls that lived within the caves.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Grr, why you plunder our lands and slay our pups, northlander?&#8221; growled the gnoll guardsman. It twirled the rusty spear in its hand as it spoke.<BR>
<BR>
Ruallen didn&#8217;t answer. He stared directly into the eyes of his enemy, a baleful tawny brown glaring at him with undisguised hatred. Ruallen smiled slowly then chanted a sentence of archaic syllables. The guardsman rushed in towards him, spear raised high and aimed for his heart screaming a battle cry. Ruallen completed the spell and laughed out loud, the gnoll&#8217;s eyes had misted over and were completely black. It began to howl in fear and tottered around, moving carefully as though it was blinded.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I plunder your lands and slay your pups because I can,&#8221; spat Ruallen. &#8220;Perhaps you should go and meet them, &#8216;eh?&#8221; he mused. He stepped in close and rammed the point of the claymore through the chest of the stricken gnoll with such force, the blade went in to the hilt and exited the other side. Grinning as he held the mortally wounded creature up using his sword, Ruallen twisted the blade viciously to secure its release and pushed the creature off his weapon. As it fell howling in pain and terror, he spun on his heel and cut the head from the gnoll using a downward sweep of his sword.<BR>
<BR>
The silence was deafening. Ruallen turned from the corpse to see that the others had despatched their targets moments before and had seen everything during the last few moments. One of them, a shaman called Catalyn was staring at him, a look of disgust in her eyes. Ruallen felt nothing inside. He felt no remorse, no emotions, nothing. He stared at the group around him, Cavane, the guard leader had stepped forwards with his whips unfurled.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Lad, you&#8217;d better give Catalyn your sword and stand with me,&#8221; he said grimly. The rest of the group looked uncomfortable, their weapons still drawn.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Why? I&#8217;ve done nothing wrong,&#8221; cried out Ruallen. His claymore flashed into the air and the group stepped back involuntarily, weapons raised. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Ruallen, I&#8217;m ordering you to drop your sword on the Council&#8217;s honour. I won&#8217;t ask again,&#8221; stated Cavane. His grip on the two whips tightened. He knew that the youth was several ranks his junior and yet, something about the dark warrior made him feel very uneasy. Suddenly, Ruallen drew a hunting knife from his belt and span around to face the wall behind him. He paused for a moment then threw the blade with terrifying speed. It seemed to stop in mid-air, then a gurgling sound echoed throughout the cavern. The rogue appeared in the light, a leather-bound knife in his throat. His hands scrabbled for his neck, pulling out the blade and sending a gush of blood onto the ground. One of the female warriors behind Ruallen cried out and ran forwards and cradled the dying rogue&#8217;s head in her lap.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You whoreson! Why did you do this? Why him? We were to be betrothed next month and now you&#8217;ve taken him from me!&#8221; she screamed at him. Ruallen looked confused but before he could answer she launched herself at him, axe raised high. Instinctively, he ducked the slashing attack, grabbed the girl&#8217;s outstretched wrist and using her momentum, threw her against a wall. Her head slammed against a jutting rock and she fell to the ground unmoving.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;How dare you?&#8221; Demanded Cavane. &#8220;By the justice of the Tribunal, you will pay, boy. Talvaren&#8217;s whelp or not, your time has come,&#8221; he snarled and advanced. The grey blood of slain gnolls glistened from the sharp barbs of his whips and he lashed one between himself and Ruallen. A line was scored into the earth, sending a cloud of dust into air.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Old man,&#8221; began Ruallen. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to join your fallen. How they will plague you for leading them into the jaws of death. Imagine, an eternity of barbarian children begging you to return them to the world of flesh.&#8221; Ruallen&#8217;s eyes grew bleak as he continued. &#8220;How can you best me, when you cannot even learn to control your fear?&#8221; He laughed maniacally then suddenly stretched out his hand towards the nearest of the young guards, a shaman. He suddenly choked and fell to his knees, retching terribly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I&#8217;m poisoned, Cavane!&#8221; exclaimed the shaman. &#8220;Help me!&#8221; he begged in between coughs. Ruallen grinned evilly and moved into position with the rockface behind him.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;If you can defeat me before the poison runs it&#8217;s course, I&#8217;ll cure the boy for you. Now that both of your shamen are, let&#8217;s say, incapacitated.&#8221; He spun and muttered incomprehensibly at the other shaman, Catalyn. She shrieked in fear and terrified, smashed through her comrades and ran out of the caves into the night. &#8220;If you cannot, I&#8217;ll slay them all before your dying eyes,&#8221; hissed Ruallen sibilantly.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;By the Gods boy, what are you?&#8221; asked Cavane. Ruallen laughed again and a moment later, a skeleton with rags hanging from the pale bones seemed to unearth itself from the ground. The eyeless sockets scanned the remaining group and reached down to pick up the spear dropped by the gnoll guardsman.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I&#8217;m Death, old man. And I&#8217;m here to claim you,&#8221; he replied. The blood of innocents is always sweeter than those who have been sullied, he thought.<BR>
<BR>
<><BR>
<BR>
The winter nights in Everfrost were always much colder than Connavar thought they would be. He climbed atop a drift and stared out over the tundra. It was a harsh, unforgiving land, many travellers had perished in the shifting snows trying to find the city of Halas and felt not the slightest remorse for their loss. It was one such traveller who had passed on the ownership of the weapon he now used, a Langseax of the Wolves. Dressed in light patchwork armour, he removed his polar bear skin skullcap and drew forth the great sword. Finding firmer ground, he went through some practice swings, noticing with grim respect the awesome power of the blade as it sliced effortlessly through the cold air.<BR>
<BR>
For some strange reason, he felt stronger when wielding the blade and almost a sense of improved balance when moving. Connavar leapt into the air and spinning, slashed the two-handed blade into thick branch of an oak nearby. He withdrew the blade and pivoting on his heel, he slashed in a tight arc the opposite direction and sent the heavy sword completely through the branch with so much force, he almost lost his footing. A little tired now, he gathered his cap then sat on an outcropping of rock and sipped from his water flask.<BR>
<BR>
It had been three months since the caravan left for Qeynos. Numerous runners had been despatched to locate the group and its cargo, but all had failed in gathering any information. He was particularly alarmed to discover that Rizal, his best friend had been sent with them and his betrothed, a warrioress called Arianna had insisted she go too. His brows furrowed when he thought of his lifelong relationship with the slim rogue. Although Riz was talented, he didn&#8217;t have the heart for slaughter. Unlike yourself, Lord of War. Conn blinked, then looked around him. The snows had drifted in while he was lost in thought and the path back to Halas was blocked. He shivered when he realised that in a few minutes, the temperature would drop and he would die soon afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
He sheathed his sword and trudged off into the tundra. He was careful not over-exert himself, to sweat would swiftly lead to hypothermia as the sweat becomes ice under his clothes. The snowfall became heavier and movement was almost impossible. An hour later, Conn discovered that he had walked almost in a circle and exhausted collapsed into the soft snow. He closed his eyes for a few moments then suddenly opened them. No, if you sleep, you will die! Get up, told himself. Rising wearily to his feet, he trudged on. A hundred yards further down, he saw an opening in the side of a cliff. Spurred on, motivated by the thought of shelter, he heaved himself forwards through the howling winds and into the cave. He fell once more only to dimly realise he was being lifted by strong hands.<BR>
<BR>
As the warmth of a fire drew closer, he closed his eyes and slept without dreams.<BR>
<BR>
<><BR>
<BR>
Conn opened his eyes to the murky gloom of a cave. He took a moment to gather his senses, then felt a rough-hewn blanket under him, wolf skins over his legs and abdomen. He sat up and nausea almost swamped him.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Careful, lad&#8221; said a gruff voice from a dark corner. &#8220;You&#8217;ve caught quite a chill and your body needs rest. The flow of blood isn&#8217;t quite what it was a few days ago, boy.&#8221; Conn strained to see into the shadows but saw only the large outline of a fur-wearing man, huge and unmoving.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Few days? How long have I been lying here?&#8221; asked Conn. His sword was sheathed and lying near him, scabbard gleaming in the firelight.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;About four days and five nights. And don&#8217;t bother with the weapon, I would doubt you had the strength to lift it,&#8221; said the stranger. He seemed amused.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Really?&#8221; challenged Conn, his anger drove away his weakness and he staggered to his feet. Shrugging off the blankets, he took a deep breath, knelt down and retrieved his sword from the floor of the cave. &#8220;What if I say I have the strength and the will to use it?&#8221; he said groggily. Conn shrugged off the rest of his furs and levelled the shining blade towards to the stranger.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Hah!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Then the cub has spirit to match his claws, &#8216;eh? I would say, young man, that unless I was very unlucky, slipped and fell atop your blade, the chances of you defeating me if you were fully refreshed would be minimal. Now, sick as a dying elk? A goblin&#8217;s chance in Lavastorm, boy. So put away your weapon and have some stew.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t patronise me!&#8221; shouted Conn. &#8220;My father is Talvaren Odysseus, Oracle of Halas and Guardian of Everfrost. If he knew of you-&#8220; started Conn.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Silence.&#8221; The man&#8217;s shoulders rose and he slowly stood up. Conn noticed the stranger was still bowing his head to avoid scraping the roof of the cave. &#8220;You&#8217;re Talvaren&#8217;s boy, &#8216;eh? Well, let me see how a shaman instructs a boy how to use his sword. He should stick to casting True North!&#8221; snorted the man.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t insult him! You know nothing of him!&#8221; shouted Conn, anger fuelling his tired limbs. He strode forwards and swung with all of his might at the man. The stranger ducked and moved into the light. Under cover of darkness, the man had seemed simply large. In the dancing firelight, the man was a giant. Almost fully seven feet tall and of immense breadth of shoulder and chest, his bulk was only accentuated by the hooded cloak he wore. Conn peered into the face of the man under the cowl, only to step back when he heard the rasping of steel being drawn from his scabbard. He saw a curved blade drawn from under the rippling cloak and recognised it immediately.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;A Yakesha,&#8221; he gasped. The stranger reached under his cloak once more and drew another curved sword with his offhand.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Do you recognise this too?&#8221; he asked. Conn shook his head, watching how the man before him comfortably held the blades. Strangely, this did not comfort him in the slightest. &#8220;It&#8217;s an Electrum-Bladed Wakazashi. One of a pair, but I lost the other some time ago. Can you tell me what the first principles of fighting a dual-wielding opponent are when you&#8217;re using a two-handed sword?&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Umm,&#8221; said Conn. &#8220;Not really.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Not really?&#8221; repeated the man stonily. &#8220;Let me give you an example of what I mean.&#8221; The stranger leapt over the fire and slashed his sword at Conn&#8217;s face. He parried the first blow, only to find his opponent&#8217;s wrist rolling with the block and slashing in from another angle. Conn desperately parried using the &#8216;foible&#8217; or lower part of the blade and sidestepped a stabbing attack from the man&#8217;s offhand. Stumbling over his blankets, he rolled onto his feet and lashed out with his blade. The man neatly blocked it and stepping inside Conn&#8217;s reach slammed his shoulder into Conn&#8217;s chest. Stunned, the youth fell back and landed in a heap on the floor, looking up to feel the tip of his opponent&#8217;s sword gently tapping his forehead.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked the man. &#8220;What have you learnt?&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You&#8217;re a whoreson and you&#8217;ll pay for this,&#8221; spat Conn. The grinned then nicked Conn&#8217;s cheek with the point of his sword. Conn cried out and clutched his cut face and looked up with undisguised malice.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I may pay for this but who will avenge you, if you don&#8217;t tell anyone?&#8221; The man paused. &#8220;Now tell me what you&#8217;ve learnt.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
Conn paused in thought for a moment, swallowing his anger and playing back the last few moments. The man&#8217;s speed was incredible, overwhelming Conn&#8217;s defence through an all-out attack, blocking only when Conn had accidentally fallen over the blankets.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Reach. You came inside the reach of my two-hander where it&#8217;s less effective,&#8221; answered Conn.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Good. And how would react against that kind of attack again, boy?&#8221; asked the man once more.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;My name is Connavar,&#8221; said Conn angrily. The man laughed for a while, then cut Conn&#8217;s other cheek with the Wakazashi. Conn, eyes wide open clasped his left cheek with his left hand.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;And mine is Alaric. However, fail to answer me again and I shall open your throat and throw your corpse out for the wolves. Am I understood?&#8221; Conn nodded. &#8220;So answer me.&#8221; Conn thought again, replaying the brief fight in his mind.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Keep my distance by circling you,&#8221; Conn replied.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;There might be something worth training in that sack of bones yet, but I think there might be one last thing you missed.&#8221; Alaric turned around for a brief moment to retrieve a fallen blanket. Taking his chance, Conn sprang from the floor, grabbed his sword and leapt at the man screaming a battle cry. At the last moment, Alaric ducked the swinging blade and brought his knee into his opponent&#8217;s belly. Conn let out a great whooshing noise as the wind was knocked from him but swung his left fist into the face of his aggressor. He heard it crack into Alaric&#8217;s jaw and then sent his right shoulder thudding into the great man&#8217;s chest. Following through he swung his left fist in a backhand, only to feel Alaric&#8217;s elbow hammer into his temple.<BR>
<BR>
Dazed and half-spun from his feet, he regained his senses and turned to face Alaric only to see a massive fist crash under his chin, the uppercut almost lifting the youth from his feet. Falling into a crumpled heap, he looked at Alaric with closing eyes. Conn had trouble focusing and struggled to keep Alaric in view.<BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You&#8217;re game lad. But a sick cub, should know better than to fight a fit bear. Sweet dreams,&#8221; said the man looming over him.<BR>
<BR>
Conn closed his eyes as his vision swam, the firelight created shadows that danced and teased on the wall of the cave. He fell once again into the darkness of oblivion.<BR>
