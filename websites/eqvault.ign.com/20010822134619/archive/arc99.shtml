Here are the latest posts from Gordon Wrinn that he made today on the Gameplay forum:<UL><b>Clipping Plane Nerfed?</b><br>I know I posted in another thread about this, but since this seems to be the active issue-tracking thread, I'll update it here. <P>Basically, I'm checking into this. Unfortunatly the person I need to speak to it out on paternity leave. He'll be back next week I believe. For what it's worth, I haven't noticed a change, but one of the other developers did. If anything happened, it wasn't intentional, but might have been a side-effect of something else. I'll keep you updated. Just be sure to remind me next Monday :)<P><b>Inaccurate Stat Information in the EQ Manual</b><br>The only patch I'd do to the stats information in the everquest_manual.txt would be to remove that section. <P>However, there's quite a few other things in the manual that could use an update. That update is being written now, so it wouldn't make much sense to do an incomplete update of the manual.<P><b>Plane Drop Note</b><br>Just dropping a note to let you know that I've read this, but I can't comment on specific drops of planes, gods, dragons, etc. We are constantly creating new items and removing old ones from the treasure tables of all of the above. Sometimes certain things will only drop for a week, other times they may last for months. <P>Basically, there should always be a chance that you'll get something truly rare in those encounters.</UL>

On the Gameplay board, Gordon Wrinn made the following post regarding the Shaman class:<UL><i>Hello all, <P>We just got out of our tuning meeting for this week. I did want to talk a bit about the Shaman changes that occurred on Test last week, and let you know about our plans for the production servers: <P>Strength: Last week we changed this spell on test to limit its effect and bring it in line with other 49th level shaman stat buffs. However, today we decided to leave it as it is on the production servers. <P>Togor's Insects: Despite the fact that information was changed in the spdat.eff file, the maximum effectiveness of the spell didn't change. This is another case where something that was previously controlled in code was moved to the spell database. Those parsers really only show half the picture. <P>Check the UltraDeath spells (1, 2, & 3) for details. <P>-Gordon</i></UL>Afterwards, Gordon dropped by the same thread again and responded to some of the player's comments:<UL>Didn't Abashi say that Togors *was* reduced? Maybe part of the problem is that he doesn't know everything, doesn't get told everything, so we get the wrong information sometimes. How many times is it going to happen, though?<P><b><i>We don't get everyone on the EQ Team together every time a question comes up on the boards. Once a week, we have tuning meetings, where we do get everyone together. At today's tuning meeting, we found out that the change made to the spdat.eff didn't have any effect on the spell since it was being controlled in code. The control for this spell will be turned over to the spell database shortly, since code-controlled caps have to be adjusted to make room for levels above 50.<P></b></i>How many times is it going to happen, though?<P><b><i>It's not unusual for someone here to make a comment of the top of their heads, for me to post about it, then for it to be checked in code to find out that what they remembered wasn't entirely accurate. It's just a drawback of having a project that is this large; no one can remember everything off the top of their head. So how many times is it going to happen? Once in a while for certain. <P>Now I've *always* admitted it when released information wasn't correct, despite all of the grief that comes along with it. This is despite the fact that it seems to get held over our heads forever, even though the same people who hold it over are heads are the same ones that post "Just tell us the truth and we'll stop complaining". <P>Now if everyone would like me to act like a typical PR guy, only telling you what you want to hear, and spending more time trying to figure out how to sugar-coat issues than just addressing them, I can do that. Just hold a poll and I'll adhere to the results.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the second response Gordon made:<UL>You say "the maximum effectiveness of the spell didn't change" does this mean that Togor's is still as effective as it was before at 50th level? OR Is the maximum effect still the same, just reached at higher levels (i.e. 60)?<P><b><i>The former. The spells effectiveness hasn't changed at 50th level. <P>This type of thing is going to be happening with a number of spells as time goes on. Many spells have a base effect, plus an additional effect per level. Since max level in the game is currently 50, the level caps the effect of the spell. However, when the max level is raised, the spell would be allowed to continue improving automatically up until the next max level. The resulting value from the linear improvement is often too high for the mana and casting time. As such, caps have to be noted specifically within the spell database. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the third:<UL>Abashi, also concerning Shaman spells on test, is it your goal to keep the classes strengths the same?<P><b><i>Generally, yes. The focus of each class won't be changing as part of the expansion. As for all of the examples you brought up though, as I mentioned before I won't be commenting on any of the information pulled out of the spdat.eff in regards to the expansion. The only reason I made comments regarding Togor's and Strength was because it affected existing spells in-game.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the fourth:<UL>CONTRADICTION<P><b><i>Read those two quotes again. They say the same thing. And no, there's no hidden meanings, nor foretelling of impending nerfs. <P>Let me clarify again, and I'll try not to leave any room to be misinterpreted:<P>ON PRODUCTION CURRENTLY:<P>The spell is capped by code.<P>ON TEST CURRENTLY:<P>The spell is capped by the spell database.<P>As for the person who made the comment about 100 percent certainty: That's not exactly reasonable.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>And finally:<UL>Gee, I didn't realize that programming was some sort of vague, arcane art where complete certainty of the effect you were trying to realize was impossible.<P> <b><i>And people say *I'm* sarcastic.<P>You might consider for a moment that EQ was not coded solely by one person over the course of a long lunch. It&#8217;s hard enough to be 100% certain about your own work before you take into account how it&#8217;s going to interact with everyone else&#8217;s. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid made a few board posts today on the Gameplay forum.  I've compiled these posts into a single post of quotes and excerpts.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>On Rangers</b><br>Guys, if you take my comments regarding this issue IN CONTEXT you'll find that I was talking about aspects of the game that didn't turn out necessarily the way I personally wanted them to. <P>There aren't many, but they're there.<P> One of them, as I've commented before, is the way Rangers turned out. My PERSONAL vision of a Ranger is more of a dual wielding blademaster and less of a caster. <P>Well, it didn't turn out that way, although the Ranger is still an AWESOME class and the class I choose to play. <P>Why didn't it turn out that way? Because the team wanted to go a direction with the Ranger and we work as a team. <P>I guess the whole problem here is that I made some statements as a PLAYER involving my personal opinion, when about 99% of the time when I post I'm representing Verant, the team, etc. <P>Anyway, bottom line is that Rangers are a very good melee class with some strong casting ability and to upgrade the melee side such that they were 'masters of dual wield' would mean we'd have to nerf their spells, and we're not willing to do that. <P><b>On Overcrowding</b><br>I'm reposting something I wrote tonight in responce to another thread in order to make sure no one misses it. The thread is/was about overcrowding and the math involved in determining how many servers we need and such: <P>------ <P>Actually, I think the math is as follows: <P>(a) Target peak usage per server : 1800<br>(b) Current number of servers : 28<br>(c) Average total users online during peak hours : 50,000 <P>And I'll also add some additional but not necessarily relevant to the math data, which we've released before and which continues to grow quite rapidly:<P>(d) Current number of subscribers: 196,000 <P>So, that means about 26% of our player base plays during peak hours. 25-30% is, btw, pretty typical for MMORPGs. I just wanted to go over that briefly as well since I've seen all sorts of formulas and calculations posted in overcrowding discussions. <P>Anyway, back to the relevant math: <P>c / a = 27.7, being the number of servers we'd need to have to maintain Target peak usage per server. <P>Now, before everyone gets too excited or upset at this math, there are definitely a few issues here to go over: <P>First, the peak usage per server is NOT equal. Some servers go over 2000 while some average 1200 or so. <P>Second, one can argue the 1800 target number in a couple of different ways. <P>When we first started thinking about target server capacities (pre-beta) we said somewhere between 1000 and 1500. As we entered beta and these numbers became less theoretical we changed our target to 1500. Then, as the game matured after launch and the level spread grew (meaning there are lower level players, mid, and high, spread out over varying zones, depending generally on the intended level ranges of those zones) we changed our target peak usage number to approximately 1800. <P>But there are some problems with that, of course. First, when we launch a new server, it tends to fill up with, of course, newbie players (in terms of their level). This means low-level zones are full and mid to high level zones empty. So you have worse crowding until people spread out level-wise. Second, you could simply debate whether 1800 on a mature server is really a good number. <P>In principal I think it is IF people are really spread out. And, of course, they're not. Some dungeons and outdoor areas have a LOT more players than others even though both have similar target level ranges. <P>So, this is why that even if you do the correct math (which I believe I've done up above), which concludes with 28 servers we're just about where we should be, there is still definitely a crowding problem. <P>I will reiterate our plan to deal with the problem: <P>1. Launch at least one more server and fill it with players from the more populated servers. These players will be taken from the group that plays during peak hours so that we don't pull people who play during off peak-hours and risk creating an under-population problem. Looking at the numbers right now I think the Druzzil Ro endeavor was fairly successful: Fennin Ro has 1670 players right now (with about 47K online), while Bristlebane (a server we didn't pull players from) has 1867. <P>2. Continue to re-tune and revamp underutilized zones. We need to entice our players, compelling them to spread out to many of the zones that just aren't used much (for example, Najena, Permafrost, Mistmoore, Kerra Ridge, etc.) <P>3. Launch the Expansion which will increase the size of the world by over 33% and add more than 25 new zones (all with different level spreads, ranging from newbie zones all the way up to level 40-60 zones). <P>So, in summary, that's our plan and that's how we're looking at the situation and how to address it. Your feedback and comments are welcome. <P><b>Blast from the Past</b><br>[This was part of a server wide broadcast from Aradune on Friday, March 26, 1999.]<P><i>"As for total number of servers, don't worry. The others aren't full yet and we can bring new servers online very fast. FYI the servers themselves can handle more than this no problem. It's a matter of crowding. I imagine it bothers some people more than others. So this has all just been a suggestion. I'm just trying to help "</i> <P>Just to put my broadcast in perspective, that was back when we were well under the number of servers, the amount of bandwidth, the places to put server farms, etc. we had planned (even though we had severe problems GETTING the bandwidth we'd been promised initially, but that's old news).<P>Since then the game has sold well above and beyond our expectations and beginning late last year approximately it's taken longer to get new servers up because of the housing and bandwidth issues.<P>We have been and continue to play 'catch-up' to some extent.</UL>

From Kevin:<BLOCKQUOTE>EQG2 was a success far past what we expected. We had a little over 140 people pre-registered, and we had over 240 people at the event. Cindy and I want to extend our thanks to everyone that attended, especially the Verant representatives without whom the event would not have been such a success.<P>We were treated to the most extensive public look at EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark that has been given to date, and let me be the first to say that it looks like it's going to blow our socks off! We were also fortunate enough to be able to give away several copies of the product that will be shipped to the winners when it is released.<P>We are currently in the planning stages for EQG3, and we would appreciate any input you can give us as to how to make the event better. Please come visit us at www.eq-event.com and give us your input on the message board. Everlore will be hosting a poll for us to help us decide where EQG3 will take place. From our informal poll on our website and at the event, the top contenders are, in no particular order: Los Angeles, Denver, Orlando, and Las Vegas. Stop by <a href="http://www.everlore.com">www.everlore.com</a> today and register your vote.<P>Next update when we have pictures posted. :) <P>Kevin Scott <br>The EverQuest Gathering </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Kevin!

Our policy could better be defined as "Neutral until proven one way or the other". If someone is "proven guilty", then they are frequently removed from our customer-base. If they are "proven innocent", they'll usually get a reimbursement. <P>The best analogy for this type of operation would probably be a bank. </b></i><P>Why do you choose to ruin the play experience of honest people to prevent dishonest people from cheating? <b><i><P>We don't "choose to ruin" anyone's play experience. However we must have a set of policies to insure everyone receives the same treatment. Now that doesn't mean that by treating everyone the same that the outcome will be "fair", but at least it is uniform. </b></i><P>He returned and *poof* all his equipment from two separate characters were gone <b><i><P>Though I'm not familiar with this particular incident, it sounds like someone else had his username and password. In fact, that's really the only way this particular thing could have happened. We can't take responsibility for the security of the username and password for player&#8217;s accounts, which is why we prohibit giving them to anyone. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest has been named CGO's Online Game of the Year in their <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/026/150/intro.html">Computer Games Awards</a>.  Here's a clip:<BLOCKQUOTE>EverQuest remains a game for the dedicated and not the casual player. The game ruthlessly encourages, and almost demands, that you play as part of a group and not go it alone. One result of this is that only those players with a lot of time to invest in the game, and who are lucky enough to be able to coordinate that time with a regular group of friends, are able to advance to their full potential. </BLOCKQUOTE>Spotted on the net's #1 source for CRPG news and views the <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com">RPGVault</a>.

As you can see from this conclusion, the author wasextremely impressed:<BLOCKQUOTE>EverQuest, simply put, is the most addictive game this reviewerhas ever played. If you want a _fun, engrossing, addictive_ game, then lookno further. Buy yourself a fortified bunker. Station guards at the entryhatch. Seal yourself in. Bring supplies -- LOTS of supplies. Break up withyour girlfriend. Sell your dog. Mortgage your house. Don't forget theport-a-potty.

The first report of the Gathering II, the real-life event that took place in St. Louis last Saturday, has been posted by MakeItSimple.com.  The most interesting pages cover the <a href="http://www.makeitsimple.com/news/gamenews/everquest_g2/page2.html">Demo of Ruins of Kunark</a> and the <a href="http://www.makeitsimple.com/news/gamenews/everquest_g2/page3.html">Q&A with Verant Interactive</a>.  Here's a few excepts:<UL><b>Graphic Enchancements</b><br>The graphic enhancements were the first thing we noticed, and while not making it a whole new game, they're pretty impressive. Screenshots can reveal the increased poly-counts and texture sizes, but once you actually see the game in real-time, you get a full understanding of the enhanced graphic features. New animation effects are evident in objects such as trees that sway in the wind, or the shuffling of the Forest Giant's vest as he moves about. <P><b>GZ Keeps His Cool</b><br>We also managed to catch Geoff Zatnik (GZ), who designed the EQ spell database among other things, talking in-depth about current issues and upcoming features. He was given a particularly hard time by a certain attendee who felt that the Wizard class was underpowered. Despite this person's repeated complaints and attacks, not once did Geoff lose his cool, tactfully addressing each and every point with a rational explanation. His dialogue was a real testament to the professionalism and expertise of the Verant staff. <P><b>Hell Levels</b><br>Although they wouldn't confirm this, they did say that every level after 50 would be the equivalent of a "hell level". Currently, the "hell levels" are 30, 35, 40, and 45, which take considerably longer to advance through than the other levels. </UL>Be sure to check out the complete report for all the info!

There was a very good turnout at the event; at the peak time I counted 140+ players. I was told at the event that other bazaars have been tried, but failed. I am so glad this one worked! All that I could see had fun and sold/bought what they needed.<P>I would like to make this a weekly occurrence on Xegony since we have no weekly bazaars. So I will also say in advance that the next Xegony TradeFair/Bazaar will be held Saturday, March 11th at 9PM EST. This is much better then the one day notice I gave before.

All info is collected from the many EQ related sites across the internet and presented in clean, "plain jane" form for easy surf-free reading. <P>Our hope is that TheSky.Org will not be competition for various sites (like EQVault), but a gateway of EQ information to all the great sites that are out there.<P>So please, drop by and enjoy the fruit of our labors thus far!<P>- John "Syruss" Wooldridge (<a href="mailto:syruss@thesky.org">syruss@thesky.org</a>)</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

While making my rounds on the Gameplay board today, I came across this post made by Gordon Wrinn:<UL><i>I have a question for everyone here. Maybe we'll try to come up with a login poll as well. <P>Should the GM/Guide staff even try to get involved in Kill/Camp/Spawn Stealing issues? <P>If so, what would you suggest for a uniform policy that will work in the vast majority of cases? Now before you say something like "he who was there first", please limit your response to the information that a GM will have at the time. They are called after a problem has occurred. When they get there, they have no idea who was there first. All they know is that there are bunches of people here all pointing fingers at each other. <P>I'd just like to hear the player&#8217;s thoughts. GMs and Guides already get a large number of player personality issues that they have to work out. On a player with 1800 people, a full 30% of the petitions is usually due to someone having a problem with another player. On the PvP servers, that's upwards of 80%, despite the fact that you think that players might be more likely to take matters into their own hands. <P>Thoughts?<P> -Gordon</i></UL>That thread can be found by <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/023776.html">clicking here</a>.

Gordon Wrinn, of Verant Interactive,  was busy on the boards today.  Here are quotes and excerpts from his latest posts:<UL><b>Up'ing the group limit to 8</b><br>I think that this would tend to exacerbate the problem more than solve it. My *pet* idea for getting people to spread out would be to make heavily camped zones dynamically turn PvP when too many people are in them. Somehow I don't think the tuning team, not to mention the customers, would go for that one.<P><b>NPC Binding</b><br>Being honest with you Krux, the idea of making NPCs so they can Bind PCs is really a dead horse. I've seen all kinds of reasonable proposals, but the truth remains that limited melee binding is not an oversight, but part of the plan.<P><b>Languages</b><br>I'll forward this to the client programmer. I think it would make a bit more sense for the language to be changed with a "/language" command that takes the language name as a parameter. It might make a nice change if his schedule frees up for a few hours.<P><b>Monk Issues</b><br>Someone sent me an email yesterday outlining some pretty compelling issues with some of the monk stuff. Specifically mentioned was the fact that a lot of the pre-plane stuff has better stats than shiverback. I'm looking this info over now. <P>As for AC in general, Monk pieces will always be pretty low in AC due to the fact that monks get an AC bonus just for being a monk. But I do think that the plane gear should probably be better than the mundane stuff. <P><b>Kunark Pricing</b><br>Discounted compared to the cost of buying a brand new boxed set. <P>But if the complaint in general is that people who have been playing for a year will pay more money for EQ+expansion than new players will pay for EQ+expansion, this is true, and an acceptable standard in business. <P>Analogies work best for this:<P>1. Take for instance if you buy a brand new car as soon as the model-year is available. You'll pay more than someone who buys the same new car prior to the next model-year being released.<P>2. People who bought a DVD player as soon as they went on the market will pay more than people who buy them now.<P>3. HDTV compliant sets are pretty pricey now. I'm waiting a while. Hopefully I'll not only get a better price, but a better set.<P>4. My computer at home is a PII-450. I can still buy a brand new PII-450, and it will cost me much less than my computer did originally. <P>The additional money you pay when something first comes out is a premium for being among the first to own it when its brand new. <br>--<br>Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to dance. We're still waiting on the pricing to be finalized. <P><b>Potion Issues</b><br>There were a couple of things such as this that were suggested back when I was settling into the job here. <P>Having meaningful healing potions out there that can be bought from a vendor would reduce class-interdependence. Yes, as you said, your suggestion is a money sink that would help all classes solo better, but the truth is that that is a money sink that we've specifically decided not to take advantage of. We don't allow people to buy healing, nor do we allow them to buy experience. That's why the healing potion is basically useless, and it's also the reason why we've adjusted the experience given out by some quests.<P><b>Why Servers weren't selected for the Transfer Option</b><br>It depends on the time of day really. There were any number of servers we could have chosen for the other two besides Fennin that we took people from. <P><b>Togor Issues</b><br>I understand where you are coming from, and you make a lot of sense. The issue is that an upgrade to Togor's is planned for the expansion, and it will *probably* be better than the this one was. However the level to which that would have been better would be too small to be worthwhile had Togors not been adjusted. <P>Strength has a similar issue, except its problem was a pure error in the entry of spell data as opposed to an overpowering, as in Togor's case. To illustrate this, a spell can have X effect, plus Y effect per level. When these spells were being entered in batch, the previous spell that was added had a "Y" value, but a much lower value of X. When Strength was put in, the existing Y value wasn't reset to its default value. <P><b>Cleric Armor</b><br>The AC of the cleric class-specific armor is being increased based upon a spreadsheet that was sent to me by one of the players. <P>I think I mentioned last week that we were going to take another look at some of the class-specific armor.<P><b>Spawn Times</b><br>Actually, spawn times across servers are all somewhat independent, based upon the load in the zone (and other zones running on the same piece of hardware). The servers automatically throttle how much they have to keep track of so that they don't peg their processor usage, which would be *really* bad. <P>The problem on Bristlebane a bit back where the spawn times in LowerGuk were 3 times normal had to due with this same issue. Of course in that case it was due to a bad piece of hardware.<P><b>On Alchemy</b><br>The latest changes to alchemy were a complete overhaul. I wouldn't be surprised if it still needs a tweak or two, specifically in the area of prices. However, we'll let people settle in and wait for the initial shock wears off before making any firm plans. <P>I should probably note that I've gotten email both ways. Some people think it's fantastic now and needs no changes. The some think that the potions that can be made are great, but the prices need a tweak, and some people think that it's completely useless.<P><b>Shaman Issues</b><br>These are some compelling arguments about the shaman spells. I'll bring them up at the tuning meeting. What will happen if we decide not to change them is that you might not get as many spells as were planned in the expansion, but it's a thought. <P>Be honest with me for a second, is the shaman class really "destroyed" by a 5% ranged reduction in the attack-speed slowing of Togor&#8217;s and a 20-some point reduction in Strength? <P>As for the clipping plane, I'm still trying to get with the client programmer about it. I'll get back with you.<P><b>Smushu + Torakk = g47</b><br>Of course. This change was made due to a balance iss.....er... wait.. I have *no* idea what this is about... :)<P><b>More Rogue Issues</b><br>This was not an "either/or" situation. Poison is still on the plate. However we were looking for other ways to reduce the perception that rogues "sucked". <P>That's where evade came in. One of the major complaints I saw was that rogues constantly caught the critter's attention because of all the damage they did, and ended up dead faster than the cleric could heal them, thus making the cleric OOM and unable to support the real, thus killing the whole group. <P>Testing showed this to be a valid issue, one that the monks (the other high speed melee damage dealers) didn't have to contend with due to feign death. Just giving rogues Feign Death would have been pretty easy, but we didn't want to just copy the monk. The Evade ability integrated into the Rogues hide fit the bill pretty well, and from what I see on the Safehouse, they are very happy with it. Most of them have even seen their damage potential go up due to the number of additional backstabs they get in, and not nearly as much running around screaming "TAUNT IT!! TAUNT IT!!" like they used to :)<P>The hotkey lock problem is also still on the table. <P><b>GS Interview: "Making items not class-specific will decrease camping"</b><br>Brad's out of the office today, on his way to St. Louis for EQ Gathering II, but I'll put my money on that being a typo. Considering that the changes that have been made to the game to reduce camping has included the introduction of class-specific items, I think that's a fairly safe bet :)<P><b>Rechargable Items</b><br>We're actually going to start experimenting with some recharable items soon. The difficulty is making it sufficiently meaningful that it still counts. For instance, if an item off of a deity gives 5 charges of Clarity, we don't want to make recharging it so easy that it hurts the enchanter. Many of the charged items out of the Plane of Sky will be rechargable. Based on how those go, we might make additional items rechargable.<P><b>On Quests</b><br>Some quests do have level limits necessary to *start* the quest. However once someone knows it they can do it over and over again as long as their faction is good. <P>In hindsite, we would like to have included not only level limits, but a way to keep track of the quests completely to disallow quest farming. We'll certainly keep these issues in mind for future products.<P><b>Roleplaying Servers</b><br>We consider all servers to be RP servers since this is a role-playing game. Role-playing is a personal decision that each player makes for themselves. The joy for role-playing should be role-playing itself, not any tangible benefit handed out by the game. That's why when people say "There's nothing to encourage role-playing", I get very confused, as there is everything to encourage it, except perhaps ones own propensity to become self-conscious. <P>Now, if you are asking about an "Enforced Role-play" server, we'd consider it as soon as someone comes up with a definition for role-play that would allow us to enforce it. We catch a lot of flack for our naming policy, which is much clearer than any enforced role-playing server could be in my humble opinion. <P>Now if we are talking about an un-enforced role-play server, I'd have to say that that would do no better than the servers we have now, which are all basically un-enforced roleplay servers. Perhaps in name alone, it would support further role-playing, but I'm sure that many people of all play-styles would join it, if for no other reason than it had less players for the first few hours. </UL>

An important new message is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>March 2nd, 6:30pm<br>------------------------<P>***Additional Server Migrations***<P>Tonight, during primetime hours, we will again be opening the registration log on Fennin Ro to allow another batch of people to request an account-move to the new server, Druzzil Ro.  In addition, we will also be opening the logs on Solusek Ro and Xegony, allowing some of the people on those two servers to move to Druzzil Ro as well. <P>All of the information contained in the patch message from February 25th (below) still applies to Fennin Ro and also applies to Solusek Ro and Xegony.  <P>The opening of the registration logs will be announced via an in-game broadcast tonight.<P>Clarification on a few items:<P>1.  If you are selected for the move, all of your characters on your account currently on the affected server will be moved.  You do not need to log in each character and execute the command like many people did for the first character migration.<P>2.  Please keep in mind that there will be no special consideration given in the move process in reference to groups, friends, or guilds.  There is a good change that you will be separated from your friends, and it is recommended that you DO NOT REGISTER for the move unless this is not a problem for you.  This is also true for people who have characters on multiple accounts.3.  Since people are being moved from multiple servers, if you are moved there is a possibility that your character's name may be changed in order to resolve any duplicates.  If a letter "X" is appended to your character's name on Druzzil, you may contact a GM in-game to change your name to one of your preference.<P>4.  REMEMBER! As stated below, CORPSES WILL NOT BE TRANSFERRED. If you are moved and your character leaves a corpse behind, the items on the corpse will be lost and will not be subject to reimbursable.<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

Here's the thread:<BLOCKQUOTE>With the new plat sinks the economy is getting stretched out the other way now. Not enough money in a crowded world but plenty unclaimed on smaller unutilized servers.<P>Another point on community, it's going to be where you find it IMHO, not just who you are stuck with. Granted we would be looking at communities more like Los Angeles over South Park but who's to say what is better? <P><b><I>You have a point I suppose. It's something we can definitely keep in mind for future products. It is of course a bit late in EQ's life to consider something such as this. <P>I guess we'll have to wait to see if someone tries this before saying definitively that it won't work :)<P>-Gordon</b></i></BLOCKQUOTE>

Verant's Internet Relations Manger, the one and only Gordon Wrinn, made several posts today on the Gameplay board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>Journeyman Boots</b><br>What's happening is that he's getting stuck on a rock, and due to that he's not finishing his script that allows him to depop. So yes, killing him is one way to get him off the rock. A GM or Guide should be able to lure him off the rock as well assuming that he's stuck. Usually, after being stuck there long enough he'll find his way off the rock. <P>Of course the long term plan is for us to make it so that he doesn't get stuck on the rock. I'll see what we can do along these lines.<P>Server Transfers, Server CapsWe are absolutly opposed to capping server population, as we feel that it does more harm than good. New people join the game and want to play with their friends, and they can't do that if we've capped the server. <P>Secondly, as people leave a new server, people have to be allowed to move in and take their place. A healthy server economy needs newbies, mid-levels, and 50s. Yes, I'm basically saying that the economy isn't healthy on a brand new server until we see the proverbial bell curve. Luckily the "Racers" move in and help a new server obtain that balance within a couple of months.<P><b>Age and Maturity (Brought up by someone wanting a server for more "mature" players)</b><br>Age isn't exactly a reliable factor to determine maturity in an environment with a high perception of anonymity. I've met 12 year-olds more mature than some 40 year-olds.<P><b>The "Next" Patch Day</b><br>Probably not next week, but the week after. Don't quote me on that yet.<P><b>Lullaby Bugged?</b><br>[After reviewing some evidence posted on the thread] I spoke to Geoff about the original author's tests. It looks like there might be *something* strange going on, but we'll have to run some more tests in House. Geoff will take another look at it after he gets done with the first draft of the expansion spells in the next few days.<P><b>The Phantom Armor Series</b><br>Poor GZ was unavailable for a good deal of time last week. He was in the Hospital from a spider bite. In fact, if anyone going to the gathering in St. Louis this weekend would be so kind as to tease him with a rubber spider, I'd be eternally grateful :)<P>Anyway, we do have the ability to make the spell make you look like you are wearing plate, but that would just lead to every magician above the required level looking like shadowknights or paladins. <P>GZ did say that he'd be willing to look into applying another effect to the phantom series to make it more worthwhile.<P><b>Kunark Box Issues</b><br>There are actually two versions of the box. The first run had a typo and said "five", the second run is correct, and says "three". The number of zones in the 3 continent world is actually higher than what was planned for the 5 continent world. This was all decided about May or June of '98. <P>So no, the expansion is not "bogus". It contains additional content that wasn't included with the original game.<P><b>Druid Expansion Spells</b><br>I should mention that it's entirely too early to be screaming "rebellion!". Spells for the expansion are a Work-in-Progress and hardly a complete list. <P>I won't be commenting specifically on them any time soon.<br>--<br>Of course you all can expect that the spells will be adjusted prior to the release of the expansion. That's the purpose of the beta. If anyone screams "NERF!" when an unofficial, unreleased, beta spell that no one has and only knows about through the use of one of those parser programs, I'm going to bang my head against my monitor.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post on the Gameplay forum regarding the upcoming server transfers.  Here's the thread:<UL>One question that comes to mind about bringing in players from Solusek Ro and Xegony to Druzzil Ro is that of duplicate character names. There will very likely be a few duplicate names found from server to server, and this may create problems when migrating accounts from servers other than Fennin Ro. <P><B><I>Yes, we are aware of the issue of possible duplicates, and that will be addressed in the patch message that will go up soon. Basically, it's announced that people who choose to move might need a name change on their character to resolve a duplicate issue, and if this occurs, an "X" will be appended to their name. In the event they have an "X" appended to their name, they may contact a GM in-game and get the name changed to something they pick. </b></i><P>Also, the original Fennin split was capped at 1200 accounts. Will tonights registration use different, lower caps? (ie, 300 accounts from each?). <P><b><i>The number of people we are moving is much smaller than it was yesterday. Ideally, yesterday 100% of the people we moved would have been represented in peak usage. As a side effect though, people who played off-peak logged on and executed the command. In addition, there are also people with multiple accounts that executed the command for each account. As a result, the amount of "peak usage" that was moved was less than we would have liked. Comparing the number moved to the amount of peak usage moved allowed us to estimate the outcome future moves and help us move the right number. </b></i><P>Keep adding new non-split servers (300 copies of the game sold each day -> new servers every other week just to keep up). <b><i><P>It doesn't quite work like that. First, of the new users we attract, roughly 30% play at peak. There's also the fact that people also leave the game.</b></i><P> FINISH the Fennin split first.<P>Once that split is DONE, then see if there's more room for overflow off other servers. <P><b><i>The problem with this is that each split means that the server must be down for an extended period. This goes for the source as well as the destination server. We want to limit the number of people negatively affected by the split, hence we are doing a few at once. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Thanks Andrew!

The following report was sent in to us by Crier Sharpsong:<BLOCKQUOTE>In an extraordinary display of coordination, effort and dedication, twoof the major guilds that made the transfer from Fennin Ro to the brandnew Druzzil Ro made their presence known to the denizens of the newserver last night by slaying both Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox. The formerFennin Ro guild Seekers of Norrath dispatched Lord Nagafen approximately45 minutes after the guild Mythic Legion took down Lady Vox. This taskwas made more difficult by the lack of /guildsay and the loss of a fewmembers of both guilds due to non-transfer. A GM for the new Druzzil Rowas present as a spectator at both events, and was supportive of ourcollective efforts.<P>With only 600 people on the server at peak time, the new Druzzil Roserver was everything that we had hoped that it would be. Thepopulation of Lower Guk was 25 and Sol B 19. The number of level 1-4players was quite high, which is to be expected when any new server isset up, but unlike any other new server there were many characters withlevels all the way to 50. Although many of our dear friends were leftbehind during the move (and sadly a few guildmates as well), theunanimous results from the informal poll that I took last night was thateveryone was ecstatic with their new playing conditions.<P>Thanks to Verant for setting up a new server and allowing a transfer,and thanks to all of the players that make EverQuest such a great gameto play. We will deeply miss our old friends from Fennin Ro that wehave spent 11 months playing alongside, but the move increase theelbow-room for everyone on both servers.<P>Crier Sharpsong<br>Seekers of Norrath<br>47th Song Bard on Druzzil Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for letting us know!<P>And remember, our new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5181">Druzzil Ro Message Board</a> is a great place to meet, plan and discuss topics and issues of the Druzzil Ro server!
