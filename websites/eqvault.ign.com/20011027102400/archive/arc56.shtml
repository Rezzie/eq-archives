<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's the Saturday edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href=""><b>Issues Addressed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: With this upping the ante on machine requirements, how do you get away with something like this by changing the minimum specifications listed on the box when one purchased this game?]</i></font> <br><br>It's not a change from the minimum system requirements. The original box required a D3D compliant video card. The definition of D3D compliant is what is changing per new drivers released by Microsoft. <br><br>These changes are necessary to remain competitive and provide EQ gamers what they expect: a game that is constantly being updated. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Verant refund people who bought the game based on what the box said only to find their game inoperable a year later? ]</i></font><br><br>I doubt that there will be many, if any people who are incapable of running EverQuest once the changes are made. Regarding what will be done in those cases should they exist, our legal department is still working out what our policy will be. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: These kinds of changes are done in releases of new products, I've never heard of a title in the past with this situation ]</i></font><br><br>EverQuest is in a unique situation as a constantly updated product that bridges technology generations. I think that its reasonable that gamers would expect that the product would keep pace with current technology. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) In game chat channels, kind of like shouts, but with a channel like a CB channel ]</i></font><br><br>We've addressed your suggestion here before, when it was made by others. The technology requirements to support an infinite number of separate chat channels would be quite extensive. It's not likely a change that will be implemented. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Why has Povar never been split? Is there a technical reason behind this? It is one of the older servers, it is always very crowded and not once has it had a split. There are not many of the older servers that can claim this now, and I'm very curious why the Povar server appears to have been continually overlooked. ]</i></font><br><br>There are other servers as old (and older I believe) than Povar. Simply, it's not been one of the most populated servers at the time we were sampling server populations when making the decision as to which servers will be split. I understand that everyone wants to see their server get split, and every time we do one we see posts from people on the servers that weren't chosen wanting to know why we didn't choose to split theirs. It's simply a matter of numbers. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Why can't players heal people who are linkdead yet people who are linkdead can still be harmed by npcs? You are concerned about people pulling the plug, but why not consider the zone they're in? ]</i></font><br><br>It's part technology and part philosophy. The technology side is that players who are linkdead are essentially NPCs, with a lot of case-specific coding to handle things such as offensive spells and other things. Beneficial spells do not directly translate through that process. The philosophy side of it is that we never want going linkdead to be a preferable situation. NPCs already react differently to linkdead PCs than they do played ones, reducing the danger somewhat. Reducing the danger further would upset that balance and create an undesirable situation.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021745.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Will the mobs in the game be adjusted now that haste has been 'fixed' and players now deal out less damage that what the mobs were designed to take? ]</i></font><br><br>No, they continue to be appropriate. I guess you are probably wondering how that can be the case :)  You see, mid level encounters were not typically tested with a haste item and a haste spell, but one or the other, since mid-level groups are more free-form in their makeup than the high level ones. <br><br>The high level groups were typically tested with max-haste, in the form of an item plus a spell. Now we didn't know at the time that any item plus any spell yielded max, but testing with max was still our intent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) While we're on haste, can you please try to look into, and explain why the Swirle Spine Belt, which is considerable harder to get than the FBSS, has less haste than the FBSS?(and you wounder why kedge is always so empty...) ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not sure that it is less haste. The players determined all of the haste numbers by analyzing data in the log. That process has more than a few problem, as I've yet to see a list of haste items and percentages posted by a player that was correct. Not even the lineup of the items has been correct. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:3) Was the "toning down" of high speed 2 hander weapons intended to also hurt the Swiftblade, or mainly the moss covered branch? maybe drop the delay at which the damage bonus was weakened to under the swiftblade dly if this wasn't the intent? (no, I don't have a ranger, but do have some ranger friends ]</i></font><br><br>It was intended to catch any weapon below a specific speed (28), so if the Swiftblade is in that range, then yes. Keep in mind however that the adjustment was rather small, yielding only a couple points of damage per hit. We probably could have gotten away without annoucning it, but it was on the list of types of changes that I've told everyone that I would announce. I do fear that the announcement of it however has made it a bigger issue than it needed to be. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Are mobs that attack people who AREN'T kos to Venril Sathir, yet are obvously his minions considered bugged.. or ever planned to be 'fixed'.. ? ]</i></font><br><br>They aren't 'broken'. The dungeons are designed so that they won't be completely safe, even for people who are in his good graces. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Will the reasoning behind the Venril Sathir story line ever be totally explained? ]</i></font><br><br>There is a pretty good amount of the story revealed in game for those willing to search for it. As for the unrevealed portions, I'd say that this is a good possibility. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Is\Will\Do you feel there should be alternate ways for non Kunark owners to obtain their particle weapon?]</i></font> <br><br>The Epic quest weapons are designed to be Level 60 weapons. They would often not be appropriate in the hands of someone who cannot exceed 50. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8) Any plans on putting the god Karana in the game soon...? revenge will be mine.. *grins* ]</i></font><br><br>Aradune is his Avatar. Feel free to challenge him to a duel should you see him online :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9) I believe there's an issue with factions.. when you hit the bottom of the main faction on a mob, you no longer get the other hits that are linked with it, example, kill dead frogs in lower guk for.. a long time, and you no longer get +livefrogs is this known and being looked into? or "working as intended" ]</i></font><br><br>I've heard this several times, I'll take this issue up next week. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: there have also been quite a few good changes made recently, things are going in the right direction for the most part I feel, keep up the good work ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for noticing, and we will :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021369.html"><b>Fan Faire Location</b></a><br>We plan to make the decision on the location within the next couple of weeks. Once we do we'll be sure to publicize it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021864.html"><b>"Verant Fixed Something"</b></a><br>/blush <br><br>I'm just happy that Hobart was able to find a problem. People have been saying that the spell was uncommonly rare for a while.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021898.html"><b>Name Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Clearly Dahlillama is a violation of this policy and the GM was no more rude or curt then was necessary to deal with me. In the end i'm just to unhappy to continue spending my free time playing this game. I played UO for 2 years so i know all about sinking free time into online games. Anyway this was my first character on my first server and i was always nice to everyone i met, including the GM who took away my name. ]</i></font><br><br>I am indeed sorry to lose you as a customer, but I do appreciate the fact that you understand our position. Bringing real-world figures or issues into the game often hampers immersiveness and does have the capacity to offend other players. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In the end i'm sure i was just looking for an excuse to stop playing this game and get back to taking care of my 200g saltwater reef tank (sorry fish! i'm coming home!) Just understand that i had no intention to quit until i was forced to change my name. ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, nice tank! My wife is a complete fish nut, and would be quite jealous. She spends most of her time online checking out tank-related sites. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021929.html"><b>Shaman Epic Quest Weapon</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 12 damage? 12 damage?]</i></font> <br><br>How many shaman melee for damage in the 50+ level range? Does the damage on it *really* matter? Sure, I'm sure that some jump in and take a few pokes, but they are certainly not doing an appreciable amount of damage through melee. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Only 30 mana/hp? clerics get 100 mana]</i></font> <br><br>I'll conceed that the stats are possibly a little out of whack, I'll check into it. It looks like this weapon may have gotten created and gone through the approval process prior to the time that we upped the power template for the items of this caliber. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The *proc* is a joke and doesnt help worth crap ]</i></font><br><br>The "proc" is not a joke, because it isn't a proc, but rather an activatable effect. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021872.html"><b>UI Suggestion</b></a><br>This probably isn't something that we would consider putting in. Coordinating to take down NPCs in a multiple NPC encounter requires certain talent and strategy, meaning that players have to learn how to work together to accomplish their goals. I doubt that this is something that we'd want to reduce the importance of. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021923.html"><b>Cheating</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If people want to cheat that is thier business.]</i></font> <br><br>No, it's the business of everyone playing the game. One of the reasons some people play MMOGs is for the competitive aspect. That aspect means nothing if people are able to gain a competitive advantage through means not available to other players. <br><br>Single player games contain cheats because it is truly only the players business in that case. Massively multiplayer games have to get everyone playing by the same set of rules for them to be successful. <br><br>If cheating were truly only the business of the person cheating, people wouldn't get worried about things such as dupe bugs, ebayers, showeq users, or perceived favoritism from the GM staff. It's obviously something that everyone is concerned about.</UL>

It was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2637913,00.html">reported last night that GameSpot</a> will be interviewing Verant Interactive regarding the "Mystere" banning incident.  Look for this upcoming interview Monday on their site.  Here's a clip from the report:<UL>n an official statement, a legal counsel to Sony Online stated that the issue is "about infringement of our intellectual property rights in a patently offensive manner that tarnishes the Sony, Verant, and EverQuest brands." The fan fiction is said to violate copyrights for the game, and Verant acted on this to initiate its banning procedure, which is used in cases of in-game cheating and misconduct. This is the first case where a fan-written story has drawn such a response from Verant, which reacted to the mature content of the story, describing the rape and subsequent escape of a young dark elf. Verant's actions have drawn an outcry from the EverQuest community, who charge that this is an excessive form of censorship, although Verant says this is not a First Amendment issue. <br><br>We have discussed the controversy with Verant and Sony Online, and Monday we will post an interview with the EverQuest team on the subject. </UL>

Here's the latest from Gordon Wrinn as posted on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021448.html"><b>Patch Next Week?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just wondering if you guys have a target date for next weeks patch. I want to have a extra day for EQ so I thought I would ask]</i></font> <br><br>There's a good chance that we won't be patching next week, but don't hold me to it yet :)  The client won't be patched for some time due to the DirectX changes, leaving only data on the server for the most part. If we do patch, it will probably be pretty quick.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021479.html"><b>Do you med faster at level 35?</b></a><br>Hehe, this is the first time I've seen the placebo effect work out in a positive way. Usually people are claiming that we make things slower causing others to observe the same thing. It's nice to see it go the other way once in a while :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021443.html"><b>More on "Waiting"</b></a><br>I guess it comes down to the question, why do people play EverQuest? Surely its not to kill things nonstop, as one can only keep that up for so long in EQ. There must be other facets, as a matter of individual opinion, that people enjoy. <br><br>The things that are viewed by some as restrictions are often the things that make the other aspects of the game possible. Were people able to kill nonstop with maximum efficiency, I would imagine that EQ would not have the following that it does today. <br><br>Socialization, making friends, and working together towards a common goal are very important to EverQuest. It however only occurs because we "force" it to occur via game design. I make that statement based upon the fact that there are other multiplayer (not necessarily massively multiplayer ones) that do support non-stop killing, and they don't have the following that EQ does.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017852.html"><b>Brownies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How can a sweet little brownie kill anyone?]</i></font> <br><br>You know what they say, big things come in small packages :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021375.html"><b>Died Due to Lag Last Night</b></a><br>The GMs were working late into the night to help with the cleanup following the router problem.

EverQuest appears to be headed to the Playstation 2.  <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/news/game_news_5221.html">Daily Radar is reporting</a> that Brad McQuaid, in a recent interview to PC Gamer, has publicly admitted this.  Here's a clip:<UL>"We're working on a massively multiplayer PlayStation 2 game [EverQuest]," admitted McQuaid, "and there are definitely a lot of questions: how do you patch, how do you communicate with others without a keyboard? I think it will end up being a very different game. Our first idea was to just port EverQuest to a console. It's like, no, we can take the same world and the same name, but it's not going to be the same game."</UL>The Playstation 2 made waves late last month when it was announced that initial shipment of PSX2s would be cut in half to 500,000.

Here's the latest quotes and excerpts that Gordon Wrinn has posted to the EQ Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021177.html"><b>Corrupted Threads</b></a><br>It starts getting really dangerous when it gets over 250, so Chris (Akriss) has been closing them down between when he sees them get over 200. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021180.html"><b>Highpass Crashing Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I do that, I managed to enter In High Hold Pass and I was at my bind point.( I checked my equipement(to know if I died)but I didnt, so the question is: Why I was at my bind point ]</i></font><br><br>In order to keep a zone problem from permanently locking players out (until the problem is fixed), the game will attempt to move you to your bind point after a given amount of time trying to enter a downed zone. <br><br>In the event that the zone your bindpoint is in is also down, it tries to move you to Qeynos (outside the gates).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021181.html"><b>Magicians and Fun</b></a><br>I'd like to see more "fun" spells for every class, but as I've mentioned before, we have to establish priorities for that sort of thing. At this point we're concentrating on content development that benefit a large number of people rather than neutral content like that mentioned here. <br><br>There's also the reaction that we frequently see when working on things that aren't considered "important" by some people here on th board. I'm sure that you've seen here on the boards complaints regarding things put in game where the author felt that we should be working on something more important.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021224.html"><b>Another GM Incident</b></a><br>These things take a judgement call. In the judgement of one GM further action was called for, whereas in the judgement of the other it wasn't. These issues are very rarely so black and white. Perhaps in one case it was a clear case of ninja-looting, and in the other it was one's word against the other. All sides of an issue are rarely brought to the public light as the one who is happy with the decision doesn't feel the need to come voice his opinion. <br><br>Getting a GM involved in your situation can result in one of two things: Either it goes your way or it doesn't. If it's the former, be happy that it wasn't the latter. In either case, we've got to move on. These issues are *always* going to be present.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021232.html"><b>Waiting...</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for my health bar to creep back. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider grouping with someone who can heal you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for my mana bar to refill. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider grouping with someone who can make that go faster. Also consider getting in a group that doesn't require you to expend that much mana. Often, a good group has virtually zero downtime. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for the boats. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider getting a group with teleportation capabilities. Failing that, try socializing with the other people waiting for the boat. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for that spawn to pop. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider moving around to find a spawn that's already popped. If they are all dead, consider going someplace that doesn't have as many people in it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING to zone. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, what can I say, we have to load data. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for a bind because there's no caster in the zone. ]</i></font><br><br>Try forming a network of friends. If you are a sufficiently fun person to be around, you might find that people will go out of their way to help you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't play games to WAIT. ]</i></font><br><br>Then consider playing the game in a fashion that reduces the amount of time that you have to wait. The things you are citing are largely due to decisions that you are making in your gameplay. There are facets of the game which you may not be exploring which could help reduce your perceived wait time. Consider taking up a tradeskill that you can practice while medding, or talking with people. Those are both aspects of the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021487.html"><b>Invisbility and the Undead</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I thought I once read a post by you stating that no class had both forms of invisibility becuase that would be too powerfull and would make travel anywhere too easy. ]</i></font><br><br>The rogue is the only class that has the ability to be invisible to both the undead and living at the same time. The other classes that have both spells cannot have them both up at the same time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020569.html"><b>EQLog.txt Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rowyl, PLEASE split eqlog.txt by character!]</i></font> <br><br>We have suggestions along these lines on the list, along with things such as separate friends lists. We also have a command (/note) that will go in the next client patch to allow people to take notes while they play. <br><br>I really look forward to the continuing enhancements to the UI, as I think most of the players do as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021044.html"><b>Ctrl + # Casting Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyways... any chance that the slide key and the casting+# key can be changed so they are not the same?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually the next client will include key-binding options well beyond what you have available now. In fact, I believe only 3 functions will not be bindable after the change is implemented. So yes, you will be able to set it to another key :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021238.html"><b>Topics on "Mystere's Banning"</b></a><br>We don't need 20 posts on the front page for you to voice your concerns. There is one that's a continuation of Brad's original post, and that is sufficient. <br><br>You might also consider sending your thoughts via email, as it's not something that we're going to comment further on at this time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021167.html"><b>Pointy Hats for Wizards!</b></a><br>We've had to backburner the "pointy hat" idea for a while. It turns out that they didn't go in because we weren't pleased with the way that the model worked. They either looked like dunce caps or the ceremonial headgear of one of the more morally repugnant organizations in the country. <br><br>Suffice it to say that they didn't look very good.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021486.html"><b>GM Incident</b></a><br>I'm not seeing anything wrong with what happened. While I agree that the person who summoned the GM should have stuck to the rules that were agreed upon by the group before hand, once a GM is involved they have to make a decision with the information at hand. <br><br>This decision was not to give the loot to one person or another, but to require the roll in this case. I really don't see much of a problem with him doing that. <br><br>In regards to "threads of banishment or suspension", "threats" is not a good word to describe the situation. The GM was attempting to let the person know what could happen should he continue to refuse to comply with the directions of the GM. </UL>

From Lowtax:<BLOCKQUOTE>After reading the news post regarding the person getting banned for "offensive" Everquest fan fiction, I realized something terrible - I have an Everquest account and haven't logged onto the game in months!  Verant has been sapping $10 a month from my bank account for no reason whatsoever!<br> <br>As a result, I tried to cancel my account online.  No luck, as I can't remember my station name or password.  Since my back was against the wall and I had no other intelligent alternatives, I did the only thing I could - create some offensive Everquest fan fiction (<a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/features/eqfanfiction/">http://www.somethingawful.com/features/eqfanfiction/</a>).  With your help and news post, we can spread the word so Verant has no choice but to shut down my EQ account and cease charging me $10 a month.  Hopefully this work of "fan fiction" is offensive enough to cause Verant / Sony to immediately nuke my account forever.<br> <br>I would appreciate any news post, as it would really mean alot to me.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Many of you are aware of the recent banning Mystere for the publication of an EverQuest Fan Fiction containing very <b>descriptive and violent scenes of a child being raped and tortured</b>.  Verant has publicly commented about this banning, something rarely done by them.  It's an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021102.html">important board post</a> that I believe sets the record straight:<UL><i>I'm posting this on behalf of our General Counsel:<br><br>------<br><br>I want to thank everyone for their fervent opinions on this matter.<br><br>We aspire neither to be censors nor the guardians of the Internet; we desire to be the developers of a great game which fosters a vibrant and dynamic community. Fortunately, the body of intellectual property law that has developed over the past 225 years -- the laws governing the use of copyrighted material, derivative works, trademarks and trade dress -- gives us the exclusive right to permit or disallow the outside use of our intellectual property so that we can properly manage our business and nurture the EverQuest brand. <br><br>Among other things, the story author used our intellectual property -- without license -- to create what the law calls a "derivative work." The law gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to create and distribute derivative works, so that the copyright owner can control the manner in which its property is being used. If this story were about Luke Skywalker or Mickey Mouse, you'd certainly expect Lucas or Disney (respectively) to resort to their legal rights to protect their valuable property and good name; this is nothing different.<br><br>This is not about the first amendment -- this is about infringement of our intellectual property rights in a patently offensive manner that tarnishes the Sony, Verant and EverQuest brands. It almost goes without saying that we cannot tolerate our intellectual property being used in a story depicting the violent and explicit rape of a child.<br><br>Andrew S. Zaffron<br>General Counsel, Sony Online Entertainment</i></UL>I'd also like to add my two cents in this matter.  The EQVault Brell Serilis Board was the place where this post originated and I personally apologize for not catching, talking with the author and deleting the story three months ago.  Perhaps if I had this controversy wouldn't have started.<br><br>I have great respect for the Freedom of Speech rights those who live in the USA, and other similar countries, enjoy.  However (and I know many of you will respectfully disagree with me here) the violent descriptions of the rape of a child goes too far in a story posted to a public board meant for all ages.  Although I'm not a lawyer, I believe it may even violate some children's pornography laws.<br><br>If you'll humor me, I'd like to try and picture the mind frame that both parties are in.  Imagining myself in Verant's shoes, I would not want such material with the vivid depictions of the rape and torture of a child associated with a flagship product.  Attempting to put myself in Mystere's shoes, I feel the punishment may be too harsh for a first time offense.  Instant banishment for a rule he/she did not know was in effect was harsh.  Similar material, both violent and gruesome and creative and tasteful, is regularly written and posted about franchises, such as Star Wars, to sites like FanFiction.net.<br><br>I must conclude that diplomacy <i>might</i> have been a better way to avoid this and future incidents.  By talking with the author first, and grabbing an EQV moderator's attention, this incident could have been avoided altogether.

Gordon announced today some news regarding the EQ client and DirectX.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020740.html">the complete announcement</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>As many of you know, over the past couple of months we&#8217;ve made numerous enhancements to the EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and other changes of that nature, we&#8217;ve enhanced the UI itself to allow moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time we&#8217;ve been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the EverQuest client.<br><br>For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 5.2.<br><br>This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest. <br><br>Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:<br><br>- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)<br>- Gamma Correction working in D3D <br>- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D <br>- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and look pretty bad) <br>- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to look better.<br><br>Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of DirectX outweigh the potential problems.<br><br>We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</a> if it is needed.<br><br>Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information regarding the planned implementation of DX7.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's a follow-up note from Brad:<UL><i>We won't make it such that the game won't run on Windows 2000 -- if this menas using 7.0 instead of 7.0a, then so be it :)<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Here's a few late evening posts from Gordon from off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020699.html"><b>Display Bug</b></a><br>I've heard about the bug before and we're aware of it, but it's not the type of thing that gets really high priority in the grand scheme of things. Here we have a situation where everything is working, but something just doesn't look quite right. Issues where things aren't working quite right have to take precedence. <br><br>It's roughly equivalent to the hole in a gnomes head when wearing a chainmail coif. We hope to fix it at some point but there are many factors that keep it from being something that we can rush in and do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020698.html"><b>Surnames</b></a><br>It sounds as if you may have gotten a newer GM. I'd ask if he'd be willing to escalate the issue. The name mentioned doesn't violate the naming policy in my opinion. <br><br>Here's the portion of the naming policy that applies: <br><br>"Note: Non-words like--D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases (e.g. D`Kval is acceptable where D`Basher is not)." <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018762.html"><b>Sash of the Dragonborn</b></a><br>Horrible haste item? I don't think that it's horrible by any means. It's better than the FBSS. <br><br>In all fairness though, we ninja-enhanced it in the patch last week :)</UL>

The following are Gordon Wrinn's words as posted by him to the EQ Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020578.html"><b>GMs Taking Quest Items</b></a><br>There's always more than one side to stories like this. I would imagine that the people on the other side would have an equally compelling story to tell. <br><br>The issue at hand is the actions that the GMs took. About nine months ago the main complaint we were seeing is that the GMs were telling people "We can't help you" when issues like KSing would come up. People didn't like hearing that they had to be at the mercy of unsavory individuals with a lot of friends in game, so we decided that the GM staff would start getting involved. <br><br>Now, when someone petitions a GM for a player-interaction issue, the GM *will* make a decision based upon the information at hand. Sometimes people will agree with that decision, sometimes they won't, but it will be a judgement call in the hands of the person making it. <br><br>GMs are called in when people can't reach an agreement on their own. It is not at all unusual for a GM to come in and mandate a course-of-action that is pleasing to neither party, so I *highly* recommend that everyone make a good effort to work these things out on their own.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020617.html"><b>Monks and Casters Nerfed?</b></a><br>I don't think that the fact that tailoring isn't included qualifies as a nerf according to the generally accepted definition. <br><br>That said, similar things may be included in tailoring at a future date.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020621.html"><b>Commands Unusable</b></a><br>We already have the changes for the "cant use while casting" messages in relation to songs. It should go live the next time we patch the client.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020535.html"><b>Archery Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If I cast a spell, I can immediately hit autoattack and there is no delay in my first swing going off. Subsequent swings use the delay, but never the first swing.]</i></font> <br><br>What if you already have autoattack engaged? If by hitting autoattack anew it fires right away, we'll probably have to look at that since it is likely a bug as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: However, with a patch about a month ago, you BORKED archery delays after using a spell. You had to wait until the spell gem activated again before you could successfully shoot an arrow. One of the problems is you were still allowed to shoot, but it went to a void.]</i></font> <br><br>It didn't really shoot. The server just said that it was too soon for you to be using archery, while the client grayed out the spell for the duration. A little bit counter-intuitive to say the least, which is why we're going to have the ranged button gray out in the future. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If there is the slightest bit of elevation, either downslope, or upslope, the arrow will rarely, if ever, give you a message. Does it stick in the ground.. miss, hit? We don't know because you broke something.]</i></font> <br><br>As I said in my last message, this is something that we are still looking in to. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But making up excuses to why you can't fix a problem is a poor stance on your part and it further alienates you from your subscriber base. It's no wonder we all cringe when there is a patch. ]</i></font><br><br>That's how it was explained to me by the programmer and the designers, so it's not likely to change. That said, we alientate ourselves from our customer base every time we tell them something that they don't want to hear. It's plain by looking at your posts. Two months ago we were the bane of existnace in your eyes. One month ago we were the best thing around. Now we're swinging back the other way. <br><br>As much as I'd like to only have to tell people the things they want to hear, I don't get to do that, and I think that you'd all tire of it if I did.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020444.html"><b>Suspended</b></a><br>I assume your suspension just happened today since you are able to post in this forum. You probably won't be able to post here after the data is propagated tomorrow morning. <br><br>To answer your question, when you are able to log into the game, your suspension is over. Suspensions usually last 7 to 10 days based upon severity. If you were not told by a GM in game that you were being suspended, you should receive an email in the next day or two giving you specific information.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020452.html"><b>GMs and No Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what's the deal? Am I just not in the grove with gm's is that why I never get any service. At level 12 I had a midnight mallet or something like that hehe I laugh at it now but I was trading it one day showing someone it and it vanished a GM verified it and said we'll get back to you and get you your item, never heard from him again. ]</i></font><br><br>Though you may have gotten help transferring a nodrop item at level 12, we put a stop to this a few months ago. NODROP items are NODROP because we do not want them changing hands. The GMs will not assist in the transfer of some items. I'm sorry that you disagree, but this is the policy that we follow. <br><br>That said, we are considering putting in a confirmation box when someone tries to loot something that they cannot use in order to cut down the number of accidental loots.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020443.html"><b>Rogue Tourney Loot</b></a><br>There was no loot given to the winner of the rogue tourney.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020433.html"><b>God Upgrades</b></a><br>It's still on the plate, but we're busy with some other content additions at the moment. For example, we felt the epic quests were a bit more important than going back and buffing up the Gods. There's some other things out there that we've got people working on first before we'll revisit the deities. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020438.html"><b>What's your favorite city in Norrath?</b></a><br>Rivervale or Qeynos. They both feel very "alive" due to the NPCs walking around and talking with each other. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019903.html"><b>Policy</b></a><br>I'm not sure why a GM would have gotten involved in this situation as it's a clear-cut case of someone dropping something. When we put in the item-drop confirmation box we made a policy determination that GMs would no longer get involved when people drop items, that anyone who is concerned that they might drop an item should leave the feature on. <br><br>In this case, based upon what you say the original owner of the dropped items shouted, they evidented dropped it so that they could log out and log on another character to get the items. As far as I'm concerned it was indeed fair game. <br><br>If you'd be so kind as to kick me the name of the GM in an email at gwrinn@verant.com, I'll be happy to look into the situation. <br><br>Regarding the "under 13" thing, that has to do with a law that prevents us from storing information about people under the age of 13. There is no restriction however on who may play EverQuest given parental permission, just who we may have listed as the owner of the account. The EULA grants you, and one minor child living with you, a license to play on the same account. The age of your child and whether or not EQ represents appropriate content for that child is up to you. <br><br>Please accept my apologies for this situation. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020436.html"><b>Dazed and Confused on Mithanial Marr</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Was it expected? Nope, Should it have been expected? No way. But the fact is, it happened. And to top it off, I get added to a "LIST" of stranded Norrathians wishing to test the waters and make new friends from a different server. A "LIST? Pardon my explecitive, but WTF is that all about?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, a list. We can take care of these issues one by one and have it take a month to do, or we can take care of them all at once and get 99% of it done in a few days. <br><br>The GMs on MithMarr and Tunare are making lists of people who requested a move but didn't get one. We hope to run the modified list through the process on Friday.</UL>

Here's the latest:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020431.html"><b>Incorrect Statement Regarding Archery</b></a><br>A couple of weeks ago rangers began having problems using their bow directly after casting a spell. At that time I posted the following: <br><br><i>The problem regarding being unable to shoot an arrow after casting a spell is unintentional. The dev team is working on the issue and it should be fixed soon. </i><br><br>...which I've just found out is incorrect. The fact that players were allowed to use their bow directly after casting a spell was a bug that was fixed in that patch. The programmers tell me that it was intended for bows to become unusable for their full delay following the casting of a spell. In case anyone is wondering, the post-casting delay has always applied to the primary and secondary melee weapons. In other words, if someone using a 50-delay weapon casted, they wouldn't again try to hit with their melee weapon until 5 seconds after the casting of the spell. It turned out that this delay wasn't being correctly applied to the ranged slot as well. <br><br>Now there is a problem regarding the way that the delay is handled. For instance, if you are wielding a 40-delay bow, and you were to try to use it 3 seconds after casting a spell, you'd have to wait an additional 4 seconds before you could use it again. This we will correct in a future patch by making the ranged button gray out during the initial delay. <br><br>There is an additional problem regarding excessive misses in archery that went hand in hand with the skill being moved to the server side back when the change above went in. This is on the list to be fixed as well. <br><br>I apologize for my incorrect statement earlier.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020429.html"><b>Playing EQ in a Cyber Cafe</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If so, would the license terms of EQ allow such establishments to legally let people play?]</i></font> <br><br>Our license agreement doesn't allow this, so I doubt that you'll be able to find a cafe that has this as an option.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020421.html"><b>Banning Stations Name Thread Closed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: find that somehow the thread got closed. I'm sure that this was accidental.]</i></font> <br><br>It was probably closed due to size. I really don't think that there's a problem with continuing to discuss this. <br><br>The issue at hand is that though many EQers feel that their station name is just like their password: something that noone should ever see, it is used as login for other station games. For instance, EQ players could login with their game account and password and go play JEOPARDY! Online. That offensive station name would then be revealed to other players of the game, which is why the policy exists.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019659.html"><b>Premium Server Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: At first I answered no to the poll... as 50 bucks seems a bit steep... still does a little.]</i></font> <br><br>The price-point mentioned in the poll had to be one that would ensure a minority of posters in order for service to be considered "premium". For instance, were the projected price point $12.95 per month, I imagine that an overwelming majority would have said yes, at which time the service being provided would be "average" for the scope of the game, regardless what that service entailed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: With the amount of CS reps you would be able to afford would this possibly allow GM's or CS reps to have characters of multiple levels that may be able to help in filling or starting groups for people that may be having a hard time getting into a group? ]</i></font><br><br>Though we still haven't fleshed out exactly what "premium" would mean, I think that its fairly safe to say that we wouldn't be providing CS members as group-mates. About the only way we'd be able to do something like that is if we went to an hourly rate.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020309.html"><b>Ignore</b></a><br><LI><a href=""><b></b></a>Sounds like you don't like being ignored. If I put someone on /ignore I can tell them they are on /ignore with a simple tell if I am that concerned with them knowing they are being ignored. However, I might just want to put them on /ignore and not let them know. The last thing I want is some idiot jumping up and down /rude'ing me to get my attention because I /ignored him and every time he sends me a tell he gets a message reminding him that I have him on /ignore. Think.]</i></font> <br><br>There's also the point that ignores are done on the client. Your client already has to process the incoming messages and determine that they are from someone you are ignoring. To then having it formulate responses to those who are sending you messages would be an added load. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020346.html"><b>Queue...Please Wait</b></a><br>The most I've ever seen that portion of the login pause is around 30 seconds. Would knowing a number really have any benefit given that?</UL>

The following is all the latest quotes and excerpts from the posts Gordon Wrinn posted to the Gameplay Board this evening:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020390.html"><b>Splurt and Asytole</b></a><br>Splurt is not an upgrade to Asystole.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020394.html"><b>Demographics of the Split</b></a><br>Around 1750 from MithMarr and 750 from Tunare. That's of confirmed unique registrations. It's apparent that the /movelog command dropped a few people, something that we plan to take care of over the next couple of days.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020384.html"><b>GM Favoritism</b></a><br>Favoritism? No. A GM being in the middle of a situation where he is going to have an unhappy customer regardless? Yes. <br><br>I don't see any problem with what happened here, though I personally would have chosen to upset the first person rather than you in this case. With the drop confirmation being in game now, people are fully responsible for what the drop, and if someone else picks it up that is how it goes. <br><br>Perhaps what happened here was that the person petitioned that the item "disappeared" (which is how they usually show up) and the GM said no, you dropped it and so-and-so picked it up. There's no policy preventing them from giving out that information, and if the GM chooses to, that is up to them. <br><br>Just because you ended up on the receiving end of a bad call doesn't mean that there was favoritism. GMs have the unenviable job of coming into he-said/she-said situations and trying to figure out how to best apply their policies. Someone will always feel that they somehow got a raw deal.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020008-6.html"><b>Banned Because of Offensive Name</b></a><br>I'm surprised that this discussion has gone on for so long, because the is pretty simple: <br><br>Playing EverQuest requires that you have a station account. Station accounts are closed if the name they are created with breaks the Station Terms of Service. <br><br>So yes, open an EverQuest account with a vulgar station name and it will be closed if you draw attention to yourself. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020370.html"><b>Splitting From a Server</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) You tell people that they can move only 1 week before the server move. Well, people past level 30 are some what conscientious of who they group with. Abashi has stated in the past that Verant is "pro grouping". With this in mind you should know that it greatly affects my move decision if my friends are going or staying. 1 week is not enough time for me to contact ALL of my group buddies and see if they are going or not.]</i></font> <br><br>No matter how much time we've given there are always some people who feel that it wasn't enough. I'm sorry, but we're not going to be able to please everyone. I think a week is a good round figure, and is enough for 90% of the people to get together and make the decision. For the 10% that can't, they should stay on the source server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Why must a movelog be done on a single day? Why can it not be spread out over a few days so that 1 billion people will not try and perform it the first second it becomes available and perhaps avoid what happened on Friday with Mith Marr (kept going down, 2.8k+ on the server). Also doing a ninja move like the one on Mith Marr sets people up for the mindset of "I must log in right at 8pm and perform the server log before everyone else does". Spreading the move over a weeks time may help minimize the mindset. ]</i></font><br><br>I warned people not to execute it at the exact second, and not to mention left the logs open for 6 hours on TWO nights due to the problems on the first night. The issue is that we want to move peak users, hence, we only take registrations during peak hours. Sure some off-peak people log on to request a move, and that can't be stopped, but overall it's pretty successful. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Guilds. Why can you not move an entire guild? ]</i></font><br><br>Because we can't. I understand that people don't like this but it's not likely to change. I've explained several times that these things are too resource (human) intensive to perform on a person-by-person basis. Nearly 9000 accounts play on every server, and the only way we could service all of those people individually would be to put every single one of our customer service poeple on it for a few weeks. Even if we did that, we'd still have people who are upset because they didn't get moved as they wanted to. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Some people own multiple accounts. One of the GMs of Mith Marr told me that he could not assure me my 2 accounts would be xfered, one could stay and one may go. Are you really this inflexible to your patrons? This is unacceptable. ]</i></font><br><br>Multiple accounts is the EXACT same thing as the guild issue mentioned above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5.) And on a larger scale even if you put in the movelog command you are not even sure if you will go to new server. WTF? ]</i></font><br><br>Obviously if *everyone* on the server were to execute the command, we couldn't move everyone, right? Well if 90% execute the command, it stil lwouldn't make sense to move all of them. Somewhere in the middle is a range that is acceptable for a move. *THAT* is why we cannot guarantee moves for everyone who asks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6.) You have made no effort to keep friends and guilds together. ]</i></font><br><br>You mentioned this above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7.) I can see no reason why you cannot release the numbers involved with the movelog. We should be able to find out the maximum number of people who will be moved, the number of people on each server who have already put in a movelog command ]</i></font><br><br>In advance? No, we can't announce it. Because if I were to say that we would move 1500, and 1501 ask to be moved, it wouldn't be very reasonable for us to refuse to move that last person. Not to mention, we frequently adjust the numbers based upon the projected peak-time users. <br><br>Anway, in this case we moved everyone who we had record of executing the command. If we didn't get you, please kick an email to Chris and we'll see about getting you moved. Please put some faith into the idea that we'll try to do what's best, ok?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020382.html"><b>Ogre Immunity to Stun</b></a><br>The immunity to stun is based on those caused directly by melee blows. Stun spells or special abilities that stun do not apply. The immunity works in every case that it should.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020383.html"><b>More UI Changes Coming</b></a><br> Yes, we have a number of additional changes planned for the UI. Stay tuned and we'll elaborate as we can.</UL>

Here's a couple of posts Gordon made late last night on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020060.html"><b>Most Hated Villian in Norrath</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: HOLLY WINDSTALKER<br>CROS TREEWIND]</i></font><br> <br>They have my vote :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020059.html"><b>The Change of Epic Quest Weapons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: On behalf of them, I am asking for a 'Guarantee' that these weapons have been playtested, and that the Epic Quest rewards will not be altered in any way that would lower its effectiveness in any way.]</i></font> <br><br>I can't give you the guarantee that nothing will change. In fact, the fact that the rogue weapon is equipable in the ranged slot was a mistake that will be correted in the next patch. <br><br>Though I don't expect any more changes, we need to leave that possibility open.</UL>
