<a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo</a> was updated on EverLore recently.  As always Milo tackles several issues dealing with just about everything in life.  Here's a blurb:<UL>Why the hell do you suck so much? Just wandering. You should also give some people your respect because you seem to like to treat people like crap. LATER.<br><br>GP69GP69 <br><br><b><I>I give my respect to people who earn it; furthermore, criticizing someone doesn't mean that I don't respect him/her. To too many people, showing respect means smiling and nodding one's head and perhaps even behaving sycophantically. I don't know what you call respect, but to me, it's just the acknowledgment of worth; I don't see that this comprises acting like a yes-man all the time. Heck, I respect only those people who are both intelligent and secure enough to hear me criticize them, anyway (should I feel the need to do that). I certainly *don't* respect whiners and crybabies, neither will I treat everyone the same, because I like some people more than others. Besides, my power to upset someone is only as strong as the veneration that this person bestows upon me. Why should anyone who doesn't know me well enough to value my opinions care what I have to say about him/her?<br><br>Perhaps, instead of "respect," you should have written "common courtesy," in which case I would have agreed with you that I can be fairly uncivil, sometimes. I'm working on that, but it's not easy, mainly because people tend to be so easily upset that the line between honesty and rudeness becomes fine to the point of being invisible. I have no intention of compromising my candor, so please, be patient with me.</b></i></UL>Thanks Catalyst!

From DDarkmane:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello,<br><br>My name is DDarkmane, the web master of a new Druid site called The Druid's Circle.  At this time The Druid's Circle is in it's infancy, but I hope that in the near future it will become a place where all who play druids in the game of EverQuest can visit when they need information about our class.<br><br>What prompted the creation of this web site was topic of Druid Quest Armor on the EQ Message Boards.  Some sites touched upon this topic but it seemed that sites dedicated to the class shied away.  I feel that controversial topics of this nature need a place where they can be highlighted and discussed among the players of the class, not lost among the clutter of every class as is evident in the EQ boards.  Those who play druids need a place where their thoughts and needs can be shared and discussed, not buried or dismissed out of hand due to a web masters interest or lack thereof.  I WILL listen, and I WILL let the voices of those who visit my site be heard.  All who enter The Druid's Circle shall stand on even ground and be judged by their peers...  And when the topic is of great interest, when the time comes for all druids to act as one, I want them to know that The Druid's Circle will be there as a rally point.  That is my promise as web master.<br><br>-DDarkmane<br><br><a href="http://www.sepknts.com/dc/">http://www.sepknts.com/dc/</a> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

An interesting observation about the dragons was sent in by Babaderu.  It's not confirmed, but it is interesting speculation:<BLOCKQUOTE>Models of the original Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox are being used on the test server. There is a dragon in the Dreadlands that looks like Lady Vox except named Snowdrift and drops the same loot as Vox has been found. Also in Skyfire there is a dragon that looks like Lord Nagafen and drops his same loot.

From JC:<BLOCKQUOTE>I have just placed up a new article by the name of <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/tech/mmrpg2/index.shtml">Livening Up the MMORPG</a>. It basically delves into the possibility of more action in upcoming MMORPG's and why it would be beneficial to the genre. <br>Here's a snippet:<UL><i>"One thing that I've always enjoyed about Team Deathmatch, CTF, or Team Fortress in First Person Shooters was the fact that you were matched up on a team as soon as you logged in. Of course in an MMORPG a player probably wouldn't want to log in to a set dungeon in a set group of people that he may or may not like or that may not be evenly matched. There are however alternatives that could make grouping easier in MMORPG's."</UL></i></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

This just in:<blockquote>On July 14, 2000 an alliance of some of Morell-Thule&#8217;s bravest warriors from the In Virtue, Hamunaptra, Pax Tharax, Sons of the Immortal, Coveit Emptor and Death and Destruction Guilds took on the Great Lord Nagafen. Over 30 warriors united to slay the dragon and his guardian Fire Giants. <p>The night began with the groups meeting in the confines of the Lavastorm Mountains, where upon we would set out in search of the Great Dragon&#8217;s lair. Upon reaching the first of his guard the alliance dispatched the initial Fire Giants with little effort. As we moved to the reaches of King Tranixx some confusion created minor causulties as the alliance dispatched the Fire Giant King Tranixx and his warlord.<p>As we past the king&#8217;s throne room more Fire Giants would fall at our advance. Soon it came time to fight the Magi Rokyll, and eventually the Great Lord Nagafen himself. The inital charge of Lord Nagafen would fail as we had under estimated the power of this grand beast. All members would regroup and once again organize for the final attempt at the Dragon Lord.<p>The brave fighting and noble efforts of the warriors left Lord Nagafen serious wounded, but did not finish off the beast. But no warrior died in vain, as Lord Nagafen was left with something to think about for the next time we make an attempt at him.<p>OOC - <p>First off, I&#8217;d like thank Xziled for organizing this raid, and doing a great job leading it. This was Morell&#8217;s first attempt at Nagafen, and it wasn&#8217;t that bad. The first attempt at Nagafen was cut short only due to the fact that most of the parties involved got Feared due to nagafen dispelling and buffs wearing prematurely. <p>The second attempt was very well organized and if anything the lag should get the majority of the credit for killing most the members of the raid. We were able to bring nagafen down to 12% health, which for many of you out there who have done a Nagafen Raid with a group of 30+ people most of which had never raided with each other before, isn&#8217;t too shabby.<p>Other thanks goes to the 52+&#8217;s who helped out with clearing and to some degree corpse recoveries, and of course Oppression who was brave enough to run in and aggro Lord Nagafen first on the second run. Oppression also did a good bit of organizing as well, which I feel should be noted.<p>The raid wasnt a complete failure as now we know what to expect on Morell as far as dragons like Nagafen and Vox are concerned...

Caleryn sent me an account of a recent GM event on the Morell Thule server:<blockquote>Last night on Morell Thule a band of Dark Elf Dragoons entered Qeynos intent on the slaughtering of innocents. They shouted out challenging the citizens of the fair city to fight them, calling us cowards. Fierce cries went up from Qeynos, I, Lord Caleryn Artavia of The AnDarim, accompanied by my trusty guildmate and bodyguard, Jhord the brave dwarven warrior, shouted out against the foul foes challenging them to approach the gates to face our blades.  Soon others joined us, Dragoons the dwarven paladin, Ynmi *sp* the high elven cleric and many others too numerous to name, and soon the battle was joined!!<p>Unfortunately, my earlier cries of hatred against the heathens had garnered me the dubious distinction of being their primary first target.  We bravely fought the onslaught, and the dark elves were slowly being beaten back, but alas a healer was among them and began rescuing them from the verge of death. The fight continued, I was forced to temporarily retreat from the battle, but my position was quickly filled by other brave souls of Qeynos. Soon after, their leader Dragoon Brynlo fell, and as he went down we rushed the remaining heathens and crushed their pitiful frames beneath our weapons. Victory!! Qeynos had been rescued!  The dark ones had fallen and we lived to tell the tale! A great joyful cry went up among the warriors and citizens of Qeynos. Their grand city still stood, unscathed by the evil elves.<p>(ooc: It was a great event, thanks to GM Ashlanne of Morell Thule, and those that helped, and thanks to all who rallied to conquer the foes. This is what EverQuest is all about!)<p>Sincerely,<p>Caleryn Artavia<br>Lord of The AnDarim<br>Druid of Tunare</blockquote>Thanks Caleryn!

Abashi spent this evening reading the Gameplay boards (you should have went to see X-Men Gordon! *g*) and as such, he made several posts. Read on for details:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061622.html"><b>Representation</b></a><br>Your suggestion is admirable, but begs the question, which players would I "represent"? Would I represent the druids who want to be more powerful than mages, or mages who want to be more powerful than wizards, or wizards who want to be more powerful than everyone? What of the melee types who want to be more powerful than the casters, or the casters who want the opposite? How about the priests versus the pure casters? The melee versus the hybrids? Do I champion *all* of the ideas and concerns, or only the *good* ones? Who decides what is *good*?<p>The wants of each individual player are extremely diverse. The needs and desires of one player are often in direct conflict with that of another. Players will typically only support the addressing of another players concerns as long as they don't view a negative impact for themselves. To pull back as far as possible, players in general want to be entertained. Get any closer and the definition of "entertained" begins to vary greatly.<p>I do champion the concerns and ideas that I feel are good and in the best interests of the game as part of my job. To the greatest extent possible my chief concern is the satisfaction of the players in the game. As much as I'd like to to please everyone and be "loved by all" however, I don't think that will ever be possible. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061613.html"><b>Experience Points and Magical Items</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Why, when the level bar was raised from 50 to 60, was the skill bar not raised? The MOBs are higher level. They hit harder. Why are skills not improving to match? ]</I></FONT><P>Many skills were raised to varying levels depending on class. You are correct in your mention of the limit to the max value. It's actually 252 rather than 255 (we use the two least significant bits for other things), but for the reasons you mention. The cap doesn't allow us to directly store larger values as part of the character. <P><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Why do the spell effects on class specific items usually a spell (or variant) of on the class already has? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to get something that they do not have access to? I myself am a warrior, so any effect is something that I don't already have, but for the other classes, is it really a benefit to have a duplicate of a spell you already have?]</I></FONT><P>It's a benefit when the spell on the item doesn't use mana. Keep in mind that the spells themselves are already balanced, and that there's only so many things that a spell can do. When deciding to place a spell on an item, we have to decide what it is that we want the spell to do. If there is an existing spell that fills the requirement, the existing spell is often used. As for giving classes access to spells that they don't already have access to, we have to be vary careful that we don't create a balance issue in the process. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060684.html"><b>Offensive Duel Broadcasts</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Put a minimum level on duels. Lets say 6, because that is the level you start losing experience, and your corpses stay on the ground.]</I></FONT><P><i>Editor's Note: This is refering to the level 1 pranksters who create characters just to duel eachother and see the resulting broadcast of the duel results.</i><P>We already have something like this planned. I don't know yet if it will be in next weeks patch, but if it isn't, it will betthe patch after that. When it is updated, if either duel participant is below level 5 or 6 (Not sure which it will be yet), the duel results will not be broadcasted to the world.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057887-3.html"><b>"Power Guilds"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Blame EQ for Powerguilds, not the guilds Verant created the powerguilds]</I></FONT><P>"powerguilds" as mentioned here will occur in any environment where like-minded players are allowed to join together. It really doesn't matter who is "blamed" for it happening. There's really nothing preventing two different guilds from getting together for the purpose of taking on large projects. Sure, communication is marginally more difficult, but it's far from being unmanageable. <p><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Unfortunately, Verant has blackballed option #2. Because they provide no guild alliance code, it is nearly impossible to associate closely with your allies.]</I></FONT><p>Whether it's "powerguilds" or "poweralliances", the only difference is the name that happens to be over everyone's head. Either we end up with everyone belonging to the same guild, or we end up with the same guilds always in an alliance. <p>I'm not sure if a sure fire "solution" exists, or whether this is even a problem that we should "solve". There should be some benefit for being part of a large army (safety in numbers for one), and a disadvantage for choosing to go-it solo or small, as the case may be. We of course do not want to see anyone monopolizing areas with their groups, but if someone cannot make enough friends to take on some of the larger encounters, is that a problem? <p>Player interaction is one of the main points of massively-multiplayer online games. I'm not sure that just rearranging the way interaction takes place from fewer large guilds to allied smaller guilds will make much of a difference.<P></UL>Thanks Abashi!

Abashi made several posts on the gameplay board this afternoon:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061660.html"><b>Dragons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Naggy and Vox need to be duplicated in a secondary zone with a passage that leads off from the main chamber..This "set" of dragons need to have a level cap of 53 needed to enter...like the planes have a cap....the loot needs to be identical..the dragons can be buffed a bit to make the difficulty" appropriate...but this was you have the dragons available to ALL which is how it should be.]</I></FONT><P>It appears that you are making the argument that people are again entitled to this loot. They aren't. You *can* however trade for the loot should you wish to acquire it, aside from the small number of nodrop items. <P>Nagafen and Vox, and dragons in general, aren't designed to be cafeterias where everyone sooner or later gets served. Though I understand the desire to obtain those items, they aren't typically out of your reach. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061616.html"><b>Druid Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: As far as i've seen, druids have no non-fire based direct damage spells from 19 - 49. Prior to Kunark, this made life for a druid somewhat difficult... people would settle for druids (with their whopping 99 point burst of static electricity and succor) if they couldnt get a wizard. Many of the 35 - 50 dungeons are highly fire resistant making us little more than emergency chutes. I've only just begun exploring Kunark, so perhaps the answer lies there and not in my homeland, but still, something magic or cold based in between to ease that sizeable gap would be very nice.]</I></FONT><P>Unless I'm mistaken, there is a cold-based druid spell at 49. If your level range was supposed to be exclusive of that, I apologize. In any case, there are other classes that only have one or two types of direct damage available to them. I believe that clerics and enchanters are both restricted to magic-based spells only. Necro's 44th level DD is fire based, and is the only DD spell that they get with exception to the poison-based one at 44. <P>I could be wrong but I believe that shaman are heavy in ice-based spells but have not much of anything else in the Direct Damage department. Wizards have cold, fire, and magic based spells but no poison or disease.<P>It all appears to work out fairly well.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061465.html"><b>Wolf-form</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: How is it a low level spell is not replaced by the higher level one of the same series when cast?]</I></FONT><P>I could be wrong, but I seem to recall that it did at one time. My understanding was that most view wolfform as an inferior spell for most applications, since it cancels at each zone line.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061464.html"><b>Warrior Magic Resistance</b></a><br>The warrior magic resist was designed to go up as the warrior levels, whereas the others weren't. We were correcting a problem that existed with the warrior class at one time. It was a relatively major tweak. The changes for the others were minor tweaks.<P></UL>Thanks Abashi!

Gordon stopped by the Gameplay board this evening to add a couple more posts.<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061349.html"><b>On Experience Loss</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: I believe this is a side effect of the Kunark patch that made it so people wouldn't immediately start at level 51 (they started like one pixel away from 51, a kill or two). As it is now, you get stopped w/ a pixel left (to "61") and cannot gain anymore. This is especially harsh considering that a meager 5 deaths will set you back to level 59 (yes, 5 deaths will take away 5 bubbles of EXP). At level 50 w/ a full bar (minus a pixel) you could die about 10 times. It would be nice to continue to get buffer XP rather than being stopped. Any chance of this being changed?]</I></FONT><P>No plans along these lines. We have to stop experience gain somewhere, and about 100 XP points below "Maxlevel + 1" is a good place to do it. Certainly you have less of a "buffer" per se, but 5 deaths seems pretty substantial. That said, are you sure it's only 5 deaths? At 60th level, max experience loss on death has been capped for several levels. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061345.html"><b>Rangers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: now correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't higher dmg output make it WORSE for us?]</I></FONT><P>It depends on how we do it. In this case the plan is to enhance damage output from archery under certain conditions, giving rangers an incentive to back out of melee range for a few seconds. <P>If rangers can make a *big* hit from time to time at a greater delay rather than a *bunch* of smaller hits at a lesser delay, the desired affects might be obtainable.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061342.html"><b>Bugs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: The specific instance may have been solved but you are wrong about them being fixed. Head out to Timirous Deep, and druid-style quad-kite the raptors. Within a few trials, when the raptors are low health (ie fleeing range) sometimes they stop, and then vanish. They don't vanish really so much as they teleport back to their spawn points and begin regaining health rapidly. (similar to when they are not engaged in combat, npc regen). This is the primary instance I can cite off hand that is easily reproduceable.]</I></FONT><P>This might have to do with them entering the water, or getting close enough to it that they think they've entered it. Pathing behaves differently there. Can anyone reproduce flee-warping away from water?<P><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Recently, due to abuse of mez lines and illusions, a change was made such that any time you cast an offensive spell in a city on a pvp server, your illusion drops(you _should_ know this).

So yes, you CAN cast mez, but in essence, you can't.]</I></FONT><P>OHHHH... *that's* what you were talking about :-)<P><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Very simple. Equip your primary and off hands with stuff. Then equip something in range slot. Example: Bard wields 2 swords, then equips spectral bow into range slot, now he is holding a bow on the character model. (Granted, bow has been changed, but it is just an example, reproducable with any range weapon equipped.)]</I></FONT><P>This is as intended. It's what makes the bow appear when it's used. When you close to melee, your character doesn't actually melee with the bow like the message suggested. The bow should disappear and he should pull out his melee weapons.<P><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Two things. On a philosophical note, A shark, on top of the mast of a boat, NOT a bug!?!?!?]</I></FONT><P>A bug is something that doesn't work as designed, not something that doesn't work as expected, nor something that doesn't work in accordance with reality. With the way that pathing works, the possibility of a shark going for a ride on top of a boat does exist, and is not a bug. It's certainly not *desirable* given infinite processing power, bandwidth, and manpower, but in the absence of those, it's acceptable.<P><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: This is sort of a philosophical gripe. You are asking your players to begin the debugging process of your product. WE report the bugs, its YOUR job to fix them. ]</I></FONT><P>Thanks for the note, however, bugs that we *can* reproduce will always have higher priority than bugs we can't. If you want to have your issue moved up the chain so to speak, let us know how to reproduce it. We don't assign people to relatively harmless (in the big picture) bugs and have them work full time on it until they've found a way to reproduce it. Perhaps if we run out of reproducable ones we might do that.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061352.html"><b>Stars</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: What's the point of a star system? Would Abashi rather read a thread started by someone with 0 stars, or a veteran, someone with 3+ stars? Would people rather believe someone with 0 stars, or someone with 3 stars?]</I></FONT><P>Actually I'd rather read posts from people who are courteous, regardless how many posts total they have. In any case, I'm not sure if this particular board script supports "stars", or whether our implementation of this board script would (since we don't use UBB's security). <P>It might be a neat thing to do. Perhaps we can look at it after we get the forums shifted over to allow only current subscribers the opportunity to post.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060924.html"><b>QA Forum</b></a><br>Ester and Hobart have been confining their activities to the QA forum. There's quite a bit of activity there which is taking most of their time. Please keep in mind that Ester and Hobart also have to document and in some cases fix the bugs that are presented there.<p>On one note, I'd like to thank everyone who's been submitting things such as spelling and grammar errors in that forum. We've another person here who's been working non-stop on them since the forum opened.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060798-2.html"><b>Magician Pets</b></a><br>That does sound like it might be a bit excessive to me. Having not played a magician into the "research" levels, I wasn't aware that this was a requirement. Of course, I do have to ask at this point, is a change in this area really *necessary* (again... *necessary*). Magicians have been succeeding since the game launched. To my knowledge, they can buy at least one pet every spell circle. Should there not be an additional and difficult requirement to get all 4 pets at every circle?<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058690-2.html"><b>Shadow Knight Population</b></a><br><font color=#072876><I>[Quote from original post: Why do you think are so few people playing shadow knights? I am very interested in your theories.]</I></FONT><P>Good question. I was quite surprised to only see one SK at the gathering. We've several people playing them here and they are typically enjoyed by all. I'd guess that it's primarily the faction issue. <P>I'd like to see a lot more people playing them. People frequently ask for a melee character that can solo, and the SK is certainly more capable of that than any of the others.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546-7.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br>Though I do completely understand and appreciate the desire for roleplayers to be *exclusively* around other roleplayers, it's not something that is really quantifiable. People already have a fair number of complaints about the judgements made by the GM/Guide staff. I can only imagine what level those complaints would reach if people started being thrown off of a server on the basis of "not roleplaying". I'd personally really like the idea of being in a roleplay-only environment, however even I am not comfortable with the thought of others judging whether or not I am roleplaying. The suggestions of removing /ooc and other zone-wide communicationd does not necessarily mean that a roleplaying environment will be further fostered, only that communications might be more difficult overall. <p>I'm sorry guys, but an enforced "roleplay only" environment" is not something that we can implement fairly.</UL>Thanks Gordon!
