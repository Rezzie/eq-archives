Gordon Wrinn <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000239.html">shared some thoughts</a> on the configuration of the Sullon Zek teams on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the post:<UL>Most Sullon players, I think, noticed the MOTD on Sullon last week hinting that the Nameless was thinking of levying large penalties against those in the Evil Alliance due to the outnumbering of others. Frankly, we're wondering if anything *really* needs to be done. <br><br>Evils currently outnumber good and neutral combined and have a higher average level due to there being safety in numbers and the geographical isolation of the Iksar. <br><br>So why did so many people join Evil? It's not one of power -- The class availability of the teams is in good balance. I imagine zone-control is a big part, but my guess is that it comes down mostly to "evil" seeming "cooler" than good. Do players *really* find this a problem? How many players joined Good expressly for the higher difficulty level and the "target rich environment"? How many joined evil due to a desire to be a part of what's imagined to be the "winning team"?<br><br>Right now based on the point-system announced last week, evil and good are scoring a similar number of points despite there being 4x as many evils as good. Neutral on the other hand is laying waste to both other teams despite being outnumbered by evil?<br><br>I suppose what it comes down to more than anything is: Are people having fun? <br><br>We have been discussing potential "solutions" to the team lop-sidedness. Some have suggested that we tweak experience rewards so that Good and Neutral level faster in order to make those teams more attractive. Others have suggested that we make evil level slower. Differing experience penalties on death have also been discussed. Frankly I'm not a fan of either of these ideas for one main reason: Everyone caps out at level 60, and come level 60 differing experience requirements don't mean squat.<br><br>There is another idea that we've been discussing. It's passed internal muster, which means it's time to bring it up and see what Sullon players think. As it's hard for us to query players of individual servers or rulesets on their thought, I'll ask everyone replying to open their reply with whether or not they play on Sullon currently.<br><br>Our idea is this, in the words of EQLive's Assistant Producer Bill "Solist" Coyle, what's the one thing throughout fantasy literature that has made it possible for Good to stand their ground and beat back the overwhelming forces of Evil? <br><br><br>/em plays some suspenseful music...<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>Wait for it....<br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>Why, it's the fact that Evil eventually turns on itself. <br><br><b>Duh duh duh duuuuuum!</b><br><br>Our idea is, simply, allow Team Evil to attack each other... <br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer<br>EverQuest Live / Luclin<br>Sony Online Entertainment</UL>

Vice President Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000237.html">announced the creation</a> of the second "Ask Brad" column on the Developer's Corner.  The following is the complete announcement:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>Some of you who read voodooextreme.com might have noticed the &#8216;Ask Brad&#8217; column that was recently added. Well, I was thinking, if there&#8217;s an interest, of doing something similar here as well.<br><br>How it works is this: people send in emails, asking me questions. I sift through them, pick out a few every week or so, and then answer them. I was thinking of doing both columns, in that different people read that site as well as this one (although I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s overlap).<br><br>I am more interested in answering certain questions than others, though. In other words, I have neither the time nor the inclination to compete with Absor  I&#8217;m not looking for EverQuest current event questions, or why a certain item was changed or has certain stats, or whether a quest works or not, or why was &#8216;taunt&#8217; changed recently, or to engage in a big debate over the precise rule set of Sullon Zek vs. Tallon Zek.<br><br>That&#8217;s what this board in general is for, and we already have a working feedback loop in place.<br><br>Rather, I&#8217;d be interested in answering more broad questions. Questions about game design in general, or why certain decisions were made in creating EverQuest. Or even questions about some of our other announced products, and how they might be similar or different to EverQuest. Or questions about our company in general, our philosophies, what we do every day, how games are developed... or even, 'Brad, who the heck are you anyway?'<br><br>Now, I&#8217;m not at all certain how many people are interested in this sort of thing, but heck, let&#8217;s give it a try. Send your emails directly to me, but make sure they have ASK BRAD in the beginning of the subject, or they&#8217;ll slip through my email filter. Then every week or so I&#8217;ll reply to as many as I can with a public post in this forum (btw, when you send an email in, if you don&#8217;t want your name shown, please make sure you let me know).<br><br>And please try to adhere to the themes and topics I&#8217;ve described. I&#8217;ll have to ignore everything else (and, of course, that includes flames and the like &#8211; please be nice to me :) ). <br><br>My email: <a href="mailto:bmcquaid@station.sony.com">bmcquaid@station.sony.com</a><br><br>-Brad McQuaid<br>Executive Producer, EverQuest<br>Vice President, Premium Games<br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive</UL>

Brad McQuaid again visited the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=13581076&replies=33">thread dedicated to Shadoe's latest article</a>.  This time around Brad responded to a post made by a player named Malakie.  Here's the scoop: <UL>I think I can honestly say, Brad, that noone is buying what your selling here. Even with your reasons, as sound as you might percieve them, I doubt very many people you are doing it simply out of the goodness of your hearts. The fact that Verant is actually stating that giving players this option will STRENGTHEN the community is laughable. <br><br>I also agree with a previous poster about the policy on not moving no drop items. While I think it's fine and dandy that you say "We are not allowing any items/coin to be moved, including no drop items," your logic in dissallowing it is, quite frankly, shoddy(sp.) I think you'd have just said "We are not moving any items" and left it at that. <br><br>I did read all of the rules and such, and I' quite glad no moves are allowed to/from Test and Sullon Zek. Very good move there. <br><br>Malakie <br>50 Enchanter <br>Test Server <br><br>BTW, Brad... Test Server just passed it's 1 year anniversy of the item whipe. Just thought I'd throw in a friendly reminder. <br><br><b><I>malakie: I'm sorry you feel that way. The reason we say we are doing it to strengthen community is because we want to bring friends or family that might have started on different servers together. <br><br>What we don't want are extreme power gamers hopping from one server to another, collecting phat lewts, ever in search of servers where one can 'buy low', and then transfering to another to 'sell high'. <br><br>Also, players know how many high-end items are in the game, including no-drop items. We don't want to disrupt that aspect of community either. Some players take pride in knowing they were one of the first on their server to obtain an item, and I think it might be a bummer to suddenly have someone else with that item transfer in. So that's why we're not allowing no-drop items to move either. <br><br>But there are times when friends or family are found on different servers, and they want to be together. They are willing to make a sacrifice to be together, and this is what our character transfer program is for. <br><br>I assure you that were we doing this just to make a buck, we'd lower the price and allow people to move with items -- the result would be a LOT more people interested, and therefore a LOT more revenue. <br><br>But, and probably contrary to what some might believe, I don't believe in hurting the health of the game long term to make a buck short term. <br><br>-Brad </b></I></UL>

In this post, Brad McQuaid attempts to explain Verant/SOE's decision to allow transfers, for a price, after years of saying it wasn't an option:<UL>There have been three major reasons we've not accomodated server moves before: <br><br>1. We were concerned that it would upset the economies on the destination server <br><br>2. We lacked the manpower to accomdate the moves. <br><br>3. We were afraid one server might be perceived as 'better' or more 'popular' and that players would flock there. <br><br>We've now addressed these three issues: <br><br>1. You move without items, and the cost is somewhat prohibitive. In other words, players will hopefully move for the right reasons now, and being sans items shouldn't measurably disturb the destination server's economy. <br><br>2. We've updated our billing system and automated much of the task, such that the manpower hit is minimal. <br><br>3. We're pretty sure we have enough servers now (which wasn't the case in the past) such that this won't happen. That said, if it does happen (or if anything 'bad' happens because of this), I assure you it will be turned off ASAP. <br><br>Therefore, I must respectfully disagree with Shadoe's assertion that we are 'selling out' in any way and/or abandoning our principles. <br><br>-Brad </UL><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=13581076&replies=5">Click here</a> to visit the original message board thread.

BUT you need to make certain that that is exactly what you are doing. We're not going to have a lot of patience with people that disguise real world harassment behind in-character pretenses. <br><br>The point of this whole thread is to make certain that people understand that, regardless of individual opinions about the specifics of 'offensive' language and things like that, we are serious about enforcing these rules. We don't want to kick people out of our game, those people are paying us to let them play our game. But profanity and harassment cause other people to quit the game. It makes for an unpleasant gaming environment, and that's not what we want. So even if you think we're too harsh with our rules, please follow them.

I can understand the no items/coin well enough but there are some details left out on that page. <br><br>What about faction? I know people work hard for thier Velious factions and the like and it would be a large factor in any decision that I make to use this or not. <br><br>No Drop Items? I know these probably fall under said policy but these type of items would not have a bering on the economy and alot of these items are hard to come by. I dont really see a problem with these being transfered. <br><br>Names. When I transferred over I got my name as soon as I could on my old server to keep it. But it was a warrior and I wanted to change him to some other class. In that process I was not able to recover my name so I can only assume that someone else got it in that short period of time. Now when I come over I was wondering what the policy on name changes while using this service. If I come over as NAMEx can I just change my first name to something else? That would also factor in my decision process. <br><br>Well thanks and have a good day. <br><br>Hrothy<br>Aro ]</i></font><br><br>Your faction will travel with your character. <br><br>As for why we won't move items, here's the logic behind it. <br><br>We decided it was in the best interest of the EverQuest community to only move characters without items, coins or the contents of their bank. If we permitted characters to move with their items, coins and the contents of their bank, it would affect the economy and item balance on their new server. Server economies vary and a move to a different server by a high level character or a large guild could completely change the economy on that server and could also drastically affect the gameplay and game balance. <br><br>No drop items are a part of that economy. Just the appearance of a new high level character on a server can have a dramatic effect on the social and economic properties of that server. Allowing no-drop items to suddenly appear on a server where perhaps only a few, or none, have been gathered yet impacts those that were on that server already. No, that person couldn't sell these items for some unreasonably high price on the new server, since they are no drop. But those items affect the culture on a server. And many no-drop items are stepping stones for large quest rewards. It would be possible to transfer with quest items that would make gaining certain items, such as epic items, much easier to get on the new server if that server wasn't mature enough for the characters to tackle certain obstacles that were more easily tackled on another server. <br><br>We also have to consider the reasons that people move. Folks moving to join friends on a different server will have people there to help them recover their items. People moving to escape a bad reputation won't. <br><br>We understand that this service will not appeal to all of our customers. But it will appeal to many, and this is the form for that service that has the least negative impact on those that don't use it, which is the majority of our customers. <br><br>As for the name thing, you can petition and a GM will change your name if you have an appended 'x'. <br><br>Xelene wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Never mind, the link works when I click on it from the front page.

Bolding going where no man has never gone before, Shadoe has written  a brand new editorial tackling, you guessed it, the new character transfer service.  In my opinion it's one of his best yet, so be sure to read it.  An excerpt from <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid994454754,62624,">Beam Me Up, Verant!</a> can be read here:<UL>Now, before you grab your favorite e-mail suite and write up a nastygram accusing me of being against moving characters across servers, let me just say you're wasting your time. I, for one, see tremendous value in being able to do this. I, for one, am even tempted to use this service for more than one of my characters. I think that transferring characters between servers can, in fact, be a Good Thing. I've often wished that Verant would reconsider their stance on this issue, and I'm glad to see this opportunity open up. <br><br>In the same breath, I will also say this is an outright compromise in principle for Verant Interactive. </UL>To respond to the article on our boards, please follow <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=13581076&replies=0"><b>this link</b></a>.<br><br>Thanks Shadoe!

But, and I can't count the number of times we've said this, the language filter is no excuse for foul language.

I'm not against evening the playing field, as evil does seem immensely powerful thus far, but I just wanted to point out that any change made is going to offend many people, especially any sort of retroactive change such as changing what team a certain god is on, as one rumor was that Rallos would become neutral. Others just seem outright unfair, such as the evil experience penatly rumor, I'll hold out faith that you all realize that. The other rumored "fix" was that of merging the good and neutral teams. Although this would offend some, I think that if it's really necessary it is the best solution, particularly from a roleplaying perspective. The idea of "newts" that slaughter good and evil sides can, I suppose, be roleplayed somewhat; but it's quite limited and not very realistic. Usually neutral character tend toward good anyway, since they still want to live well, not be slaves, etc. <br><br>On the whole idea of crossteaming, I still do not understand why the teams can't group together (or guild for that matter, but it's less important). It's sort of like saying if you work with someone you hate then you have to quit your job. As long as beneficial spells can't be cast on each other, and they can still hit one another, the team rules can't be exploited. Arbitrarily stopping grouping just stops possible roleplaying situations as I see it, I'm sure such grouping would be a rarity, anyway, but there's just no reason to completely and arbitrarily bar it. ]</i></font><br><br>All of those are rumors. We are talking about things to do, but I haven't heard any of those considered seriously. <br><br>However, if we feel it is necessary, and we find a functional method, then we will make changes to the server rule set. Obviously we don't want to make any major changes unless they are absolutely necessary, and if they are needed, we'll try to make them as painless as we can. But we're certainly willing to make those changes. <br><br>So part of the rumor is true, we are most certainly looking into ideas for shifting the balance a little if it we have to. <br><br>As for cross-teaming, the idea of having teams is to be on your team, not on two teams at once. We most certainly did not 'arbitrarily' prevent grouping across teams. That was done deliberately. We want people to rely on their teammates, we want a segregation between the teams. That was the intent, not an arbitrary decision. <br><br>Mulamasi_TZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like the fact that the teams cant determine which side their on. As an Evil I can just con anyone and see 'Threatening' woohoo! more blood to add to my weapon. <br><br>The fact is if you make it so that goods can con newts and see 'Apprehensive' they can basically form a light alliance where it becomes socially unacceptable to attack newts as a good or goods as a newt. According to the information I've gotten about the server its supposed to be a Deity-War therefore Newts/Goods shouldnt care that they're worshiping 'less evil' deities and should kill them regardless. As a follower of Innoruuk my Troll Shaman is going to be killing anything I can hit :)]</i></font><br><br>But it would also mean that evils and neutrals could more easily make alliances. At the same time, neutrals can't really tell who is who (except for the obvious cases), and will be at as much of a disadvantage as an advantage, and will have to be more careful who they attack than good or evil if they want to keep their alliances solid. <br><br>This didn't go in last patch as we had intended.

I knew what I was getting into when I started this, and being disadvantaged increases the interest of this game by 10X for me. Please, don't nerf the evil, or any, team. They will all evolve according to the players, there is no need of outside interference. We have some very devoted people on the good team, we took MM the other day, and we're going to hold it, our barbarian counterparts have carved out a haven in permafrost, we will survive it will just be harder--which is why we chose this team. <br><br>Sweyn Sylvan<br>21st Warrior of Tunare - SZ <br><br>Sweyn Sylvan<br>55th Ranger of Tunare &#8211; VZ ]</i></font><br><br>You mirror my personal opinion on the matter.

I'll correct the rules. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, <br><br>Just to make it clear, not everyone who "cross-teams" on VZ/TZ does so for the purpose of immortal healing. In fact, most people who cross-team, do so purely for roleplaying reasons (as I've said before, most of us want to play Light vs. Dark, not a three-way dance like SZ, or a four-way dance like the purists want, or a free-for-all like RZ is). I truly hope you don't think that the only reason people choose to team up across race lines is just so they can cheat. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding your statement where you said: "Cross-teaming is, as far as I know, making guilds and groups that combine teams so that you can use the invulnerable healer properties of the team PvP servers." Quite the contrary, Alan, cross-teaming happens because a lot of us love stories like Lord of the Rings, where Elves, Dwarves, and Humans teamed up to fight the Dark races of their world. We cross team on VZ/TZ because that's the closest thing to giving us what we want to play. We (and I'm speaking for my guild, but I imagine this is true for most Lighty guilds) aren't doing this to cheat. In fact, if a Lighty guild (like mine) only engages with a Darkie guild, then guess what? There can be no immortal healing, because we don't have Darkies, and they don't have Lighties! What a concept, eh? :-) <br><br>I'm not trying to anger you, or sound bitter, I'm just trying to point out that while there may be SOME people who "cross-team" solely to cheat, I don't want you lumping all of us into that catagory. If we had a Light vs. Dark server that we could move our characters to, believe me, we'd move there in a heartbeat and the purists on VZ/TZ could happily play the four-way Race Wars they want, the Sullon Zek players could happily play the three-way Deity Wars they want, and us Light Races vs. Dark Races players could happily play the War of Light against Darkness that we want. No cheating, no immortal healing, no people quitting en masse because you wrecked their guilds/friendships that have been there for two years, etc. We all get to be happy. Even Verant, since they'd be keeping all of us who would quit if we were told we couldn't play Lights vs. Darks anymore. Let's all be happy, eh? <br><br>Respectfully yours, <br><br>Taliaferro Erucolindo<br>Officer of Giliath Lang<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>You're right, it did sound that way. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intent. <br><br>We could argue the proper way to play on the team server until the cows come home (and there ain't no cows comin' home to my little apartment&#8230;) and probably not agree. My counter to your point would be, no, the best place to recreate the Lord of the Rings situation with elves, dwarves and humans teamed up to fight evil would be Rallos Zek, where the battle lines are drawn entirely by the players. On the team servers the lines were set in such a way that it should have been obvious that elves, dwarves and humans were not meant to work together, but to hate each other. <br><br>But I did not mean to imply that everyone that 'cross teams' is doing so in order to exploit the system. I don't believe that to be true. <br><br>On the other hand, if you are grouped with a dwarven paladin, a human cleric, and a elven enchanter, for example, and you are jumped by a band of human thugs&#8230; <br><br>Well, is your human cleric going to refuse to help his friends, or is he going to heal them? <br><br>Regardless of the intent, such situations will arise. And such situations really seem to represent broken gameplay to me. The fact that the human cleric in that situation is forced to choose between doing what he thinks his character would do (heal his friends) and something that his player should see as an abuse of the rules of the server (since the human thugs can't hurt him in any way). <br><br>This isn't a good situation for anyone, really. <br><br>Now that's my feelings on the matter. We also understand that people have grown accustomed to the way it is now, and that some people have formed groups and guilds across the barriers that were so poorly erected against such activity. We know that some people will be upset by this change. But we also know that some will be pleased. <br><br>So we're still discussing it. But the inclination is to makes the rules work, remove the broken invulnerable healer thing, and 'hard code' the teams. That's still the direction we are headed.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000233.html"><b>Patches</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, i have a few questions on the patch (7/5). <br><br>ok, one, do we need to edit the EQ Client text file in order to see anything new??

Sullon Zek and other patch-related topics make up today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000233.html"><b>Servers Down Thursday</b></a><br>On Thursday July 5th at 3AM, all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch.

But there are most certainly cases where a suspension is warranted immediately. And, well, some people that say, "I didn't even get a warning!" aren't exactly telling the truth. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi Abs <br><br>Just a minor question: HOW does one go about handling situations, where foul language is occuring? <br><br>What if Im in say Oasis, and someone starts to shout at each other, clearly being very offensive. None of their verbal attacks are aimed at me, but I can still hear/read them? Do I /report or do I /petition? <br><br>Or what? Since its not aimed at me, perhaps I should just let it slide? <br><br>I would personally love to see EQ as a game, free of all the "kids" who cant control their language. But how can one best assist the GM's in carrying out this task? <br><br>Some advice would be greatly appreciated. <br><br>:)<br><br>Kaz <br><br>ps. Im from Denmark - that should explain the bad english.. :)]</i></font><br><br>Well, it is up to you whether or not you want to report something. But foul language does not need to be directed at you to be warnable or bannable. <br><br>The best way to deal with it is to scroll up until the offensive chat is visible in your chat window, then use /report &lt;character name&gt;, where the character name is the name of one of the offenders (you'll have to pick one, but include all offenders in your petition), then /petition &lt;full details&gt;. <br><br>This gets the offensive text on file and tells the GMs that they need to look it up and come and deal with it. <br><br>Cyrisha wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Not sure about you but your links didn't work for me.

It should be pretty obvious that the intent was that there be four teams, not two." <br><br>Can you clarify? A good/neutral alliance sounds like xteaming to me. I thought the intent on Sullon was 3 teams, not two.]</i></font><br><br>Cross-teaming is physically impossible on Sullon. <br><br>Cross-teaming is, as far as I know, making guilds and groups that combine teams so that you can use the invulnerable healer properties of the team PvP servers. <br><br>You can't guild or group across teams on Sullon, so cross-teaming isn't even possible.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000228.html"><b>New Animations on "Character Select" Screen</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, Absor.<br><br>Maybe I am the only one who looks at my characters on the select screen for a decent amount of time and that is why no one else has noticed this.

Two more posts to report to you tonight from the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>More Sullon Zek Talk</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really think a second server should be put out with the Deity rule set. <br><br>I know you're waiting for things to settle down but we're approaching the first week mark and every night so far there has been over 3k people at night and 2k in the mornings. <br><br>Has anyone ever stopped to think that you guys might have came up with something that everyone likes? This is a hit, guys! The only down side is 150-300 people in newbie zones. I don't see this dying down either, or lookie-loos leaving. People actualy want to play this thing. I'm one of them! <br><br>So please, at least consider thinking about starting a second server. <br><br>Surefoot Twelvetoes<br>Sterling Order of Knights<br>Fennin Ro ]</i></font><br><br>It's just too early to think about a new server. We're certainly enthusiastic about the way the rules have been received by the players, but we want to wait before we make any decisions about the future for this server. Let's see if the numbers are still high in a month or two. Remember, this is a rather harsh server to play on, what with experience loss and all that, so let's see how it goes before declaring it a huge success&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a couple of Questions / Issues with the PVP Ruleset on Sullon...<br><br><br>1. Is the entire Cancel Magic Line of Spells considered to be 'beneficial' and not castable on opponents in PVP? This spell line is commonly used (particularly with Pumice) to dispel beneficial buffs / effects from an opponent such as SOW, Levitate or Damage Shields. Now, I can see it could potentially be used to 'crossteam' by canceling harmful spells on a foe, however, does this override the near essential use of this spell line in offensive PVP? Would it be possible to have the spell line only remove beneficial spell effects from a member of a opposing Team when cast on them?<br><br><br>2. The Posted Rules state that Neutrals would con to a Good or Evil Team member as 'apprehensive' rather than threatening as Goods and Evils are supposed to CON to each other. However, in game, conning a member of an opposing Team is the same 'threatening'. Will this be fixed one way or the other, as the conning system does a lot to develop the roleplay mindset in PVP?<br><br><br>3. With the addition of the rogue ability to pickpocket PCs the question arises: Does this follow the level limits of PVP? Can a rogue pickpocket a PC who is not yet PVP enabled (i.e.: 5th or lower)? In game, several rogues have tried to pickpocket my 5th Ranger, all unsuccessful, causing my character to react by calling for Guards. Does the fact my character did react to the pickpocket attempt indicate they could pickpocket from her without her having the ability to use PVP to defend against it? Is this as it is intended to be? <br><br>Thanks for answering these questions. <br><br>-Sazami of Sullon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>1. Cancel Magic spells should work across teams. They function mostly in an offensive capacity. Their use to 'cross team' is very limited. <br><br>2. I thought the apprehensive thing was supposed to be in game myself&#8230; I'll ask around. <br><br>3. Yes, pick pockets is supposed to follow the level limitations of PvP. I can't see why someone should even be able to attempt to pick the pocket of someone under 6th level&#8230; I'll ask about this too.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000231.html"><b>Patch Fixes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "We fixed the way that NPCs were treating pets. They were accrediting more hate to pets than they should have." <br><br>I still don't think its fixed :)<br><br>Saturday we had a day long raid in Kael, arena area.. during that day our tanks could not get mobs off my pets no matter what they did. Even if I repetedly hit pet back off and the warrior was attacking and taunting like mad, it still hit my pet. <br><br>Now, I agree, before pets were building zero aggro, and this was a problem, but now they are out-aggroing 59th level warriors! (and these are only the 54th level summons (so a 41-45th level pet) <br><br>It seems that the aggro is still out of balance, could you look into it again? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Takiel Vrathe. ]</i></font><br><br>We're still looking at this. It seems that the fix might not have been complete. I certainly noticed that it was much better after the patch, but there may still be a few bugs in it. Keep in mind, though, that there is no promise that we will or even want to return things to exactly the way they were regarding pets. As you say, zero aggro for pets isn't really in the plan either. <br><br>Goladus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: LOL, I was quite surprised when my saw a mob shout 'You will not evade me Gibober!' I was quite proud of him too..]</i></font> <br><br>:)</UL>

Alan popped this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000232.html">on the Developer's Corner</a> as a reminder to players to watch their language on Sullon Zek:<UL>With the popularity of our new server, we are encountering a few problems as well. These problems revolve around the rules for the server.<br>For those of you that are unaware of the rules for Sullon Zek, please read them here: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/sullonzek.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/sullonzek.jsp</a><br><br>One portion of those rules that people seem to be misunderstanding is this:<br><br>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any server. <br><br>Unfortunately, we have been forced to warn, suspend and banish a relatively high number of players (over 60 suspensions since the server opened) that have chosen to ignore the part of the rule after the bolded word HOWEVER.<br><br>Remember, we will continue to enforce rules about common decency. We will not allow any sort of swearing or out of character racial slurs. We will not allow names that violate our naming policy (<a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp</a>).<br><br>Yes, we expect players on this server to duke it out for their team.

Dynamite sent word of a new event on Fennin Ro:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro!!<br><br>    As you know, in past months, I have hosted a rune trade faire for<br>wizards, that we may help each other further our research and<br>development of spells. Last month I was not able to host the faire on<br>account of my writing my final exams, but this month the faire is on!<br>    <br>As in past months, the idea is simple: wizards of all levels meet<br>together and bring their runes. If you need a rune, ask for it, and if<br>anyone has it, they will give it to you. Conversely, if you have a rune<br>someone else is in need of, that you yourself do not need, then it is<br>expected that you shall give it to them freely. This has been a great<br>success in past months, and I'm looking forward to this month being even<br>better!<br><br>    I have had requests to postpone the faire past this weekend as I am<br>told a number of guilds are having events that would coincide with the<br>faire were it held this weekend (I understand one guild is even having<br>an all-weekend scavenger hunt!), and even though that would mean putting<br>the faire past the end of the month, I see no reason why not to postpone<br>it. As such, the faire will be held at the following place, date, and<br>time:<br><br>Where: Toxxullia Wizard Spires<br>When: Monday July 2nd<br>Starting Time: 3PM PST (6PM EST)<br>Ending Time: When all is said and done, and we have finished having fun!<br><br>    As always, I ask that if you ply a trade in which others may partake<br>of your wares and enjoy them, please feel free to bring some of your<br>fare with you! I myself brew, and always ensure I bring enough of my<br>wares to keep everyone happy. If you would care to bring some of your<br>own stock, or if you bake and would like to share your wares, then by<br>all means, bring them with you! These are always welcome!<br>    <br>While this is a faire geared primarily at wizards, I invite everyone<br>to attend. It's good fun and you can get to know your community better.<br>Since I started hosting this faire, I've gotten to know my fellow<br>wizards much better, and am constantly conversing with them... I like to<br>think that this has helped me gain many friends, and will help to gain<br>many more. For this reason alone, even if you aren't a wizard, or if<br>you're a wizard that cannot yet research, or has no more use of<br>research, you should attend anyway! Especially if you are beyond the<br>point that research can advance you, as you can help your fellow wizards<br>who are not quite as advanced as yourself research their spells. Higher<br>level wizards have always been at hand in the past to help younger<br>wizards research their spells, and there is no reason for this to change<br>now.<br><br>    If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, by all means,<br>either send me a tell in-game, or contact me at fenninrunes@hotmail.com,<br>and I will get back to you as soon as possible.<br><br>    I am using the faire this month as a guage of sorts. I intend to use<br>its success in order to determine how popular the faire really is, and<br>whether it should continue. So the more people that attend, the more<br>likely it is that you'll see another faire! I hope one day to limit the<br>faire not only to wizards, but to all casters to come together and share<br>their research, help each other, and get to know each other in the<br>community.<br><br>    I look forward to seeing you there this Monday, my friends, and I<br>hope this will be the greatest faire yet!!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Fresh off the Developer's Corner is a heap of new bits and pieces of information written by Alan in response to feedback sent in by players like you:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Team Server Feedback</b></a><br>B_O_B wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ----------------<br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br>---------------------- <br><br>I asked this question today, <br><br>"'One part of the rules confused me. When it said you would only lose faction by killing a PC if you killed it in their home town, does that mean, for instance, killing a gnome in Steamfont Mountains? Or Ak`Anon?'" <br><br>and got this answer <br><br>"Raenna tells you, 'Hello Guide Raenna here, we're not sure on that question. I recommend that you post the question to Absor on the Developers Corner'" <br><br>So I did what I was told ;-)]</i></font><br><br>Just Ak'Anon. The rule applies to starting cities (not newbie zones). The exceptions are zones like Freeport that have city zones with bat yards attached (and you would lose faction there) and Greater Faydark, where the whole zone is considered a starting city for elves. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is there any way that you guys can Start a secound Server for this? I am getting Kinda Tired with 300+ people in faydark. and 180 in BB. Or you going to wait for it to be live for a while? or what? Maybe on the new server Coin+item. or not I don't care.. but a new server i think is needed! <br><br>Thanks Andrew]</i></font> <br><br>All new servers look like that. Give it a while and everything should smooth out.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000228.html"><b>Feedback on the Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ----<br>Players who are invulnerable won't be the primary on the hate-list for NPC's any longer. <br>---- <br><br>Does this mean warriors will fall off of the hate list when they use DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS against melee only mobs? <br><br>Discipline Description:<br>When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on them by the opponent they are facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<br><br><br>Dractwo Smackdaddy<br>55 Warrior RN ]</i></font><br><br>No. The discipline does not make you invulnerable. It makes you very good at riposting. <br><br>Invulnerability is a very specific thing in EverQuest. You can, as far as I know, only obtain it with a few spells, and all of those spells also make it so that you can't attack back. Divine Aura is the prime example. <br><br>Having a lot more hit points (Rune), being very good at avoiding getting hit (Furious) and things like that are not invulnerability. <br><br>Again, I urge you all to try it out, see how it works in game. <br><br>Sadim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is a question about the changes involving when a person goes invis. They way I understand it is if a person goes invis they will dissapear from your target, but if you have see invis or smiliar spell up they will not disapear. My question actualy has to do with the duration of see invis. I play a 50+ druid on tallon zek and my usual 4 buffs that I always have up are SLN, thorncoat, form of the great wolf, unless indoors, and see invis. The duration of the spells are:<br>SLN approx. 72 mins<br>Thorncoat approx. >120 mins<br>Form of the great wolf approx. 144 mins<br>See invis approx. 27 mins<br>Now you can guess which buff I am constantly refreashing and with the changes involving invis this spell is so much more important. My quesiotn is; Is there a way to increase the duration of See invis or maybe add another spell, like improved see invis, that would have a loger duration? <br><br>Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I see that as a good thing. See Invisible is now a very valuable spell in PvP (for a standard server, it's not really going to matter). The fact that it has a relatively short duration (though you are comparing the duration of a 12-16th level spell with spells of 50+ level) is a good thing. This means that you have to be attentive to your buffs, and that this spell doesn't completely negate the usefulness of invisibility. <br><br>Ashavir wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br>Skyshrine, Thurgadin and Tizmak all had similar looks for the druid armor. We wanted the Skyshrine stuff to be more distinctive."<br><br>Actually, the Thurgadin and Tizmak (and ulthork) armors aren't "similar", they are identical. The Skyshrine armor was similar in that it was a dark brown tinted tizmak. The new change to Skyshrine stuff is great, we love it =) But is there any way to get the Thurgadin armor changed a bit, even to what the old Skyshrine color was? I know druids are used to running around looking like they are in leather, its been our lot in life for over 2 years, but as it is now, a lvl 60 druid in full Thurg armor looks exactly like they are wearing cheap tizmak off lvl 30 mobs. Gear of this level should at least look like more than plain (velious) leather! ]</i></font><br><br>Nope, we're not going to change them. <br><br>I've been getting a LOT of requests for changes to this tinting or that armor appearance. <br><br>Please stop. <br><br>We're not going to revamp every piece of armor in the game to meet the desires of a few people just so we can upset other people that liked the way they looked already. In a few rare cases we've seen some changes that seem to make sense. But we are not going to go back and add this graphic to that sword or that color to your favorite piece of armor&#8230; <br><br>We certainly understand the desire to have armor that looks the way you want it to look. If you want a different look, there are plenty of other armors or items to use that look different. And no matter what we change to please one person or group, someone else isn't going to like the change. It's not worth our time to annoy one group to please another.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000230.html"><b>SZ Point System</b></a><br>Kronx-Zeb wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The real problem here is that points are only awarded for killing players, which I interpret to mean "Who cares about role-playing anymore? Here's Quake with swords." <br><br>Of course, it's only on one server so what's the big deal? Well, if it works well, it may spread to other PvP servers, then who knows? <br><br>Points just seem an exact contradiction to the nature of EQ. No, we don't know how much mana we have, but we know who's killing the most team members and racking up the points. <br><br>I just hope this is presented in the appropriate manner if it crosses to other servers. Indeed, I wouldn't mind getting bonuses for killing a bzillion orcs. I'll probably have to do that anyway, since the questing system is so screwy. ]</i></font><br><br>The points will only be visible outside the game on our site, there won't be any in-game ranking boards (as far as I know), so that should reduce the Quake feeling. <br><br>The idea is to encourage PvP. Me, I won't be looking at the point totals (except as required by my job to make sure they actually work :)), so they probably won't affect my gameplay in any case. <br><br>I certainly understand your point. No, I don't think you'll ever see anything like this on a standard server. The Orcs will be keeping their tallies on little notepads or in their heads, but not on a leader board&#8230; <br><br>Vidar- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will the insignia's of like type be stackable? If not I just could see inventorys of nothing but insignias. <br><br>Also in the most recent posts it seems to be that you've given up on the idea of insignias being for a team reward. Is this point system to replace that and the insignias will be for personal reward now? I know nothing is final yet, just wondering if the direction it seems things are going are how you think they are going. ]</i></font><br><br>Right now, yes. We're still looking into ways to aware the team, but individual point scores are easy enough to do, and don't prevent us from creating team awards. But by far the easiest thing to do is award individuals, and that's the current setup. We've not given up on the idea of team awards yet, though. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This has probably been covered and I just missed it.<br>Q: Are the insignia stackable?<br>Q: Will we be able to turn in multiple insignia for greater reward?<br>Q: What about some unique (to this server) tradeskill items made from the insignia (similar to making a necklace from the ears of your foe)? <br><br>Nill<br>Tribunal ]</i></font><br><br>A: Yes, sorta&#8230; there are several types of insignia (4 for each god) and those will stack (you can stack minor Innoruuk insignia together, but not minor and normal; nor can you stack minor Karana with minor Brell).<br>A: Yes, sorta&#8230; Insignia will be combinable. 10 of one will give you the next one up. In fact, you can only get a Superior insignia by combining 10 Greater insignia. It will be an interesting conflict. Do I keep the 10 minor, which are worth more points, or combine them into one normal insignia that takes up less inventory space but worth less points&#8230;<br>A: Probably won't be a tradeskill.

The Developer's Corner was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000231.html">updated by Alan</a> with some info concerning the emergency patch implemented today:<UL>We fixed the bug with feign death spells that was causing it to fail and sending a "Your spell has been interrupted" message.<P>We fixed the way that NPCs were treating pets.  They were accrediting more hate to pets than they should have.<P>We also fixed a bug with factions that was making it impossible to raise some factions.  There may still be factions that you can't raise because there are no methods for raising them, not because of a bug.  If you get a faction message you will also get a faction gain (or hit).<P>We also added a message that will let you know when you can no longer gain or lose faction with a certain group.  It will say:<P>Your faction standing with &lt;faction name&gt; could not possibly get any worse.<P>or<P>Your faction standing with &lt;faction name&gt; could not possibly get any better.<P>That was the essence of the patch last night.
