<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Yesterday's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064737-2.html">thread started by Alan</a> on handing in quest items has been split.  Here's the latest response from Alan on the subject:<UL><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Disco. Your argument for multi-questing really is just in reaction to a problem with the quest itself. The newbie shackle should be given out to any monk who asks the right NPC. Problem solved.]</i></font> <br><br>And there would undoubtedly be a few cases like this that would have to be fixed up. But they should be few enough and easily fixed. And, well, perhaps we should make this change anyway. I'll mention it to the team. <br><br>Ludovic wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I meet a new NPC! Never spoken to me, because I hadn't done an earlier part of the quest.. I hand him a rusty dagger... <br>I'm SORRY this is NOT what I asked for! <br>*DING* I just discovered that this NPC is a Quest NPC]</i></font> <br><br>Then the NPCs should only react that way to the specific items that they are looking for. If you hand them at least one of the items they seek, but not all of them, then they return them. They should still accept any other sort of gifts. <br><br>Good point. <br><br>Brewhaus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't get it Absor, basically you guys want to get rid of multi-questing, but since that will seem to be a nerf your willing to throw the users this bone. Why don't you just say that you want to nerf multi-questing? Why can't you leave multi-questing and add this. Really, it's not that hard. If your programmers can't figure out how to do it, all they gotta do is ask someone. I could think of many ways to go about this, for example, A pop up box. "You have turned in the wrong or incomplete items, would you like them back?".]</i></font> <br><br>Right now we don't know if it is our intent to change multi-questing. That would be the whole point of this thread. <br><br>Despite your misdirected anger, you might have a good idea. I'll mention it to the team. <br><br>Ludovic wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If noone in the group can use the item, and since multiquesting is out... They will shout to zone, and some newbie...*not a twinked secondary* just got half of what they need for an uber item... qll they need do now is weight around the other drops for the same and bingo they just skipped 30...50 levels worth of upgrading to the next best thing...]</i></font> <br><br>How is that different than it is now? Is it somehow less acceptable that some random person gets to be twinked than some high level person's twink? Is it less acceptable that the low level character get the item than the high level character that can't be bothered to show up and get the item himself? <br><br>And the chances of someone getting a quest done in its entirety this way at a level way too low is extremely slim. And removing multi-questing will not have much of an effect on this anyway. Those high level people wouldn't be hunting that NPC unless one of them wants the item anyway. <br><br>Hasuko wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -This is a multiplayer game that is supposed to encourage grouping and personal interraction. Multi-questing is a part of that.]</i></font> <br><br>Not really. It's not part of 'grouping' at all. If I'm grouped with you, I can loot the item in question and there is no multi-questing needed. Though I can see that it does promote interaction in some ways between people that might not have met otherwise. But those cases are rare. For the most part, muti-questing is done by people that know each other already. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Loss of items is regrettable, but I don't think they occur with all that much frequency that would warrant changing this aspect of the game.]</i></font> <br><br>If it didn't happen with some frequency, we wouldn't be talking about it. It certainly happens enough to make it worth talking about. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -The real problem lies with higher level people camping hard to get items (i.e. The Ring of the Ancients) and then auctioning them in East Commons or GFay at the expense of other players working hard to get the items. That cheapens some quests.]</i></font> <br><br>Agreed. Obviously my personal opinion (again, personal, meaning just me) is that multi-questing is one of those things that, in general, cheapens the game. It allows people to basically split quests up so that the guy getting the reward isn't even doing most of the questing. But that's just my personal opinion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -However, if two or more friends work together to complete a quest and turn in the items so one person gets the reward, then that is well within the spirit of player interraction.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, those friends are not working together if they are multi-questing. They are working separately. They are not interacting at all. If they were together doing each part of the quest, they wouldn't need to multi-quest. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: -Another example: Guildmember-01 is in a raid in the castle in Mistmoore, and they get the werewolf claws. Guildmember-02 is a warrior that needs crafted armor. Guildmember-02 buys the rubies, then Guildmember-01 turns in the werewolf claws and Guildmember-02 turns in the rubies and gets the crafted BP is a perfectly legitimate example of teamwork and the spirit of multi-player cooperation.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, that is an example of teamwork. And I'm not saying that it's a bad thing. But it is basically circumventing the quest (again MY opinion, not that of the team). <br><br>The concern that someone mentioned, the link-dead group member that just can't loot the item that he did work hard to achieve, that's a real concern for me. That person would not be able to get the item (or have someone get it for him), and would lose the chance. In this case, I'm in favor of multi-questing. <br><br>Gestaltmind wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are you even bothering asking us when you have almost certainly already made up your mind?]</i></font> <br><br>Then why bother replying if you are so convinced that we've already made up our minds? <br><br>You'll note that we want to talk about this. When we are set to change something, we'll just do it. Some decisions can't be made by a committee of 300,000. We'll make those decisions and move on. But in cases where we want input, we ask for it. The fact that you assume we don't want to hear your opinion is both silly and false. <br><br>AuntieShaynta wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Third things third: eliminating multi-questing is wrong. There are at least 2 quests I'm aware of that virtually require it. The "Orc Illegible Cantrip" quest in West Freeport that requires 2 of a Lore Item to be handed in, and a necro quest which I believe runs from Paineel that requires good faction with Halas (don't know details, just that a friend has asked me to help him with this).]</i></font> <br><br>I would argue that those quests are broken if they _require_ multi-questing to complete, and should be changed anyway, regardless of what happens here. By themselves, such quests are not really a good reason not to remove multi-questing. But, again, just my opinion (I'm gonna say that a lot, since I'm only representing myself, and no decision has been made by the team on this yet). <br><br>Mr_Vandemar wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This will make at least one quest impossible to complete. The Necromancer "Mantle of Souls" quest from Paineel. It requires that you get a potion from a Barbarian in Halas.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks. That's the information I needed. I'll make sure the team knows about this quest, perhaps it should be changed somehow. <br><br>Aamen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I fail to understand why this is suddenly becoming a problem now since people know that broken quests never get addressed properly until someone has lost a lot time/effort in trying to complete one.]</i></font> <br><br>This has nothing at all to do with broken quests. <br><br>Alcarian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Absor, how unfortunate for you that you've caught me in a adverserial mood.]</i></font> <br><br>Unfortunate for who? It harms only your argument. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Stop making fools of yourselves.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't have a problem with your lack of interest in the discussion. But please refrain from active attempts to disrupt it. <br><br>Stumppuller wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Removing multi-questing is guaranteed to break a number of quests, since a lot of quests were implemented with it in mind as a necessary feature. For just one example, it would break the Paladin Soulfire quest (which in turn would break the Paladin Epic Weapon Quest, since it relies on the Fiery Avenger quest which relies on Soulfire). Why? Because to do an early, necessary stage of the quest, you must give four LORE Drom's Champagnes to the drunk Tyklar Renlon in East Freeport. The only way to do this is to give him one, hit Give, then quickly buy another from the nearby bartender, hand that one over, repeat repeat. This only works because of the multi-questing feature.]</i></font> <br><br>Then that quest sounds broken to me. How silly is it to have it set up that way? This is another one that I'll pop over to the team, regardless of the outcome of our discussions on the subject. <br><br>Letholas_FOV wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What I want to know is how anyone who cannot forage will be able to complete the Tunarean court quests if you implement this. (FYI: you have to forage several no-drop items for part of this quest)]</i></font> <br><br>Noted. <br><br>Yendii wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: just like you said you wouldn't make unkillable mobs]</i></font> <br><br>Certainly not something I ever said. Personally, I'm all in favor of unkillable NPCs. <br><br>Thanks for the input everyone. <br><br>Alan</UL>

Amano Jyaku informed me of this event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Do you ever wish there was something to do besides <i>kill stuff?</i>  Do you like talking to people?  Do you like boozing it up?  Do you want to gather at a large, mobile social event for one night?<br> <br>This is your chance.  <br> <br>Grab a couple plat out of the bank (you'll only need a couple most likely), and come on out and join the <b>Pan-Antonican Pub Crawl</b> on <b>Saturday, March 17th at 1 pm Pacific time</b> (that's 4 pm eastern, 2 pm mountain, 3 pm Central).<br> <br>We're going from Freeport to Halas, on foot, no sow, no teleports, and we're going to hit up every single merchant along the way for more booze.  Our crack team of druids has already mapped, charted, logged and noted the entire route, and there are no less than 25 stops along the way for the frothy brew.  See Antonica the way it was meant to be seen: on foot from one end to the other (and through beer goggles).  <br> <br>Come and meet other player characters and chatter.  Bring your stories, your boasts, your grudges, your pick-up lines, and a couple empty backpacks to hold extra drink as we move along.  And be warned that this is gonna last a while, it took the druid scouting team over 2 hours to track down all the merchants, and they had Spirit of the wolf!  Fortunately the merchant locations are all marked now, so we won't have to go searching... and when we finally arrive in Halas, if you've got the stomach, prepare yourself for a steinhoist that promises to kill at least a few of you!<br> <br>Experience the fun of trying to navigate down a 900 foot chasm while staggeringly drunk!  If you thought Kithicor at night was scary before, try it when you can't SEE anything!  Your liqour and your friends will keep you warm as you weave through the Everfrost Peaks.  We might even have to see if we can't find some of those elusive brewers in Blackburrow and mug them for their highly prized Stout, but no promises. ;)<br> <br>So be in West Freeport in the secret tunnel north of the newbie area at the designated date and time, you know, the big round room with a water-covered floor.<br> <br>A couple notes:<br>1) we won't be hunting for loot or exp. We may have to kill a few beasties along the way for extra cash to buy more hair-a-the-dog-that-bit-ya though.<br> <br>2) Try not to die along the way.  Every effort will be made by the rest of us to keep you alive, but if you throw yourself at a guard in highpass just for giggles don't expect us to wait up for you. We got booze to find, man!<br> <br>3) I realize that some of you may be KOS to some of the merchants we visit, and we'll try to work around it as best we can, but there's only so much that can be done and yet still maintain the event.  And if you're KoS in Halas, my sincere apologies :(  Maybe next time the Pub Crawl can end up in Grobb or something.<br> <br>4) Due to time constraints, we won't actually be including the booze merchants in Freeport in this trip. There are just too many, we'd never get outside the city gates.  The trip starts outside freeport, and we go from there. <br> <br>5) for more questions, please contact Amano-Jyaku on the Out-of-character messageboard at <a href="http://www.ralloszek.net">http://www.ralloszek.net</a><br> <br>Thanks, and hope to see you there!<br>-Amano Jyaku<br>Seekers of Divinity<br>Rallos Zek Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/030601/index.shtml">EQ Quiz centers on Monks</a>.  What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure.  They make great group pullers because of their ability to feign death.  You've perhaps sat back in awe as they've kicked and punched opponents with their bare hands and feet.  But how much more is there to know about these Ninjas of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" test will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the famed martial artists of Norrath.  Feigning death isn't the only talent these elite fighters have.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Monks of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

But, also, please try to do so in a civilized fashion. <br><br>I understand that it appears that we are 'attacking' clerics, with three recent changes that directly affect gameplay for the highest level clerics.

The changes to these healing items are being made in quick succession due to the simple fact that we have reevaluated the idea of healing powers given to items, and for no other reason. <br><br>Cassie_Unforgiven wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would love to see an official post from VI stating they will do exchanges and/or reset faction.]</i></font> <br><br>I can address the faction issue. There were/are alternate ways to get those items. The faction loss was a choice the player made to get the item one way rather than the other. We won't be changing any factions over this. <br><br>Exchanges (or perhaps just changing all existing instances of these items) are something that we are reevaluating. When we've come to a decision on what the replacement effect will be, we'll then decide about how to deal with existing items.</UL>

This is news to note for those <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">attempting to hand in a quest item</a>:<UL><I>I wanted to talk to all of you about the way turning in quest items works. We are thinking about making a change here, and I'd like to talk about it.<br><br>Let me set up a fictional example. Let's say that there is a quest NPC that gives out the final item for the quest in exchange for three other items. Currently, if you give the NPC two of the correct items and a third item that you think is the correct item but isn't, the NPC will take all of the items and give you nothing. This seems like a rude thing for the NPC to do.<br><br>Also, if someone has come along and given the NPC one of the three items before you arrive, and you give him the three correct items all at once he'll give you the quest result, but the person that gave the one item previously will get nothing (the NPC is, basically, letting you complete the transaction that he started).<br><br>Both of these situations cause someone to lose out. That's not something that we like.<br><br>We've been thinking about making a change to the way this whole turning in quest items thing works. The most reasonable and eloquent solution to this problem would be to simply have the NPC give the items back if they are not enough to complete the quest. This would mean that if you give him one item, he would give it back to you and tell you that he needs more than just that item to give you what you want. If you give him two correct items and an incorrect item, he would give the quest items back to you and tell you that you made a mistake (he might or might not give you back the mistaken item, depending on the technical ability to get him to do that).<br><br>This would fix a bunch of problems with questing. But, as you all have probably guessed, it would eliminate the ability to 'multi-quest'. We know that the whole concept of multi-questing is a touchy one.<br><br>So I have a question for you. Would eliminating the problems with losing quest items to NPCs be worth the loss of the ability to multi-quest?<br><br>Alan</I></UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">Click here</a> to jump to that thread.

Judging <br>by the foliage arranged atop it, Safka could only imagine that it was the <br>resting-place of the dragon herself. A series of ornate steps lead up to <br>smaller man sized platform some twelve paces or so above the main structure.<br><br>&#8220;That must be some form of audience area,&#8221; Safka guessed, &#8220;so that you can <br>speak to the dragon at it&#8217;s eye level.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Heh,&#8221; laughed Iste, &#8220;aye, I guess straining her neck to lean down to our <br>level might get a bit painful.&#8221;<br><br>The cleric smiled and nodded, &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t think she has had too many <br>visitors of late. Rumour of a place like this would spread like wildfire <br>amongst the adventurers of Norrath had any found it.&#8221;<br><br>A pair of the smaller dragons swooped down in a swift arc and landed before <br>them, immediately propping up on their hind legs and spreading their wings <br>to their full extension, barring their way any further down the path.<br><br>By now Iste was not surprised to find that they talked in common speak. Half <br>an hour before he might not have believed anyone who had told him of talking <br>dragons.<br><br>&#8220;Sssssstate your business.&#8221; Rasped the first of the dragons, pointing at <br>Safka with a curled claw.<br><br>&#8220;Your lady Gorenaire has invited us down to her home.&#8221; She explained bowing <br>serenely, and tugging Iste&#8217;s arm to make him bow as well.<br><br>The two dragons looked at each other briefly before the one that had <br>addressed them stepped forward.<br><br>&#8220;Invited you sssay?&#8221; it stated, looking them up and down, &#8220;ssstrange stature <br>of guests our lady seeks out today, bessst get to the audience podium then <br>you had. If you are lying ssshe will soon make dinner of you.&#8221;<br><br>The other dragon flapped its leather like wings excitedly. &#8220;Dinnerssss, yes <br>we have not eaten today, Elf tastes good from whats I remember.&#8221;<br><br>Safka gulped and looked at Iste<br><br>&#8220;Buts nothing to worry you if you are indeeds invited.&#8221; The first dragon <br>confirmed smirking, before turning to its brethren, &#8220;barbarian is too tough <br>though, not as sweet as the elf.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Well at least I would give them indigestion,&#8221; Iste leant over and whispered <br>to Safka.<br><br><br>* To read on visit us at <a href="http://safkaslore.webjump.com">http://safkaslore.webjump.com</a> *<br><br>Many Thanks<br><br>Safka Fairheart</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Safka! :)

For many of the same reasons that we made recent changes to the Donal's Breastplate, we are going to make some changes to these items with the next patch (which will be next week).<br><br>Existing instances of these Plane of Growth breastplates will have the casting time for Celestial Elixer increased to one minute.<br><br>No new instances of the Plane of Growth breastplates will occur (they will stop dropping).<br><br>In places where the Plane of Growth breastplates were being created (off of NPC corpses or as the result of quests) new breastplates will be created.<br><br>Basically, the existing breastplates are having their casting times increased and they won't be dropping anymore, new breastplates will take their place.<br><br>I'm sorry that these items are being changed so long after their introduction. But this is something that we feel needs to be done for the integrity of gameplay in EverQuest.<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

Muertos A`Todos sent in this event announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>Many ages ago, back when the Ogres lived on the land known as Faydwer in <br>lands taken from the Orc hoards, a great warrior step forward and created a <br>mighty kingdom.  This warlord&#8217;s name was Raknok and his empire was named <br>after him.<br><br>Several ages past and the fifth warlord of Raknok&#8217;s kingdom, Dagnor, began a <br>war on the Dwarven city of Kaladim.  Dagnor rallied all the Ogre forces <br>together and began a march onto the Dwarf Kingdom.  The great warlord&#8217;s army <br>assaulted every Dwarfish outpost and home between them and the city.  Now <br>this seemed like a good idea to rid as much land of the filthy little Dwarfs <br>as possible before the final battle at Kaladim, but the plan backfired.  <br>Dagnor&#8217;s raiding gave the Dwarfish King a chance to form they&#8217;re own army to <br>defend Kaladim from the Ogre onslaught approaching.  Sadly the Dwarf army <br>was able to advance and conquer over the powerful Ogres, with some aid from <br>the neighboring Elven Empire to the east.  The spot of this defeat was then <br>named after the warlord by the Dwarfs to mock the Ogres, Dagnor&#8217;s Cauldron.<br><br>The few Ogres that survived the war were forced to leave the land of Faydwer <br>and cross the Ocean of Tears to Antonica.  Here in the southern jungles of <br>Feerrott the Ogres built a new home and named it Oggok (which means Revenge <br>in the Ogre language for those of you that don&#8217;t speak Ogre). After all <br>these years the time has finally come for vengeance on the Dwarven Kingdom.  <br>How you ask?  The answer is simple; King Kazon Stormhammer (the current king <br>of Kaladim) will pay for what his ancestors did to the Ogres with his own <br>blood!<br><br>Commander Dervishh Dwarfslayer of Soldiers of Lost Souls is asking for all <br>Ogres and any other enemies of the Dwarfish race to unite to crush the <br>Kingdom of Kaladim and its king.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br>Server: Mithaniel Marr<br>What: Kaladim Raid<br>When: Saturday, March 10th, 6:00 P.M EST<br>Where: Meet at Butcherblock / Dagnor&#8217;s Cauldron zone<br>Who: All enemies of Kaladim<br>Sponsored by: Soldiers of Lost Souls<br>E-Mail class/level to soldiersoflostsouls@hotmail.com to sign up.

It might have been an improvement because of the way the skill worked, but reducing their cap would probably have upset people. <br><br>All that really matters now, though, is that it's pretty much the way we want it, and it's working great.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063452.html"><b>On Magical Death Item</b></a><br>Never heard of it. <br><br>And, well, maybe they were pulling your leg.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448.html"><b>New Producer's Letter</b></a><br>Ok, it wasn't actually written by the producer&#8230; but it's up anyhow. <br><br><a href="http://www.everquest.com/main/letter.jsp">Take a look by clicking here</a>.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-2.html"><b>Wizards and the Vision</b></a><br>Calvarro wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yes, we are making some positive changes to wizards.]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we are making some positive changes to wizards. <br><br>Alan <br><br>I'm not being flippant.

But that doesn't mean that there won't be new servers some time in the near future, just that there aren't any plans that I know of for one.

When the servers drop as they did today can we PLEASE get something posted on the system status/scheduled downtime page to inform us of what is going on?]</i></font> <br><br>That often depends on why they went down. Often the servers seem to go down because of ISP problems at one end or the other. We do our best to get a notice up. But for very short-term outages it's not always practical or useful to put up a notice. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9.

If the answer to 24 is Yes is your character above lvl 50?]</i></font> <br><br>I don't talk about my characters. I will not reveal level, class, race&#8230; none of that. Doing so, unless I could claim to have played all classes and all races to 60th level, would do nothing to improve my credibility. It would only serve to focus people on the facts of my class preferences and be a hindrance to conversation on nearly any topic. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 26. Are there plans to give the clerics a JOLT type spell in the next 2 months?]</i></font> <br><br>Not that I know of. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 27.

It seems unlikely to me, though. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  Are there plans to reduce the Spellbook med from lvl 35 to lvl 20 within the next 3 months?]</i></font> <br><br>Not that I know of. <br><br>Sorry, I don't follow restrictions like only yes or no. :)  They certainly don't make your questions easier to answer. Some of your questions just can't be answered with only a yes or no.

This is the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132.html">original post and Brad McQuaid's response</a> from a thread devoted to various community issues:<UL>They should just change things as they see appropriate. They should have invested the time and energy they put into these boards to have more people test the game actually IN-GAME.<br><br>It is THEIR game, they can make the rules however they want. Allowing the player base a forum to vent and suggest changes has actually decreased customer satisfaction. It looks good on paper, and is a tremendous effort to keep communication open, but it has been a failure. Yeah, they probably gleaned a little useful info off of these boards. But has it been worth the headaches? Have they gotten the return on the investment? NOW the customers perceive it is their RIGHT to mandate changes to VERANT's product. Of course we can just stop playing. If they never would have opened up this can of worms, players would just....PLAY. Of course we would get angry over issues or changes, but an open forum such as this amplifies dissatisfaction.<br>I know it is not quite right to compare other traditional games to EQ, but have you ever heard of a game or product manufacturer that goes through so much effort to solicit customer input? And 99% of these posts are negativem it seems.<br><br>I appreciate the effort, and I can imagine the meetings when they decided these boards were a good idea.<br><br>"Yes Alan, we will have a whole site dedicated to hearing our customer, and responding to their needs on an ongoing basis! Johnson, you work with Bradley and design it. That is the key to a long lasting MMPRPG people, real time customer feedback."<br>Maybe it has helped EQ to last longer. EQ has lasted a long time, and I bet will last a few years more. But they also have learned some very important lessons.<br><br>First, the majority of people in the world are selfish morons who are unable to see past the tip of their nose.<br><br>Second, soliciting input from this majority is a BIG DRAG and largely pointless. They end up spending days and hours and hours sifting through the unending load of crap and looking for a little gold.<br>And third, message board detail is NOT a fun assignment, but great for shuffling some poor schmuck into the limelight for 15 minutes. Wonder if just prior to reassigment here the next 'victim board moderator' goes home to his/her spouse all excited about their 'big break'? "Honey, this is big time, I am on the front line between our cutomers and the company. Man, I cant wait until Monday...this will really look good on a resume...I am really gonna change things there too"<br>Like I said the effort is appreciated, but the resource committment is misplaced.<br><br><same board moderator two weeks later><br>"Honey, nothing is WRONG, I just hate that place. I have been listening to people whine and cry all day on that @#$@ board, I dont need you whining now when I get home..." <br><br><b><i>Thanks for the feedback so far (excluding the x-files Aradune = Manglosh sillyness).<br><br>We will continue to read this thread very carefully.<br><br>I will say that if we do make a major change, we will still absolutely have a very real means by which our players can give us feedback. This board has been a huge resource for us (and hopefully many of you) -- many, many changes have been made because of ideas and feedback from this board, and so any change we might make cannot risk losing that feedback.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

George M. Scotto wrote the latest <a href="http://www.everquest.com/main/letter.jsp">Producer Letter</a> found on the official EQ site.  Customer Service and several policy updates were the main focus of this letter.  The big and most important points of the letter can be found in this excerpt:<UL>Communication will be the key and, naturally, it&#8217;s a two way street. Your concerns have been voiced to us, and we are responding. As you read this, several policies are in the process of being refined. Within the coming weeks, we will be posting several new policy FAQ&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/index.jsp.">http://www.everquest.com/support/index.jsp.</a> Our goal is to make it perfectly clear not only what we expect from you as player-citizens of Norrath, but also what you can count on from us here at Verant/SOE. <br><br>Our first step in response to players&#8217; concerns was posted recently. Our new and updated Naming Policy (<a href="http://www.everquest.com/support/naming.jsp">http://www.everquest.com/support/naming.jsp</a>) should hopefully be clearer, more consistent, and bring us even closer to a healthy role-playing environment. Subsequently, we will be conducting a thorough review of all current character names on all servers, including surnames and guild names. Names not necessarily in line with the updated Naming Policy will be evaluated and handled accordingly. </UL>Thanks Alan.
