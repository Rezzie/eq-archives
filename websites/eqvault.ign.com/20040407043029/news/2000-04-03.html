Is it REALLY true that 2/3 of the quests in the game are yet unfound, and there are 90 caster robes yet undiscovered?<BR>
<BR>
**No. There are quite a few, but not that many.<BR>
<BR>
Do you have plans to allow a command so pet classes can be told the level of their pets?<BR>
<BR>
**Probably not, no - can't you roughly determine it's level anyway?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will there ever be a message so we know if a rogue is trying to pickpocket when he claims he is not?<BR>
<BR>
**Interesting idea - we'll toss it around.<BR>
<BR>
Why haven't you answered questions based on the many stat tests players were told to perform by Verant? Specifically, when these test results were posted why didn't you make an appearance?<BR>
<BR>
**I believe Abashi has addressed the stat issue several times.<BR>
<BR>
Do you have an estimate on when or if the main storyline of EQ will have an even stronger affect on the players as a whole in the future? (GM Events, new quests introduced etc.)<BR>
<BR>
**I think this will happen over time as we do more GM Events and get more static quests in the game (which often reveal the history of the world).<BR>
<BR>
Humans in EverQuest. What is the Vision(tm) on them and what is their place in Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
**The intent was that they would be neither great nor poor at any one thing. They have the most flexibility when it comes to class selection. Their stats are fairly middle-of-the-road.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from RP, What do the players get from selecting Humans as their play choice (and getting mediocre stats and being night blind)?<BR>
<BR>
**More class selection and one of races on the lower end of the experience needed table.<BR>
<BR>
Abashi hinted that there were class equivalent or near equivalent weapons to the Fiery Avenger in EverQuest. Are there indeed weapons which we haven't found yet (hard to believe) which involve quests other than PoS alone (which can't be done until after the expansion).<BR>
<BR>
**There are a few very powerful unfound items, yes. Fiery Avenger status items, particle effects and all, are still coming for the other classes and will take us some time.<BR>
<BR>
I know you don't want to answer questions about the future, but how about some hints on these new melee skills? I'm getting quite jealous looking through the Kunark spell list in Castersrealm.<BR>
<BR>
**Can't say yet, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
What is this 'Vision' I keep hearing of. I have never heard from your words exactly what the 'Vision' was intended to be. Not a flame here, just a question.<BR>
<BR>
**It would probably take me pages to answer this properly, but in a nutshell here goes: to recapture and recreate the fun people had grouping together and going out on quests and adventure playing paper & pencil games in an online virtual world; to create a successful, fun, and popular graphical MUD.<BR>
<BR>
Can there be more Dynamic GM quests?<BR>
<BR>
**Indeed, and we hope to have more in the future.<BR>
<BR>
Why are JBOOTS, such an incredible item that it vastly imbalance the game in outdoor areas, still in the game? Shouldn't this item be made more available to everyone or just dropped?<BR>
<BR>
**We felt that after addressing the kiting issue some months ago, making it not as abusable, that Jboots no longer 'vastly imbalanced' the game.<BR>
<BR>
In all seriousness.. I don't know how specific this question is. but are dark elf clerics ever going to get any race and class specific quests?<BR>
<BR>
**I will ask about that.<BR>
<BR>
Why can't we bash with the Unicorn Shield? Any fix in the near future?<BR>
<BR>
**I believe the shield is more of a weapon - 'fixing' it implies it is broken in the first place, which I don't believe is accurate.<BR>
<BR>
Can someone please explain why the tests on stats are incorrect? Our tests show a negligible impact on melee ability with their use. Can you please post an example to demonstrate where we are going wrong in our testing?<BR>
<BR>
**Some stats certainly have more of a direct impact on the game than others. This is by design.<BR>
<BR>
Would it be possible to attach a server designation to each .opt file on our end so that when we play characters on different servers, it doesn't use the same global file for hotkey assignments? Whenever I play on another server, I have to redo my hotkeys every time because each char name has only one .opt file irregardless of the server.<BR>
<BR>
**It would be possible but would require a bit of programming and I'd probably prioritize it fairly low, but we'll see what we can do.<BR>
<BR>
In the expansion, will there be any new classes available for any of the existing races? i.e. like having Halfling bards or rangers? (its a long shot I know but I had to try hehe)<BR>
<BR>
**No, just the new race.<BR>
<BR>
Server crashes, item and exp loss from hardware failure at Verant -- why is the burden on the players and not on Verant when this happens?<BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. Both players and Verant are burdened when there is data loss and neither of them are happy about such occurrences.<BR>
<BR>
Are more relaxed item and exp reimbursement policies planned?<BR>
<BR>
**Not in general, no.<BR>
<BR>
Are monetary compensations like free 1 month playtime for affected players feasible?<BR>
<BR>
**No, data loss, albeit rare, is unavoidable at times. Compensation as you describe would indeed not e feasible.<BR>
<BR>
Why would a mob that is obviously far, far tougher than the con system have you believe actually be low blue. i.e.: why is that guard that just kicked my ass not yellow or even?<BR>
<BR>
**The higher level you get, the more we expect you to be grouping. The 'con' system assumes, over time, that you are grouping more and more - it does not necessarily assume you are alone. Also, the color is an indication of the experience you will receive from killing the NPC, while the text is supposed to indicate difficulty.<BR>
<BR>
Why are there very few mobs in outdoor zones for people 40+ (aside from the nasty sorts like sea furies, etc...) is this to slow people down once they get to level 40+?<BR>
<BR>
**While we'd like people to group more and more and to enter dungeons and such at higher levels, we do agree that higher level outdoor areas are needed and you will see several in Kunark, including a 40+ outdoor zone.<BR>
<BR>
Will shaman ever be able to shrink in outdoor areas? i.e. to fit in the bank in Kelethin<BR>
<BR>
**Unlikely. There are supposed to be size penalties in the game, depending on the race you've chosen for your character. Over time, we've implemented more and more ways to overcome the size restriction and I think we've gone far enough.<BR>
<BR>
What will it take for you to admit there may be need to change the Vision(tm)?<BR>
<BR>
**Whenever something doesn't turn out the way we wanted, or whenever it did but the desired effect failed to occur, we adjust the VisionTM (if it's possible to do so). The VisionTM is both pure in its idealistic form and flexible when it comes to what really works and doesn't work.<BR>
<BR>
EQ tuning is not by mob rule, I agree; but 99% of your customer base are up in arms over the melee class bind issues (or lack thereof). What will it take to break such an inflexible vision(tm).<BR>
<BR>
**I definitely think your 99% number is greatly exaggerated. Changing binding would change the pace of the game for both melee and caster classes. It would also lessen the death penalty. We've no intention of changing the binding rules.<BR>
<BR>
When is the HOLE going to open?<BR>
<BR>
**The Hole will open when we're done with it, which should be sometime in May, we hope.<BR>
<BR>
I think one of the craziest ideas I have ever had was to develop some kind of in-zone game you can play that involves a ball or spell aura that you pass around. Sort of a PvP event but I'm just talking crazy here..... would be great for guild wars. People need something like that to break from the norm, guess you could call it a mini-game.<BR>
<BR>
**There are no plans currently to implement those sorts of mini-games.<BR>
<BR>
What new skills will warriors get in the expansion?<BR>
<BR>
**Can't say yet, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Will the skill caps be raised with the expansion?<BR>
<BR>
**Some will, yes.<BR>
<BR>
Why do the gnome guards in Steamfont punch me for 106hp but when armed they would only be hitting in the 60's?<BR>
<BR>
**Guards are often very nasty, highly trained individuals that excel in combat far above and beyond the average create in Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
I have a question of the vision, well sort of, to encourage more player interaction, why did you allow 8 slots? Why not limit it to one slot per server? I think that would have helped a lot of the issues we hear about now if that had been from the get go.<BR>
<BR>
**When designing EQ we had NO idea if we'd even have close to 8 servers. The fact that we're at 28 now is mind-blowing. So with 12 races and 14 classes, we wanted to make sure players would have a chance to experience at least most of the race/class combos, so we made it such that a player can have 8 characters per server.<BR>
<BR>
Also, can you expand a bit on why you don't like archery or throwing weapons to be a viable class weapon?<BR>
<BR>
**EQ was designed to be a melee & magic based game. There is a reason in real life that humanity switched over to range weapons when the technology was developed to make them a reality: they're better. It's almost always better to shoot at somebody from the distance than it is to get up close and dirty. Knowing this, and knowing we wanted melee combat to be integral to EQ, we designed archery and other forms of ranged combat to be secondary in terms of how effective it is.<BR>
<BR>
What are your 5 favorite musical groups?<BR>
<BR>
**Fates Warning, Dream Theater, Psychotic Waltz, Enchant, and Yngwie Malmsteen.<BR>
<BR>
What do melee stats do?<BR>
<BR>
**Affect the outcome of melee to varying degrees.<BR>
<BR>
IF poison is spell code why is the overhaul taking so long. i.e. just up the dmg on them and give the vials charges, poison fixed.<BR>
<BR>
**We don't want a simple fix, we really want to do it right.<BR>
<BR>
I heard a rumor some time ago about an EQ movie, some company that was working with final fantasy the movie I think.... but any truth to this?<BR>
<BR>
**I hear the same rumors you do, but am unable to confirm or deny at this point. It's not something that Verant is involved in.<BR>
<BR>
The simplest solution is to nerf but is that the right solution?<BR>
<BR>
**Sometimes it is, yes. More complicated solutions, like enhancing every other class and then upping the difficulty level of the game to compensate, are very time consuming and prone to error.<BR>
<BR>
Why is it in almost all cases of gameplay tuning that you "nerf" class / race abilities and spells?<BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question (and we don't).<BR>
<BR>
The average player impression is that there are way more nerfs happening than there are class/race enhancements. So much so that we get very paranoid on very patch and lose all sense humor during April 1.<BR>
<BR>
**I don't think that's true, and with all due respect I don't think you speak for the 'average player'.<BR>
<BR>
When you created EQ, were you able to include the Entire Vision, and is this expansion and all *possible* future expansions an expansion of the vision? Or were you only able to program a very small portion of the realm you envisioned?<BR>
<BR>
**We accomplished a great deal of our Vision for both gameplay and world creation, but yeah, there's a TON of stuff we'd like to do in the future. I think the long, long term goals of MMORPGs is to create holodeck technology, and, well, we have a long way to go J<BR>
<BR>
What is the Vision as regards removing/replacing/rotating items in EQ?<BR>
<BR>
**We need to do it more often. One of the reasons, I think, that people get so upset when we alter the status quo is that they're used to things staying the same. If the treasure in dungeons was removed, rotated, and replaced more often not only would the game be better in terms of discovery and exploration but also people wouldn't be so upset when something did change.<BR>
<BR>
Could you give us an example of a bug fix/feature that was implemented via suggestions and logs sent in through /feedback and /bug?<BR>
<BR>
**Feature: Messages letting the party know a member went link dead.<BR>
**Bug Fix: Randomly twirling around when using the /follow command.<BR>
<BR>
Is there any place we can go to find out what quests are broken?<BR>
<BR>
**Not really, no. The problem there is that it would require listing the quests, which we don't want to do because we don't want to post spoilers.<BR>
<BR>
Where you as pissed as I was when you found out you weren't selected for beta testing Diablo II?<BR>
<BR>
**Who said I wasn't already in the Diablo II beta? J<BR>
<BR>
Player disruption seems to be the major factor in GM quests not working well. Are there any plans to address this issue? If so, could elaborate on what those plans are I would appreciate it.<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, and there are a couple of ways to make it better. First, involve less people and announce events less. Second, create a storyline in which players who try to disrupt aren't rewarded (perhaps even penalized). Third, flat out make it against the rules to try to screw up and disrupt a GM event and discipline accordingly (this is obviously the most controversial of the plans, and we're still tossing the idea around).<BR>
<BR>
Can we look forward to more higher level class and race specific quests (sort of like the Paineel ones) being added to existing cities relatively soon?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, depending on your definition of 'relatively soon'.<BR>
<BR>
Will the Expansion CD contain a few fixes to things considered to be too big to download, say like the barbarian shield issue?<BR>
<BR>
**As a matter of fact, yes. The barbarian shield problem should be fixed via the Expansion, and other similar problems can hopefully be addressed in the future thanks to some new coding we've worked on that should allow us to fix some of those problems sans a huge download.<BR>
<BR>
Is the wizard class the way you envisioned it in group usefulness and effectiveness not in regards to paper stats but in in-game real-time situations of level 50 players? If the answer is no, will it ever be?<BR>
<BR>
**Roughly, yes. They're not perfect, but then neither is any other class, nor the game for that matter.<BR>
<BR>
I have read (not sure if it is real) that you requested GZ to do some tests on the class for in-game time Vs Damage compared to other classes is this true?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, he's agreed to run some tests after he's finished working on new spells for the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
Stats in EQ and why the stonewall from Verant? Why are stats details (like how they affect/enhance the character you create) veiled in such secrecy?<BR>
<BR>
**Because we feel revealing the inner working of stats and other core game mechanics spoil much of the game.<BR>
<BR>
Is it that they do not work in any measurable degree and are broken?<BR>
<BR>
**No, they are not broken. Yes, some stats have a more measurable and direct influence on the game than others. This is by design.<BR>
<BR>
Is the game manual misleading in its description of char stats?<BR>
<BR>
**Unfortunately, it is inaccurate in some aspects, yes.<BR>
<BR>
Do you believe druids to be currently balanced as a class, or are they overpowered in your estimation? If not, do you have any future nerfs for this class under consideration?<BR>
<BR>
**We feel they are fairly balanced at this point.<BR>
<BR>
What does the 'MAGIC ITEM' tag really mean? For boots and gloves and shoulder pieces it means you can kick, punch, and slam magically, and rogues cant pickpocket it. I always thought it meant the item had stats, but a few things like the molten cloak have stats but aren't magic.<BR>
<BR>
**Generically, it means that it's special treasure and not mundane. Beyond that, it can also mean being able to hit 'magic' creatures, as you described.<BR>
<BR>
Why doesn't Dead Man Floating (level 44 necro spell) work in Kedge Keep? This is the perfect use for it but you can't cast it inside.<BR>
<BR>
**I'm pretty sure that's a bug and on our bug list.<BR>
<BR>
Why does a person's health go down when they go link dead? It seems like it drops to their unbuffed hps and then comes back up when they come back. Always thought this was strange and just wondered.<BR>
<BR>
**When you become link dead the server takes control of your character and you are in many ways an NPC and treated as such.<BR>
<BR>
Why can't you automatically meditate? Why do you have to push the button every time for it to work? Is there any chance it could be changed to default on? Because I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to be medding if they had the skill.<BR>
<BR>
**Good question - we'll think on it.<BR>
<BR>
Why isn't run on by default? I don't know anyone who walks through EverQuest.<BR>
<BR>
**Another good question - we'll think on it.<BR>
<BR>
Can you fix pronouns in emotes? For example if you type /drool without anyone targeted it says ' drools -- something must have $#%&^%$ excited!'<BR>
<BR>
**I'd like to, yes, but it would be fairly low priority.<BR>
<BR>
Can you get faction without getting a faction message<BR>
<BR>
**I don't believe so, no.<BR>
<BR>
Why can't I remove one item from a bag in the bank, instead of having to remove the entire bag?<BR>
<BR>
**That's simply a feature we never coded - I'm certainly not against such functionality, but would probably prioritize it fairly low.<BR>
<BR>
Why is it that we (Paladin) are only given slow (but good, not complaining about QUALITY) weapons? (e.g., why make FA 34/44, but not 17/22?)<BR>
<BR>
**I don't know if that's true across the board, but it's probably true that our vision of a Paladin is a mighty knight, clad in plate armor, wielding a really, really big sword.<BR>
<BR>
If faeries are a good race, why is it that paladin's killing them seems to be appropriate to Verant (e.g., Ro armor quest, FA quest, Princess Lenya quest)?<BR>
<BR>
**Many Paladin quests are set up to create a moral dilemma for the Paladin who RP's.<BR>
<BR>
How would you rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the variation in new graphics for the Expansion? You know what I mean, will there be a multitude of new robes for casters, armor for fighters, etc. or are you following a similar routine as with the class specific quests: i.e., will it look like plate mail but basically just have a different color tint to it.<BR>
<BR>
**Most of our effort went into creating new zones to explore, not creating a ton of new item graphics. We are planning on adding some though.<BR>
<BR>
One more question off topic Brad -- have you and Hook raced your cars yet? Who would/did win?<BR>
<BR>
**He won't go to a real track with me, and I sure as heck wouldn't drag race him.<BR>
<BR>
Why are basic fundamentals of character creation, such as stats and exp tables, not given clearer information on?<BR>
<BR>
**To preserve a sense of mystery and exploration in the game.<BR>
<BR>
Why was poison nerfed so HORRIBLY with a 7 second apply time "in anticipation of an upgrade" almost a month ago, and yet poison is not slated to get work until after expansion?<BR>
<BR>
**We'd hoped to have the Poison upgrade complete by now, but were delayed by the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
Why has GZ been allowed to discuss at length what stats do for casters, but no such information has been given to melee classes?<BR>
<BR>
**In hindsight GZ would probably agree with me that he's revealed too much over time.<BR>
<BR>
What level is you ranger at, Brad?<BR>
<BR>
**In his mid 20s - I just haven't been able to play as much, and when I do it's usually using test characters on Kunark L<BR>
<BR>
Do you think having ONLY static encounters with static mobs as the method of loot distribution may have been a mistake? i.e. 'we should have had more loot dispersal methods to begin with"<BR>
<BR>
**Probably, yes, to a point. We are experimenting with more randomization of loot in the Expansion and I hope it works out. That said, I remain against total randomization of loot in that one loses the ability to provide context for an item (e.g. the Iron Crown of the Fire Giant Warlord should probably be found on the corpse of the Fire Giant Warlord).<BR>
<BR>
Would it be possible to allow Rangers to target track? i.e. type /track hill giant and they track nearest HG.<BR>
<BR>
**That would be a neat enhancement. We do want to enhance tracking in the future, but have no short term plans to do so.<BR>
<BR>
What was the original vision for the rogue, and what is the vision for the rogue now?<BR>
<BR>
**The original version included their ability to detect and disarm traps, but it turned out we couldn't get traps working correctly with our engine such that they were truly a challenge and hindrance. Also, upon reflection, we should have had more locked doors and therefore more interdependence between rogues and other classes when dungeon adventuring. We hope to address the latter issue in the Expansion, but traps just aren't really doable. So, in a nutshell, our vision for Rogues has changed somewhat, but we feel they will continue to improve in the future.<BR>
<BR>
I don't understand Verant's Concept of good and evil in EQ, and am often baffled by certain quests. What races are good, and what races are evil? (I mean orc, fairies, fish, etc..not elfs, humans....)<BR>
<BR>
**Morality is supposed to be more relative than absolute in the world of Norrath, hence the faction system as opposed to a more simplistic alignment system.<BR>
<BR>
Do you think EQ has evolved into more of a straight hack-n-slash than an RPG? I personally know many players who feel the game mechanics themselves actively discourage role-playing.<BR>
<BR>
**No. EQ was always supposed to be a more adventure oriented RPG. Role-playing, in our opinion, is up to the player, and we feel we've provided many tools to help the player role-play.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any plans to add quest-able Armour sets for the monk and druid classes?<BR>
<BR>
**Rough, general plans, but nothing specific that I could announce.<BR>
<BR>
EverQuest gameplay and the need for secrecy. How do we know if it's a bug and not a feature?<BR>
<BR>
**You can't always, but usually it's fairly clear. Typically, anything that gives a player a significant and unbalancing advantage in terms of advancement is a bug and not a feature.<BR>
<BR>
Any changes at all to Alchemy planned?<BR>
<BR>
**We're pretty happy with Alchemy as of this last upgrade and have no short term plans to upgrade that particular trade skill.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to hear what the original "vision" of character stats was, and in what ways the current implementation varies from the original vision, and *what* the current implementation is?<BR>
<BR>
**I think the original vision was that the stats that currently affect the game less would do so more. But it didn't turn out that way as we balanced and as the game evolved during beta, and it would require very unbalancing and major changes to make them 'matter more'. The current implementation is that some stats affect the game significantly moreso than others. This is by design.<BR>

<BR>
What is the high-level view of the current state of the player run economy: specifically trade skills and their usefulness, and the affects of twinking on the economy?<BR>
<BR>
**Trade skills, by their nature, need to be updated periodically in a deflationary player run economy (and it is our intent to do those updates). Twinking is also part of the economy and it accelerates the deflation, but can still be controlled by adding more to the game (better weapons, harder monsters, etc.). It can also be controlled to a point with no-drop items.<BR>
<BR>
What are the current efforts to deal with bug reporting? I think a bug tracking system with a web front end would go a long way to easing some tension in the player community. Flaming on the message boards is out of hand because it is perceived that this is the best conduit for feedback. I would suggest a bug tracking system that deals with technical *and* gameplay bugs. (for an example of a similar system see:<BR>
http://bugreport.apple.com)<BR>
<BR>
**The combination of the /bug feature as well as in-game player feedback and feedback from message boards has proved to be very effective in terms of us finding out about bugs. It's certainly more of a challenge to isolate and get them all fixed than it is often to identify them.<BR>
<BR>
If you have been involved in the rogue tuning meetings, can you comment on poison being added as a one time proc per poison vial (or whatever form it is going to take) in DD or DoT form, or something completely different?<BR>
<BR>
**I cannot yet announce the inner-workings of our poison upgrade because we're not done with it.<BR>
<BR>
Why do paladins get a quality non planar 1hs weapon (ghoulbane) mid to low level, and sk's do not? Not enough people playing sk's to waste the time creating the item? I have heard that a 1hs is going to be put in for sk's that is of similar quality to gb any eta on that?<BR>
<BR>
**I'm not going to address that specifically, but rather just say that all sorts of class specific weapons are on their way into the game, especially via the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
About EverQuest the game. If you had to do it all over again and start with a clean sheet of paper knowing what you know now, what would you do differently?<BR>
<BR>
**Wow. No way I could answer that in just a few sentences, sorry. I'll say this - the game is certainly not without its flaws and we plan on making EQ better and better in the future, whether it be in the form of expansions or sequels.<BR>
<BR>
I've heard a rumor about a dynamic quest team being implemented to only run dynamic quests.<BR>
Any truth and if so what type of time frame do you see them starting?<BR>
<BR>
**We already have a team similar to what you describe, and we plan on adding more people to that team. We definitely want to see more dynamic quests and events and know our players do to.<BR>
<BR>
Why are player concerns on Wizards dismissed out of hand? (too long to go into detail but there are posts 300+ messages long)<BR>
<BR>
**They're not - we've posted several times in regards to those issues, and even announced that GZ would run some tests after he was done with the Expansion spell implementation and testing.<BR>
<BR>
How do you expect Rogues to be a viable class in EQ when they come with such a horrible group unfriendly skills like PP?<BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. They are already a viable class in our opinion. As for PP, Rogues are Rogues... they're thieves, they're assassins... earning trust from other players as a Rogue is supposed to be more challenging.<BR>
<BR>
Is a "second loot pool" feature for rogue's PP a viable idea in the future?<BR>
<BR>
**No, no plans to do that.<BR>
<BR>
Is it a bug or a feature that hybrids get less mana per wis/int from wis/int items than they do from their base wis/int?<BR>
<BR>
**Don't know - I'll ask Abashi to look into it.<BR>
<BR>
Also, why is it that hybrids get less mana than stated from mana items? ( i.e., 0-10 mana from a +25 mana item)<BR>
<BR>
**See Above.<BR>
<BR>
What do you think of the idea of allowing Shaman to forage for the herbs used in alchemy instead of purchasing them from a vendor? Would be a more realistic idea from a role-play standpoint as I don't think any self respecting Shaman ever bought their herbs at the local quickie mart.......<BR>
<BR>
**Kind of a neat idea - we'll toss it around.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any plans to make more "crafted" items from the trade skills needed to complete quests?<BR>
Much like banded is already required for totemic armor, could there be a quest out there that needs a forged weapon?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, but no short term plans.<BR>
<BR>
Druid quests... can we get more? We kind of get tired of doing class armor quests for the other classes (two edged question there sorry)<BR>
<BR>
**I think you'll see more and more class specific quests in general in the future.<BR>
<BR>
Will hate and fear planes ever be changed to something more along the lines of air plane or killing the fire giants to allow high level groups to progress a certain amount based on the time they have available or will new areas in the expansion be structured in a similar fashion? examples: safe zone in points, removing roamers from hate so everything is on the same spawn to allow an even progression through the zone. After all, almost no-one ever really gets to see or enjoy the zone except for pullers or scouts.<BR>
<BR>
**The planes are supposed to have a different feel and difficulty level relative to most zones. They are also supposed to often require more of a time investment from the players.<BR>
<BR>
Why is it the stats of the guards throughout Norrath have not changed to either<BR>
a. more like Paineel guards to stop the High level farming of guard exp.<BR>
b. guards are made to be casters like clerics and shamans. I would think twice before I would attack something that could heal and cast blindness and/or a dot...<BR>
<BR>
**We've slowly but surely been upgrading guards for the very reasons you state.<BR>
<BR>
Why is that a lose of equipment due to a hardware malfunction... i.e. a Crash of the server cause people to wait for weeks to hope to get the item back and be required to /petition at least 3 times a week...<BR>
<BR>
**It often takes time to verify item loss and to search the logs that we do have. That said, it shouldn't take as long as you describe and I hope we can increase the responsiveness of our customer service team in the future by adding more people.<BR>
<BR>
Why is it after spending 1 week in hate (7 days) one piece of enchanter gear was dropped yet several pieces for the other classes, yes in the teens. And, how is this fair to even the loot being dropped per class.<BR>
<BR>
**I'm pretty sure we've made some adjustments to Hate recently and that players on the Test server are reporting things are much better.<BR>
<BR>
I know that every person wants "enhancements" for their primary class, and this is not regarding any particular class 8o), but why is it that certain spells do not work in the planes for certain classes?<BR>
<BR>
**Planes are special places, and supposed to offer special challenges as well as some unique tactics to conquer. We reserve the right to have all sorts of spells either not work or do strange things in the alternate planes.<BR>
<BR>
Have we all driven you mad yet with our inquiries?<BR>
<BR>
**I'm getting there, thanks J<BR>
<BR>
Can you speak on the possibility of Rallos Zek adopting the Vallon Zek or Tallon Zek PvP loot rules?<BR>
<BR>
**No plans at this point to do that, no.<BR>
<BR>
Why do hybrids get an xp penalty if they are balanced without it?<BR>
<BR>
**Hybrids are generally more flexible classes, able to melee as well as cast spells. In order to maintain balance, we decided to compensate for their extra flexibility and often power by requiring them more experience points in order to level.<BR>
<BR>
What are the general pros and cons you have seen with the implemented EverQuest class system?<BR>
<BR>
**I have been and continue to be a huge believer in class systems for MMORPGs. They encourage interdependence, which leads to a more social environment - people are heavily encouraged to work together and often forge friendships and alliances over time. The only con that comes to mind is that some players appear to be eternally envious of the fact that they can do some things with their class, but not everything.<BR>
<BR>
It seems like the good majority of complaints fed to Verant are related to player's beliefs of perceived class imbalances. Has it ever made you consider a different way to handle how characters are defined? Perhaps a more complex method that gives the players more control over their character while still maintaining game balance?<BR>
<BR>
**Perhaps. More flexibility in general is a good thing, but you'll never play an EverQuest that doesn't have some sort of class based system.<BR>
<BR>
Why are there so many broken quests in a game called EverQuest?<BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. I don't think there are that many. There are some, and we try to fix them. But we are also constantly adding new content and quests. With human error, that means we will inevitably add more broken quests as the game evolves.<BR>
<BR>
Why not run 4 dynamic quests all at the same time in 4 remote locations. They would go a lot smoother =P<BR>
<BR>
**Great idea. It just requires more manpower (here's hoping that, over time, given such a successful game, we'll get more).<BR>
<BR>
Good Lord! -- Why are you working on a Sunday?!?<BR>
<BR>
**Heh, good question. I think that even though I know that the vast majority of players love EQ and that the number of people who bitterly post on these boards is very small, that it still bugs me to hear false claims and allegations about Verant and our game. Some people say we don't care, or that we don't listen, or that we don't respect our customers. I've always been a person that is bothered by people believing things that aren't true about me (or my company, whom I represent). I also know that for every poster there are probably 10 or even 100 'lurkers' who just read boards, and I know that they appreciate when we post. Heck, whenever I do I see new names either post or email me, thanking me for the extra info. So I do what I can, and today it occurred to me to try to answer as many questions about the game as I could.<BR>
<BR>
Whenever your inventory is full, and you have a stackable item in there, and you go to loot another stackable item of the same type, it says your inventory is full. So you have to manually pick it up and place it there. This is really quite annoying. Any chance of getting it fixed?<BR>
<BR>
**No short term plans, no, but I'd love to see that addressed one day.<BR>
<BR>
Why does it take 2 months to patch data? Why is the time interval in-between data patches (whatever that means) take over a month. Why is it when a response like "next patch it will be done" really means "next DATA patch" and not clearly stated "which will happen in over a month"<BR>
<BR>
**It doesn't always, but it certainly does take some time. Patching data can often be the most dangerous type of patch, because it's so easy to miss bugs, exploits, and other similar problems. So whenever we add a bunch of data to the game, we try to test it for a longer period of time. Also, moving data over from our test environment to the live servers takes more time than just moving code. Sometimes, when we've had a decent amount of downtime, for whatever reason, we are hesitant to move data over and have delayed the process in the past.<BR>
<BR>
**Can you give wood elves the /lapdance emotes (yes with animation)?<BR>
<BR>
**Hehe, no comment :)<BR>
<BR>
A Rogue cannot evade when the only other thing attacking the creature is a pet. Is this intentional? Why isn't the creature considering the pet a valid target to attack if a Rogue evades?<BR>
<BR>
**I'm not positive, but I think the skill was intended to work in a group situation, and that we assume there are other characters attacking the target.<BR>
<BR>
Why aren't most items that have charged effects rechargeable?<BR>
<BR>
**Because having items with charged effects allow us to place items into the game that would be too powerful were the charges infinite and/or rechargeable. That said, it does indeed make sense to have some charged effects items rechargeable and I think you'll see more in the future.<BR>
<BR>
Are you ever going to reimplement fear and charm back into PVP? If not, why?<BR>
<BR>
**I sincerely doubt it - the problems both of those spells caused became such a customer service nightmare that we took them out. And when we thought long and hard as to how we could re-implement them without creating additional problems, we couldn't think of a way.<BR>
<BR>
When will we expect to see new improvements to Tinkering? Right now there are only a handful of marginally useful items to be made with it.<BR>
<BR>
**Tinkering has a planned upgrade after we get the Poison upgrade in.<BR>
<BR>
Will the new zones that you are creating post-ROK look like the new and improved graphics or will they have to be compatible with the old graphics engine.<BR>
<BR>
**They will have the new and improved graphics.<BR>
<BR>
Will the old areas ever be redrawn to take advantage of better graphics cards.<BR>
<BR>
**No, we won't be doing this. We'd have to recreate the old zones from scratch in order to do this effectively, and we'd rather allocate those resources (game designers/world builders) to creating new content.<BR>
<BR>
What is being done to stop showeq users and does Verant/Sony consider using it a violation of copyright laws or any other laws?<BR>
<BR>
**We are occasionally introducing problems for showeq, breaking it with patches. This typically slows down the distribution of the program, but we've yet to devise a way to eliminate the program. Overall, it's not really that detrimental of an advantage to run the program.<BR>
<BR>
Heheh... wonder if Brad is regretting this idea yet=)<BR>
<BR>
**Getting a bit tired, yeah J<BR>
<BR>
Religion... currently all its good for is getting oneself killed. Are there any plans to ever give people a benefit to having a religion? Say, quests limited to people only of a certain religion, for instance.<BR>
<BR>
**Not quests, but we're thinking about making it such that certain items may only be wielded/used by characters who follow certain god(s).<BR>
<BR>
Does EQ Dev team feel that Magician class is fairly well balanced in levels 50 - 60? What's magicians role in EQ?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, we feel the Magician is in pretty good shape. For a good description of the class, please see www.everquest.com<BR>
<BR>
What is the underlying policy behind a nerf or enhancement to a class? Is it the "power" of the class? The desirability of the class (e.g. As expressed by player population)? The dependencies of the class?<BR>
<BR>
**We nerf when we feel it's the best way to address something that isn't balanced and/or that's not working out the way we'd planned. We don't like doing nerfs, and realize it is upsetting to some of our players.<BR>
<BR>
My main concern now is with dependencies. Is it Verant's intention to balance classes with respect to dependencies? It's good to have classes that each need each other, but if there are classes that need others that don't need them, would that be cause for tuning?<BR>
<BR>
**In a sense, yes. Interdependence is key to EverQuest and has always been. Classes should need each other, and some classes should need other classes more than others (i.e. some race/class combos are better for soloing than others). This is all by design.<BR>
<BR>
What use does minor illusion have on a non-pvp server where most mobs see right through it? (don't get me started on how sneaky and useful it is on a pvp server)<BR>
<BR>
**This is probably something GZ should answer.<BR>
<BR>
Why doesn't the tree illusion give the same regen effect that tree form gives to druids?<BR>
<BR>
**Another GZ question.<BR>
<BR>
Why is it that monks wearing magic gloves can hit magical creates but a spell caster wearing magical gloves gets the INVULNERABLE message(this may apply to all other classes...just don't know)?<BR>
<BR>
**Monks, being reliant on their fists, are able to use the magic in the gloves to their advantage.<BR>
<BR>
Why can't stealthy classes with high enough sneak ability, sneak anywhere? Don't we remember that historical Halfling that burgled a cup from a dragon?<BR>
<BR>
**Actually, you could get pretty much anywhere in beta with sneaking/hiding/invis. We changed it because it was simply unbalanced - players could map out dangerous areas without risk. I also think the One Ring that allowed Bilbo to recon Smaug's Lair was probably an artifact level item J<BR>
<BR>
Is there a possibility of Battle-Mage class or Ogre Mages(there is an ogre paladin in East Freeport)?<BR>
<BR>
**No plans for additional classes, no.<BR>
<BR>
Any chance that ALL ae spells can be given the NON-PARTY effect like bard songs?<BR>
<BR>
**Doubt it, but that's probably one for GZ.<BR>
<BR>
Is Verant trying to find a way to adjust the clipping plane for spells that are suppose to increase sight range? In their current state these spells are rarely used.<BR>
<BR>
**Turns out we'd rather just let everyone see farther if their machines can handle it.<BR>
<BR>
**Is Verant considering making Wizards more group friendly. When I am making a group level 20 and above Wizards are my last pick.<BR>
<BR>
Loaded question. I think Wizards are group friendly.<BR>
<BR>
Will Enchanters get an Illusion Iksar? I hope so.<BR>
<BR>
**Can't say, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
I know you are sick of this one. Any idea how the Iksar will fit in on Tallon or Vallon yet?<BR>
<BR>
**On the Troll, Ogre, Dark Elf team, those evil bastards! J<BR>
<BR>
In your vision, what are Bards supposed to be the masters of?<BR>
<BR>
**Song and dance.<BR>
<BR>
Will reported broken quests be repaired? (some have been broken for months and have been /bug, petition and email reported)<BR>
<BR>
**I certainly hope so, eventually. We fix them all the time.<BR>
<BR>
To whom do I report game bugs (broken programming)?<BR>
<BR>
**Please use the /bug command.<BR>
<BR>
Will reported game bugs be repaired? (some have been broken since beta and have been /bug, /petition and email reported)<BR>
<BR>
**I certainly hope so, eventually. We fix them all the time.<BR>
<BR>
What will you do to help Melee classes in the expansion? Items are nice but with all the caster classes getting 20 spells or so do you think Maybe they will give some new Combat skills or abilities more than maybe just the 2 that the rumor is.<BR>
<BR>
**I can't answer specifically yet, sorry, but we've got some pretty cool things planned (and in testing now).<BR>
<BR>
How much do you plan to have pathing improved for EQ? Will we ever see a situation where mobs take the most direct route between point a and point b in an open area rather than zigzagging? If not, will we see drastically improved pathing in EQ 2.0?<BR>
<BR>
**We continue to enhance pathing here and there (we've hopefully fixed one of the bugs related to disappearing mobs recently). That said, the way pathing works in general isn't like to change in this incarnation of EQ.<BR>
<BR>
Is it possible to make a command like /bag head arm chest ect. for pvp servers, this would make it harder of naked pk's to make a profit pk'ing when people can hotekey all their armor.<BR>
<BR>
**We've heard this idea several times, and like it in general. It would, however, require quite a bit of work to implement and we don't plan on it short term.<BR>
<BR>
Are there "legendary item" (aka fiery avenger) yet to be found via quest?<BR>
<BR>
**The Fiery Avenger has been found. There are currently no other FA-type items in the game for the other classes, but it is our intent to add them over time.<BR>
<BR>
Are some quests only initiated if you hail or talk to a NPC in his native or non-common languages?<BR>
<BR>
**I don't think so, no, but I certainly think that would be cool.<BR>
<BR>
Are there plans to put in Player controlled NPC's for quests/storyline enhancement? Perhaps they could be attained through a "guide-like" application system and follow a ongoing script written by Verant's quest/ history developers. Not guides as they are too busy with customer complaints.<BR>
<BR>
**No plans, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Is anything in the works to explain better the history of Norrath other than picking up bits and piece's in quests, both on the God level and within the day-to-day goings-on of Norrath. UO's town criers and GM controlled in game news boards come to mind.<BR>
<BR>
**Those are great ideas, and we hope to do something like that in the future, time and resources permitting.<BR>
<BR>
Noticing a lot of people are complaining of lag and Zone disconnects, is it possible this is due to the security elements you have put in place since you are changing things around often to keep programs like ShowEQ from working. Seems a lot of these complaints peaked after you started thwarting programs like ShowEQ and other hack programs.<BR>
<BR>
**No, no relationship at all. We wouldn't do anything to stop showeq that would jeopardize our playerbase.<BR>
<BR>
When is the next new non-split server going to come up?<BR>
<BR>
**We hope before the Expansion launches - that's the plan, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Kunark: What are you and the team generally shooting for when you're thinking of moving characters from being able to level from 50 to 60? I.e. comparative power to famous mobs? Would this be considered a "crowning" level with a very powerful new ability for each, or just an upgrade of 10 levels?<BR>
<BR>
**Probably somewhere in-between. A level 60 player is certainly more powerful than a level 50 player, so much so that we feel it will be very attractive to keep playing beyond 50. That said, level 60 players are still going to get beat on pretty hard in the depths of higher level dungeons.<BR>
<BR>
You're going to revamp existing unused dungeons (Runneyeye, Kerra ridge) so people will go there - what is the basic scheme in which you plan to go about this?<BR>
<BR>
**Primarily more and better loot, some of which may come from existing dungeons, and some of which might be new.<BR>
<BR>
I'm concerned that by playing on an older server I'm going to eventually reach a level where there's nothing I can fight because everything is camped solid. What is being done about this?<BR>
<BR>
**We're launching the Expansion which will increase the size of the world by over 33%. We are revamping existing dungeons to make them more attractive. And we intend to keep expanding the world after the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
How's Star Wars Online shaping up? (I suspect we'll be unable to play Jedi or own/use ships. Any comment?)<BR>
<BR>
**Can't say much other than it's going to be an incredible, ground-breaking game.<BR>
<BR>
Will tracking ever be made more useful, and will rangers ever be able to track better than druids/bards (they currently cannot)<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, but I don't have a time frame.<BR>
<BR>
Will rangers ever become the best at archery, because currently warriors are better (not including strange new ranger only bows, but trueshot and raincaller dmg ration is outdone by DW)<BR>
<BR>
**I'm not sure this is accurate, but if it is, I think we'd rather that Rangers be better at archery than other classes, yes.<BR>
<BR>
Why do so many quests involve CAMPING for a specific item? Wouldn't it be easier to make larger quests involving the gathering of more items, from a wider area with slightly easier drops. That is in the one to two hour range. Not everyone can play in minimum 8 hour blocks.<BR>
<BR>
**Totally agreed, and that is something we've come to learn over time. Our plan is to still have rare items in the future, but have obtaining those items require smaller and more blocks of time.<BR>
<BR>
Why can someone do the same quest over 100 times if they want and still get the item or XP.<BR>
<BR>
**Because it slows down the absolute consumption of content, which is very important for MMORPGs where people plan on playing them for months, even years, as opposed to just a few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Why are city guards allowed to be killed, session after session?<BR>
<BR>
**Because they are NPCs, like any other. We have upgraded them recently, and will continue to do so if necessary, as a deterrent to people farming them and interfering with newbies.<BR>
<BR>
Why are there many people outside of PAW and so few inside PAW?<BR>
<BR>
**I think Paw needs more work, and we will return to it after we revamp more zones.<BR>
<BR>
What is your stance on TWINKING?<BR>
<BR>
**It's both good and bad, sort of a necessary evil. It upsets some players, yet it increases the replayability of the game significantly. This is one of those topics, btw, that I could write an essay on - I don't think I can accurately explain with just a few sentences, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Why do casters upon death have access to their SPELLBOOK and yet a melee does not even get a rusty weapon?<BR>
<BR>
**So they can help themselves and other players, both casters and melees, with corpse retrievals.<BR>
<BR>
One year after release why are rogue skills STILL so lacking?<BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. It is our opinion that after we revamp poison that Rogues will be in pretty good shape. We made numerous enhancements to Rogues over the last year.<BR>

<!-- end strapline -->
<!-- body text -->
Here's my final bunch of Q&As for the evening. Thanks very much everyone for not only providing me with a TON of questions to answer, but also for keeping the flames to a minimum.<BR>
I really hope all of this has been helpful to many of you. Also, let us know if we should compile all of this into a gameplay FAQ or some such, thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Lastly, I apologize to anyone who posed questions today that I missed or was unable to answer, for whatever reason.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, here goes:<BR>
<BR>
---<BR>
<BR>
Brad, being a longtime RPGer yourself, do you REALLY believe that understanding the basics of stats (not even exact formulas) reduce the appeal and longevity of an RPG? I understand you don't want players to concentrate on the numbers, but this "wall of silence" regarding even general questions is taking things too far.<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, I really do think that. When I played AD&D the DM tried very hard to keep us from hard numbers and such, opting instead to try to create a more immersive experience. And it worked.<BR>
<BR>
Thought you were going to OSI. When will that happen and who will carry on the Vision?<BR>
<BR>
**That was an April Fools joke put on by one of the websites I think. I am extremely happy at Verant and plan on staying here for a very long time.<BR>
<BR>
Are you ever going to embrace Open GL?<BR>
<BR>
**We already are with our newer engines (Sovereign, for example). Back when we were working on the EQ engine, though, it just didn't make sense - Glide and D3D covered all the bases. That's still true to an extent, and we don't plan on adding Open GL support to the EQ engine.<BR>
<BR>
Currently an INT of 200 for a caster is the ceiling for purposes of adding via multiplier to your mana pool. Will this limit of 200 go higher in RoK?<BR>
<BR>
**Can't say yet, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to know what you mean by balance. (I personally think that any class should achieve the same goal by different ways, either as fighter in close combat or as caster with magic)<BR>
<BR>
**I think what we mean by 'balance' could also be turned into a detailed essay - there's just so much to the topic. In a nutshell, we want all race/class combos to be appealing, but not necessarily exactly appealing. We don't want gross variations in how long it takes a character to advance, or to obtain things. We want decisions on how to play EQ to be as much subjective as objective.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any plans to enhance the ability of PCs to essentially "take-over" zones or cities to a greater extent than already possible? If not, why?<BR>
<BR>
**We really don't have the game mechanics or zone makeup in place to handle a 'take-over' as you describe.<BR>
<BR>
What was the original vision of Warriors, specifically, tanks in general? How well do you feel you've met that vision?<BR>
<BR>
**You can read the class descriptions on www.everquest.com. Essentially, they're supposed to have the best weapons, the most HP, and be the best tanks. I'm pretty happy with Warriors right now.<BR>
<BR>
How do you foresee the role a tank (warrior specifically again) will play in the expansion lands/levels?<BR>
<BR>
**Pretty much the same overall as the rest of the game.<BR>
<BR>
Can you state your opinion on not allowing binding in cities by NPC's (say the POD who does nothing, but stand around on blue servers) As servers become higher level, one can waste not only minutes, but hours waiting for a bind in small (Rivervale).<BR>
<BR>
**Waiting that long has not been my experience in-game - I can usually find a bind very quickly. In any case, relying on other classes is part of the interdependence we designed into EQ. Needing an actual character to bind you is important because you have to go out and talk to people, ask them favors, etc. We feel this supports an environment that fosters making friends and alliances with other players.<BR>
<BR>
Hehehehe, I think you got more than you intended to get, eh?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes and no. I figured there would be quite a few questions asked, but you guys never cease to amaze me :)<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, is the Bard song Kellin's Lucid Lullaby ever intended to be fixed? It currently has a 3 second duration and a roughly 60% resist rate. Even those that are in favor of it the way it is admit that it requires a dedicated healer to keep the Bard alive while using it. One resist causes the monster to go berserk on the bard and instantly interrupt the song, and then the Bard is more or less dead because all the monsters are<BR>
going to be un-mesmerized in three seconds.<BR>
<BR>
**Don't know, sorry. That's definitely a GZ question.<BR>
<BR>
Also, is it intended that Bards don't get any magical instruments until mid 30s or higher? If not, please examine the quests that give the unfound/missing instruments, they may be broken.<BR>
<BR>
**I'll ask GZ.<BR>
<BR>
Abashi said players don't get indoor sow or selo's or any kind of speed buff because in beta they caused a lot of trains. How about Mobs not getting indoor sow etc? IMO sow'd mobs cause more trains then any sow'd players. If it is just to prevent trains please remove the ability of mobs to cast sow indoors.<BR>
<BR>
**I agree with Abashi, however that's not the biggest reason we don't allow SOW indoors. The biggest reason is SOW and similar spells were originally intended to only help with travel. They were not meant for kiting and such. Since dungeons, relative to outdoor zones, are much smaller, we designed it such that 'travel' spells wouldn't work there.<BR>
<BR>
How about adding 3DNow optimization?<BR>
<BR>
**It's already in - the engine uses 3dNow instructions.<BR>
<BR>
Is it within the vision to ignore all bard posts/concerns except the least important for two months straight? So far we still don't have any class specific weapons and only two non-planar, non-dragon instruments that have an effect (and one is from Kedge and extremely rare).<BR>
<BR>
**I'll ask Abashi why he hasn't responded to 'bard posts' if indeed truly he hasn't.<BR>
<BR>
Will there EVER be a "/who guild " to list all the members of a guild currently online (and displaying tags)? I think this would be a great tool for guild leaders and officers for organizing events. Heck, you may already have something similar implemented. If this is the case, please excuse this waste of time<BR>
<BR>
**You can already get the listing for some guilds by using /who all . Obviously, this method is sub-optimal and doesn't always work. Adding better who/guild functionality is on the programming list of things to do.<BR>
<BR>
Any plans on adding an NPC that can reduce the weight of shadow Knight Quest Armor? It seems that this armor was designed with only Troll and Ogre Sk's in mind.<BR>
<BR>
**I'll bring the idea up.<BR>
<BR>
Please comment on Trade skills and what you had in mind when you made them.<BR>
<BR>
**They're there to offer players an alternative to adventuring, and they're also there to bolster the player-driven economy, create item and money sinks, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Any plans to make baked food last longer than store bought or even add some stat points?( i.e. str bars , mana crunchies etc.)<BR>
<BR>
**Unfortunately, probably not, at least not short term. We'd really like to have food with differing strengths and durations, and had planned that to be the case before launch. Some programming directions we went in, however, made it such that implementing varying food durations and strengths a very complex task and so I don't see this happening.<BR>
<BR>
What good is a high alcohol tolerance?<BR>
<BR>
**Alcohol Tolerance is a trade skill that's really there purely for RP. There's no practical purpose to increasing it.<BR>
<BR>
If EverQuest is a grouping game, with a certain soloing ability, why is it the strong pet classes (Necros, magicians) are given the ability to both tank and use powerful magic? I do not understand why meleers have to resort to casters to keep them alive, but the opposite is not true. You must be aware the power of pets at higher level, isn't a pet a last line of protection? A servant? why is it given the power equivalent to some of the principal melee classes? In hp, ac and attack?<BR>
<BR>
**I have to disagree with your assertion that melee classes cannot solo - some can. That said, some mage classes are just as good at soloing, probably better.<BR>
<BR>
Has the clip plane slider bug been identified and if not, what information do you need to identify and fix it? Bug: Increasing the slider between the midpoint to the extreme right in outdoor non-forested zone does not increase visibility distance. It used to work.<BR>
<BR>
**No, internal testing and the programmer involved are still looking into it. I appreciate the information.<BR>
<BR>
I don't want to get too much into game mechanics, but it just seems odd that the entire FOCUS of the game mechanics (grouping up to take on more powerful critters) impacts some classes so negatively.<BR>
<BR>
**There are definitely some classes that need to group moreso than others. This is by design.<BR>
<BR>
When is druid armor being put in and why isn't it in already?<BR>
<BR>
**I don't think we ever promised druid armor per se. I think it is safe to say, however, that more class specific quests and items are on their way in, especially with the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
Any plan to increase the number of spell slots? 8 slots to memorize spells is not enough.<BR>
<BR>
**The 8 slot limit is there so one has to use tactics depending upon the situation and upcoming battle, deciding which spells to memorize and which spells not to.<BR>
<BR>
Will you ever shorten the time it takes between starting the EQ.exe file and entering the world of Norrath?<BR>
<BR>
**We have a few times, and if any additional ways pop up where we can optimize things, we will. At this point, though, I don't know of any ways we haven't thought of. WARNING: the zones in the Expansion are much larger than previous zones and slower machines with less RAM will take a while to load them - zoning time in general will be going up with Kunark, not down.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will more items be added to the Smithing skill? Are there items that can be smithed now that PC's are unaware of?<BR>
<BR>
**Not sure if there are any items players are unaware of, I'll try to ask. As for trade skill upgrades, they're definitely coming.<BR>
<BR>
Why are mobs not given missile weapons? Seems to me that they way to fix all kinds of problems you guys are having is to make it possible for mobs to attack from a distance if they are not casters. Kiting isn't a problem when a mob stops and crit hits yah from behind with a bow for backstab-like damage (no agi bonus either.) Centaurs have the ability already, there damage just sucks like a Ranger's does...<BR>
<BR>
**Some mobs DO have missile weapons. Are you suggesting that more should, and that we should increase the damage they can do with ranged weapons?<BR>
<BR>
What do you think is the most important thing (as a programmer/game designer) you've learned designing and maintaining EverQuest?<BR>
<BR>
**That a lot more players than I ever thought would follow the path of least resistance and play the game the absolute easiest and most efficient way possible. I would have thought, for example, that players would embrace a slightly harder dungeon with slightly less appealing loot perhaps slightly farther away to avoid crowds. Boy was I wrong.<BR>
<BR>
If you could change anything about the way things turned out, or the way something happened along the way to where EQ is now, what would that something be?<BR>
<BR>
**There are quite a few areas where EQ failed in a sense, even though we're extremely pleased with the game overall, are damn proud, and consider it a huge success. I guess the biggest one is that people don't 'do' dungeons as much as they 'camp' single locations within a dungeon. I wish we could go back and radically revise the way dungeon spawning works.<BR>
<BR>
Some time ago, you mentioned that you were going to try to get a "history" put together for player consumption. It would be nice to have that for "fitting into" the world we are supposed to be role-playing in. Any status?<BR>
<BR>
**Good question. I believe Abashi was supposed to be working on this - I'll ask him about it in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
What is the "vision" for each of the character classes - a "sound bite" that advertises the essence of the class?<BR>
<BR>
**Please see the class descriptions on www.everquest.com -- for the most part they're pretty accurate and sum up the classes fairly well (boy, gonna get flamed for this one &grin)<BR>
<BR>
Are there any areas of the game, in zones which have been around a while, players have yet to discover?<BR>
Are there any creatures in the game players have yet to see?<BR>
<BR>
**Hrm. I doubt it. None spring to my mind, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any plans to expand group features in the game? For certain activities, i.e. Planes and Dragon runs, 20+ people are required. This causes issues with communication and looting rights. Maybe maximum group size could be expanded in certain situations?<BR>
<BR>
**We've tossed around the idea of linking groups together, enabling better communication. No short term plans to do this, but we like the idea.<BR>
<BR>
Any chance certain items in game will be made rechargeable?<BR>
<BR>
**Aren't some already? If not, there will be some in the future.<BR>
<BR>
I know you must hate this one, but: Could a concise definition of all Attributes (str, stam, agi, dex, cha, int, wis) please be given?<BR>
<BR>
**No, I won't get more precise than we already have, multiple times, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Is some attempt made to mathematically quantify the relative usefulness or uselessness of spells or abilities that don't directly affect combat, or are classes balanced more "by feeling"? In other words: Would you call class balancing more of an Art or a Science?<BR>
<BR>
**Both. We have internal programs we run to test ideas out, weapons, spells, etc. We do a lot of math to make sure certain ideas are balanced. But there are just as many times that we make decisions based on the Vision(TM) of what we think should happen for subjective reasons.<BR>
<BR>
The vision is frequently cited as the reason for making changes in the game. Do you have a Vision statement for EQ that is a detailed, written statement? No sound-bites, but a "position statement" of sorts that is used as a guiding principle for development? If not, would you consider writing one and publishing it?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, we have internal documents that talk about the vision, or mission statement, behind EQ and our other games. I don't think we want to publish internal documents, but if there is really a demand, perhaps I'll write an essay on the Vision(TM) one of these days.<BR>
<BR>
Could you add a /broken command to enhance the current /bug command? This new option would allow people to "report" and EverQuest to "compile" broken quests ...(like the assassin in Qeynos not dropping [black wood chips] broken since beta)... and cosmetic stuff like typos without the information being hidden in bug reports.<BR>
<BR>
**We have an email address (which escapes me at the moment - doh!) that we'd prefer players use to report problems with quests. Abashi, if you're reading this, please re-post the quest help email addy.<BR>
<BR>
Could the language skill be used to enhance the taunt skill? You would, for example, get a bonus to your taunt skill if you use your opponent's language (after achieving a certain skill level). Running with this, could people learn language skills from the creatures they are fighting.<BR>
<BR>
**Sweet idea - I'd never heard that one before. We'll toss it around.<BR>
<BR>
It's been said many times that one of the reasons druids don't have quest armor is that we run around in wolf form once we hit 24. What if the armor gave us different tints for our animal form or, better yet, allow us to have different forms. I know that all animal forms are not in each zone, but what if the animal form was a random polygon from the zone's existing animal table.<BR>
<BR>
**Actually, the reason you don't have quest armor is that the quest armor was supposed to make up for the fact that we removed Rubicite armor from the game, and druids couldn't wear Rubicite in the first place (in other words, we put in quest armor for those classes that COULD wear Rubicite).<BR>
<BR>
Why doesn't EQ have a quick quit? (not /quit which requires me to click again and again, exit, yes I'm sure, exit, yes I'm sure) I have a time limit on my ISP and like to try and reconnect real fast.<BR>
<BR>
**Good question. I'll ask the programmers how feasible it would be. Like /quit, though, I don't think it would generally be a good idea to use, in, that you'd remain in the world a bit after using the command, subject to attacks.<BR>
<BR>
Why do we have to click agree (to the disclaimer) each time when log in?<BR>
<BR>
**To protect us legally.<BR>
<BR>
Why are there 4 splash pages to log in? We all know who made the game after all, wouldn't one page suffice?<BR>
<BR>
**When you have multiple companies involved in the creation of the game, they pretty much all want splash pages shown all the time. Honestly, though, I just click ESC really fast, 3 times, and it doesn't bug me.<BR>

Do you believe that the lack of non-durable items in the game is a key factor in the need for "money sinks"?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. We want most items to be durable, and now that we've added some quests that consume items, other consumable items (potions and such), as well as other money sinks, we feel the economy is in pretty good shape. I don't think there's any real need to make items wear out in general.<BR>
<BR>
The Shaman's Alchemy and the Rogue's Poison skills appear to be the only "unbroken" trade skills in the game. The products do not stay around forever and create a supply glut in the long run because the are "consumable."<BR>
<BR>
**I do agree that as we continue to update Trade Skills in the game they need to involve more and more consumables. We should have made it that way in the beginning, of course, and as you've noted, Alchemy and Poison, both of which have been updated significantly since launch, are based on the consumable principle. I think it's safe to say future revisions of many other trade skills will be handled similarly.<BR>
<BR>
Why do quests give so little experience? Abashi stated that the reason for this is that Verant doesn't want players repeatedly doing quests for experience. I just do not understand this position. Aside from the name, why is an endless period of "camping a single mob" superior to completing a non-trivial quest?<BR>
<BR>
**Many quests do give out decent experience (they didn't always, be we updated many of them several months back). The problem is that it's hard to control who is doing the quest and then to award 'proper' experience for the character, depending on his or her level. I guess this is a deficiency in the quest system, but then putting in quest level limits isn't something we're too keen on doing.<BR>
<BR>
The majority of the players (over 70%) now under the Equipment Loot system (reference the risk poll Gordon initiated on PvP servers) overwhelmingly prefer Exp loss in PvP to Item Loss in PvP, why is Exp loss NOT being considered as a Valid option in the next patch or "ever" for that matter?<BR>
<BR>
**I think Gordon still has plans for making PvP even more viable, but most of the solutions require quite a bit of coding, and so they have to compete with other enhancements.<BR>
<BR>
Planes armor is all no drop lore, however in Fear the Shaman and Cleric belt are just lore and droppable, why do you allow armor or weapons droppable at all from the planes?<BR>
<BR>
**No clue - I'll ask.<BR>
<BR>
Overcrowding is a huge issue on the older servers even with Kunark many servers will still be overcrowded do you plan on bringing more servers up when the expansion goes online? I'm not talking one server every two months but more servers to help allow more gaming time w/o the pressures of crowding<BR>
<BR>
**We plan on launching four more servers short term. As soon as we have fairly solid dates, we'll try to announce them.<BR>
<BR>
Are the mage spells posted on castersrealm and the like really real? Or are they just some joke like the early April fools thing. (I've heard the answer about not believing that stuff but I want to know if its truth.<BR>
<BR>
**I don't know which post you're referring to, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any plans to change the mage's phantom armor line so it's useful?<BR>
<BR>
**Don't know, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Since rogues have crit with thrown weapon and Rangers have crit with bow, can Paladins and ShadowKnights have crit with bash?<BR>
<BR>
**I'll bring it up at the tuning meetings, but I doubt it - we're fairly happy with where Paladins and SKs are at right now.<BR>
<BR>
Was wondering why the armor in EQ is not damage absorbing? My reason for asking is that this would help differentiate the weapons (i.e. pierce does the class armor piercing damage). Also would allow you to diversify the classes more.<BR>
<BR>
**It would be great to have different types of armor that responded differently to different types of weapons. Perhaps one day in the future we could implement something like that.<BR>
<BR>
Will hybrids ever get unique upgrades/abilities, or just pull off their parent classes? Will we see new spells and skills in Kunark?<BR>
<BR>
**Being hybrids of other classes, I doubt they'll get unique spells, other than the traditional special abilities some of them already have (lay hands, harm touch).<BR>
<BR>
Would you consider switching the character development of melee classes to getting more different skills at more levels as opposed to getting new and better gear?<BR>
<BR>
**Funny you should ask that... we're doing something very similar to what you're asking for with the Expansion for the pure melee classes.<BR>
<BR>
How do I go about getting a job on the dev team?<BR>
<BR>
**Check out www.verant.com for information on how and to whom to send in resumes.<BR>
<BR>
Will there be anything for players below level 50 in the expansion other than new areas and items? Spells, skills, etc.<BR>
<BR>
**No, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any plans for more of a symbiotic link between the Magician and their pet, (especially control-wise)? It'd be nice if it actually followed me when I used /pet follow me.<BR>
<BR>
**No plans, but it's a neat idea.<BR>
<BR>
Do you ever intend to address the spawn in Plane of Fear and the safe spot inside the zone to prevent farming of items?<BR>
<BR>
**Probably, yes. We'd like to address that issue in some capacity.<BR>
<BR>
You said: **To preserve a sense of mystery and exploration in the game. Ok, so isn't this sort of a catch 22? I can't know what to put stats into a character creation until I explore the game, but I can't explore the game until I have created my character.<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, by design. You're supposed to start out with a character and learn and explore both the world and the game mechanics. That may mean at some point you want to start another character to better use the knowledge you have gained playing the game previously.<BR>
<BR>
Why does Verant think that spending 8 minutes meditation or spending an equal amount of time for health regeneration fun?<BR>
<BR>
**Downtime between battles is pretty traditional. It allows players to talk, re-group, cast buffs and other related spells, head to the restroom, etc. That said, I wish there was more to do during downtime, more gameplay involved.<BR>
<BR>
Are you doing this (responding to all these questions) because of the recent deal with Lucasarts and because of other online games coming up soon? OSI wasn't very attentive to its customers until a game called EverQuest started beta. Coincidence?<BR>
<BR>
**Yes, coincidence. I'm not aware of any other MMORPG coming out in the near future, are you? Is it even remotely possible I'm doing this because I care or must there always be some hidden motive :) (greed, fear, or some other nasty emotion)? I explained why I'm doing this in an earlier batch of answers - take it or leave it.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of randomizing loot, which doesn't make sense as you've said, the fire giant warlord crown SHOULD drop from the Fire giant warlord, why don't you randomize more spawns?<BR>
For example instead of the Goblin Knight who drops the BIBS spawning in the same place all the time, have him spawn in a random Dazed Goblin guard spawn point. This would encourage "doing" a dungeon instead of camping the spawn point.<BR>
<BR>
**Agreed, at least to a point. You'll see more of this experimented with in the Expansion zones.<BR>
<BR>
One of the great draws of a graphical mud is to see your character evolve and develop graphically as well as statistically. Why is it that most classes have a huge range of robes/armors that change their look, while Monks and Druids must look like "newbies" for a long, long time?<BR>
<BR>
**There is a limitation of texture memory (which used to be much more restrictive, btw, but recently 3D cards have been shipping with a LOT of memory, thank God), so we were limited as to how many texture sets we could put in the game for player characters. We were able to get around this limitation to a point by using 'tinting' which allowed us to tint a single texture set multiple colors without affecting texture memory. The more uniform the texture, the less 'bad' it looked when tinted. Monks, having lots of skin showing, are the least tintable without things looking bad. Anyway, in the future I hope we have the resources and time to add more texture sets - heck , you can never have enough variation in a game like this, I agree.<BR>
<BR>
You have said that there are many planned fixes to a lot of this stuff. Would you ever consider posting a list of planned fixes in advance? Not a timetable, people will ***** if you don't do it on time, but a priority list so people know what is being worked on in the future and don't whine so much?<BR>
<BR>
**We have an 'In Development' section on www.everquest.com that we just haven't been using. That's definitely our bad :( - sorry about that. Part of the EQ Live team's responsibility post-Expansion will be to keep that page up to date.<BR>
<BR>
Why did you make the role of the magician and wizard so similar?<BR>
<BR>
**We did? I have to respectfully disagree on this one.<BR>
<BR>
With many of the characters 'getting married,' will you ever implement instead of the 'pet' that follows the character around, an offspring?<BR>
<BR>
**Hrm. Involving 'children' as player characters or even NPCs at this point in MMORPGs... well, we're afraid to, honestly.<BR>
<BR>
Enchanters get the instill mana line fairly recently and it has proven to be useless (with the exception of Wu's gauntlets). Are there any plans to add more items for the skills (in a gradual process) or will everything be added at one time?<BR>
<BR>
**Definitely a GZ question there, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
This might be a question for GZ, but why don't enchanters get a level 49 illusion? Also, will enchanters get any illusions after level 50?<BR>
<BR>
**Another GZ question.<BR>
<BR>
Has the idea of houses in the game completely vanished or is it still planned for the future?<BR>
<BR>
**It's completely vanished, at least for this incarnation of EverQuest.<BR>
<BR>
I've noticed that a few of the questions you have answered indicated that the fix or change to the bug and or enhancement would be implemented via the Expansion. For those people who do not buy the Expansion, how will these changes be made or will they not be made?<BR>
<BR>
**The vast majority of global fixes will be available to everyone. More specifically, many of these fixes will be made in a global file everyone will get when we launch the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
Any chance of giving Cleric's a bash skill when they equip a shield?<BR>
<BR>
**Doubt it - they're supposed to be a limited melee class and primarily casters.<BR>
<BR>
Why no Halfling Rangers? With warriors and druids in the race.... it would also help with a guild closer to East Antonica...<BR>
<BR>
**That's a good question. I'm pretty sure we discussed this years back, but it's hard to remember. Essentially we felt (and feel) that the number of races that could be certain hybrid classes needed to be limited. Also, traditionally, we just couldn't come up with an image in our mind of a ranger Halfling :)<BR>
<BR>
Will Verant ever look at locating some servers overseas in the future? Has the feasibility of this been looked at? Being an Aussie I'm just curious.<BR>
<BR>
**Very unlikely. The way the EQ infrastructure has turned out it's much easier for us to administrate when servers are local. In any case, with EQ being as latency tolerant as it is, and with ping times not being a big issues in terms of gameplay, we haven't really felt the need to host servers remotely.<BR>
<BR>
EQ isn't really a role-playing game is it? It's a game based on the principles of addiction outlined in current psychological doctrine. It's based on positive reward and positive punishment. Pavlov's Dog, so to speak. It's designed to keep people addicted for as long as possible. That is the vision, isn't it?<BR>
<BR>
**Heh, um, no. It's certainly designed to be addictive in the sense that any good game is. EQ has its heritage in all the great text MUDs of the past, many of which were very addictive and a hell of a lot of fun. Perhaps some of the early MUD pioneers were evil, scheming psychologists with a hidden motive , but we just wanted to make a damn fine graphical MUD that was fun to play for months, even years.<BR>
<BR>
Why were the Jboots made more difficult to obtain in terms of camp time and level range when the reason you changed them to a quest was because of complaints of that nature?<BR>
<BR>
**Actually, the reason we changed them from a campsite to a quest was because of the complaints of people fighting over a single campsite and the customer service issues that arose because of that.<BR>
<BR>
Would it be more realistic if someone who has looted a timed-out guard's corpse received the same appointed faction loss as if they were to kill them?<BR>
<BR>
**Well, we really don't want to tie looting in with faction hits, which is what that would require.<BR>
<BR>
DO you honestly think gnome newbies should get away scott free with selling their own guards equipment to their own merchants?<BR>
<BR>
**Heh, probably not, but there's no code in place to make merchants selective as to what they'll buy and what they won't. I wish there were.<BR>
