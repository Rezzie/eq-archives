This is the Saturday edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019542.html"><b>"Unbelievable" Customer Service</b></a><br>Thanks for the note. The GM staff often bends over backwards to help players out when there are connectivity problems like tonight, even though the problem is something that we really don't have direct control over.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019547.html"><b>Refreshable Server Idea</b></a><br>Due to the amount of time that people play their characters, and the sense of self that they bestow upon them, I don't think that it's something that many players would like. I'd imagine that come the time for a reset, we'd just be hastening the canceling of accounts.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019527.html"><b>Was EQ Designed to be PvP?</b></a><br>EverQuest was designed from the beginning to be primarily PvE (Player versus Environment) with PvP as an additional option while maintaining the integrity of PvE. The PK switch was part of the original design document, where the tenent that no player would be forced into PvP was set. <br><br>That said, that's an interesting assertion from that article. Would you have the URL?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019519.html"><b>Major Router Down?</b></a><br>Yes, in the SanFran and Boston areas. We're on the phone with everyone and their brother at the moment working to get it solved. We apologize for the problems.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019501.html"><b>Downtime/Splits During Peak Hours</b></a><br>Our plan is to move peak usage. Why would we not do the /movelog on the day with the highest peak usage? The taking of /movelog registrations really doesn't have anything to do with the problem the server is experiencing now. Our ISP just suffered a bit of a blip, and everything is stabilizing as we speak.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019500.html"><b>Guide Abuse</b></a><br>If you had a problem with Customer service, feel free to email eqmail@verant.com. Your issue will be forwarded to the appropriate people there, including the management for the customer service department. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019489.html"><b>Guild Problems</b></a><br>First, per the patch message explaining the situation, the report was run the morning of the patch. Any users added after the servers came back up would not have been counted. <br><br>Secondly, are you certain that in the 13 members that you mention you had at the time, that at least 10 separate active accounts were represented? <br><br>In any case, it's possible that the guild may have been improperly deleted. If that is the case, you need to contact your server GM to arrange for verification of membership. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019445.html"><b>Customer Service Issue</b></a><br>Except in very special circumstances (which are made public on the server when those circumstances apply), GMs cannot come verify possessions prior to the completion of a quest. There are thousands of quests completed every hour, and doing this would have a severe impact on their ability to do their job. <br><br>GMs can, after the fact, see what happened, but keep in mind that they do not have write-ups of all of the quests available. When there is a broken quest (which incidently there are very few of these days), they become aware of them, but normally working quests are not on a list for GMs to view or confirm. <br><br>Yes, I agree that GMs should not leave mid-conversation, but he could very well have been zoning or away from the keyboard for subsequent tells. It's very possible that he thought the conversation was over. <br><br>If you feel you've had a problem with CS, please email <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.comeqmail@verant.com</a>. It will be forwarded to the appropriate personnel. I'd appreciate it if you could indicate at the top of your email that your suspicion regarding the quest was incorrect, as otherwise it's libel to be forwarded to the reimbursement issue queue rather than customer service management.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019411.html"><b>Most Powerful Pet Throught Process</b></a><br>Certain classes, specifically pet classes are designed with soloing in mind. Those pets are important for that purpose. The pets do not, however, eclipse the need for tanks in a grouping situation where tanks are generally needed, which means that there isn't an imbalance. <br><br>Pets actually become less useful in many dungeon-going groups due to the difficulty in controling them in tense situations. The fact that it ended up like this is no accident. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019169.html"><b>Toggle for Ctrl + 1-8</b></a><br>If we made it just the number keys up top, would that address the concerns here? I personally play with an FPS layout, where movement is controlled with the left hand, and the right hand is on the mouse, so wouldn't notice this problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019257.html"><b>Agressive High Level NPCs in Newbie Zones</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: He killed a group of 2 45's and a 42. Why is such a powerful npc in a newbie zone ?]</i></font> <br><br>Simply, there are no newbie zones, not from the standpont of the story. Sure, you normally find lower level stuff closer to the cities as a matter of gameplay, but when trying to develop a story we cannot always adhere to these rigid structures. <br><br>People talk all the time about how neat it would be for cities to get invaded and taken over, but we can't necessarily have that happen if we're restricted to using level 1 to 4 NPCs because it's a "newbie zone". It wouldn't make much sense for the high-level nasties with a plan to only hang out in the sparsely populated outer areas. <br><br>For the purpose of presenting a story, it may be necessary to have some high level critters running around a zone that's been considered relatively safe. It's part of our goal to bring the story to the players and have them participate in it. Certainly some people will be caught in the crossfire, but it's just part of the game. I hope that we can continue to please more people than we upset in the process.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019397.html"><b>Allowing Items into the World</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How do you get items into the world at a rate of 1 every 20 hours, without requiring the player to spend that long staring at an empty spawn point?]</i></font> <br><br>You don't. Perhaps the only way to get a quest that has 10 2-hour steps without having the items come in at the 2-hour rate is to have it so that step 1 cannot be attempted again until the completion of step 10. That way a person going through the quest would encounter 10, 2 hour steps, but the next person wouldn't be able to start until the first completed the quest. <br><br>The problem here is that the second person could certainly choose to camp at the spot for 18 hours waiting for his "turn" to come up. Not to mention, what is there to do if the first person decides to quit halfway through...</UL>

The following was a message added to the Patch Server late last night:<UL>September 29th, 9:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Connectivity Issues*<br><br>As many have noticed, late tonight we began experiencing connectivity issues centralized in the Boston and San Franciso areas. Due to the amount of traffic that these hubs serve, many users are having problems reaching the servers.  We are working diligently with the responsible organizations to get these issues solved.<br><br>As a note, tonight we are also taking /movelog registrations on Tunare and Mithaniel Marr for tranfer to the new server Drinal, which is due next week.  Due to the connectivity issues, we will be opening a second /movelog registration on Sunday, October 1, between 6pm and midnight PDT (GMT-7) on those servers.<br><br>We thank you for your patience.

Jeannette brings us the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>***Blackburrow Triage Event**<br><br>&#8220;BAAARRRRRRRKKKKK!&#8221;<br><br>It was a familiar howling cry that ripped through the Qeynos night.  Zsalshun stood up and waited for the inevitable as the howl of the hunt bounced off the stone walls of the city.  In the dark there were cries of pain as the pack tore through the young adventurers, even as the guards rushed out to slay the encroaching  dogs.  The priestess called upon the powers of her dark god to help the unfortunates in the way of the reckless charge but still some were lost.  The guard came back to his post with the fire of hate burning in his eyes.<br><br>&#8220;Those Darkpaws grow ever bolder and we don&#8217;t have the manpower to exterminate them in that black den of theirs!&#8221; <br><br>The Tier &#8216;Dal priestess cast her dark lord&#8217;s protections on a recently mauled fighter and sent him healed and on his way.  The citizens had come to tolerate her and on occasions such as this even respect the power granted to her by Innoruuk.<br><br>&#8220;These gnolls have taken quite a bite out of the citizens here.  I think it might be time for the citizens to start taking back.&#8221;  The priestess raised an eyebrow at the guard.  He looked at her uncertainly.<br><br>&#8220;Their den is a hive of traps and they are as thick as Inkies in Neriak in there.  No offense.&#8221;<br><br>Zsalshun sighed and thought a bit.  &#8220;House Winterborne can provide protection and aid to the townsfolk.  That might help and I am sure there are several young adventurers who are looking for revenge on these dogs.  We have healers, casters and respectable warriors who can insure a margin of safety for an all out assault.&#8221;  She tapped a finger absently on her mace.  &#8220;Yes, I think that with our help, the citizens of Qeynos can finally charge into Black Burrow and take back some of which the gnolls have taken.&#8221;<br><br>The guard smiled grimly.  &#8220;I wish you all the luck.  May the gods smile on your plans.&#8221;<br><br><br>OOC:  Monday, October 2nd at 8:30 EST  House Winterborne of the Xegony server will be providing aid for any adventurer wanting to assault the Darkpaw gnolls in their home of Blackburrow.  We shall  assist those in Blackburrow by healing, buffing, providing bandages, food and drink as well as the esteemed services of our warriors for train breaking.  We invite you to come spend an evening stopping the gnoll scourge at the starting point:  Their own home den.  We have no delusions that the gnolls will be exterminated, but for one evening we can definitely help with the thinning of their ranks. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Over the next several days, the peak population will drop off to a level of around 1300 or so, at which time we'll be turning the server "green".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019178.html"><b>Default Settings for Resizable Windows</b></a><br>There isn't a simple command to do this at the moment, but you could open your EQCLIENT.INI and delete all of the screen configuration entries. I'll talk to Rowyl about the possibility of a /screendefault command. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019144.html"><b>Statistics and Numbers</b></a><br>Wow, warriors outnumber druids. That's impressive.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019121.html"><b>Escaping to New Server</b></a><br>How do you know they did it to escape from Twinks? Following any new server being brought up, there's always a bunch of people that flock to them. This dies off in a couple of days and the population stabilizes. I'm sure that everyone has their reasons for going, but what makes you think it's all about twinking?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019116.html"><b>New Server at Peak Hours</b></a><br>I assume you mean Kelethin. In any case, it hardly mattered when the server came up. It would have been crowded. It happens every time a server comes up. If you find it unplayable, you might want to wait a couple of days for the population to stabilize. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019110.html"><b>Shared Account Issues</b></a><br>Unfortunately Zacheus, we've been unable to come up with a way of verifying *for certain* that the characters wouldn't actually be changing hands, so it's not something that we can pursue at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019087.html"><b>Res Nerf?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second hand info.

It's a good thing, bugs are fixed, content is added, and other generally positive changes are made. Patch is announced ahead of time and an ETA is given on when the servers will be back up. Then..... Silence... Patch goes over the posted time frame one hour... two.... three.... STILL no update on server status on the website]</i></font> <br><br>To my knowledge, this patch went only 15 minutes over the scheduled time, meaning that there'd really be no point to a status update. <br><br>Now there is always login congestion following patches. This is unfortunately not feasibly avoidable, as login traffic is many times normal load during this time. I suppose that we could automatically put up a banner explaining this each time, but that'd really only be useful to the brand new players, as everyone else is already aware of these issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019059.html"><b>Will Tholuxe Paells be a split server?</b></a><br>No, we don't split people off to "new character only" servers like Tholuxe.

We'll get it in, just please be patient.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018757.html"><b>Cleric Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "id much rather spend 2 hours each on say 10 or 12 items for 1 stage of the quest than sit under a lake for 23 hours watching goblins spawn."<br><br>I think we ALL would Woundweaver.]</i></font> <br><br>As I've mentioned before, the 10-12 step quest with 2 hours required for each step allows items into the world at the rate of one every two hours. We do not want any of these items to be that common.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018732.html"><b>NPCs and PCs</b></a><br>NPCs do not not collide with PCs due to AI limitations and potential balance problems. I understand your assertion that from a real-world perspective it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, however from a gameplay perspective it is necessary. <br><br>NPCs already have to calculate the best route to a target around world geometry and switches. It would be another matter entirely for them to try to also calculate the way around dynamic objects within the world. <br><br>So, as foreseen by Lostalus, NPCs can do things that PCs cannot. This is discussed further in the FAQ.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018406.html"><b>Customer Relations</b></a><br>I appreciate where you are coming from Jochomo, however there are a number of things that I don't think that we can agree on. <br><br>First is that its been shown in the past that the more in-depth an explanation in attempt to get buy-in, the less buy-in we get. Threads quickly devolved into arguments over each point, each of which expect those arguments to be addressed in the same fashion. Second is that sometimes the information you are requesting is information that we'd never release. It might be something that's internal information that will never be made public, or perhaps its something dealing with mysteries of the game. Finally, a lot of the time it is an opinion. Facts and formula can back not everything up. For instance, I saw of thread the other day asking why halflings couldn't be rangers. There's no formula that will answer that question. The answer is that our opinion is that they shouldn't be rangers, and is as simple as that. <br><br>We're not going to break things down to a scientific certainty in all, or even many of the cases. We won't post our logs, or snippets of code. We'll certainly make every attempt to explain the things that we can, however please remember that this is a service that we provide, and that you choose to purchase based upon the merits of what we provide. Simply, sometimes "no" is the best answer we can give. Going into a dissertation on all of the reasons why the answer is "no" every time it comes up gives the impression that we're willing to change our minds if sufficient counter-arguments are presented. Sometimes this *is* the case, and other times it's not. We're fairly open about it when we're willing to debate matters further. <br><br>For example, if someone posts here on the board that Ice Comet is broken, because it should do 200pts more damage, what should our answer be? Do we need to lay out a matrix of all of the spells and try to justify scientifically that its current damage level is appropriate? Or do we just say "No, it shouldn't" or "No, it's working as intended". <br><br>I used to work for a company that developed highly expensive customized software for a relatively small customer-base (around 100). Certainly, when customers would request new functionality, we'd fly out to their location, and bend over backwards to implement the functionality for them in order to keep getting their yearly 6-figure support and license fees. There was no such thing as something that we couldn't do. It's a great way to do business, and leads to customers being very satisfied. <br><br>The last company I worked for built moderately expensive, highly configurable software for a customer base of around 1500. Here, we would not fly out to customer sites, but would certainly meet with them if they came in or talk to them on the phone if they called. We'd keep their suggestions for new functionality on a list, and implement as we could. If there was something that we couldn't do, we'd make a good effort to explain why, however it wasn't the same case as above where there was nothing that we couldn't do. <br><br>However, here, we're dealing with 300K customers, who all have their own ideas as to what the product should do. In this case, we cannot afford to take suggestion from them all, and completely justify our decisions every time we decline to implement suggested functionality. <br><br>It's all a matter of scale. Though the extent that we explain things varies depending on the issue, we&#8217;ll generally explain them to the point that we feel that there is something to be gained through the depth of the explanation. That often changes as the issue comes up over and over again. The melee binding issue, for instance, was explained and debated in great detail shortly after I came on board, but now it&#8217;s a simple &#8220;No&#8221;. <br><br>As for other issues, we&#8217;ll see as they come up :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018335.html"><b>Binding</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Casters bind anywhere except Kunark dungeons. This is a bug. Originally casters were supposed to self bind ONLY in towns.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure where this is coming from, as I've seen it posted several times, but it was not the original intent for casters to be able to bind only in towns. <br><br>Now they were not supposed to be able to bind in dungeons, so that much is a bug, but any non-dungeon location was to be fair game. Though it is technically a bug, it's one that we've waived, so it essentially becomes part of the game.</UL>

Brad reminisced about days gone by, namely EverQuest beta, in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018611.html">following response he posted</a> to the Gameplay Board:<UL>Out of curiosity, back in Beta, I recall Verant saying that there was an employee of Verant who was had a warm spot for musicians and bards. Who was that person and do they still work at Verant?<br><br><b><i>You bet! Steve Clover, one of the original two designers of the game and bard lover is a programmer for EQ Live.<br><br>And, if I might persue a tangent...<br><br>One of the really cool things about this place and EQ is that almost all of the original EQ team are still working on EQ related projects. Out of like 30 plus people who were originally involved I think maybe 3 or 4 at most have left to pursue other interests.<br><br>Which is, of course, very cool because the original creativity and talent is still with us going foward. Couple that with all of the new talent we've brought on board since then, and the fact that we've also got original UO team members working here (for example, Raph Koster), and you have, IMHO, one heck of an MMOG company <br><br>-Brad</i></b></UL>

Today's message is now up on the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>September 28th, 7:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br><b>***Patch Day***</b><br><br>The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch:<br><br><b>*General Changes*</b><br><br>- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying.  This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>- The item "Woe" has been repaired.  If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed.  The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon.  In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads.<br><br><b>*Fleeing NPCs*</b><br><br>Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed.  After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before.  NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been.<br><br>As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health.  We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players.  As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request.<br><br><b>*Level 1 Character Purge*</b><br><br>The Level 1 character purge has been completed.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted.<br><br><b>*New Server Active*</b><br><br>Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play.  Enjoy!  As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7).  Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week.<br><br><b>***User Interface Changes***</b><br><br>Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch:<br><br><b>*Moving and Resizing Windows*</b><br><br>The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again.  The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking again.  Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br><b>*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed*</b><br><br>We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared.  They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed.<br><br><b>*Miscellaneous Additions*</b><br><br>Added the following /-commands:<br><br>- /camp: Causes your character to camp out.  You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>- /invite:  Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack".  You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state.<br><br>In addition:<br><br>- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell.  However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <br><br>*Pauses in Socials*<br><br>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).  <br><br>For example, a social consisting of:<br><br>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<br><br>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<br><br>For example:<br><br>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<br><br>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.  <br><br><b>*Emote Codes*</b><br><br>The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <br><br>The new %-codes are: <br><br>%T - Returns the current target.<br>%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<br><br>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:<br><br>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.<br><br>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

The RPGVault recently <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/features/interviews/bmcquaid.shtml">interviewed Verant's Brad McQuaid</a>.  The major subjects dealt with in this article are communities, the future of the genre, Brad's job and more.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>Jonric: It's hard to talk about attracting more players without discussing community. What does that word mean to you? How important are community and community building for an online world? What are the essential factors in successful community building, and what are the main obstacles and pitfalls? </b><br><br><b>Brad McQuaid:</b> Community is relationships between players, whether it be friendly or adversarial, symbiotic or competitive. It's also a form of persistence, which is key to massively multiplayer games. Without community, you simply have a bunch of independent players running around the same environment. Players won't be drawn in and there won't be anything there to bind them. <br><br>The key to creating community, therefore, is interdependence. In EverQuest, we forced interdependence in several ways and although we've been criticized for it, I think it's one of a couple of reasons behind our success and current lead. By creating a class-based system, players NEED each other. By creating an environment often too challenging for a solo player, people are compelled to group and even to form large guilds and alliances. All of this builds community, and it all keeps players coming back for more and more. <br><br>The hurdles are basically anything that interferes with this building, which is why communication is key. Global messaging, different channels, and other functionality found in sophisticated chat programs is very important. Also, finding additional ways to bind people together is challenging. As MMORPGs move beyond focusing on only adventure, other means of interdependence will need to be found. For example, Ultima Online does a fantastic job of building community with both its trade skill system and also with player run vendors and towns. </UL>

There we will be publicizing EQ storyline, including that surrounding dynamic events/quests that you may have missed in game.

Gordon talked about NPCs fleeing in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018596.html">following thread he started on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>Last week while optimizing code, one of the programmers fixed a variable initilization problem that resulted in the fixing of a bug that had been around a long time in regards to when NPCs decide to flee. As a result of this, NPCs became much more likely to flee in combat. The response to this has been mixed, with roughly an equal number of people on both sides of the issue.<br><br>Now that the problem was fixed, we've reevaluated the the bravery code and determined that they flee too often now. As such, that potential to flee will be reduced in tomorrow's patch, though they will still flee more than they did before.<br><br>That said, the same change also had a decidedly negative effect: Charmed creatures began fleeing. I think everyone can agree that this part of it was pretty well objectionable, so we're going to stop charmed creatures from fleeing.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>
