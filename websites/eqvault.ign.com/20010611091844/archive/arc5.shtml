Mr. Poe assited Alan several times today by helping to explain certain spell questions on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000126.html"><b>Scale of Wolf</b></a><br>MagisteRex wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I posting to learn if the way Scale of Wolf works currently - drops the way in invis does if you cast or attack or are attacked - is a bug or as intended? <br><br>If as intended, please reconsider this. Druids get an upgrade to sow in wolf form at the very least and I believe they get one other. Bards call all outrun sow. Why cannont Shaman have an upgrade that is functional? It is worthless even as a long distance traveling spell since it drops if you are attacked. I have ended up in bad situations due to casters casting on me and even due to a greenie skellie getting in a lucky hit as I passed it. <br><br>This is absurd. <br><br>If the way it currently acts is a bug, please fix it! ]</i></font><br><br>I don&#8217;t want this to end in a lecture&#8230; so I'll do that now. <br><br>This was a perfectly nice comment. You made your points, you had your reason, and you were making sense. And then you decided to add the "This is absurd." line. This line changes the tone of your post from upset, but rational to upset and verging on irrational. It does not make your point stronger and it will not somehow make us more likely to agree with you. <br><br>I just needed to point that out. <br><br>Mr. Poe has an answer to your concern: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This effect was changed several patches ago. Scale of Wolf will only drop if the spell expires, the enchantment is dispelled, the person with the buff turns on auto attack, or the person with the buff casts a spell. The spell will not drop if a spell is cast on the person with the buff, or the person with the buff is attacked. ]</i></font><br><br>So, while it was not a bug, it was something that we decided to change.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000128.html"><b>New Wizard Translocate Spells </b></a><br>Thibz475 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think you should stop and take a look at the fact that all of the translocate spells are being pointed towards light-race held areas. Not one of these teleports is geared towards Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres. Arguably Iksar too. Throw in a Nektulos or a South Ro please. ]</i></font><br><br>Today seems to be teleportation day here on the boards&#8230; :)<br><br>More from Mr. Lawrence Poe: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: These spells are being pointed towards "four post" wizard spires, as they are the strongest conduits arcane teleportation on Norrath. ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the information, Mr. Poe.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000129.html"><b>Ro's Fiery Sundering </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As far as I know the only way to get this spell is to kill Sifaye which give you bad Tunare faction, or get incredibly lucky and nail Garou who is defintely on Norrath's Most Wanted list. <br><br>Is it intentional that Verant put one of our most useful and sought after spells on mobs that would ruin our PoG faction if kill them? Quite a few of us rather like keeping our faction. So that means we have to pay 10k plat to buy them from necros. <br><br>Druids everywhere are burning with curiousity and frustration over this one. <br><br>Wysteria ]</i></font><br><br>There are several places where you can obtain this spell. I hesitate to list them, but I'll tell you this much. It drops in Wakening Lands, Iceclad, and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. And we'll be increasing its drop rate in the Tower a bit. <br><br>And having such a good spell be hard to get isn't contrary to our intent. Good stuff should be hard to get. We're adjusting the frequency of its appearance a little. But it's never going to be easy to find.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000125.html"><b>New Teleport Spell &#8211; Translocate Group </b></a><br>Elmarid wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think a great spell idea would be one that sent everyone back to their bind points, it could be called scatter or something like that. It could be the same amount of mana and casting time as an evac, and would be useful at the end of a grouping session when everyone wanted to get back the city they were bound in. Just a suggestion. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't want to give away too much, but since I don't have any news about Shadows of Luclin&#8230; :)<br><br>Another short quote from Mr. L. Poe: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is going in next patch in the form of Translocate: Group it will drop in Velious. ]</i></font><br><br>It is, of course, my job to tell you that we intend to have it in the next patch&#8230; :)<br> <br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000124.html"><b>Spell Stacking Bug?</b></a><br>Nicol wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Topic: Spell stacking bug <br><br>The ranger spell call of earth overwrites/blocks the enchanter epic quest effect speed of shissar. <br><br>The latter is almost always the preferred buff.<br>Their effects are unrelated, far as I know. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, they both add armor class. I believe that the ranger spell adds greater armor class than the Speed of Shissar, and that would explain why it is the spell to take precedence. <br><br>This is not a bug. There will be cases when you must choose one spell over the other. Not all spells will stack, nor are they intended to. Making decisions about which spells to have cast on you is the same sort of decision that you have to make about which weapon to use or which armor to wear.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000123.html"><b>Voltaic Draught / Draught of Jiva </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I hope this is the correct forum for this question: <br><br>I acquired a spell the other day Draught of Jiva and found out I already had it but it was under another name, Voltaic Draught! These spells are not merely similar they are identicle in terms of resist, mana, casting time, spell recovery and damage per level. (the only difference it seems is the level of the spell: one is 54 the other is 55) Since I find this type of thing no where else in the EQ spell lists I have to ask whether there has been some mistake in the creation of this spell. <br><br>Validata Tempestas<br>Wizardess Of Saryrn ]</i></font><br><br>They may appear to be the same, but they are not. Draught of Jiva has a slight stun attached to it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000122.html"><b>Critical Hits With Bolt Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>I have recently been hearing about "Bolt" type spells doing critical hits (doing about double their normal damage). I was wondering if this is true or merely a rumour. <br>Any information would be much appreciated :)<br><br>Feynan Escafon'ea<br>45th Wizard<br>Karana Server ]</i></font><br><br>It's a phenomenon, not any sort of new special skill&#8230; here's what Lawrence Poe (spell guy) had to say about it: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: We have not added critical hits to bolt spells. I've read a couple emails about this phenomenon. I spoke with Steve Clover about this, what appears to be happening is that the mage will cast a bolt spell and due to lag or the zone server not updating it will miss and fly off. The caster of the bolt will cast another bolt spell as the 2nd bolt spell is hitting the first one will correct itself and also strike the target, giving the appearance of a "Double attack" or "critical hit". ]</i></font><br><br>I asked, 'cause it seemed strange to me, how a bolt could wander away like that. It seems that it's not something that strange. Bolts aren't that different than NPCs. If one can go astray, the other can. <br><br>So if you've seen this happen, check the circumstances. If these double hits have occurred after a previous bolt seemed to have missed or you thought it just failed to report damage (and might have, indeed, missed), then that would explain it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000119.html"><b>Questions about Cannibalize 2, 3 ,4 </b></a><br>RazcoForte wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: what is the significant changes ?<br>ex. HP to Mana exchange? ]</i></font><br><br>Lawrence Poe, spell guru, has a short answer for your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The Ratios of Cannibalize II and III were made slightly better. The hit point cost remained the same, but the mana return was slightly increased. ]</i></font><br><br>I also wanted to address something that I've been hearing a bit of lately. The changes to these original spells and the addition of the new one don't dramatically increase the power of the spell line. What they do is address an issue. Shamans everywhere were using Cannibalize I in preference to Cannibalize II because it was the more efficient. The improved spells address that problem. That's why they are only slightly better. The higher level spells are now preferable to those of lower level.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000120.html"><b>Teleport Spell to Bind Spot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I dont know if anyone has mentioned this before but I think it would be a much welcomed addition to the teleport line of spells! Teleporting a group to the casters binding spot would speed up guild raids, trips to town. There have been many times I got a ride to a druid ring and then got left to walk as they gate to town. Toss the idea around and see what you think please. <br><br>thanks, <br><br>Radrez of Lanys T'Vyl ]</i></font><br><br>A spell like this will probably never be created in Norrath. There are far too many ways that such a spell could be abused. We're certainly not set against the convenience that this spell might add. But there are far too many ways to use a spell like that to trivialize zone content and the challenges that are presented in the game world. <br><br>Sadly, this isn't much different than watching many episodes of Star Trek where the writer has to create silly reasons why transporters can't work in a given area or why they can't use their replicators to do, well, just about anything. I mean, if you can transport people by taking them apart and putting them back together again, then you would never need a doctor. Nobody would need to die&#8230; <br><br>But I digress. The idea here is that we don't want to introduce things into the game world that, by their very nature, make many of the zone designs and concepts meaningless. So, this spell will probably never be seen in Norrath.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000121.html"><b>Abscond </b></a><br>Lord_of_the_Pit wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Abscond - Self only teleport to zone safe point. <br><br>I was informed by the GM that this is not accurate, the description on websites cannot be trusted. <br><br>The spell can get you killed becasue in certain cases it'll bring you right in front of a mob (i.e. fear) <br><br>a. What's the point of this spell?<br><br>b. 600 mana and cast time 7.0 @ lvl 52 seems expensive for a spell that does a self-only teleport to possible safe place and clears aggro. ]</i></font><br><br>Mr. Poe has been taking his day responding to comments. I appreciate his time. And, as I should, I pass on his responses to you: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote:  Abscond will take the caster to the "safe spot" in the zone. Safe spot being a designation we use for the load in point of a zone. It is true that sometimes these "safe spots" are not always safe, but we try to fix them when we find them. In the case of extraplaner zones however, there really are no "safe spots"]</i></font> <br><br>The value of the spell is evident to me; to remove yourself from what appears to be certain death to a place where there is but a small chance that you will find yourself in danger. :)</UL>

I ask this because the Velious Expansion seems to tell you that you should not bother with it until you can even get close to killing the dragon on the cover. Can you tell me what the cover shows? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Hammie]</i></font> <br><br>There was a quest that related to that picture. It was a dynamic quest (run by real people playing the NPCs involved) that ran shortly after the Ruins of Kunark was released. This quest will probably never be run again, since it was designed to be part of the story line that lead to the discovery of Kunark. So, unfortunately, you missed it. <br><br>You shouldn't let the cover art on the Velious box make you think that you can't enter Velious without the power to kill a dragon. You're better off reading the requirements and features stuff on the back&#8230; :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Textures</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>I know that in the latest patch if you set LoadArmor23=TRUE it displays the new Velious textures.

However, rigging your own roll is not difficult. Using /random 99 100 will result in a 99 or 100 evertime or if you don't want to make it obvious typing /random 80 100 or anything to that effect will limit the random to that range. <br><br>Now I may have missed something in the results messages, but I don't recall ever seeing a message indicating what the other players are using for a random range. Having such a message would keep people honest and when 4 out 6 in a group get results all above 90 then I will feel give out cudos for great rolls.

It is the story of Firiona Vie and her companions, a story of GM events, and zone changes. Bloody Kithicor, the whole Bertox thing in Qeynos, the dragons who are outcasts, this is the story of EverQuest. Granted, there are lots of sub-stories, and other stories in the world, but I think most people would agree that the real story revolves around the stuff with epic characters and worl-changing consequences. ]</i></font><br><br><br>Ok, I'll admit that. :)<br><br>But I disagree a bit. While those quests do lead to world altering events, they aren't really the 'story' of the game. While some folks do get involved in those events, and they become part of the story of their character's life on Norrath, for some these events are tales not reality. To me, at least, the real story involves my characters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>Apostrophe problems in the Subject again =)...just for note. <br><br>One thing that I've always wondered about concerning the "dynamic" nature of EverQuest, the ever evolving storyline, and the variations between Servers, etc. <br><br>Now, I understand that there are some storylines that come up dynamically that cross all the servers (like the Dark Elven war that changed the face of Kithicor). My Cleric has sniffed out another brewing in the Karanas (tremendously well done, BTW :), and smells the work of the foul Bertoloxxus behind it. Those seem to also coincide with big product releases, and that's a very cool thing as well. <br><br>But, beyond those, it does not seem that the world of Norrath is particularly dynamic in nature (at least not to any lasting extent), nor does it seem that servers have their own specific individual "character" by and large. <br><br>Here's what I mean, for the most part, no matter how monumental the efforts of a group of players, no permanent effect can ever be had upon the face of Norrath. That's expected, due to the "Everlasting" nature of its inhabitants. Still, you run into a roadblock "as a character" trying to write the story when you realize the static nature of the environs. <br><br>What I do wonder about is the "power" that a lead GM for a particular server might have in suggesting a change to his/her world. In other words, if a GM decided one day that he wanted pirates to have swarmed over the Ogre/Aviak island in Timorous Deep, and have "taken over" the Ogre outpost there. What power would they have to (even for a short time) have someone change the spawns there so that Pirates spawned there instead? I understand that there could be severe technical limitations to this...but it would open the possibilities of characters being able to effect a "change" upon their world. <br><br>For example, let's say that a Guild of Followers of Marr declared a crusade (much like the Pirates above). Let's say they staged a fantastically successful raid, and kept the island cleared of Ogres for a full week (real time). Let's say that in the course of this, the GM's ran an event where the Ogres tried to take the island back, and failed. The GM would then have the option of effecting a "permanent change" on the island to change it around. The world would be dynamic, and a change would have been made on that individual server. <br><br>I know the kind of nightmarish changes this would cause programatically, and I understand how difficult the patch process might be to try and keep up with it. What I might suggest, however, would be the possibility of localizing this to a special server (Perhaps even a RolePlaying server? Hmmmm? Sorry, had to get that in :)) <br><br>Call it a "Dynamic Storyline" server if you like, and give the GM's license to do anything they wanted to effect the storyline. Restrict them to rules that they have to coincide with the "global" storylines, and give them a specific list of things they can do to the environment at different levels. Use the current event structure as a guideline, but take the kid gloves off. Let the GM's play Gods, smite down characters for no reason, create general havoc in their world, even without the "world" being affected. Let them do anything necessary (even destroying character's items, changing religions, heck, change a character's SEX if it takes that). Let them submit changes to the world based on story, and schedule some programmer time to do them. Keep the patching scheme on a different line than the main program (much like the Test Server is done today). <br><br>Obviously, it's a pretty bold step, but it's something to consider strongly for EverQuest II (The Second Story), or any other MMORPG that you guys might design. It might even be a way to spur on interest when your "next big thing" starts to take away from the EQ player-base. <br><br>All just suggestions, as usual, take them as ye will... <br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names ]</i></font><br><br>Heads will role&#8230; er&#8230; roll! <br><br>I've no idea why those apostrophes are such a nightmare. I'll hassle someone about it. <br><br>Unfortunately, maintaining completely different data for each server would be as much of a nightmare as you imply. <br><br>I certainly would love to play in a world such as you describe. But many people wouldn't. There are a lot of EverQuest players that do not like the idea of allowing a GM to 'smite down' their characters, from on high or from below, with or without reason. <br><br>And even if this were to happen on a single server it would require a ton of resources. One GM can only entertain so many people at one time, after all. Writing up, testing and coding changes to a zone (even the ones that might seem simple enough) is time consuming. The awesome thing going on now regarding the plague has taken several people a lot of time to conceive, code and build. They deserve a ton of credit for it, it's a great event. But it's a time consuming process.</UL>

I read up on the manuals before I started playing, and in game I talked to each and every NPC, looking for quests, and the history of the world to immerse myself into it. <br><br>The one thing I never found, after 2 years of searching, is the story. I know the history of Norrath, but I just can't find the story of Everquest. <br><br>Maybe it's me, so maybe someone can help me find the story of Everquest? In particular, what's the plot of Everquest and who/what is/are the protaganist(s) and antagonist(s). <br><br>Afterall, every roleplaying game has a story, or there wouldn't be any roles to play. <br><br>HELP! <br><br>Aloran Al`Aan - The Lost One<br>Tunare Server ]</i></font><br><br>The history of EverQuest is our job to convey. As the world builders, we set the setting and prop up the props. <br><br>But as for the story of the game as it exists today, that's mostly up to you all to write. What happens on Norrath in the current days is motivated primarily by the actions of player characters. The story of EverQuest is what happened to your group last night in Unrest. The tales of EverQuest are told around the water cooler in your office the next day as you relive the battles and travels of the weekend with your friends. The epics of Norrath are written in long drawn out e-mail conversations with your guild members. <br><br>Obviously there are restrictions to your ability as a player to tell your own tale, limitations based on the technology that restricts us and the game world. You can't burn the tavern down in a moment of drunken panic. You can't permanently remove Emperor Crush and replace him yourself (after all, you're far more handsome). <br><br>But, barring these limitations, the story of EverQuest is written by the players. <br><br>Bring life to your characters, and you bring life to Norrath. <br><br>I know, I sound a bit like a commercial there, but that's what we have in mind.

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Bards</a>.  Bards are the jack-of-all-trades of Norrath. While playing magical songs, a bard can fight, heal, charm, damage, run fast and so much more. Bards were created for grouping and make an exceptional addition to any group.  But there's so much more to this class .. how much do you really know about the story-tellers and traveling minstrels of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the story tellers of the realms.  Mana song isn't the only thing that bards can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Bards of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you can equip the item and you right-click in from the loot screen, you equip it. Moving it from the range slot is going to be no more or less time consuming than the old method of looting (faster, really).

One of the things you could do in that game was donate valuables and cash to your guild (equivalent to class in EQ). At regular intervals, the game totalled up the donations for that interval, and whichever guild had the highest donations would receive a small boon to their abilities (though the exact quantities of the bonus were not revealed). <br><br>Anyway, my idea is to allow donations of some sort to your deity. Donations could include cash or items; items would be valued at their nominal merchant-sold price, i.e., the lowest price for which a merchant would sell the item to a player character. After some interval - weekly, perhaps - the donations would be tallied and divided by some normalization factor (so the very few worshippers of Veeshan would have the opportunity to compete with the fifteen gazillion worshippers of Brell), and the followers of the leading deity would gain a small bonus of some sort for that period. If you like, you can also make that deity ineligible for the next one or few intervals, to give more people a shot at the bonus. <br><br>It requires far less balance concerns than a permanent bonus to abilities based on deity, and it has the added bonus of removing cash and the glut of equipment from the economy. <br><br>Who knows, it might even work, if adjusted just right :)<br><br>Nizanko Seigikan]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting idea. The two birds with one stone thing always appeals to me. <br><br>I've passed it on to the team, as usual. Other than that, the only thing I have to say is that it's an interesting idea. And I've already said that twice&#8230;</UL>

Dynamite brought us this event update:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail good people of Norrath!<br><br>    Again, I come before you today with news of Fennin Ro's Wizard<br>Faire! This Faire shall be the first of its kind, where wizards of all<br>levels come together to have fun. We shall have games, contests, duels,<br>prizes, and on top of it all, our monthly Rune Trade!<br><br>    For those who do not know, in past months I have hosted a wizard<br>Rune Trade on Fennin Ro. Wizards of all levels came together with their<br>runes and helped each other: if there was a rune you needed that someone<br>had, you would ask and it would likely be given to you. Subsequently, if<br>you had a rune another wizard needed that you didn't, it was expected<br>that you would offer it to your fellow wizard in order to further his or<br>her own advancement. Several higher level wizards also offered their<br>time and skills in research to the cause, ensuring their lower level<br>comrades were able to get their spells.<br><br>    This month, the trade is still on. However, on top of that, we will<br>be having several contests and games just for fun, some of which will<br>have prizes for the winners! As this is an effort put forth by the<br>community, as a member of the community you are welcome, and even<br>expected, to lend your assistance. If you have ideas for games (we<br>ALWAYS need these), prizes or money for prizes you would like to donate<br>to the faire, or any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at<br><br>fenninrunes@hotmail.com<br><br>or contact me in-game.<br><br>    If you are making a donation, I would ask that you please hold on to<br>it until the Faire, but please let me know that you intend to donate it.<br>This way I can schedule the games around the prizes, making sure the<br>appropriate prizes are awarded for the appropriate games and contests.<br>Also, if you are not able to attend, but have runes or prizes you would<br>like to be at the Faire, then please give them to a wizard friend who<br>intends to attend. On that note, be sure to tell all your friends! The<br>Faire schedule is currently:<br><br>Fennin Ro Server<br>Toxxullia Spires<br>Saturday 28th April<br>Begins: 2PM PST (5PM EST)<br>Ends: when it's over! =)<br><br>    The trade itself shall begin when attendance has peaked, so the more<br>people you bring with you, the faster we can begin trading. Also, I am<br>only one brewer, and in past months, I have had JUST enough of my fare<br>to please the attendants of the trade. If you are a tradesperson and<br>would like to bring some of your stock to the Faire, no matter what it<br>is (baked goods, alcohol, anything!) then you are more than welcome...<br>just remember to save yourself for the drinking contest!<br><br>    Thank you my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro, for being such a wonderful<br>community and making this possible. When we stand together like this, we<br>truly shine in every way. It is you that makes the Faire, and the Faire<br>is magnificent. I look forward to seeing you all there!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Since you can <i>never</i> have enough "Daily" features, tonight marks the launch of the <a href="/display.cgi?/features/artwork/chrysania-border.jpg">Artwork of the Day</a>! :)  To kick it off we have a piece done by none other than the talented Maggie Wang.  Here's more information on this piece of art:<UL><LI>Title: Chrysania Kiga'rasku <br><LI>Artist: Maggie Wang<br><LI>Email: <a href="mailto:chrysania@mysticdawn.net">chrysania@mysticdawn.net</a><br><LI>Webpage: <a href="http://www.magyss.com/">http://www.magyss.com/</a></UL>View a thumbnail of this image by looking on the Features bar.

I just received moments ago this note from John Smedley concerning the server problems that have troubled EverQuest this week:<UL>Hello All,<br><br>We apologize for the problems we've been having this week. Basically it was<br>a nasty server side bug that we now believe we have tracked down and<br>eliminated (there's always the chance that this wasn't the problem). The<br>approach we are taking now is to load the new code onto the servers one by<br>one so as not to cause downtime to the entire game like we have the last 3-4<br>days. Everything should be back to normal soon.<br><br>John Smedley<br>Chief Operating Officer<br>Sony Online Entertainment</UL>Thanks John!

Levels 15-25<br>invited.<br><br>We will meet in the Swamp of No Hope at the base of the waterfall from<br>Trakanon's Teeth at 7:30 pm est to form groups.
