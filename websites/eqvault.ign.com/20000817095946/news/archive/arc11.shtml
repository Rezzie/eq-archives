Gordon responded to a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055966.html">lengthy post</a> about the Vallon Zek server on the Gameplay Board.  Here is an <i>excerpt</i> from the original post followed by Gordon's response:<UL>There are two purposes to this note: 1) to make a logical argument for keeping Vallon an item-loot server, and 2) to make an emotional one that Vallon is one of the best and most fun servers on EQ. I love my server and I hope that passion comes through. <br><br>There are a number of things that make Vallon special. Many of these will be lost if Vallon becomes a coin-only server. Here they are, in no particular order: <br><br>1) ROLEPLAYING on Vallon is not an optional frill. It arises organically out of the rules. Everyone on the server has definite ideas about cross-teaming and when it's appropriate to Player-Kill (PK). There are guilds that are all-team, all-Light, single-Team, single-Race. There are people who kill anyone not on their team, anyone Dark, anyone Light, anyone Elf. There are solo-PKers whose biggest thrill in life is killing green /cons and use every mean trick in the book, noble PKers who refuse to PK naked or to kill people at low health, and group-PKs who love camping the teleport circles and the banks. And everyone feels so passionately about these issues that they don't even call it role-playing, which naturally makes it the best kind of role-playing there is.<br><br>I'm a Gnome warrior, and I only kill PKers. I spent a few days in Blackburrow the other week, collecting Gnoll teeth to improve my faction with Steel Warriors. When I first got there the Barbarians and Humans there were really rude, attacking me occasionally, inspecting me without asking, shouting for everyone to watch out...a Gnome was in the zone. But while I was there I killed an average of two Dark Elf PKs a day, and before long I'd say /ooc "I can't help with the Shorts, but if you get any Dark PKs, just send me a /tell." And people would shout "All right! Caper's in the zone!", or I'd say /ooc "I have a Senior Apprentice robe I just looted of a PK wizard. I'll give it to the first caster who /pokes me", and they would shout "WTG Caper!" "Woo woo Caper!" It was more fun than I've had in a month of levelling and fighting AI mobs.<br><br>On a Blue server, what can you do that's a truly despicable act? Start a really bad train? And what can anyone do to stop you? Petition a GM? That's noble. Good and Evil become just an affectation. <br><br>2) TWINKING on Vallon is risky. If you're like me, you think twinking is cheating. It wrecks the economy, makes a mockery out of role-playing, and destroys competitiveness. I know I'll never convince many of you about this, but look: there are 2 dozen servers where you can twink to your heart's content. There are only 2 where it's in any way risky. Why can't those of us who hate twinking have our servers, too?<br><br>Once I saw a very low-level halfling warrior in Misty wearing a bronze breastplate. I thought, "That guy's going to be stripped naked inside a half hour." But that BP blinked on and off everytime he heard a noise. Blink orange, blink naked hobbit chest, blink orange. He was spending so much energy keeping the thing that I couldn't resent him for it. And that's the way twinking should be. <br><br>3) PvP TACTICS are difficult to learn and fun. Re-arranging the default keyboard layout and learning to move with the mouse are not affectations, they're necessities. Melees spend as much time collecting PvP gear as PvE gear, and that makes for tremendously exciting stories. "Hiding" on Vallon isn't a push-button skill, it's an art that works regardless of whether or not the other guy has his See Invisible spell up. For instance, a sitting Gnome will just fit inside the belly of an Ogre corpse, and no one can see her, and she can see out at everyone. Train a Young Kodiak to the Nektulous zone and kill it there, and you have a hiding spot that will let you eavesdrop on the glory of the Dark nation as they parade by, and no one will know.<br><br>The most fun I've ever had in EQ was running around LGuk trying to get some NO DROP Shin armors and the Basalt Carapace. I was level 15, chased by Dark Twinks and Shin Ghoul knights. I followed a high-level Dark group through the Bedroom, into the Heart room, to the Gargoyle room, shaking the whole time. I spent 10 days down there and never got a single experience point. But the stories I can tell! <br><br>4) The RISK is so much greater on Vallon, and that makes the game much more exciting. There's so much at stake. The first time you're murdered in cold blood and <br>your best item is looted, you're tramautized. You're shaking and you might feel sick at the stomach. You're probably filled with a futile hatred that some *%&$ wizard 8 levels higher than you are just killed you in two nukes and there's no way you will ever get back at her. Hatred on Vallon isn't artificial, it's real.<br><br>But so is gratitude...normally Elves hate Gnomes like me, so I'll never forget the Wood Elf Druid, a stranger, who saved me from a Ranger PK one day. Once you get a good reputation, those suprise acts of kindness become increasingly common. You make instant friends. And you begin to figure out the PvP tricks...how to hot-key inventory slots for quick bagging, how to move around in combat so you're not caught by surprise.<br><br>I'm a level 18 warrior with 15 days of /played, and with luck and skill I haven't lost an item since level 8. But I know I will again, and I'm ready for that. I'm proud that I'm levelling on the most difficult server there is, and you would be, too. <br><br>5) But the greater CHALLENGE of playing on Vallon varies greatly depending on class. Melees are the hardest, being the most dependent on equipment, and you never want to log on and level for a few hours when you're sleepy. On the other hand, pet classes can level to 50 stark naked, essentially without risk. <br><br>So when I'm in the mood to be challenged, when I'm ready for an adrenaline ride at any moment, then I play my warrior. And when I'm not, I play my mage. My warrior gets 85% of my playing time. <br><br>And Vallon is a team server, so there's always someplace SAFE. When I pull into Rivervale I breathe a sigh of relief. I can go fishing on the docks there in full armor without risk. I don't have to be paranoid all the time. <br><br>6) My favorite thing about Vallon is that it's so much less PREDICTABLE than the Blue servers. People are much more surprising than idiot computer AI MoBs. The game never reduces itself to a stopwatch and a calculator. You never get the feeling that you're just floating around a visually-appealing chatroom. You have so many more STORIES to tell.<br><br>I'm a regular reader on the main Warrior board, at Stratics, and in a thread on pulling recently an argument was made that a good puller is essentially just someone with a good memory for spawns and pathing and a knowledge of MoB's aggro radii. This poster was very denigrating about the skills of a puller, and even the best and most prideful pullers on the board agreed that he was essentially right.<br><br>I felt such pity. On Vallon when a warrior is in her best armor, in dangerous territory, a long way from her group, the spawn times of computer MoBs is strictly a secondary consideration. Even when you have a zone memorized, you're still always on the lookout, sharp and alert...at any time, an adventure can find you. <br><br>7) Vallon has a HISTORY of nations and a politics. Unlike Blue servers, racial hatreds aren't a static lookup on a database table, they evolve. It's fascinating to read about the fates of the four nations on our server as they won and lost influence, as zone controls shifted and attitudes changed. And you can aspire to something besides personal aggrandizement...you can imagine changing history.<br><br>Elf-Gnome relations have been particularly volatile since I came on the server in December. When I first got on, a low-level Gnome could run to Crushbone and level. But a series of Shorty-only PK guilds who hunt contstantly in GFay has changed all that. GFay has become the most savage zone in the game. Corpses everywhere. On the other hand, if an Elf and a Gnome meet out in Qeynos, they're almost instant friends. That's deep human territory. I see a High Elf walking toward me, my gut clenches up and I stop, and so does he, but before long we're bowing and swapping food and buffs and promising to help each other if someone tries to PK us. <br><br>8) I love the POLITICS involved in cross-teaming. I've been betrayed by group members, I've made good Dark friends, I've been forced to group with Darkies who hated my guts but who needed me at the time to get a job done. It's fascinating. <br><br>9) Vallon has BORDERS. This makes for many interesting consequences. For instance, some items are MUCH harder to get than on a Blue server, and when you get them they're so much rarer, and so naturally you're much prouder of them. Crude Steins, for instance, might sell for 20 pp on a Blue server, but they'll go for 10 times that in Freeport on Vallon. Small Bronze is very hard for a Dark Elf to get, since it drops only in Unrest, a light zone. The Gatorsmash Maul requires kills in Crushbone and Ogguk, the Wee Harvester requires adventuring in Rivervale, the Karanas, and Ferrot. You can make a killing by SMUGGLING these things, but that has its own risks...if you want to sell a Langseaxe in Nektulous, both of you at some point are going to have a huge quantity of cash on you and be vulnerable to a backstab.<br><br>And you don't find jarring combinations in newbie zones. Dark Elves don't run over to Misty Thicket to level, or if you see an Erudite levelling in GFay, that's a once-in-a-lifetime event. Some zones are war zones...you'll find 70 people in Nektulous daily, but maybe 10 in East Commons, and only a few of those are there to level. <br><br>10) On Vallon the ECONOMY works much better than blue servers. Items retain their values pretty consistantly. For instance, Bronze sells for about 2pp per AC, Banded for 1pp. Trade skills are actually worth something...if you're a master smith or a master tailor, you have an endless supply of decent armor. <br><br>If Vallon goes coin-only, then many of these things will disappear. Role-playing becomes an affectation. Without the ability to commit truly despicable acts, it also becomes impossible to commit noble ones. No good, no evil...everyone becomes sort of neutral unless they want to pretend to be something different for a little while. The server becomes less risky, more predictable, less exciting. It's no more challenging to level than on any Blue server, so a lot of the pride goes away. There's no reason to develop PvP tactics except as a hobby. Anyone can twink, the borders become soft, the economy gets as bad as on the Blue servers. <br><br>I don't want to see that happen. There's little enough server diversity in EQ. I'd hate to see a unique server become just another Care Bear server. I think Vallon is the best server in the game. I don't want to lose it. <br><br>Caper the Periodically Poignant Gemchopper<br>Level 18 Warrior Vallon Zek.<br><br><b><i>You're using Roleplaying as your argument here. However, Roleplaying doesn't require that items be looted in order to play your role as an anti-PK police guild. The "crime" of killing someone and taking their coin doesn't have to be any less important than the "crime" of killing them and taking an item. This is espicially true when the chances of getting an item back from someone, unless they are the honorable sort who always wears their gear, is very slim. <br><br>As for the rest, I have read it, and though I appreciate your opinion, we do not plan on changing Vallon back. The arguments here are roughly the same ones as on Tallon when the coin-only change was made there. Your arguments aren't any less important than those of the people who wanted coin-only loot, however the item-loot people was a much smaller population. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

I received the following letter from a very excited Ranger.  Here's an excerpt from the original message:<BLOCKQUOTE>This promises to be the largest event ever on EQ.  It already has multi-guild sponsorship on almost every sever and is hosted by the Webmaster of the Ranger's <br>Glade (eqforge.com/ranger) -  You  can read all about it at: <br><br><a href="http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum60/HTML/203833.html..">http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum60/HTML/203833.html..</a><br></BLOCKQUOTE>Here's the event announcement courtesy of him:<BLOCKQUOTE>As the trumpets fade, all eyes turn skyward and see the sky twisting a hue <br>of crimson. Frightened, people began to scatter as a low moan arises from <br>points unknown.<br>It seems a blood red cloud has formed over the fortress of Crushbone and a <br>glimpse through a telescope reveals an abundance of strange shapes <br>terrorizing any near.<br><br>The Ranger, crumpled from his latest battle, raises his hand to his side and <br>finds his swords have vanished. Painfully reaching around, he notices his <br>bow splintered and rendered useless by some unseen force. He calls upon his <br>magics, yet finds his mind empty of the power needed to evoke the mystic <br>powers required to heal his wounds or harm his foes.<br><br>Undaunted, the wiry form rises to his feet to faces this new challenge. <br>Startled, the Ranger whirls to face a sound behind him.<br><br>Ahhh, he smiles, it seems that others have heard the call and have come to <br>his side. He sees the forest of Kelethin come alive as Rangers detach <br>themselves from the trees and stumble forward. He painfully gazes upon the <br>countless scars and wounds his comrades bear and cringes as his own body <br>tries to comply with his will.<br><br>For ages Rangers have come to the call of many battles and the hundreds of <br>faces of Brothers and Sisters among the now-swelling crowds brings a lump <br>into his throat. He has often heard their shout throughout the woods, <br>"Ranger, looking for a fight!" and yet sadly go unanswered.<br><br>Solitary as wolf, yet at home among his kin, the Ranger begins to snarl at <br>the impending forces amassed against them. He motions for the others to <br>follow as he picks up a steady trot towards the gaping maw of the unknown.<br><br>Each Ranger knows this will be the fight of their lives, yet they have laid <br>down their lives so many times in the pursuit of adventure that they know <br>their tenacity will be not only seen, but feared!<br><br>The Rangers run towards Crushbone, many being cut down by the now swarming <br>legions of Orcs. Hundreds of elves are fighting for their lives and the rest <br>of the populace stops and watches the battle, slowly shaking their heads at <br>the overwhelming odds.<br><br>The grass takes on a fiery red as the blood of so many stain its blades. <br>Strange drops of blood start to spatter the land as the clouds burst their <br>seams and spill their essence. The moaning becomes louder as the howling of <br>the orcs strike an eerie chord.<br><br>Somewhere in Crushbone lies the answer...<br><br>How will this battle turn out? You'll just have to participate to see.<br><br><br>(OOC)<br><br>The time has come to face this strange, unseen force crippling Rangers in <br>their prime. The time is now to act!

A few posts were made today on the Gameplay Board by Sony's Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055851.html"><b>eBay</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: sorry phelan..but that is not good enough. Before everyone goes and flames this "musk" you need to know it is him. ANYONE at all with a FA coold sell their account and try to MAKE it seem like it was this guy...hmmmmm would maybe casue people to try and bid more.]</i> <br><br>Very true, and it's the same issue that we face daily. We've already had several cases of people putting up auctions, making it appear to be someone on their server who they don't like, in an attempt to get them banned. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055820.html"><b>Does EQ Support Dual Processors?</b></a><br>Though EQ will run on a multiprocessor machine, any performance increase will be negligible. The application, though multithreaded, wasn't built specifically to take advantage of multiple processors.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055872.html"><b>Jumping Into the Hole</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: No one said not to levitate in... Read the patch message again it didnt say.]</i> <br><br>The patch message included: <br><br>"As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST. The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole." <br><br>I felt that this was as clear as I could make it without completely spelling it out. The risk of exploring new zones is quite high, and it should be. It really wouldn't be appropriate for us to describe in detail everything that can kill you. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055457.html"><b>Rubricite & Manastones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering why Verant doesn't put rubicite back in the game? It is so rare now that the price is inflated too high for its worth.]</i> <br><br>Prices never inflate too high for its "worth". The economy doesn't allow that to happen, as no one will pay more than it is "worth" to them. As for putting it back in, I suppose that it's possible that it might make an appearance or two. <br><br>The manastone, however, will not go back in. The manastone stopped dropping due to balance issues associated with it. Rubicite stopped dropping due to rampant camping.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055891.html"><b>If I do "this" will I get in trouble?</b></a><br>It basically falls under fraud or harassment. Someone is bugging you for a port, you agree to port them, you port them someplace else. You do something other than what you agreed to do. Next thing you know the guy is dead, and lost experience due to something that another player did intentionally. It's basically the same as purposely training someone. <br><br>Now if someone is harassing you with non-stop agressive begging, and refuses to leave you alone when you tell them to, please /report and /petition a GM. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055923.html"><b>Experience Loss & Death</b></a><br>Experience loss on death isn't calculated as a number of bubbles, but rather a numeric value. That value, is however, capped at the higher levels. In other words, a level 60 person will appear to lose less experience (comparing "bubbles") than a level 55 person.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055928.html"><b>Manastones and The Hole</b></a><br>The Hole shouldn't be marked as a "Kunark" zone, so the manastone should work fine at the moment. </UL>

Gordon made a few more late night posts in the last hour or so.  Here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055325.html"><b>Druid Bug</b></a><br>Thanks for the note about the regen problem. I've confirmed it and sent it off to the test team. I'll check into snare, but I'm pretty sure that there's some case-specific code that reduces its resistability.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055170.html"><b>Veksar</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Where is the underwater dungeon in the Lake of Ill Omen? Now that you have completed The Hole, will you be working on Veksar?]</i> <br><br>Veksar is a possible future expansion area. It's not on our schedule at present.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055155.html"><b>Revive Spell Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Has anything been done to prevent problems with clerics randomly casting revive on folks to intentionally/unintentionally depriving them of getting experience restoring ressurections or any at all?]</i> <br><br>Not yet, but we are working on a plan. In the mean time, anyone doing this intentionally is subject to discipline for harassment. You should use /report and /petition in the event this happens to you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054856.html"><b>Haste Sashes</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I realize I will start a fire storm by this post but I decided to ask it anyway. Last night a member of my group told me that Gordon and company were going to reduce or already have reduced the effect of haste items by 10%.]</i> <br><br>We do not have any plans along these lines. Hate items and such appear to be working pretty well in game. With the release of Kunark and the subsequent raise of the haste-cap, we've made room for more and better haste items and spells. <br><br>I think we're safe for the time being :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055289.html"><b>The Neat Idea: Caught in a Lie?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is today's patch that "neat idea"?]</i> <br><br>Yes, this is the idea. We've been discussing it since before Kunark launched. Obviously it would have been nice if we would have put it in back before anyone surpassed level 52, but we decided to hold off for a while and see what the impact of growing numbers of high level folks would have. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Did anyone at verant consider ways to expand EQ without messing with the level limit?]</i> <br><br>Sure, but as the majority of players polled expressed an interest in an increased level limit, we decided to go in that direction.</UL>

Here's the first round of posts and excerpts made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055248.html"><b>Dragons: Solutions Not Complaints</b></a><br>We're always open to better solutions to the problem. Of course in this case, I don't think that anyone will be happy with anything that reduces their ability to contribute once they get too high in level. <br><br>One suggestion I've seen was that people's ability to affect dragons should be scaled back as they go up in level, such that perhaps a level 58 warrior couldn't do as much damage as a level 52 warrior versus a dragon. Though this would most likely accomplish the same goal, I don't know how well it would fit into the world.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055250.html"><b>More Dragon Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: And where is it we find the "other dragons" that have the unique loot that you have places ONLY on these two dragons?]</i> <br><br>The same loot? I doubt you find that. However there's nothing to stop you from trading the loot you find on other dragons for some of the loot you can get on Vox and Nagafen.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055245.html"><b>Gobblins Banishing Players</b></a><br>Yes, we are aware, and it is not the intent. It will be fixed this evening. SolB is fine, however. <br><br>Sorry for the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055182.html"><b>Zone Level Limits</b></a><br>For zones, you are correct, we aren't interested in putting level ceilings on particular zones. Having an NPC use different abilities based upon the level of the attacker is something else entirely. <br><br>"You are too strong to enter here" doesn't fit well into the environment. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055223.html"><b>Find Other Dragons</b></a><br>The change wasn't made to restrict people over 52 from fighting dragons, but to restrict the level of assistance they can render fighting these TWO dragons. Other dragons in the world are not affected by this change. <br><br>I realize that this is not a solution that will make everyone happy, but the situation the way it was wasn't making everyone happy either. This change should help give everyone a chance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055159.html"><b>Can't Zone Into Permafrost</b></a><br>It's a small bug. Only Vox is supposed to have that ability. We'll be bringing down permafrost this evening to fix it. Nagafen's Lair is working correctly. <br><br>I apologize for the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055123.html"><b>Druids, Animals and Charm</b></a><br>Though I'd certainly like to see more critters out there marked as "animals" to allow druids to charm them, we don't plan on giving druids a way to permanently charm an animal, as they are not a pet class. The ability to have a pet, for any period of time, certianly makes them stronger for that period, so I hope you consider it a benefit. <br><br>As a note, we have introduced an animal-only resistance debuff which should help with some of those charm times. However I suspect that you might need to check out some Charisma gear to extend the duration of your charms.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055151.html"><b>Locked Doors: Another Options</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A better solution would be to not allow NPCs to walk through locked doors at all. How come that rat in Befallen can open a door (locked or not) anyway?]</i> <br><br>The problem is that spell effects don't collide with objects or world geometry. In other words, as was done at one point in beta, people could cast rain spells and such and have it affect NPCs on the other side of the door, with no risk to the caster.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055119.html"><b>Dragon Complaints</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why won't Gordon/Abashi comment on dragon complaints?]</i> <br><br>I've commented on several other threads as well. You might want to check out the "search" funtion, it can help you find the active discussions which we are participating in. <br><br>It's not unusual for situations like this to result in dozens of threads where everyone is asking similar questions or making similar arguments. In these cases, it makes the most sense for me to only concentrate on a couple of them. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055108.html"><b>Lockpicking Negatively Affects Players?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Well, I don't know about your servers, but on mine there are probably 5-6 level 50+ rogues.]</i><br><br>With the lockpicking change, 3 of the 4 level 50+ dungeons in the game now require a rogue to access all/part of them. Now the 2 to 3 50+ rogues that are online at any given time have absolute control over where the other 100's of level 50+ players can go. <br><br>Players have always shown a remarkable ability to adapt to changing conditions. I doubt it will be long before we see a surge in rogue population in response to this change. <br><br>I think everything will work out well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055056.html"><b>Nagafen/Vox</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: You never once said we'd be punished for levelling beyond 50th]</i> <br><br>This is a special case. As I stated in the patch message, our goal was to avoid having to raise the bar for existing players. Had we been able to make no changes, and still have the result be that the 40s and low 50s were killing the dragons, we would have done so. However every week I've gotten more and more reports of high-50s folk coming in with a small number of people and besting the dragons. <br><br>We still think that the lower level folks deserve a chance. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: After FoH killed Trakanon, we saw that he shared the same loot tables as Vox and Nagafen.]</i> <br><br>No, he doesn't. I looked at the items that they got off of Trakanon, and they are certainly different than anything that has been found in game. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: It does not say that characters lvl 53 and over would be BANNED from Vox & Nagafen raids.]</i> <br><br>Very true, and I'll let the players figure out exactly how it works. I still think that they'll be able to assist in some fashion or another, but it's not going to be the same old strategy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055078.html"><b>FA Quest/Dragons</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Was the FA Quest, taken into consideration, before this Dragon *enhancement* was done?]</i><br><br>Well, we haven't done anything to restrict level 53+ paladins from looting the items, so I wouldn't say that it's been placed out of reach. That said, we are going to discuss this issue further in our next tuning meeting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055079.html"><b>Shrink Anywhere Potions</b></a><br>I'll see if I can walk this issue through. I apologize that it's taking so long to get this change made.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055087.html"><b>Bug While Following Mobs</b></a><br>This happens due to the way collision with objects works server-side versus the prediction engine of the client. Basically, the server doesn't acknowledge the object (a tree for instance) so has the NPC walk through it. The client on the other hand sees the NPC hit the tree, and figures that he NPC will get stuck walking up against it. <br><br>In a few seconds, the server resync's the client and everything is updated. It's one of the minor drawbacks to the system that we adopted to minimize the effects of internet latency and reduce bandwidth usage.</UL>

<a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid961699856,47777,">The Bottom Line</a> is the most recent addition to <a href="/lore/shadoe">Shadoe's Corner</a>.  "Bottom Line" tackles many different issues and aspects of the customer service system, the Vision (TM), upcoming competition and more.  Needless to say, it's a very unique article and definitely worth the read.  Here's an except:<UL><i>The truth of that standpoint is subjective. It makes no sense that a company whose life's blood flows from its customers (is there any other kind of company?) would so callously hold them in the same regard as sheep. A spurned customer base is a short-lived customer base, and hence the same can be said for the business. So, I think it's safe to say that Verant, in fact, does care for its players as a community. Which begs the residual question: Do they care for their players as individuals? Should they?</i></UL>Thanks Shadoe!

Today's big Patch Message is up on the Patch Server now.  It reads as follows:<UL>June 22nd, 9:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>***Today's Updates***<br><br>*The Hole*<br><br>We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level dungeon on the continent of Odus.  The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest, available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status.  The files necessary to enter The Hole are available via the "Optional Patch" button at the bottom of the patch program interface.  The files are quite large (about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to postpone downloading the files until later.<br><br>As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support characters starting at about level 40.  It should be regarded as extremely dangerous.  As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST.  The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole. <br><br><br>*Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*<br><br>As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying interest in "coin-only" loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to retain item- loot, we have implemented "coin-only" looting rules for PvP combat on Vallon Zek.<br><br><br>*Resurrection*<br><br>Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection.  Due to the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, we've raised this limit from two hours to three.  This should assist players and make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection within the time limit.<br><br><br>*Warping*<br><br>We put in some code that should help decrease the "ghosting" (NPCs appearing to be some place they aren't) being reported in some of the larger Kunark zones.  Please let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>*Locked Doors*<br><br>We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to pick locks.  In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through locked doors without opening them. <br><br><br>*Vox and Nagafen*<br><br>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s) adventurers.  As we've always felt that Dragons should be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br><br>One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging.  This would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people.  This would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br><br>Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to pick their own fights.  Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br><br>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

Gordon Wrinn made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054528.html">following announcement</a> on the Gameplay Board concerning the Test Server:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>After a good deal of discussion on the Test server status, we've decided that having the right or the ability to do something doesn't necessarily mean that we should. Our thoughts were that everyone was aware of the risks of playing on the Test Server, and always did so with the understanding that something such as a character-wipe was always a possibility. It's apparent at this point, given feedback from players on Test, that many didn't understand the risk.<br><br>That said, we do need to restore the integrity of the testing environment in order to insure that we are able to catch and address issues prior to them going to the live servers. Test has served well in this capacity since release, however item loot issues and other factors have reduced Test's ability to do this. Given these issues, we still feel that a complete character-wipe represents the best possible solution for continued functionality of the Test server. However, this is a case where, in the interest of keeping our current testers and players satisfied, that we need to compromise on the solution. <br><br>After our discussions today, we've decided that an item-wipe, without deleting characters, will accomplish the majority of our goal to restore the Test server as a functional testing platform. Given that, the EQLive and Operations teams are currently at work restoring all characters that were wiped yesterday, with the exception of characters known to be artificially buffed. This process should be completed later today.<br><br>Furthermore, in order to allow those that did not understand the purpose or risks associated with the Test server a chance to avoid future problems of this nature, we will be allowing built-up (not buffed) characters a one-time chance to move when the next split-server comes up, sometime in the near future. As Brad mentioned in his message earlier, we do recommend that those who are on Test more for playing, and less for Testing, seriously consider moving when we open registration. The possibility of a future wipe, whether it is a player or item wipe, is not necessarily unlikely in the future.<br><br>We hope that the players on Test will find this compromise acceptable and continue to participate in the testing process. Furthermore, we apologize for the insensitivity of our previous decision to completely wipe the server. <br><br>On behalf of the EverQuest team,<br><br>Gordon Wrinn <br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Several different issues and topics were addressed by Gordon Wrinn this evening on the Gameplay BoarD:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054577.html"><b>Necro Res Too Powerful?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: But think long term, when there are many level 60's, and you realize that those people don't mind losing the exp. They'll get it back in no time and sit with maxed exp most the time, just like when level 50 was the cap and you could not mind getting killed much because you would be maxed again soon.]</i> <br><br>Level 50 non-Kunark characters and level 60 Kunark characters cannot be sacraficed to produce the component necessary for the necro resurrection. In other words, a sacrafice requires an actual sacrafice on the part of the target character. :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054578.html"><b>Test Server Status</b></a><br>It's being left up while the guys work on the data. We've had to build the program to go through the characters one by one and remove items. It's neither a clean process nor is it fast. That part is done. <br><br>The next thing that has to happen is that all the character names have to be loaded into the used-names list. That takes a while since the Test server has so many characters. <br><br>We'll get them restored as quickly as possible, it's just not something that we can nail down to a specific time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054569.html"><b>Race War Servers</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The only reason that I wanted to join Vallon was because it was a more realistic server. I like the added danger of having to negotiate for you life, and then having the possibility of loosing and taking a good stash from someone that I kill. Most classes will even be nerfed in PvP in what they can obtain. For instance, my cleric has blind, when it is on no one can remove any items. Without item loot it makes them less worthwhile.]</i> <br><br>I recommend that you give it a shot before calling it quits or calling it boring. On Tallon, I know of several people who make thousands of PP a night just by PvP. There's also a lot more PvP on Tallon since people don't run and bag at the first sign of opposition. <br><br>That said, I still think that PvP needs more risk. I've recommended making it so that everyone can only bind in the city, in order to give someone a real incentive to stay alive, but that's met with some serious opposition here on the boards and in the office as well. We're still thinking about it though.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054545.html"><b>More Spell Drop Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, I understand you said that spell drops are very low in some areas (Skyfire, Chardok) and higher in other(s) (you didn't say, but player discussion seems to say Sebillis is higher).  Why are the rates different? How does this improve gameplay?]</i> <br><br>An equally valid question might be, why should they be the same? We don't like the idea of making zones one-stop shopping for everyone. It's problems along those lines that lead to things such as tons of people in lower guk, but nobody in Kedge. Just like any other loot, the spells are spread out. Some zones will have more than others. Some won't have any. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Having it this way just makes it more frustrating for players in Skyfire and Chardok. It incents overcrowding in Sebillis, just like the "everyone in sol b and lower guk" problem before Kunark. I thought you wanted to spread players out?]</i> <br><br>Sebilis isn't the only zone that they appear to drop in more frequently. I suggest that people go looking around a bit more. As for Sebilis being overcrowded, most servers are reporting around 45 people there during peak hours. It can support far more than that comfortably. <br><br>In any case, why don't you check out Charasis?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054449.html"><b>Spell Drops</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Yes or No: Should a single level 51 drop only necro spell be worth MORE than a SSOY, FBSS and SMR?  If the answer is no]</i> <br><br>That's a valid opinion. Who's to say how much these items *should* be worth. The players. The players decide what they are willing to pay for items based upon supply and demand. In this case, supply is a relative constant, while demand will diminish over time as people fill thier spellbooks, but continue to find spells thus allowing them to trickle down. <br><br>We are happy with the rates that the spells are dropping currently, based upon the fact that demand is still higher than the supply. We do not, as mentioned before, want to make them common by any means. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054479.html"><b>Mobs Regenerating</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, level 45+ MOBs regenerate *faster* than a bow can inflict damage! (no flame)]</i> <br><br>It really depends on the NPC. NPCs can have individually set regen rates, for both a peace time, and when they are mad at someone. For instance, it's not unusual to see an NPC that will regen at 50 points per tick while idle, but only 1 point per tick while in combat. Another NPC might regen 200 per tick regardless of the state of the NPC. <br><br>It's one of the things that we have the ability to set in order to adjust the difficulty of an encounter. <br><br>In other words, I'd recommend that you try another NPC for your test. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Remember, Abashi, archery unlike melee skills does *not* have a 2* weapon damage bonus.]</i> <br><br>Though the formula that you are using may or may not be correct, there certainly is a bonus that applies to ranged weapons, but it's not as large as that for melee weapons. This was part of what was needed to balance archery.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054505.html"><b>Same Game at Level 45+?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Is it the same game at 45+?]</i> <br><br>Though I don't agree with the general purpose of this post, I would say that the answer to the question would be "no",but allow me to clarify: <br><br>As characters progress in the game, strategies that they found viable at lower levels might not be the most successful strategies to use at higher ones. Players have to adapt to overcome new situations in order to remain effective. As an example, a warrior can find a bunch of things to fight at, for instance, 20th level and below, and have a reasonable chance of soloing those creatures. As they get higher in level, they start to require groups, and particularly, healing classes, to be more effective. <br><br>We didn't aim for one strategy to work throughout the life of a character, and in every encounter. We certainly expect players to learn new ways to overcome the increasing challenges of the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054424.html"><b>Rogues, NPC Pets, Doors</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: You are killing a mob, it walks through a door you can't open, now you get a huge train.]</i> <br><br>Yes, you are correct. A rogue, a key, a root, a mez, and a stun, can all address this issue quite nicely. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: However, it's stupid to REQUIRE a locked door to be passed to get to major parts of the game. That's nothing but affirmative action for rogues.]</i> <br><br>Heh, perhaps. Of course I think the main resistance to this idea is the fact that it's something new. Had this been around since the game launched (as it probably should have been), it wouldn't be such an issue, but rather just how the game is played. <br><br>I do however look forward to seeing more people experiencing how good rogues are for the group. Most people I have heard from, who have experience grouping with rogues, agree that a well-played rogue is a wonderful addition. However, there are a lot of people resistant to the idea of grouping with them based upon anecdotal evidence when the game was first released. They just think that "rogues suck" and aren't open to other possibilities. <br><br>It will be nice when people see how valuable they really are, even when a door doesn't need to be opened.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054072.html"><b>"I Quite Because of Research"</b></a><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "time sink". Does it take time? Sure, though everything takes time. Games are made to take time, it's the way they work. <br><br>I personally have never found research that difficult. I get the components as I need them, and would see what I could throw together on my periodic trips back to the bank. Of course, you don't have to research. You could simply choose to buy those spells off of other people making them, as there are plenty of people out there who are spell merchants for fun. <br><br>I think that most would agree that it is a good thing that we give you other things to do besides kill things non-stop.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054274.html"><b>Customer Service</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I am a 29 Shaman and have done 5 Totemic armor quests with no problems, am a Barbarian and have plenty good faction. I gave Vrynn- 1 Banded leggings(reg.ones, not large), 1 Powdered Dufrenite, 1 Snoball from goblin Wiz in Perma, & 1 Bone Bards from unrest. He didnt give me the leggings and I know 100% I gave all the right components.]</i> <br><br>I am indeed sorry that you had a problem here. However we've never run across a situation where an NPC would intermittently not give out a reward due to a bug, which is probably why the GMs couldn't assist you in this matter. <br><br>In order for reimbursements to take place, loss has to be done via a known or verifiable bug, and there has to be sufficient evidence that the bug occured. Our logs are useful to verify many things of this nature, however not *everything* that can posssibly happen is logged. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053516.html"><b>Scale of Wolf Broken?</b></a><br>I would like to thank everyone for following up in this post. Like most of those who followed up, I haven't found a problem with the spell and move faster than spirit of wolf in several different tests. I suppose that it is possible that there is some dynamic that's not being properly reproduced, so if anyone finds any more information let me know and I'll send it to the Test team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054404-2.html"><b>More on Death Experience Loss</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've been seeing snippets of posts by people who want exp loss removed on EQ Vault...it seems to be a growing sentiment. <br><br>The title pretty much says it all...are you people crazy? Take out exp loss and strategy and tactics pretty much go out the window. When you are fighting, goal #1 is to stay alive, with killing the mob as a secondary goal. (Some exceptions, eg Gods and Dragons). Take out exp loss and that's reversed. This leads to people just not trying as hard, making accomplishments much less rewarding. <br><br>Even if you don't agree with that...just think about it. The death system and exp loss are an integral part of EQ. No matter how much you hate it, it's going to be there. And it's the same with any online RPG. Don't want a death penalty, play Quake. You are supposed to *care* about your character in EQ, as with any RPG.]</i><br><br>Very well-stated Kaisharga. Thanks for posting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054279.html"><b>Removing Experience Penalty on Death</b></a><br>I don't think that I'll ever get everyone to agree, but my point has been, if a situation is too risky for your taste, then either don't put yourself in the situation, or take steps to mitigate the risk if fulfilled. <br><br>Many aspects of the game can be reduced to the statement above. We try to give you options in order to empower you to make the decision that is right for you. As it applies to death and experience loss, if experience loss on death is too severe for your taste, don't put yourself in a situation where you can die, or find someone who can rez you if you do. <br><br>The amount of risk that you assume is up to you.</UL>

Gordon indeed confirmed that our <a href="http://auctionvault.ign.com">Auction Vault</a>, a site allowing you to quickly and painless auction and bid on EverQuest items, is <b>perfectly</b> legal.  Here's what he had to say:<UL><I>We really don't have a problem with this. The site is hosting auctions for platinum in game, rather than for real money. It's basically a service matching up buyers and sellers. And of course, since the secure trade window is used to fulfill the auctions, fraud isn't a concern.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>It's time for another lame plug! ;)  Auction Vault, located at <a href="http://auctionvault.ign.com/eq.cgi">http://auctionvault.ign.com</a>, is the community's finest site dedicated to EverQuest auctions, and soon other online games like it.  It features a clean interface, sleek options, a great atmosphere and more!

Gordon discussed official warnings on the Gameplay Board in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054100.html">following response</a> he posted there:<UL><b><i>Warnings are just that: Warnings. They should be taken to heart as a learning experience. Giving you a warning is giving you the benefit of the doubt in a particular infraction. You certainly aren't "stamped" a criminal for receiving one. </b></i><br><br>I found it accidentaly too and I exploited it for what about 20mins before the gm came. <br><br><b><i>Ok, as you say, you found it accidently, you knew it was wrong, and you chose to exploit it. The GM still gave you the benefit of the doubt :) Exploitation of a bug remains improper in game. It's taking advantage of a situation that shouldn't be there for the purpose of personal gain. </b></i><br><br>isnt our fault hell if you saw 10 bucks on the pavement wouldnt you pick it up.. <br><br><b><i>I'll see your analogy and raise you another: If a bug in the ATM software makes it start spitting out $20 bills, and you pocket them, I doubt that the bank would go easy on you.</b></i><br><br>On a plus note I think EQ is a great game<br><br><b><i>Thanks, and like I said, don't take the warning too hard. It's just there to let everyone know the limits and give them a chance to stay within them.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon ruled out of the possibilities of a <i>/who all zone</i> command in this recent post to the Gameplay Board: <UL><i>This functionality already exists for those who are GM flagged, however due to bandwidth and server load issues, we've decided not to open it up to the playerbase at large.

Spells won't be switched from normal status to the controversial "NO-DROP" status anytime soon according to Gordon.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054062.html">the post</a>:<UL>Spells need to be made no drop. When spells are dropped, very rare occasion I might add, tanks feel that they deserve to be able to roll for them.<br><br><b><i>I disagree. The trading of spells if functioning well as part of the player-driven economy. If the group that you are in decides that the tanks can roll for the spells, then that is up to your group.

Gordon responded to a complaint on the Gameplay Board concerning an incident at a recent GM event.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054111.html">the thread</a>:<UL>I'm usually a rational person, but right now, I'm pissed something fierce. I'm playing my level 5 Erudite Necro when things get nasty.<br>All happy of my new level, I finally venture out in Tox Forest just in time to witness a GM event (probably to open up The Hole). Once this is over, it seems like a whole pile of Earth Elementals are out in force in the zone and I quickly die by getting jumped by 3 of them. This doesn't really bother me, I'll quickly run to the Paineel bank to pick up my bone chips. I head to the elevator and as it happens to be up. On my way down, I'm rooted by..... AN EARTH ELEMENTAL.<br><br>This is where I start to get pissed. Once the elevetor hits the bottom, I'm quickly wiped out by what must've been 10 EEs IN THE CITY. The good thing though was that the guards were killing them (albeit VERY slowly). I wait near the elevator until all the fighting stops. Now I'm ready to get a new key so I can get into the city.<br><br>This is where I get even more pissed. I run towards the newbie zone (still in Paineel -- If you've started a char in this city, you know where I mean). On my way there, guess what happens. I get rooted AGAIN by another dozen or so EEs in the newbie area. Needless to say, I've now a 3rd corpse lying around.<br><br>Can't get into the city, can't get into the newbie area and I'm still missing all my stuff. I venture back into Tox to try to figure out what I'm going to do. Luckly, a high level character comes around to help me get my corpse back. Still however, we weren't successful for a while. I kept getting rooted by EEs and summary pounded to death. I don't blame the player trying to help me cause how is he/she supposed to keep a level 5 alive against multiple EEs that take him/her at least 3 spells to kill.<br><br>Anyway, I didn't lose any XP cause I was only level 5, but I think I died 7 times while trying to get my stuff back. I /petitioned so that I could rant but camped before anybody responded. Right now, I'm seriously upset and at the moment REALLY HATE this #@$%@#$% game. Correction, not the game, but the people who organize this crap. I mean, at least when they did this with Kithicor, you could still walk around Rivervale without getting you ass handed to you every 2 steps.<br><br><b><I>I am sorry that you had a bad experience. <br>Our intention is to provide excitement for the players involved. Changes to predictable behavior or circumstances is often a good way to do this. Things are supposed to happen in EverQuest, things that cannot be foreseen, and things that are a departure from the norm, both lead to an interesting world. <br><br>I understand that some people are upset when we do things of this nature. We just hope that the majority of those involved have a good time.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
