As always, Gordon Wrinn has been keeping busy on the Gameplay Board.  Here are quotes and excerpts from today's posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032717.html"><b>Gordon on Several Topics and Issues</b></a><br>We've no new illusions planned beyond what may be included with the Kunark release. <P>The Lull series is not Harmony, and as such suffers some disadvantages. It's not meant to make single pulls possible in all (or even most) situations. It's also why Harmony is outdoors only. <P>We'd love to see more use for the mana vial series, and hope to when the guys get a chance to take another stab at trade skills. Poison is planned first after the expansion, but we'll see what happens after then. <P>We feel that the enchanters pets (and the enchanter class) are balanced. The enchanter pet is a supplement to the class, not a major component of it. We do expect that most enchanters will dump the pet for most dungeon situations later in life, as they can be a tad unruly. <P>Religion change won't be an option in EQ.<P> No ranger-only skill is planned. <P>SK-only weapons (quest based) are planned, though I can't comment further on them at this time. <P>Though there are FA-class weapons for other classes out there (PoS mostly), we're also planning on creating "Epic Quest" weapons for all of the classes. This is not however the type of thing that we'd make regular updates on.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032741.html"><b>RoK Shipping & Order Confirmations</b></a><br>Confirmations just started going out today, and the computers are plugging away as we speak. Hang tight in the meantime, the confirmations are going out in no particular order, and you should get yours soon.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032731.html"><b>Aging Armor?</b></a><br>Back in EQ's design phase we opted out of item upkeep based upon the philosophy that people shouldn't have to worry about losing something once they earned it. In retrospect it is quite possible that such upkeep could help establish and maintain the importantance of trade skills, though a change like this would not be possible in EQ at this juncture. It is certainly a philosophy that we can keep in mind for future products that we'll be involved with. <P><i>[Quote from original post: limiting ertain classes from wearing banded, i.e. shawman, bard, and making reinforced armor a little more appealing to utilize the toiloring skill alittle more,no more big gap between cured silk and backpacks.]</i><P>Reinforced armor was a fairly recent addition to the game compared to banded, it probably wouldn't have been fair to take that away from them at the time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032725.html"><b>Why does life leech cost more than 315 mana? </b></a><br>All hybrid spells are subject to a mana penalty curve associated with their level. As the level goes up, the mana penalty decreases. The early SK lifetaps have a spell-specific additional mana penalty associated with them. Life Leech does not have this additional mana penalty, but is still subject to the general hybrid mana penalty. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032700.html"><b>Buying Levels For Money?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: That's right, all those rich people can twink their new characters with a few thousand pp, go buy some gems, and do the crafted quests OVER AND OVER. They don't care if they sell at a loss, it's easy experience, and it's NICE. Furthermore, this holds true for a LOT of class armor quests.]</i><P>I'm only marginally familiar with the crafted quests, and correct me if I'm wrong, but don't all of them require a dropped item in addition to gems? The inclusion of a dropped item (e.g. something that must be adventured for) goes a long way to quell our concerns. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032692.html"><b>Moving Characters Between Accounts?</b></a><br>I'm sorry, but we do not allow characters to be moved between accounts. The prospect of allowing that opens too many doors for potential problems. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032686.html"><b>Another Nerf Needed!</b></a><br>Rofl. Might as well I suppose, someone nerfed my stock portfolio today. Actually it's been an ongoing persistent nerf for about the last month and a half.  <i>[Note from Aurum: My portfolio was nerfed all week too!]</i><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032618.html"><b>Reclaim Energy Issues</b></a><br>As a level 1 spell, it's really as useful as we want to make it. We don't want pets turning into a mana battery. That might drastically change gameplay for certain encounters. For instance, someone might find it more efficient to terminate his pet right before the end of battles in order to avoid sharing experience with it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032661.html"><b>Will Verant turn off faction hits for major GM events?</b></a><br>No. For events such as this we prefer that they take place with at least some semblance of character. There's also the fact that faction effects just can't be turned off, much like XP loss.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032600.html"><b>Verant's View on Trading Accounts</b></a><br>Accounts are non-transferable per the license agreement, so this would apply to both the selling and trading of the accounts. On another note I do suggest that you be very careful regardless what you decide to do. We've seen many people scammed by people claiming that they'd trade accounts.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032684.html"><b>Is it possable to gain faction with dungeon creatures? </b></a><br>In some cases it is possible. Dungeon creatures that have faction often have a way to reduce the faction. For instance, the well-known "Live Froglocks of Guk" faction can be reversed. One thing to keep in mind is that there are thresholds to certain factions, meaning that there is often a limit to how good, or in some cases, how bad it can get. Finally, some factions can't be improved if you let them get below a certain point. For example, if someone bombs a building here in the US, we don't care how much he gives to charity after the fact, he's still no good :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032580.html"><b>Some of the expansion spells will only be found off planes mobs</b></a><br>This is not at all true. Though it is true that some of the expansion spells will be treasure drops, many will be purchaseable or questable. I can see how you might come to this conclusion, but please keep in mind that the plans are *currently* the only place you can find 50+ NPCs in abundance. That's why you are seeing the spells drop there.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032045.html"><b>Lack of, um, Breats on Iksar Females</b></a><br>Er... They are reptiles. :) To my knowledge, reptiles have never had need for such endowments.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032588.html"><b>Is Kerra Isle Fixed?</b></a><br>The alternate data set should be active on all servers. I'll ask the GM staff to doublecheck.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032549.html"><b>Moving NPC Corpses</b></a><br>GMs cannot (meaning that they do not have the ability) to move NPC corpses. What further actions that a GM would be able to take would be up to the GM there at the time. If the corpse was there in the wall, there's a very good chance that the GM couldn't have targeted it either. Did you try the /loot command? <P>Of course now that the corpse is gone, there's really nothing further that a GM could do in regards to this issue. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032124.html"><b>Cleric Quest Armor</b></a><br>You mean the stats on the individual pieces of cleric armor? We're pretty much happy with the way they are. If you compare the different class-specific armors, and look at the values of the primary stats granted, the cleric armor is right up there with the other peices. Mid level armor doesn't grant the super stat buffs that many are asking for. <P>There are many +WIS items out there, but you might have to trade AC and appearance for them.</UL>

Caldyen informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Tis with much sorrow that I tell thee this tale. It all began in Greater Faydark, beneath the grand city of Kelethin, where shouts of a party arose. 2 finely dressed wood elves (the Oakwynds) and their dwarven friend Thubr Axebringer were having a celebration of sorts. After much drinking and carousing, twas heard that the great king of the Elves, King Tearis Thex, was to speak to his people that night. Once gathered around Felwithe, twas revealed that Firiona Vie had returned to her homeland. Twas a bittersweet homecoming though, as evil reared its ugly head this night. A troll and ogre attacked, led by a Tier'Dal caster. The battle twas ugly, with few lives spared in the process. The abominations struck down Lorisyn Oakwynd, who had come to speak with Firiona Vie. Much sorrow was felt by all, as his  sister Lyirae Oakwynd swore revenge upon those who had slain her brother. <br><br>*OOC* It was a great event, and I'd like to thank the GM's involved. It  looks as if it will be continuing in 3 days time, in the city of Freeport. The ^mostly^ full log can be found at:<br><a href="http://phobos.spaceports.com/~caldyen/EventLog.html">http://phobos.spaceports.com/~caldyen/EventLog.html</a><br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Caldyen Nightblade<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Povar</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Here's a snippet:<UL>These gameshelp introduce the Internet world to the people. C&C started it off with the modem games where you connectto your friend's computer and the play.

Brad McQuaid, Verant Interactive, Inc.'s Vice President, again denied knowledge of the mysterious pile of you-know-what in West Freeport.  Here's the thread from the Gameplay Board:<UL><b>Brad, what's with the poo-poo? In west freeport, straight out from the Casters guild, and right before the monk guild, is a pile of what looks like...well, we've all seen it i'm sure. What IS this? :)</b><i><P>I can't really answer you, sorry. We beleive that to reveal the formulas and stats behind the piles would be taking away from the mystery of the game.<P>-Brad</i></UL>Once again Verant REFUSES to give out vital information to it's customers.  My inside sources believe this has something to do with Verant's secret contract with the government of this country, and it somehow connected to the UFO/Lewinsky scandal.  We can only hope that eventually the truth will be revealed.<P>Thanks Ort-Man! :)

Hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board, here is today's regular edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032436.html"><b>Aegis of Life is broken due to faction. Will it be fixed soon?</b></a><br>The faction thresholds on it are set a bit too high at the moment. It should be fixed on test now and will probably go live in a week or two.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032451.html"><b>Why are artifacts NO DROP?</b></a><br>Characters are required to earn artifacts. They are given as a reward for completing various tasks. They are badges of honor. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032458.html"><b>How's the Pony model coming?</b></a><br><br>Fighting with Milo now on the model. He thinks that it should have fangs, claws, and bat wings :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032458.html"><b>Verant Software</b></a><br>Our company is founded on the concept of massively multiplayer online games, and the ongoing revenue that they generate through player subscriptions. We don't intend to release any single-player games, or server-software to allow people to set up their own games. To my knowledge, I believe that another company is producing a game that will allow you to do as you ask. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032480.html"><b>Shrink Spell Changes</b></a><br>This spell was changed indirectly by a fix that was made in another area. I have heard people ask for shrink to be done in stages before, but I wouldn't mind hearing everyone's thoughts on this. <P>As for the shrink potions, we'll probably make them shrink to gnome-size in a single charge.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032398.html"><b>Getting Level 51+ Spells</b></a><br>Some level 51+ spells will be buyable, some questable, and some will drop as treasure. As a general rule, spells which are core to the abilities of a class (such as a clerics heal spell) will be purchasable. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032392.html"><b>Will we ever see capes on characters?</b></a><br>In a nutshell, no. The back and shoulder slots (places where you'd expect to equip a cape) are not visible slots. We have no plans at present to rebuild all of the character models to support visible capes.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032366.html"><b>Server Splits: Character Transfers</b></a><br>If you have characters on more than one server destined to be split, and those characters all have different names, you could have them all moved to the split server where they would all be accessible to you. <P>However, if any of those characters have the same name, you'll want to leave them on their current server, or pick one and delete the other. If you try to have characters moved from more than one server, and a name is duplicated, the last one to be copied will overwrite the first. We might look into disallowing a move in the event of a duplicate, but that isn't yet finalized. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032373.html"><b>Tumpy Tonic Quest Nerfed</b></a><br>We reevaluated our earlier position upon continued concerns posted by the customers. In addition, we received several testimonials from people who were able to level using it at a rate far (10+ times) exceeding our designed pace for the game. Finally, I myself was sent a few screenshots of over a dozen people standing around the guy handing in tonics. <P>It was essentially buying levels for money, something that we don't want done in EverQuest. <P>As a note, the quest will be changed and the experience given by it will probably be increased beyond what it originally was. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032378.html"><b>Charm Spell Bug?</b></a><br>This isn't a bug. When a creature dies, the system checks to see what entity gets credit for the kill. If that entity is a pet, the credit for the kill goes to the pets owner. Since charm broke, and the entity that did the most damage is no longer a pet, you don't get the experience. Your choice in this case is either to kill the former pet first, or recharm it so that it is your pet when the first critter dies.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032352.html"><b>Kunark Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My question about the expansion is that, with characters going up to level 60, will the two classic dragons that are out there now simply be camped constantly by 60th levels who want to twink their new characters with dragon droppings? Is there anything special about their locations or zones to prevent this?]</i><P> We're still considering these issues. Though we don't want to see level 60 folk bottom feeding on dragons, we don't necessarily want to buff them all up either. We'll come up with something, but everyone will have to wait for the release of the expansion to see what that is :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032341.html"><b>Spirit of Cheetah Spell Bug</b></a><br>Bypassing the recast time of a spell by zoning was a bug. The fact that we fixed it should have been listed in the patch message, and I apologize that it wasn't. Apparently we had to spend time on the reset-on-zone issue in order to implement some of the cooler spells and disciplines for post-50 play.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032331.html"><b>Breaking into the Planes</b></a><br>Though we understand the feeling that people have concerning their effort in breaking a plane giving them "rights" to the area, other people have a right to be there as well. Our feeling is that the effort and deaths expended to break into the plane was evidently "worth it" to those breaking in, and that the reward for doing so was more or less "first dibs" on the creatures required to break the plane. <P>Though we fully intend for there to be areas and creatures in the game that require large organized parties, guilds, etc., we won't deny access to an area based upon membership in a guild. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032281.html"><b>Why By Kunark?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why should I pay up to $30 for ROK when I really know very little about it?]</i><P> It could be aruged that this is precisely why you might consider purchasing the upgrade, as it is comprised of new things that you know very little about. <P>We believe firmly in the ideal that players should be allowed to explore areas, discover new spells, quests, dungeons, etc., without getting the information handed to them from outside sources. Yes, I understand that within a few months, everything about Kunark will be up on the spoiler sites, but before that happens, everything will be new to everyone. That's priceless in my opinion.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031691-2.html"><b>Classes and Combinations</b></a><br>Actually I said that adding a new class is highly unlikely for a multitude of reasons. As for race/class combos, we recently added Erudite SKs to the list.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032013.html"><b>Root</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Maybe also the treants figured out that the druids root spells now work better then bevor and like to use it now?]</i><P>Strangely enough, that is very close to the truth :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032046.html"><b>Instill Doubt, Magical Kick, and Magical Boots</b></a><br>You make some good points. I'll mention it to the guys. Perhaps we could make the monk kick automatically magic at a certain level, or add a craftable magic foot item as suggested.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032329.html"><b>Spawn Rates</b></a><br>Please keep in mind that though the spawns were fixed, it doesn't mean that they are always around, just that they spawn at the rate at which they are intended. The Undead Cyclops spawn was one of those that we looked at when reviewing all of the spawn times, it was spawning improperly and should be working appropriately now. We also made changes to the Netmasters, Cooks, Clockworks, and Plague sharks. </UL>

From Raene:<BLOCKQUOTE>Almost a year ago today, on April 14th '99, The Rathe Rhapsody opened as asite of collected information pertaining to the Rathe Server. How we havegrown and changed! Gone are the Personal and Business pages, little used byRathe players. Full are the guild listings. In the start of our secondyear, we've added a permanent link to EQRaid.org...a site to organize andplan your guild raids and events in sought after planar camps.<P>A year ago the "high-level" players wore expensive bronze and sportedsurnames above their heads. LGuk was empty. Sol B was empty. The planeswere in the planning stages.

In a very interesting turn of events, after months of not supporting player-based events <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032372.html">Verant has announced</a> that it will begin working with the players in developing them.  Here's the post Verant-Thom made on the Gameplay board:<UL>Greetings!<P>We want to start implementing more Verant Sponsored Events in the near future. Below is a list of the current Events that will be going live to the servers shortly, so if you have comments about these events, or have an idea that we are not touching upon, please let your opinions be heard. <P>Tournaments <P>Test of Tactics<P>This Six vs. Six-player competition is designed to be the most intense 30 seconds possible in Everquest. Two opposing teams facing each other in the arena, confined to the raised platform area, completely de-buffed before match fight in single elimination, team style combat. Has been run on Xegony and Veeshan to this date. Other servers will participate in this event in the near future. Prizes have been extreme weapons such as the legendary &#8220;Fanged Skull Stiletto&#8221; and items removed from the game such as the beautiful &#8220;Cryosilk&#8221; Robe. <P>Test of Flight<P>This is an archery tournament designed for all levels. The archers will fire upon a GMPC that will match his level to the level of the Archer. A flight of 20 arrows at 100 paces, most arrows landed wins the event. In the case of a tie, the archers will each fire a single arrow, and the archer doing the most damage wins the tiebreaker. Preliminary testing completed on Xegony, about to be started on all servers. <P>Test of Steel<P>This is a single melee vs. melee combat with very simple rules. You must hit with steel, and you cannot cast spells. Preliminary testing still in progress on Veeshan, prize is set to be the infamous &#8220;Gleaming Bastard Sword&#8221;. All Skills such as &#8220;Lay of Hands&#8221;, &#8220;Harms Touch&#8221;, and &#8220;Mend&#8221; will be allowed. Test of Faith<P>This is another single competition designed for any class that is capable of casting &#8220;Greater Heal&#8221; before level 50. This is still in its design stage, and a server will be designated shortly for preliminary testing. Test of Mystics<P>This is open to any class, but rules forbid melee. This is still in its design stage, and a server will be designated shortly for preliminary testing, <P>Other Events <P>City Invasion &#8211; Qeynos<P>The ultimate challenge for a guild, the City of Qeynos still has not fallen to this date in Everquest History. Background is that Antonious Bayle has left for a diplomatic meeting in High Pass Keep, and a guild of players is going to sack the city. To achieve victory, there are 10 designated NPC&#8217;s that must be taken by force of arms within 4 hours (real life time) before the return of Antonious. These 10 are the 7 non-primary caster Guildmasters (Q-Cat is not part of this Event), the 2 Lieutenant Guards, and the Corporal. Since this is a signup event, a guild must prove ability to repel such firepower and slay the Lieutenant in Northern Qeynos (No small task I assure you). Primary Testing on Xegony and Veeshan for this event has already been accomplished, and the first attempt at this event should take place within the week. The Leader of the Guild that takes Qeynos will receive a title. The title will be &#8220;The Conqueror&#8221; or a very similar title. <P>Rules for other cities may follow in the near future. <P>This is what we have planned in the near future. If you have other ideas for events, we would like to hear them for all levels of play. Let us know what you think. <P>-Aikbach</UL>After reporting hundreds, even thousands of events in my time this is the first time I've ever seen something like this happen.  There are more logistics to figure out, but this could be big!<P>Thanks James!

Verant-Thom made Verant's response to the Guides who were banned/suspended on Lanys T'vyl on the Gameplay board.  For those unfamilar with the incident please consult the two <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player Views</a> we have posted for further background info.  Here's the post:<UL>The guides that were in this incident were not banned, with the exception of one. The guides knew the policies, agreed to them, but decided to ignore them, therefore their accounts were suspended until we could remove the guide powers on their account. They will be able to play on their accounts after we un-flag their account.<P>There was one account that was banned, and the decision was based on many incidents regarding this account.<P>I hope this clears up the erroneous posts that we have banned all of the accounts.</UL>

Velshanna brings word that a planned event has been cancelled:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi all, <P>I'm sorry to say that the newbie war on Tarew Marr that was supposed to happen this weekend is temporarily canceled. After spending weeks trying to get the guilds created I have still had utterly no responce from Verant to get this done so it's impossible to go on with the event, at least this weekend. I will continue to email Verant about this and once I actually get the guilds formed I will be able to repost about this event. This could take up to three weeks given that I have been emailing them for three weeks now about this matter. <P>Once again I apologize to everyone who was looking forward to joining this event. I, too, was looking foward to participating in it and am still hopeful that we can do this on a future date. For more information about this you can go to <a href="http://www.tarewmarr.net/war">www.tarewmarr.net/war</a>. Thanks, <br>Velshanna Wolfwatcher</BLOCKQUOTE>Sorry to hear it! :(

The feedback given by all players, on many different boards and in-game, regarding yesterday's <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> article has been astounding.  I have a small update to bring you regarding the situation now.  Desmo, who was one of banned Guides, sent me a letter sharing his side of the story with us.  Due to it's length I have posted it on a sperate page titled, <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid955639197,55187,">Follow-up: The Rights of Guides</a>.  Included on this page is a log of the events leading to the banning, a letter to the GM responsible and a few words to the players and other guides.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><i>To the other Guides on Lanys, I wish you the best. You were all very friendly people, and helpful to a new guide like myself. To Jhek, Lead GM of Lanys, even though you work for Verant, I know you went to bat for me and did what you could. I think you are the best GM I've ever dealt with, and others share my opinion. To any of the other Guides that were banned with me and feel somewhat guilty, don't sweat it. I have no hard feelings towards you at all. To all the rest of Verant that agrees what happened to me was justified, I return to you my Sword of Guidance.</I></UL>Because of the amount of posts made to the original thread I have split yesterday's board thread into a new thread.  To voice your opinion of this issue please leave a news comment or visit the new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5435001&replies=0">board thread</a> on the Player Views Board.

Gordon Wrinn went on a late night posting spree last night, so finish waking up, grab some breakfast and here's this mornings edition of the Gordon Infobits for your reading pleasure:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031979.html"><b>Inte's Super Duper Sword of Death</b></a><br>Yeah that 150dmg 15 delay sword was our fault. We wanted Inte to be carrying a flaming sword, and one of the game designers figured that no one would ever be able to kill him and made the sword a little unruly. We did have the forethought to make it NORENT though, and changed the stats in the item database to something a little less nasty, but we went so long without patching items that someone actually managed to kill Inte two days before the patch. <P>That'll teach us to go around calling NPCs unkillable :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029967-2.html"><b>Spell Casters have GZ, but what about Melee concerns?</b></a><br>I do agree that casters have received a good deal of information from GZ, and has done a very good job addressing casters concerns. This was one of the reasons that I first started trying to address stat issues, and also one of the reasons that we later decided to give everyone a concise explanation. <P>I'll pay special attention to try and service melee concerns, but it is very difficult to get into some issues while trying to maintain some sense of adventure and exploration. Melee stuff is typically pretty straight-forward, and to delve into it any deeper might end up on the virge of spoilers. <P>I am happy to say that we have gotten several melee issues addressed since I came on here. As for things I've had a primary hand in, the Paly/SK boosts, rogue hide/sneak (versus undead as well) and evade, monk built-in haste, and many item changes. There are many other things as well. So I'm not ignoring your posts and I apologize if that is the impression you've gotten. <P>As for questions about items such as this, the game designers take into account many things when creating items. For instance, many casters would like to have higher strength or agility, but are unwilling to sacrifice INT/WIS to get it. This item is a shoulder item, and as many people know, there aren't too many +INT/WIS shoulder items in game that are available to casters. It's just not meant to be a melee item.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032035.html"><b>Patch Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The Necromancer spell Hungry Earth was included in the original request as well because it roots the undead and then hurts them. It was scheduled to be fixed as well, has it been fixed or is it still being worked on?]</i><P> This should have been done as well. I'll check with GZ tomorrow, as I'm about to hit the sack now.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032204.html"><b>Great Quiver Idea</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Make quivers lower the delay of your bow, assuming that arrow is coming from a quiver.]</i><P> Hmmm, that's an interesting idea and it might even be possible. I'll chat with the guys about it tomorrow. I think we'd jump at the chance to have quivers useful for something :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032173.html"><b>Raising your Install Doubt Skill</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why is Instill Doubt the hardest skill in the game to raise?]</i><P>Well the technical reason is that the skill-increase roll is only made when the skill-success roll succeeds. This can get a bit frustrating at times I imagine. I certainly remember it from when I raised sense-heading from 0 a few times :)Recently we put in some code that should be allowing faster skilling in ID. It's nothing dramatic, but it should save you a few hundred clicks :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032251.html"><b>Typo</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: "CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you;" <P>Now isn't "affects amount YOU will be paid" and "how much they will pay YOU" the same thing? Haha Brad is this just a typo? Might wanna go over it befor its published :)]</i><P>ROFL. Feel free to give him a hard time bmcquaid@verant.com :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032297.html"><b>Login Screen Artwork</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Dumb question but on the Login screen art, who is the big green guy, you also have one like him on the original box, At first I thought troll but the nose is wrong as is the body shape and what not(not fat enough to be a troll) Then I thought Goblin or Orc but he is huge even compared to the Barbarian chick in the corner.]</i><P> He's a Troll. The original sketches that were provided to Kieth Parkinson were based on our old character-models, back before the engine change that occurred in about March of 98. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032253.html"><b>Not Allowing a Change of Faith</b></a><br>The decision to disallow a "Change of Faith" was made during the early design process for EQ. At that time it was decided that we didn't want people changing faith as a matter of convenience, to get whatever benefits that a particular religion might grant at that specific time. <P>With that in mind, several other design decisions were made for EQ that now makes changing faith impossible even if we decided to allow it through a complicated quest or what have you. It's burried too deep into the core faction code for all of our work since then to be unraveled. <P>Your initial faction is set through your choice of race, class, and deity. Other factions that you affect as you build that character are affected based upon your own faction. The entire faction system would basically have to be redesigned to support it, and with thousands of other NPCs and factions to consider, the work involved and the potential for problems makes it prohibitive. <P>I still maintain that this deity-specific items issue is no different than if we added new items restricted by race or class. Sure, I've seen people say that if they ever had the idea that weapons or items would be restricted by deity, then they would have chosen one. However, knowing all the potential aspects of the game prior to playing it is not required in order to play the game. I'm sure that many people started the game with a limited or non-existent understanding of game mechanics. <P>Though I understand the viewpoints that have been presented, we are firm on this design aspect of the game.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032238.html"><b>Lavastorm Design Issues</b></a><br>The gator model has been there forever as a rare spawn. <P>Anyway, when creating a zone we have to decide in advance what type of creatures will populate it. All of the textures associated with the models for those characters have to be loaded into the texture-memory of the video card. <P>So, when planning on putting more creatures in a particular zone, the game designers are limited to the models and textures that already exist in the zone. Yes, it could have been cool to stick a wandering fire-giant in the zone, or something like that, but if the model isn't there, you have to work with what you have.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032283.html"><b>EverQuest Disciplines and Shadowbane Disciplines</b></a><br>"Disciplines" is a term that we've been throwing around here for a while. To be honest, no one on the EQ team was aware that that other project was using a similar term for an aspect of their game until we read it on Lum. <P>After reading about their "Disciplines", the only similarity between ours and theirs is the name. They aren't at all similar in implementation. <P>We'll probably explain what disciplines are in the near future.<P><i><b>[Note from Aurum: A post or two later Verant Sysop-elbrop made the following post clearing some things up:]</b></i><P><UL><i>The term discipline has been used in many RPGs (mostly pen and paper games like Vampire)To claim SB was the first to coin it for rpgs is plain silly.<P>And as the two systems are completely unrelated apart from the name I think you really are just clutching at straws.Of course don&#8217;t let me stop your &#8220;Verant is the devil&#8221; posts but try and pick better subjects to hang your arguments on, this one is just plain ridiculous.</i></UL><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032300.html"><b>Where will Gordon be when Kunark opens?</b></a><br>Well I don't know where I'll be, but we're taking major steps to insure that I'm not here writing a post that begins with "We apol..."<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032291.html"><b>Hailing and Targeting</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: When you target and NPC and hit 'h', you say 'Hail Whoever'. Why can this not also be so when hailing players?]</i><P>That's always bugged me too. I'll ask the guys about it tomorrow. Thanks for reminding me :)<P><i>[Quote from original post: More communication of what's going on to those around you, or at least in your group. I'd like my casters to be able to see me taunting away, and I'd like to see the damage they're doing or not doing with their spells. This would promote trust within the group I'd think]</i><P> We like the idea that people learn to trust that those in their group will do their jobs (such as a warrior taunting), but we also have a technological bias here. Any time we broadcast a message to everyone in a group, that uses bandwidth. Though the amount of bandwidth in use might seem inconsequential, when we take a very frequent occurance like taunting, and multiply it by 50K+ people online at one time, it *really* adds up. <P>The group loot messages, which is the last thing we added a group broadcast for, occur far less frequently than something like a taunt would, definitely uses a good chunk of bandwidth. </UL>

The race is over and here are the results and report from Avalan:<BLOCKQUOTE>All was calm in Lesser Faydark Saturday when a cry shattered the peaceful afternoon, "The Gnomes are coming, The Gnomes are coming!" as nearly 30 gnomes burst forth from the Steamfont zone, feet beating the ground as fast as their little legs could push them. Battles stalled, women screamed and Beasts of all kinds licked their chops as the small horde of Gnaked Gnome Racers streamed by. And so it went from zone to zone, continent to continent as the dwindling number of gnomes strove to reach the gates of Halas and prove that such a quest could be done. One by one and in groups the brave gnomes fell to beasts, raiders and orc, in the Commons, the Karanas and Everfrost as they struggled to reach their goal. <P>Just as race officials were beginning to think that none would survive the ordeal, shouts of "Run Gnome Run!" could be heard echoing through the mountains of Everfrost. Of the 28 racers that started the race, only 7 made it to the Everfrost zone. Exactly 55 minutes after the start of the Antonica leg of the race, the first weary gnome staggered up the ramp to the Halas zone and finished. 22 minutes later the last of the 5 finishers tagged the race official.<P>/ooc This event, sponsored by the Starrwarriors Guild of Tarew Marr had 3 parts. A Sprint from AK'Anon to the end of the docks in Butcher, The main race from ship docking in Freeport to the Halas ramp in Everfrost, and a Last Man Standing Brawl at the end of the race. Winners could select from cash awards and special items for their prizes<P>Winners of the Sprint: <br>1st - GGNocologee (Srik)<br>2nd - GGRumfelt (Wump)<br>3rd - GGRacer (Zenar)<P>Winners of the Race: <br>1st - GGRoper<br>2nd - GGRabkinkin<br>3rd - GGRawinkin<br>Last Man Standing - GGRawinkin<P>GGRevealer (Villad) and GGNefertiti (Pyroth) also finished the race and were rewarded for their efforts.<P>We do not have their names because a representative of their guild collected their prizes, but I would like to give a special tribute to the top three finishers of the race as all were members of the Alliance of Amicus. They have done their guildmates proud. <P>Congratulations all and thanks to all racers, the citizens of Norrath for cheering/cajoling these racers on and to my guildmates for helping make this, our first running of the Gnaked Gnomes, such a successful event.<P>Avalan<br>GM, Starwarrior Guild<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gnome4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Avalan!

More posts have been made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn today.  Here's round two of today's Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032075.html"><b>Server Downtime</b></a><br>We announced several weeks ago that 1 or 2 servers would be coming down for about 4 hours per day for the purpose of performing several upgrades needed for Kunark. Our apologies to those who find this unpalatable, but it has to be done.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032095.html"><b>Religion Matters</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My enchanter started out in the beginning as a worshipper of Erolissi Marr. Another person that I was traveling with at the time, a wizard, started out worshipping Solusek Ro. Around the same time (level 24 I believe), both of our religions were changed to Tunare. We petitioned then and the guide told us they'd log it as a bug, but that there was nothing they could do.]</i><P> There was a bug a while back that would cause the deity name to change spontaneously, but this was just a display bug. It didn't change what deity you actually have selected, because that is based upon a faction that is created at character creation. As for the Deity that is displayed, the GMs were correct in that they do not have the ability to change that. <P>In other words, should a deity-specific item be implemented, it will take into account your original deity, not the one that is displayed now were you affected by that bug.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032260.html"><b>Kerra Items & Erudites</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Ok Abashi, let me see if I've got this right. Kerra Isle has been re-done. GREAT!!! New Items were added that you had to quest for. GREAT!!! Some items are NODROP to prevent farming. GREAT!!<P>All Erudites are hated upon entering. GRE.... HUH?!?!?! This makes absolutly no sense.]</i><P> Sure it does. The Erudites are not known for their kindness, especially to the lesser races. With Kerrans being a tad "lesser" than most, it's not too big of a stretch to imagine that they really don't like the Erudites. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Some of these items are really nice and useful, but being a Erudite means I can never have them.]</i><P> Don't give up so soon. There are ways :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032217.html"><b>Druid Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why have druids not gotten any class specific armor quests as of yet, and will there be in the future?]</i><P> As to "why there isn't any", the answer, as simple as I can make it is the same reason that there aren't quests in other areas that there probably should be: We haven't put them in. Yes, it is entierly possible that we will put in druid class-specific armor at some time, in the same fashion that it is possible that we'll put in class-specific quests for gnome necros, or dark elf clerics. <P>The point I am trying to make is that just because something isn't in at present doesn't mean that we have no intentions of putting it in, just that we haven't put it in *yet*. EQ is an evolving game. New quests go in in nearly every patch. I do imagine however that druid-specific armor hasn't received much priority at this point due to the fact that the of adventured-armor available for them at that level is probably superior to class-specific armor we might put in. <P>Please trust that we have every interest in providing you with the content that will keep you interested and playing. We don't like hearing about people quitting because they feel that they've run out of things to do. <P><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant player bought houses be implamented?]</i><P> At a certain point in the development process the team has to start making decisions in regards to what features will be in the game. This lets them put some ideas to rest while allowing them to spend more time and devote more effort to things that are approved. Back in beta, it was decided that player-owned structures would not be a part of EverQuest, much like horses.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032030.html"><b>Annoying Footstep Sound Bug</b></a><br>The footstep/sound issues should have been fixed in today's patch. Sorry for the problem.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032038.html"><b>Item Crash Bug</b></a><br>Those item-based crash bugs that we implemented with the patch yesterday have been fixed in the patch today. <P>In your particular case, it was the totem that was causing you to crash.</UL>

A very unusual situation took place on the Lanys T'Vyl server recently.  Five guides were stripped of their rank and status and had all of their EQ accounts, guide and regular, banned.  The first report I've decided to post was sent by an anonymous resident of Lanys V'Tyl:  <BLOCKQUOTE>Ozzadyen, Calais, Desmo, Valdul, and Tygira--five Guides--were apparently stripped of their authority and fully banned from Everquest for participating in PVP action with regular players at the Lake Rathetear Arena on Thursday night of Lany's Tvl.  <P>This experience, prior to the banishment of the Guides, showed to us that Guides were players like us, that they cared about us, and that they like to have as much fun as us!<P>Whatever rule the Guides broke by battling players in the Arena does not justify the punishment handed down by Verant! What harm was done? Are Guides never to interact with players outside of either Customer Service Issues or Verant-sanctioned events? What about weddings? In many cased, GMs or Guides preside over or conduct the ceremonies. Will this now be cause for banishment? <P>All people on Lanys are sad to have lost 5 guides. We want them back! </BLOCKQUOTE>The second is a letter that has been written to the public by former Senior Guide Ozzadyen.  Here's a copy of it:<BLOCKQUOTE>I was once known as Ozzadyen a Senior Guide of Povar for a long time and Lanys T`Vyl for a very short time. I devoted almost a year of my time to helping others and giving them some enjoyment. I was released from the program for Improper behavior for going to the Arena and having fun with players on Lanys T`Vyl. <P>Now that I am no longer a part of the Everquest Guide program I can freely speak and I have every intention of doing so. First off Verant was on a Witch hunt to get me removed from the program anyway, because I was very unhappy with what had happened during the Rending of the Veil Part 4 on Xegony and let them know this. It was brought to my attention that there were 2 Councils on Xegony Councils of Light and Councils of Dark. On each of these councils were 5 players for a total of ten players. The Heads of these two councils were guides. At the end of the Veil 4 Quest a member on the Council of Light Allora was awarded the Title and Veeshan Claw. I found this very disturbing and wrong they have 10 Elite players on Xegony now and 1 was awarded a Title and an Artifact know as the Chyrstalline Claw of Veeshan. <P>Now while for the most part the Guide program is not to blame I will miss everyone there I worked with and knew for the last year. Go easy on those Guides, Apprentices and Seniors they are only doing what Verant directs them if they Deviate at all Like I did last night this is what happens to them. I have absolutely no respect for anyone at all in Verants upper Echelon, they rule with an Iron fist and use those in the Guide program without ever thanking them. Should something go wrong they immediately blame this huge Volunteer force they have. These Volunteer Players provide 85% or better of Verants Customer Service on a daily ongoing basis. I was told I was a disgrace I found this very amusing coming from the Upper Echelon of Verant GM staff. There are some GM's that are genuinely great and care about the players, but they are Temporary staff so even they live under the threat of a Hatchet day in and day out if they do not do what they are told.<P>But we learn, and we go on, perhaps you will hear more from me. There were others with me this night who helped provide great entertainment for several players not just 10 Elite ones like on Xegony. To Calais the Gnome Kicker, Tygira is Stark Raving Mad, Valdul, and Desmo, all these Guides, Verant immediately removed from the program, and Suspended their accounts. To them I give my deepest apologizes.  I was the Senior Guide, and had I not gone to the Arena none of the others would have followed because of me they lost there rights and access to there playing accounts I can in no way tell them how sorry I am and repay them for that. They were the best damn people you would have ever wanted to meet. Every last guide I had the pleasure of meeting and working with on Povar and Lanys T`Vyl in the last year were the greatest. The Senior staff and every last soul in the Guide program devote endless hours of devotion and time to help make EQ what it is today and they do this with Thanks from the players and not a single thank you from Verant. So ends the tail of Ozzadyen Servant to Lanys once Ozzadyen Servant to Povar, those always were my titles and I always lived up to them. <P>Now another thing that really gets to me is players are given warnings. As a guide in the program you are given no such Luxury not only was I immediately suspended but every account I had has been suspended, all of them, not just my guide account but every account I have. This fact alone is pretty interesting as a member in Verants CS program you are treated far worse then even the most stubborn player that refuses to share a spawn and disrupts an entire zone, even they are given the common courtesy of only having there one account suspended.<P>Ozzadyen no More.Safe travels in the Lands of Norrath friends and may thee be Karana's flood and wash over thy enemies.</BLOCKQUOTE>Obviously he broke the rules, but after reading this many EverQuest players are asking if such an extreme action was really necessary.  Guides aren't an abundant source.  They devote hours of their time each week to do service to the community.  Good ones are hard to come by, and harder to keep.  Certainly a program as important and vital to EverQuest must have rules, but because of one insignificant and pointless incident good guides can be banned instantly and without a second thought? <P>To voice your opinion of this issue please leave a news comment or visit a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5427887&replies=0">specially created board thread</a> on the Player Views Board.
