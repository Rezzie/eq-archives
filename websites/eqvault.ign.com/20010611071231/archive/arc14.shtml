I'm doing a story about people who play massive, multi-player <br>online role playing games and was interested in talking to guilds or clans <br>based in the metro Atlanta area. The story will be published in the paper <br>on Wednesday, March 7, and I need to interview several people as soon as <br>possible. I'm interested in talking to everyone regardless of race, creed <br>or color or whether you play Asheron's Call, Diablo, Ultima Online or <br>EverQuest. I've already talked to several guys who play, and I'm especially <br>interested in female gamers to help round out my story. Also if anyone has <br>an interesting anecdote about how these games have changed their lives for <br>better or worse, I want to hear from you. Please call me at 404 526-5882, <br>or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:lharris@ajc.com">lharris@ajc.com</a>.

From PlanetEverQuest:<blockquote>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/022701/index.shtml">EQ Quiz centers on Rogues</a>.  What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure.  But what sneaky things are they doing when you aren't around?  Are they perhaps gaining your trust and confidence only to stab you in the back later because someone put out an assassination notice on your head? Perhaps they are sneaking a quick peek (and hand) into your pockets when you're not looking.<br><br>This "just for fun" test will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the live cuisinart blade masters of Norrath.  Skill with the dagger isn't all that rogues do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about these stealthy assassins.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Auric Flamewalker <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233.html">wrote up an extensive post</a> on the rules and policies enforced on the official boards:<UL><i>Hail and well met all.<br><br>I have seen recently many questions regarding why a post was closed or deleted. The main reason we close or delete a thread is when it is an attack on one person or a group of people. Below are the guidelines for posting on this forum. Please read through this carefully if you post frequently on this board. Any posts that do not meet the criteria below will be deleted or closed. Any infraction of these rules can result in warnings issued to your Everquest accout, suspension or banning of your Everquest account, depending on severity of the offense.<br><br>1.0 Official EverQuest Forums<br>This section of the FAQ is primarily concerned with the Official EverQuest forums, and the conduct that is considered appropriate and inappropriate when posting to those forums.<br><br>Q: What is the purpose of the Official EverQuest forums?<br>The Official EverQuest Forums exist as a place for EverQuest players to gather and discuss issues related to EverQuest. Some forums (e.g. Customer Service, General Discussion, Quality Assurance) are visited frequently by official representatives regularly, and serve as a place for players to communicate with some of the various EverQuest teams (e.g. Development, QA, and Customer Service). These forums allow us, as developers, the opportunity to discuss issues that the players feel are important.<br><br>Q: Who may post on the Official EverQuest Forums?<br>In the initial implementation, "Customer Service / Technical Help" will be open to the public. While anyone may read all of the forums, the remaining forums will only allow posts from active EverQuest account holders.<br><br>Q: Why is posting to the Official EverQuest Forums restricted?<br>While we would like to keep posting open to everyone regardless of their account status, in the past, the official EverQuest forums have had some problems maintaining a suitable posting environment due to the relative anonymity of the posters. With little to no tangible reason to keep posting behavior in check, some posters took advantage of the anonymity provided by the forums to post often vulgar and otherwise inappropriate material on the boards.<br>As EverQuest is a family game, with people of all ages participating in the gaming community, we as developers have a responsibility to maintain a suitable environment to the best of our ability. The only way to accomplish this goal in regards to the Official Forums is to reduce the relative anonymity of the forums, thus allowing us to eject posters who post material that is inappropriate for public consumption.<br><br>Q: I'm concerned about security of my account. If I must log in with a valid Station Name to post, doesn't that give someone half of the key needed to hack my account?<br>No. Though you will be logging in (through a secure connection) with your valid station name and password, the station name will not be displayed. Instead, entirely within our local network, the Station login server will connect to the registered account database and obtain the "Chat Handle". This is a unique identifier that you chose when creating your EverQuest account.<br>All posts made to the board in restricted forums will display your "Chat Handle" rather than your "Station Name". Should you wish to change your Chat Handle, you can do so within the EverQuest chat server. Type #help within the chat server for a list of commands.<br><br>Q: What are the rules for posting in these forums?<br>As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The Station, posting to these forums is bound by The Station's Terms of Service that can be found in their entirety at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml</a> <br><br>In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that apply to the EverQuest Forums.<br>In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting. This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum.<br><br>You may not, however, post any material that:<br>&#61623; Attacks or insults others on the board.

Alan made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-6.html">several comments</a> on a Cleric thread located on the Gameplay Board:<UL><b><i>Oouz wrote:</b></i><br><br>"Im sorry but I just have to ask you Alan, can Verant ever be wrong?"<br><br><b><i>Of course. We make mistakes like everyone else. The point here is not that we are absolutely right, but that we don't think it's completely wrong. There might need to be some tuning done to this change. But the change itself isn't wrong. Having monsters nearly ignore the fact that there is a healer restoring the life to its enemies is wrong, both in terms of consistency within the game world and for the mechanics of the AI.<br><br>Suro wrote:</b></i><br><br>"1) Encounters involving one or two mobs that are below the 50th level cap."<br><br><b><i>I just wanted to clear this up. The 51st level thing is based on the person being healed, it has nothing to do with the level of the NPC. I just wanted to point this out because so many people have been getting this wrong.<br><br>Tfodthog Tmfof wrote:</b></i><br><br>CH is a 10k heal it doesnt check the amount of points the target needs and only send that. It dumps massive hp at the target. The target is healed to max hp. Low level heals always agro on the hp sent by the spell not by how many hp the target needed. So the logic posted on your "PATCH" is broken. Is the logic in your Code?<br><br><b><i>Actually, you are incorrect. The maximum healing of the spell is never looked at, only the points actually healed.<br><br>LetoII wrote:</b></i><br><br>Absor, this is just sad. You've stated that the change was made because clerics were bored with the old heal/med routine.<br><br><b><i>No, I didn't. This change was made because healing was being almost ignored by the NPCs. The mechanic was broken. I've never said anything about this being done as something to make a cleric's life more interesting.<br><br>Renic_TdS wrote:</b></i><br><br>I think the main problem we have is that the Verant of today seems very reluctant to say: <br>"We made a mistake" <br>or <br>"Hmm maybe the change isnt in the interest of those who pay our wages" <br>They are terrified of saying anything like: <br>"We are going to changes things back to the way we were because we were wrong, and its what our customers want<br><br><b><i>Not at all. If we make a mistake we are not afraid to apologize for it. And we are always looking out for the game as a whole. But we are not in the position where we can just respond to every customer request by doing as asked. What we do for one customer has the potential to affect all customers. So, unfortunately, we have to say no to some customers, especially when their request would adversely affect other customers.<br><br>Making the game the better is in the best interest of all customers. When making changes to game mechanics that don't work properly, that's what we have to consider as out first priority. The only thing that I can tell you right now is that we are looking at the effects of this change. If something needs to be changed to make the game better, we'll do it.</b></i><br><br>Im quite passionate about this, and normally I jus sit and read quietly and dont get involved. This time I cant just sit by and watch..... <br>Only problem is, many of us are reluctant to say <br>"I quit" <br>but Im getting there........<br><br><b><i>And we appreciate your passion, we share it.

Pathing being one of the major ones that comes to mind. Now with that statement I'm positive you're all going to put your little heads together and fix them ALL yes? But I pray when you do it you actually do a thorough test and determine exactly how the fixes will affect all aspects of the game and take those into consideration cause you failed miserable at doing that on this 'fix'.<br><br><b><i>Well, there is a difference between a broken game mechanic and a technological problem. Bad pathing is not a problem with the game mechanic, it's a problem with the execution of that mechanic. That doesn't mean that such things shouldn't be fixed, I just wanted to be as clear as possible on my point.<br><br>As for not seeing all of the long range repercussions of this change, that's always possible. In a way, it's not being able to see far enough out that probably caused healing aggro to be way too low for all this time.<br><br>ciberido wrote:</b></i><br><br>To claim that the whole issue is merely people overreacting, and thus to dismiss so high-handedly the claims made by people who have played their clerics and have died because of the nerf, however, is a slap in the face.<br><br><b><i>That isn't my claim. As I have said, there may indeed be an issue in certain situations, and we are looking at that. But there is an undeniable affect that happens with things like this. There is a snowball thing, one person claims that something has been done to make something really bad and before others have even tried it out, they are agreeing and insisting that it be 'fixed'. This becomes a problem for us. We need feedback on the game. This sort of thing, however, is not feedback, it is misinformation.<br><br>All I was saying was that if people want to provide feedback, please do so. We're reading as many of these posts as we can. But posting something that basically says, 'I haven't even played since the change, but the change is bad', isn't very convincing as feedback.<br><br>Keep posting your experiences, we are reading them. And we are certainly aware of your concerns. We are looking at all of this keeping your responses in mind. I'll keep you informed about any decisions we make.<br><br>Alan</b></i></UL>

Banegrivm announced the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings, <br><br>      I wanted to take this time out to make everyone aware of the Druzzil <br>Ro Alliance. What is the Druzzil Ro Alliance? The Druzzil Ro Alliance is a <br>collection of Guilds on the Druzzil Ro Server that have formed together for <br>the purpose of doing high level dungeons, planes, and dragons, without having <br>the necessity of being in a high level guild. With such an alliance all the <br>participating guilds remain in their present guild and are never forced to <br>lose their guild tag. This way they are not forced into giving up their home <br>or their friendships with those they have grown to know and love, and still <br>get to play the game...on their own terms. <br><br>      Their is now an option for those that want to be involved in the high <br>level end of the game. No longer will people be forced to be in a guild with <br>people they do not care to associate with on a daily basis. Now people will <br>have the option of remaining within the confines of their guild and doing <br>said raids and staying in their home without ever losing their guild tag. <br>When raids are conducted no guild will ever demand any guild member from the <br>alliance ever to disband from their guild for the purpose of the raid. All <br>those in the raid remain tagged into their guild for the conductivity of the <br>raid. No one ever loses their guild tag under any conditions where it <br>corresponds to the Druzzil Ro Alliance and its operations with regards to <br>raiding. <br><br>      The Druzzil Ro Alliance has also come up with some base policies such <br>as looting and simply working together as a team. The later will force guild <br>leaders to be guild leaders and help to keep relations friendly between <br>guilds. Not everyone will see eye to eye one hundred percent of the time, but <br>that does not mean we can not be civil and respectable and try our best to <br>bring about an honest and honorable resolve to whatever the situation may be. <br>In short the Druzzil Ro Alliance is in it for fun. We pay monthly fees a <br>month to have fun, so fun we shall have, and what better way to do it then <br>with our friends. <br><br>      If you are a respective guild leader and interested in joining the <br>Druzzil Ro Alliance please visit the forums at www.druzzilroalliance.cjb.net <br>and read the looting rules under the General Discussion forums. If you agree <br>with these rules then please leave a post in the General Discussion forums <br>requesting to join and you shall be prompty added to the Druzzil Ro Alliance. <br>Please make sure you leave your website URL if applicable in the post so we <br>may add it as a link. This way anyone interested in being in a guild apart of <br>the alliance will have an easier time in chosing a guild in which they can <br>call their home. <br><br>      If you have a greivance with an alliance member and wish to enter your <br>guild into the alliance please leave said greivance at the door upon <br>entering. No one will hold anything upon any other alliance members. The past <br>is simply the past and this is a new beginning for us all. As well, no one <br>will be refused admittance into the alliance as well...so long as they agree <br>to the loot rules. We shall endeavor in all things to enjoy our company, and <br>our fellowship, and the game we have come to know as EverQuest. Here it is an <br>even playing field, and for us involved it shall be our fun and our enjoyment <br>of the game. To those of you who may be joining you are welcomed with open <br>arms. May the gods and godesses bless you in the days ahead, and may the <br>hunting begin. <br><br><br>Sincerely Yours, <br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>Member of the Druzzil Ro Alliance - <a href="http://www.druzzilroalliance.cjb.net">http://www.druzzilroalliance.cjb.net</a> <br>Banegrivm@aol.com </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

Straight off of the Gameplay Board, here is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061242.html"><b>Tracking Problem: Bug or Working as Intended?</b></a><br>Dun wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This post is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Druid cap was raised on TEST SERVER. No changes to Druid tracking have been made to live servers. Please stop posting this kind of inaccurate nonsense.]</i></font><br><br>True, this is only on Test right now. And you folks all need to be aware that stuff on Test will not always go live. <br><br>But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community. <br><br>So the plan is to raise the Druid cap so that they are still better at tracking than Bards. That's the plan anyway.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061249-2.html"><b>Whiniest Class in Norrath Poll</b></a><br>Sorry folks, but I'm closing this one.

I have no desire to. My idea of fun is not "One heal and die". As a matter of fact, after being disgusted with the changes in the patch message, I've logged in for a total of about 25 minutes.]</i></font><br><br>And therein lies the problem. <br><br>Far too many people are not trying the new changes out. I hate to do this, but let's look at the Evade. Some Rogues were convinced that the changes we made to Evade were going to make them worthless, long before they had a chance to play with it. 'One backstab and die'. It turns out that they are, if not excited about the change, accepting of it. But only now that they've actually played with it. <br><br>Please, play the game. See what we've done. We want feedback from people that have tried it out. You do yourself and your fellow players a disservice with posts like this. <br><br>Thanks to those of you that have played with the changes. As you continue to play with them, and as your tactics evolve (and we know that you'll find good ones), let's talk about the effects of this change.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061474.html"><b>NPCs and Inventory</b></a><br>Lieah wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No where does any NPC state that a general inventory lot was to be opened. Are they encouraging us to read the spoilers then? How psychic did I have to be to know this? I find it appauling that they would be so inconsiderate to a customer like that. Its just a game, let me have my fun and give my item back, this is pathetic.]</i></font><br><br>I'm sorry that you lost your item. But in the case where the NPCs is going give you a container you must have an open inventory slot for that container. This is something that most people understand by the time they've played long enough to be trying to complete an epic quest. We've posted about this, and I'm pretty sure that this was also placed on a patch message. <br><br>I wanted to take this opportunity to stress this again. If you are completing a quest, any quest, make certain that you have an inventory slot open to receive any items that are given to you by the NPC. It is recommended that you keep a few open, just in case.</UL>

Here's the last response Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060839.html">posted so far today on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL>Lets say I have a level 25 Warrior fully buffed. They pull 4 mobs and make sure they hit them all. Then the cleric casts CH and the mobs all aggro onto the cleric. If someone puts a dam shield on the cleric the mobs will all die and the warrior will get credit.<br>It also means that although we can't kill the top mobs anymore, we have now given Clerics the BEST area taunt in the game. If the mobs can't summon, the cleric can do a CH and as long as the cleric is faster than the MOB [snares?] stay out of range. The other party memebers attack the mobs. When the aggro off the cleric the cleric does CH again.<br><br>I haven't had time to think this out yet, but I bet Verant didn't even give it a thought.
