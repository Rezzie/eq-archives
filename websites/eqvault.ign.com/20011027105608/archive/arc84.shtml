<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon has been busy on the Gameplay Board lately.  Here's all the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051774.html"><b>Iksar Faction Issues</b></a><br>It's not a bug. Iksar have some serious faction issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051785.html"><b>"Gordon Caught in a Lie" Thread Deleted</b></a><br>I deleted it. <br><br>The message "quoted" two things that I never said, neither in letter nor in spirit. I figure if someone is going to have the nerve to call someone a liar, they should at least get their facts straight. Besides, I really have enough work clarifying the things that I did say, let alone the things that I don't. <br><br>Now if someone wants to ask if I said "XXXX" or request clarification when I said "XXXX", feel free. But don't come on the boards declaring as fact that I said something that I didn't, calling me a liar for it.<br>-------<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: We're still considering these issues. Though we don't want to see level 60 folk bottom feeding on dragons, we don't necessarily want to buff them all up either. We'll come up with something, but everyone will have to wait for the release of the expansion to see what that is]</i> <br><br>Actually that quote was specifically about Dragons. We have something in mind for that, and wanted to get it in at launch, but had to put it off for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if you see something happen along those lines in the near future. <br><br>As for the Planes, I believe that I said that we are sensitive to everyone's feelings concerning the planes and that we had no plans at that time to upgrade their difficulty. <br><br>That's still accurate. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: But just like the rest of your post, you leave room for error on your part]</i> <br><br>Error, changed minds, reevaluation, etc., sure. Nothing is absolute in this business except for the fact that nothing is absolute. Things change, ideas are refined, and arguments are analyzed. "should", "might", "probably", and "may" do not mean "will" and shouldn't be taken as such. <br><br>We have to be flexible to remain responsive.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051758.html"><b>Balance and Equality</b></a><br>This thread appears to be going along quite well without me, but I did want to comment on this quote. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: If a wizard and a warrior are balanced, they are both about equal in power level.]</i> <br><br>Actually, offensive power is only one component in the equation. Usefulness to a group is another, which leads to versitility. Versitility is a big one, meaning that classes that are very versitile may not be as offensively powerful or useful to the group as another class in a specific role. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051765.html"><b>Faction Messages</b></a><br>I'm not sure who you may have been speaking to or what they meant, but the information isn't correct. Faction messages are all printed, though it is certainly possible for someone to be unaware of the particular faction that an NPC is on.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051705.html"><b>More Fun Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have been thinking lately that there should be more "fun" spells in the game.. Spells that dont' neccisarily (misspelled) have a purpose in the game other than to play around with.]</i> <br><br>I do like the idea of fun spells, and would like to have more of them around. We have several in now, including a line of magician summons that are there for fun. Of course, one of the problems with fun spells is that people have an expectation that all spells should be "useful", with "useful" being defined as something that helps advancement in one form or the other. <br><br>It would be interesting to hear how many would like to see more fun spells of this nature in the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051678.html"><b>Favorite Class Duo</b></a><br>Though every situation is different, I've personally been fond of the Necro/Rogue combo. The necro ability to both debuff movement rates and fear lets the rogue do a heck of a lot of damage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051492.html"><b>Reforming Guildes</b></a><br>As far as getting the guild reformed, that will only happen if the guild leader comes on and does it himself. <br><br>Once a guild is created, the person who created it has rights to the name, and can create or disband it on other servers as he sees fit. Ownership of guilds is system-wide, not server-based.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051640.html"><b>Lost a Level</b></a><br>I suppose that it might be possible that whatever problem disabled the use of spells also affected the experience attached to the corpses of anyone who died at the time. The GM Staff, however, are the ones who would determine this and decide what reimbursements if any would be awarded. <br><br>You'll really need to contact them per the Guide's advice.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051667.html"><b>Moving Characters Between Accounts</b></a><br>We've spoken about it. Moving characters between accounts just opens up too many loopholes where the ability could be used for something other than intended. Though I do indeed sympathize with those who are in this boat, there are too many ways around any verification that we could do to insure that the transfers aren't being used for illegal sales of characters. <br><br>I do apologize to those who we cannot service in this matter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051482.html"><b>Death Penalty Comments</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can see a fair amount, but let's face it the death penalty in this game stinks!]</i> <br><br>Drootes, if the death penalty did not hurt, it wouldn't be a penalty. If everyone was happy with it, then it wouldn't be serving it's function. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: The death penalty is completely wrong and needs to be more in line with reality.]</i> <br><br>Now *that* would be extreme :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051430.html"><b>Couple of Questions Answered</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: GM's can do an Exp res when there is a game play problem right? Well then why do you have exp loss (you still don't get all your exp, but most), you still get res effects, and you lose all your mana and most of your HP. If a GM has determined that you deserve a GM res, why not have it a full, no strings attached res?]</i> <br><br>The process that attaches the "Resurrection Effects" is on the back end of the resurrection code. At the time that the effects are applied, all it knows is that you have been resurrected, not by what spell, which is why it's attached to all resurrections. I agree that this is a bit of a pain, and I'll see if we might have another way to determine what kind of Rez has been cast. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2.) What is with all the random faction hits in the Lake of Ill Omen?]</i> <br><br>They aren't precisely random. They occur when you are on the hatelist of a creature killed by another group. Basically, it's part of the Hatelist propagation issue described here a few days ago. <br><br>For instance, you attack NPC A, who yells for help to NPC B, who yells for help to NPC C. NPCs A and B are close enough to you to chase after you, however NPC C is not. NPC C wanders around the zone and yells for help to NPCs D, E, F, and G, who are all too far away to come after you. However, since they all have a copy of the hatelist, whenever they are killed you will take a faction hit.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051447.html"><b>Massive Spell Glitch?</b></a><br>I've heard about the serverwide-spell failures, it affected servers on one of our ISPs. Players having a problem should camp out and log back on, or zone to restore their spell casting abilities. <br><br>Please be cautious in play until the issue is resolved. Our Ops team is working on it as we speak. <br><br>Players who were killed may petition for a resurrection.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051424.html"><b>PVP Comments</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'm sorry....by taking away a benefit to non "gankers" who can bind isn't going to be a fair solution. Part of what makes having a cleric/necro who can bind in a area close to where you are doing a dungeon raid to get a rez is to lower down time. If on PvP, you in sense want to increase down time because a few "exploiters" want to ruin the game, then you are causing more problems than you are fixing.]</i> <br><br>The challenge has always been to add PvP as a viable option without adversely affecting or trivializing the PvE (Player versus Environment) aspects of the game. That said, PvP needs to have risk associated with it. Since item loot creates a caster/melee risk disparity, and since coin-loot is only a negligible risk, and since experience loss isn't going to happen, restricting binding might might be the best way to go.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051383.html"><b>PvP Suggestion Response</b></a><br>Being very honest with you, any type of experience loss for PvP deaths is not at all likely to be put in EQ. The GM/Guide staff is already inundated with requests for customer service based upon harassment even though there is substantially little risk. The core engine of EQ cannot support the changes that would be necessary in order to implement experience-loss on PvP in an equitable manner. <br><br>That said, I do recognize the need for risk in PvP. One idea that I'm partial to is making it so that binding is *only* allowed in cities, regardless of class. That would encourage people to win battles, punish them if they lose, and be fair for both melee and casters from a PvP perspective. <br><br>Thoughts?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051108-4.html"><b>Robe of the Lost Circle</b></a><br>Scaevola certainly has my sympathies for the whole situation. <br><br>Here's what happened for those interested: <br><br>1. Scaevola fails to make the Robe of the Lost Circle. Of course, at this time, there is a chance of failure. The fact that I posted that we're removing this skill check the next time we patch items has no bearing on what is in game now. The failure isn't a bug, but rather a poor decision on the part of the quest designer. These happen from time to time.<br>2. A GM gives him a robe. This was a mistake on the part of the GM who thought that failure was a bug.<br>3. The GM later finds out it wasn't a bug and takes the robe back. This was probably also a mistake, as the GM should probably have let him keep the robe then deal with future requests for serivce along these lines by admitting that he'd made a mistake. Of course, what he wanted to avoid was a bunch of peopel deciding to go and make their robe under the mistaken impression that they'd get reimbursed if it failed. <br><br>All of that said, giving the robe back to Scaevola at this point would be a further mistake, as things are now the way they were back before the GM got involved. <br><br>I certainly apologize to Scaevola for the whole series of events.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050986.html"><b>When can I buy the expansion upgrade again?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Am I correct in that since the release of Kunark, there has been no way for someone who already owns Everquest to buy a copy without re-purchasing the entire game?]</i> <br><br>Yes, that's the case. The "Online Store" was taken down shortly after Kunark launched due to some distribution, billing, and shipping issues. We're still working on these. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please tell me that's not the case and where I can buy the expansion.]</i> <br><br>If you need it right away, the only option currently available is purchase of the retail box, who's key you can use to upgrade your existing account. I've heard that a few retailers are offering some pretty sizable rebates to existing EQ subscribers, so you should be able to get it near the expansion-upgrade price.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051330.html"><b>Feign Death</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Today i used one of my spells that is supposed to save my life at least once in a while. I was in Karnor's catle and 4 drolvgar were pulled when i was not in a group yet. 2 died and i went oom and very low health so i feigned and checked to see if it worked. It worked both were indifferent to me.]</i> <br><br>Every experience I've had with feign death indicates that it either works, or it doesn't. This is the first I've heard of it working, the person having the item to /con each creature that was on them, then it breaking for no reason. <br><br>Possible reasons it might have happened: <br><br>1. Another mob came into range and wasn't fooled. <br>2. Perhaps hit by an AE spell? (haven't never been hit by one while feighed before, I'm not sure if this would do it.)<br>3. It's possible that the critters might get several chances to see through it if they are just standing around. I'll check into this tomorrow.<br>4. Some bug? <br>1-3 would not be bugs if it is one of those that was happening. <br><br>Please remember that creatures do not get a direct save versus feign. If you get a "fallen to the ground" message, none of them are fooled. If you do not get that message, you have then fooled them subject to a low percentage chance of the creature making it's intelligence check. <br><br>You do, however, get an indication if a creature isn't fooled, it keeps beating on you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048669-2.html"><b>Spawn Rate Question</b></a><br>If that's indeed what has to be done, it does sound a bit out-of-whack. I've forwarded this thread to the Live team for them to check it out.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050361.html"><b>TZ/VZ Question </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: My question is this - say 15ppl from TZ ask to move to VZ yet 600ppl ask to move from VZ to TZ. Are you still going to allow that switch to take place?]</i> <br><br>That's a good question, and we're still tabulating numbers here. If the move shows a complete imbalance in those wanting to move from one to the other, we may reevaluate the decision. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: and then he continues "and I don't like the idea of moving, but I"m so tired of the prophets,"]</i> <br><br>I would be interested in hearing how many people registered to move from VZ to TZ in order to get away from a guild on VZ.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046393.html"><b>Are GM Ressurections constrained by 49 cleric spell?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: GM ressurections constrained by 49 cleric spell...]</i> <br><br>No, they are not. They return 100% of the experience lost. They used to be constrained, not by the 49th cleric rez, but by the XP modifier for the zone. All rez's were constrained by this. <br><br>It was corrected a few months ago. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2- The 49th level cleric spell has a 2 hour time limit on xp return.]</i> <br><br>All rez's have this two hour limit, not just the 49th cleric rez. We're currently looking into the possibility of having the GM Rez excluded from this time limit, but it's difficult, so I don't have an ETA. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, when you make a petition and log out, that petition is cleared.]</i><br> <br>No, it's not. Petitions are held for several hours before they expire.</UL>

I received the following from Barthalo:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hear Ye! Hear Ye what the Draken and Elder Dragons have to tell!<br><br>On the 21st of this month the two guilds &#8220;Draken&#8221; and &#8220;Elder Dragons&#8221; have planned a great event in the forest of Faydark to celebrate the first birthday of both guilds. So we invite every brave adventurer who is willing to join our peaceful party. <br><br>The party will start at 8 a.m. (PST) at the wizard gate near Felwithe. You will find there a exquisite meal to everyone of you and beside this we planned for the young adventurers (level 1-9) of you a special challenge to award the brave warrior who knows Faydwer best.<br><br>We hope to have a lot of guests who will celebrate the first birthday of these two guilds with us.<br><br><br>( Important: Because both guilds are German speaking only guilds we decide to use this language mainly on this event. This makes it easier for some of our members who are not too good in English. But of course we have some members who have no problems with the English language. So they will translate it roughly and as good as they can. The challenge is planned in German but we translate it in English as well if demanded so that every one has the possibility to take action in it. I hope everyone will be satisfied with it)<br><br><br>May Tunare watch you<br><br>Barthalo Edhelorn<br>Dragon Master of the Elder Dragons</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Felwan Silverblade informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail,<br><br>Last night, I was strolling around west commons when I heard a shout from a<br>man named Jeroth asking if any warriors, paladins, or shadowknights were up<br>to a challenge, a test of honor.  Well, feeling that if I didn't respond my<br>honor would be in question, I answered his request and was then told that I<br>was the one who would face the challenge.  I met Jeroth in the corner of<br>commons near the shadowmen camp and he proceeded to tell me what was in<br>store.  I found out that I was to face his 3 brothers, one at a time, in a<br>battle to the death.  Once I killed the first brother, I was to return the<br>amulet wore around his neck back to Jeroth and would then receive my clue as<br>to the location of the next brother.  Also, I was able to choose a team of<br>companions to aid my in my fight.  Well, I choose friends that were near,<br>Carbo, Stratten, Taycie, Kaetlyn, and Canalon agreed to help me and we were<br>off to the desert of North Ro to kill the first brother.  After that fight,<br>we returned and were told to meet the next in Kithicor, and after that<br>battle, my final brother to meet was in lava storm.<br><br>The first brother's name was Drewyn Wyndsteel and he was a warrior as<br>myself.  The second brother was a monk by the name of Zev Thunderfis.  The<br>third and final brother was an evil dark elf shadowknight by the name of<br>Dalesk V'Syrn.  All three were difficult competitors, but all three died by<br>the end of my blades.  Upon returning to Jeroth after the third brother, I<br>was told I would face my final confrontation in the Arena in West Freeport<br>and this battle was to be me alone.  Well, we all assembled in Freeport and<br>after some problems with some over zealous guards, I was in the arena ready<br>to face my final battle.  My opponent was the Spirit of Honor, and I was no<br>match for his obvious powers.  I knew my doom was pending, so I saluted the<br>Spirit before he made the final blow, and was told to STOP fighting.  He<br>congratulated me for passing all the trials and two more spirits showed up,<br>the Spirit of Fury and the Spirit of Heart.  I was congratulated by all<br>three spirits, and was then awarded a blade, the Blade of Champions.  I<br>vowed to do my best to uphold the name of this mighty blade and thanked the<br>Spirits who had gathered to test me.<br><br>I am honored that I was chosen to take place in this test, and I am<br>greateful for all those that helped.  I wanted to take a moment to thank<br>everyone who followed me around to all the different spots and congratulated<br>me in the end.  Thanks.<br><br><br>Felwan Silverblade<br>Emerald Warrior of Solidaire<br>Lanys server<br><br>/ooc This was a blast!!!  I loved the shouting matches with those that were<br>playing the brothers before each fight as I had to hunt them down.  I really<br>want to thank my group that helped me out, couldn't have done it without<br>them.  I've included 3 links to screenshots, one of the Spirits and 2 of my<br>new sword.

Here are more excerpts and quotes written by Gordon Wrinn and found on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051376.html"><b>TestEverQuest.exe</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: What gives? Was this a mistake during the recent client upgrade I think I heard about? Ive never had access to the test server before, and I dont think I do now, so where in heck did the shortcut (and corresponding executable) come from?]</i> <br><br>"Testeverquest.exe" is the patch program and loader that will give you access to the test server. The shortcut has probably been on your desktop all along, or, perhaps someone else on your system put it up there for you. <br><br>As for logging in, the entire interface is the same except for the server-selection screen, which will only list the Test server as a valid server. I would imagine that if you had problems logging in, though I'm not sure at what point you had those problems, it may be because the Test server goes up and down frequently to put in the newest changes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051372.html"><b>Mother of All Whines</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: heh, verants been aware of the alchemy problem since last year and they STILL havent touched it]</i> <br><br>Er, after we (finally) relized that there was a problem training the skill, alchemy as a whole was revamped. In addition, prices are being lowered. The changes that didn't go in in the last item patch will go in in the next. <br><br>All of this was "touched" since last year.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051362.html"><b>Procs on RoK Stuff</b></a><br>All those who can wield the sword are melee types. The addition of the mace allowed some other classes, not melee in nature, to obtain and use an item with a similar effect. The SSoY proc's sooner because it is only for classes that deal their damage primarily with weapons. <br><br>There is also the matter of the higher ratio as someone else here mentioned.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051366.html"><b>Rogue's Hide/Sneak Messed Up?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I play a rogue and a necro why is it that when my rogue hides and camp he is visible when i log back on but this doesnt happen to my necro invis spell? when my rogue zones he is not hidden but by necro is invis?]</i> <br><br>Much like illusions, "sneak" will not cross a zone border. Camping is equivalent to a zone border from a funcationality standpoint, which is why the same behavior is observed. It's not a bug, but rather the way it works. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: when I hide next to a Bard in my group his song brakes my hide... but the caster siting next to him is still invis?...]</i> <br><br>For this issue, we're looking into changing hot it works. This also goes for the similar issues with caster invis.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051370.html"><b>Bugs on the Board</b></a><br>Hello all, <br><br>Every once in a while someone will post all of the reproduction steps necessary for our test department to investigate an exploitable bug, and "bump" the post in hopes of it getting acknowledged. <br><br>Though I do appreciate the fact that you want to bring the issue to our attention, and I do forward the issues to the test team, I generally won't reply to a report of that nature here on the boards as I don't want to call the attention to it, thus spreading the information across the net. <br><br>I would ask that if you have something that is exploitable, meaning that it can be used to harm other players or allow unreasonable gains for the user, please email it to <a href="mailto:eqtesting@verant.com">eqtesting@verant.com</a>, rather than posting it here on the boards.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051154.html"><b>Concordance Still Having Trouble?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Although the leggings did combine once to make a rune, 3 attempts failed to combine to make anything. Losing your quill is a bummer not say the trouble of having to go find a burned out lightstone.]</i> <br><br>Hmmm, I haven't heard of any intermittent problems in this regard. If a recipe works once, and does not check a skill, it should always work. The caveat here is that it is assumed that there isn't another item, with the same name, in game, that isn't accounted for in our tables. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can't help but think it is some perverse design built into the game that when I wanted a GLS, all I ever saw were burned out ones. Now when I need a burned out lightstone all I ever get are GLS's.]</i> <br><br>We have Murphy on retainer as a consultant. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have noticed that the ring-mail components for making Study runes (beza) are more expensive then those required to make Expert runes (beza). Was this intentional? You can buy a ringmail braclet from a merchant for 5pp. I try to aquire my own components when possible. Sometimes this is very boring as I am hunting and killing stuff that is 20 levels lower then I am, but that is the way of it. When I have the extra cash I buy from players, and if the pickings are slim and I am in a hurry I buy from the merchants.]</i> <br><br>It's not by value as much as it is by difficulty to obtain the item. In this case, I believe the ringmail pieces all have the same chances to drop as any other piece, so the real "value" from a game-mechanics standpoint is equal. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051114.html"><b>No Rogue Trainers in Evil Kunark Outpost	</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone else find it odd that there are no rogue trainers or quest givers in the dark elf outpost? The Hall of the Ebon Mask should have every reason to want to set up station there. Besides, it gets damned annoying having to travel all the way back to Neriak from Overthere whenever I level. :P]</i> <br><br>Bankers and guildmasters on the island is really an artifact from the beta period, when testers on Kunark couldn't leave those lands. When it went live, we basically forgot to remove them. The missing guildmasters are ones that were mistakingly neglected when setting up the outpost. In this case, we've decided not to remove them. <br><br>The point that I'm getting to here is that Kunark was not meant to be a self-contained environment that noone would ever leave. At present, we're not planning on adding the missing guildmasters. As I mentioned a few months ago, deciding that we aren't going to "nerf" something doesn't mean that we will be elevating everything else to the same level. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051088.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br>The Hole is looking good. It's being populated and itemized right now. We'll be putting it up on the Test server when we are ready for tuning. <br><br>As for that 49th Paladin spell, I've asked for a progress update. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051103.html"><b>Being Happy</b></a><br>Thanks for your input JasTiger. I appreciate your opinion, and understand what you are trying to get at. But please understand that there is no universal definition of "happy". Things that might make one person happy might upset 100 others. On virtually any subject, you can find people who will agree or disagree. <br><br>Our goal is to keep as many people as possible as "happy" as possible for as long as possible. Just as there are people who joined the game and decided that they didn't like it in a few weeks, there are others who've been playing since it was released. Trust me that if there was a way that we could insure 100% of the people would be pleased, within the guidelines of our goal, we'd take that course.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051097.html"><b>Kunark Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The drops in Kunark of cash are pathetic, every decent item costs THOUSANDS of plat on Veeshan, and there is NO way to get this kind of money together after nerfing the dwarfs, except by camping rare spawns or HGs, and competeing w lvl 30 characters for kills. I have hunted blue con mobs in almost every outdoor kunark zone and they all drop liek 3sp and a TON of cp drops, WTF is that when you kill 10 lvl 40 mobs and get 11cp a piece?]</i> <br><br>It is true that cash drops in general are getting lower. In addition to the Kunark zones all being set up to drop less cash, other zones are likewise being modified. "Cash Cows", such as the dwarves in Butcherblock that used to drop an average of 27pp every six minutes, are being identified and adjusted. <br><br>Good items cost "thousands of plat" because of the amount of excess cash in the world. As the money sinks take their toll, the price of the items will drop to a level of equilibrium with the current cash drops. It shows that money is becoming more valuable.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051087.html"><b>Stance Against Responding to Class-Envy Posts</b></a><br>Thanks for your comments MrDete. Your advice is well-received. Please also understand though that everyone can come up with well-grounded issues for each class, which they honestly feel is a deal-breaker. The downside of this is if we could wave our hands and resolve all of the issues raised, the resolution of those issues would create other issues that other people would likewise feel need to be resolved. <br><br>Suppose for an instant that class A feels that they are less powerful than class B. Class B might at the same time feel that they are less powerful than class C. The process of elevating class A, in a manner that they feel would "balance" them with Class B would often leave Class B feeling that they are overpowered by A and C. <br><br>This process is played out over and over here on the boards, and will probably be a source of debate for years to come. Often the best course of action is not to engage in discussions where we are faced with the unenviable task of repetitively telling players that their specific concerns are not something that we consider to be an issue. It just creates bad feelings. <br><br>Indeed, you are our customer, and your business is very important to us, but to no greater or lesser extent than the business of everyone else playing the game. We'd really *like* to be able to make each person or group feel that they are more important than all of the others, and our marks in customer service would probably improve if we could. However, in our business, the level of attention or service given to one customer affects that given to all of the others. <br><br>It's a fine line. We do the best that we can and constantly strive for improvement. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050895.html"><b>Skyfires & Coin Looting</b></a><br>As I commented in another thread today, coin loot is indeed lighter for many areas of the game. Skyfire included. <br><br>In other zones, the "big" outdoor critters are an exception to other things in the zone, allowing for more loot to be handed out since there are less of them to go around. However in Skyfire, *everything* is pretty nasty, with those encounters being the rule rather than the exception. Many groups can hunt there nonstop and never run out of things to kill. Given that, they just can't drop the 10-30pp per kill of other encounters. <br><br>As for the XP, the mobs in Skyfire give more experience than mobs of a relative level in any other outdoor zone in the world.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050902.html"><b>What about Magician's Summoned Bags?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I KNOW this issue has come up a million and one times, but it just really irks me that this awesome item is hindered by the no-rent rules, thus making them risky to use. Can you fix it where the items placed in our summoned bags will transfer to the next available slot in the individual's inventory when we log or go link-dead and cannot make it back in time?]</i> <br><br>Those bags reduce the weight of anything carried within to zero, therefore there must be some downside to them or special bags dropped as loot really lose value. <br><br>We have considered putting a warning up in the event that someone tries to camp while they have loot in a summoned bag, but are having trouble coming up with a solution that would fit linkdeath loss. We didn't used to make norent items disappear on linkdeath, but many people then would go linkdead as the preferred method of leaving the game for the purpose of saving the bags. Also, once a character is out of the world, we don't maintain a record of them to allow removal of the bags after, for instance, an hour. <br><br>As far as moving the items out of the bags, that would present some major problems in the event that inventory is full. <br><br>Given these issues, the chance of losing the items on linkdeath will probably remain one of the risks of using the summoned bags.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051065.html"><b>Clarity Dwarf Key Binding Crushbone </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Plarinum caster nerfing 7/14 DVinn issue PvP SMR banning. Rangers xp res CShome fall for 10K? Wizards superior heal fishing Felwithe Guides linkdead! <br><br>Smedley Fiery Avenger patch virus ganker Trakanon ShowEQ...camping KSers guildmate Neriak breaking. Strategy guide bards tumpy tonic Anitonica trade window post-50. <br><br>Hotkey NECROMANCERS coin-only corpse Bristlebane lizardmen Loviane speff.dat /guildsay boats train!]</i><br><br>I think that it's fair to say that we have no official stance on this issue :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050837.html"><b>Make the Sense Spells Make Sense</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyway, I have noticed that no one really uses these spells very much. The reason for this is because with all the Necro's, Mages, and Enchanters around, you can't really get any use out of this. What would be nice is that instead of the current way that these spells work.. would be if they would work somewhat like Tracking does, bringing up all of the mobs in a certian radius, of the type mentioned.]</i> <br><br>Though I appreciate your concerns and suggestions concerning the "sense" series, we wouldn't want to dilute tracking by extended "undead tracking" or "summoned tracking" to other classes. I know that it's been suggested before that we shouldn't include pets as a valid target of a "sense" spell. Perhaps that might be something I could pursue. I'll check into it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/047608-2.html"><b>Changes to PoF</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - You specifically stated that no changes would be made to the planes to make them harder (except for possible pathing changes). These changes are horrendous and now hate is a CAKEWALK compared to Fear.

A new <a href="http://www.gamersfocus.com/reviews/kunark/review.html">review of Kunark</a> has been posted by Gamers Focus.  Overall Kunark gets a 8/10 rating from them.  Here is the traditional clip:<UL>There are so many positive things about Kunark that I want to reveal to you that I feel I must get a few problems off my chest before I continue, so as not to spoil the rest. First, Kunark is currently a bit expensive. The online store that was to allow players already subscribed to buy the update is, at present, not available. This forces long time customers to go and buy the entire game all over again in the form of the new EQ+RoK pack. Also, Verant has again subscribed to the "release now, patch later" pattern of game development, thus leaving a number of known bugs in Kunark at release. These bugs consist of items not appearing as they should (The Axe of the Iron Back appearing as a two handed sword, for example), unique monsters dropping nothing but small coins (much to the disappointment of the people who banded together to destroy them), and creatures disappearing from view for no apparent reason. Some of these bugs appear to be fixed, but it is my opinion that they should never have been there in the first place. </UL>

From Catalyst:<BLOCKQUOTE>We've posted a new issue of <A href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> here on Everlore. This week Milo covers a wide variety of topics such as Laissez-faire capitalism, The ethical issues which accompany cloning, and of course The 2nd law of thermodynamics. Oh, he also talks about 3D modeling and EQ stuff too, but you're probably not interested in that... Here's a snip from the page.    <Blockquote>    1) When you are about to start on a model, what do you begin with ? The largest part of the body ? Or perhaps the left foremost     finger that have a spot on it ?<P>     2) What is - in your opinion - most important part in modeling a figure that will be animated versus one that will not be animated     (ie. like a human vs. a rock) ?    </blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

EQ Rants sends word that they've kicked up a brand new <a href="http://eqrants.net/abashi.htm">Q&A with Verant's Gordon Wrinn</a>.  Here's a clip from this amusing interview:<UL><b>*Some people are under the impression that yourself, and Verant employees in general, are evil and perhaps demons from hell. Could you please clear up this mess. Are you indeed a demon from hell and, to your knowledge, does Verant actually employ any of hells minions? Or is that just a Microsoft thing? </b><br>  <br><i>*looks over his shoulder* <br>  <br>I'm sorry, but an NDA I signed shortly after being summoned...er...I mean hired... prevents me from answering. <br>  <br>Seriously though, we are sincerely aiming to please the largest percentage of our playerbase possible by keeping the game fun and interesting for them.  Though it may appear to some that our intentions are "evil", it wouldn't make much sense for us as a company to purposely alienate our customers.  The numbers, particularly the ones that show EQ's ability to retain subscribers, and the ones that show EQ's subscribers gladly recommending the game to others, clearly show that we must be doing *something* right. People may disagree on exactly what that *something* is, and most would agree that EQ isn't perfect, but in the end, the people are here, play the game nearly every day, and enjoy the heck out of it.</i></UL>Check out the link above for the rest!

A very interesting article titled <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/guidebook/kunark/spell.shtml">Descriptive Statistics and the EQ Magic System - Part 1</a> can now be found in our <a href="/guidebook/kunark">Kunark Strategy</a> area.  The purpose of this article is revealed in the opening paragraph:<UL><I>I&#8217;ve read many comparisons of spells on many website and many online forums.  Almost exclusively the power of spells is compared based on the maximum damage they can deliver and the efficiency of mana put into those spells is compared by the ratio: Point of damage per point of mana. <br><br>These are valid measures for comparison.  However, they tell a very limited story in terms of the true power and efficiency of the classes.  My purpose is to offer a more complete view of casting power using different statistics than what I&#8217;ve seen proposed previously.  But first let me start with what seems to be a reasonable argument using the old statistics: </i></UL>Very special thanks goes out to Nenelar Valandur, High Elf Elementalist, of the E&#8217;ci server for writing this for us. <br><br>Enjoy!

I received the following from Banegrivm:<BLOCKQUOTE>It was a day of epic proportions that would be forever remembered for all time by both the armies of the light and the dark. The 1st Fist of Light had gathered at the gates of Qeynos and prepared their descent into the depths of teh catacombs beneath the city where had rested the fate of Norrath in the grips of the Plaguebringers.<br><br>As the army made their way down inside their deepest fears had been wrought to light. The armies of hate had indeed forged a pact with the plaguebringers but Drayvar was not their only commander. Euthan Hatebringer had indeed brought ihs warband the Order of the Crimson Hands in tow. Behind him from the shadows Euthan summoned his ally tis his side. Lasombra, high lord of the dark order Illumin Cathari.<br><br>The army of light stood their ground yet could not possibly survive the onslought of the defending forces. Having retreated back into the surface, Drayvar turned his attention to the now disheveled army of light assured that victory was his.<br><br>Drayvar sent a herald to the Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light and demanded that a battle be set for he had the paladins betrothed and would see her fate sealed in hate, should he refuse to meet him in battle to the end with the loser decommissioning their army. (OOC - duel for deletion of guild and character).<br><br>The two stood before the gates with people from both sides of the army standing fast to the battle. Yet upon that hour Innoruuk was not with his daughters champion. As the paladin that had been Banegrivm drew his blade down to send the shadow knight to his god, Drayvar whispered his final words, "she is one of us, you will never know your peace". With holy rage the paladin took the shadow knights head to place back upon High Keep as witness to all those who cross the threshold of darkness.<br><br>The armies of hate were no more, however now an alliance was set. Where Drayvar had failed stood the human born son of Innoruuk to hold fast the mantle of hate and reforge what was broken. Euthan Hatebringer, High Lord of the Order of the Crimson Hands stood...and evil would surely flow. <br><br>There were tales and legends of heroes, of villains, and strange beasts that walked the lands. This was but a saga or a legacy of things to unfold. Was this the end of the war of Hate as we had known it...or a new beginning? Many questions yet remained unanswered. Only time would tell...but at least for now their was a banner of peace.<br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Shalkai was kind enough to inform me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings from Aven du Sora on the Innoruuk server! We'll be holding another event this Saturday, June 10th, at 8:30pm PST, in and around Qeynos. This event is the second edition of YAAP (the Young Adventurers Assistance Program). All races are welcome - we will be stationed outside the gates. We'll have food, drink, buffs, and weapons available for free for characters under 10 seasons. Armor for all classes available for free or for easy tasks. Magic items will also be given for simple quests and contests, which we'll customize for participants.  Expect role-playing, races, and anything else that looks fun. Equipment will NOT be "uber-twink"; expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If you have Crafted Armor or a Flowing Black Robe at 5 seasons, you've already had enough assistance :-).  <br><br>More experienced adventurers are cordially invited too! We'll have a free 6-pack for anyone who wants to imbibe, and you're welcome for storytelling, buffing the youngsters, helping out in your own way, or just having a good time.<br> <br>We hope to see you there!<br> <br>Shalkai Windchaser, Organizer<br>Wyndorn Windchaser, Guildmaster<br>Aven du Sora<br><a href="http://ads.eqhq.com">http://ads.eqhq.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

Agravaine sends us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, It was an ordinary day on the Test Server in the Oasis of Marr,<br>until I thought someone had trained 3 spectres from the island to the<br>gypsie camp.  After the sprectres spotted me, I made a quick run to the<br>North Ro zone.  But on the way I encountered 3 more spectres at the zone,<br>making 6 spectres total so far.  I found this very odd since the specs<br>that were on the island were still there.  After I rested up and zoned<br>back in, I noticed that everybody was talking about people training<br>specs.  That was not the case.  Spectres were spawing everywhere...on p1,<br>p2, South Ro zone, North Ro zone, gypsie camp... pretty much everywhere. <br>Nobody could quite figure out the reasoning behind this. No strange<br>drops. Possibly GM fun...but on the test server?<br><br>Here are some screenshots that I took: <br><a href="http://www.redrival.com/vs/specs.html">http://www.redrival.com/vs/specs.html</a><br><br>Agravaine<br>17th season  High-Elf Enchanter<br>Test Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Kardeiz:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<br> <br>For several months now I've been writing an ongoing comedy serial for the Fennin Ro Epic, entitled The Perils of Pinter.  It follows the misadventures of an awkward little gnome through the big bad world of Norrath.  If you're familiar with the style of Terry Pratchett or Douglas Adams, you'll get an idea of the way the story is written.  It's been very well received and I thought I'd like to share it with other EQ players.<br> <br>Please direct your browsers to the Fennin Ro Epic site at <a href="http://fre.feir-dal.net/">http://fre.feir-dal.net/</a> and click on Library.
