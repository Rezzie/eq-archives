Zanth sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Zanth log:<br>Tuesday, April 11, 2000<br><br>There had been rumors of a new evil coming from Ak'anon, centerof the Gnome Kingdom. The rumors from weeks ago about the darkness near Erudin had been true. But there haven't been any more reports of strange happenings from Toxxulia Forest since we killed the Overlord in the Paineel. It seemed strange to hear of a 'new' evil from the heart of the Gnome Kingdom. The necromancers have always existed in Ak'anon and they are still no threat to Norrath...<br><br>This is what I can recall from the day the Gnome King fell.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>..Outside of town we prepared for our journey into Ak'anon. I glancedat the night sky and took a deep breath. Full moon, figures. Dear Karana,let us die well this night, and quickly.<br><br>Only five of us, not enough, not enough! The four others with me arepraised by some, unknown to most. They are good and I have great faith.The night passes quicky, we must go, time is of the essence.<br><br>..Inside we have problems early. The troll Uglar does not know when to sheath his blade and when to lay low. Perhaps it is the magic of the bloodfirethat drives the madness into him. Looking at his eyes you can see... small firesburning. Blade and whip swinging furiously, Uglar takes out bot after bot.He is not alone tho, next to him the barbarian Carressa shreds bots into scrapmetal. The first battle is over quickly; the two warriors had been hungry for some killing.<br><br>Quickly we moved towards the Palace. The whole way I had to listen to theranting of the drunken cleric Bannek. "Whars the ALE!" he says... "HAR HAR!" hecackles gleefully. If we didn't need him, I might have slit his throat. Damndrunk dwarves.<br><br>..There! The palace is in front of us. With the troll masked through druidmagic so he is not seen, the guards do not pay attention to him nor the others.It is common for barbarians, halflings, and dwarves to visit the Ak'anon.Through the front doors we walk in, smiling to the receptionist. "Are youhere to see the King?" she asks. I respond, "Why yes, we are," as I barelyhold back an evil grin. <br><br>Down, down, down we go, deep into the Ak'anon Palace. My heart is pounding now,glancing around you can not help notice the platemail wearing guards lining every corridor. _gulp_ ...Finally! We are before the throne room.<br><br>..Still hidden by the druid magic, the troll scouts about the throne room entrance.He's back and grinning. Trolls have really bad breath. "What are you so happy for?"I ask. Uglar says, "I found a torturer, here is proof of the evil!" "Lets kill it"We enter the torture chamber and lo and behold, one gnome torturer and two gnomeguards. Out come the swords and whips and the two warriors proceed to teach thegnome a little on the proper way of torturing. I'd hoped to get some informationfrom the gnome about the evil engulfing Ak'anon. Unforunately in the heat of battleCarressa put a six inch cut into his neck. Damn, the cut is too deep for the shamanwith us to heal the gnome. We decide to speak directly to the King.<br><br>..Hail King Ak'anon. King Ak'anon says, "Its druids like you who have ruined yourown lands! You will not ruin mine!" ACK!!!!!<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The battle that pursues is intense. The exact events I can not recall. When all was done, only 5 adventurers stood in the throne room, alone. At their feet liesthe corpse of King Ak'anon. With the evil King defeated the 5 friends looked at eachother, shrugged, and headed out after...<br><br>The Mayor of Rivervale (The TRUE Evil!)<br><br>Brought to you by,<br><br>Dead on Arrival,<br>First to conquer Paineel<br>First to conquer Ak'anon<br>========================<br>Zanth Zanth<br>Carressa Ba'shemgud<br>Uglar Ba'shemgud<br>Bannek Boulderbane<br>Shaman Incognito <UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/corpse.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Extreme roleplaying or powergaming, you decide.

Gordon Wrinn has made even more posts on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's round two of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031728.html"><b>Quivers and the Ammo Slot</b></a><br>We agree that quivers *should* be equipable in the ranged ammo slot. Unfortunately, due to the way that we store data on the character, an insurmountable techical issue made this impossible given our core architecture. With the way that we store data on the character, a full p-wipe would be required to change this, and as such the prospects of this happening have been ruled out.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029668.html"><b>Level 50 Experience</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was just wondering what will happen to people that have a full experience bar in 50, will they automatically become 51 when they launch RoK or will the exp bar be reset?]</i><P>We won't be subtracting any experience points from anyone. The only *possible* thing that could happen is that we make an adjustement to the experience curve for level 50 prior to the release of Kunark which might make it appear that you have less experience. It is very unlikely at this point that we will do that. <P>We expect that when Kunark goes live that there will be many people who are but a kill or two away from level 51.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031880.html"><b>Will we ever see full screen interface windows for high resolutions? </b></a><br>Though I'll avoid saying that this is outright impossible, it is highly unlikely at this time. The design of EQ's interface uses custom bitmaps that have to be produced for each supported resolution. We don't want to do something cheesy like stretching these images out, as it will not only look bad but cause some technical problems.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031895.html"><b>Problem with Graphics: Missing Shields</b></a><br>We've had a few reports of this come in from other sources now, and our testing team is taking a look. <P>It appears that no shields are showing up. I'll get back with everyone when I have more information.<br>--<br>Update: <P>Turns out it's just the Shiny Brass Shield that isn't showing up. Trying to find out why now.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031889.html"><b>Future Server Splits</b></a><br>The server splits will take place prior to the servers first coming up, so people playing on them won't get surprised by a few hundred level 50s showing up. We'll announce more information when we have the servers ready to go.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031887.html"><b>What's up with Kerra Isle?</b></a><br>Yes, something indeed went wrong with the patch. Our operations personnel are currently in the process of patching the correct files. This can be fixed without bringing down all of the servers, as it only affects that zone.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031898.html"><b>How much hard drive space will Kunark take?</b></a><br>I have 622MB in my EQ directory. I'd say about 650 (for the data) to be safe.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031910.html"><b>More on loud footsteps</b></a><br>The problem with the loud footsteps was indeed something that we implemented today. It has been fixed on test, and will require a client download on the live servers for the problem to be fixed there. Unfortunately repatching the client will probably not occur until early next week. Our apologies to those who have to endure the loud footsteps in the meantime.</UL>

Burlabus sent the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Recently, on the Innoruuk server, sixteen members from Order of the Charred <br>Heart and House of Pendragon and friends banded together to defeat one of <br>the toughest, hardest-hitting mobs in Norrath. No, not Lord Nagafen, not <br>Lady Vox, but Kithicor, the despised level 50 Wood Elf Ranger who lives in <br>Kithicor Forest with his bear, Thumper.<br><br>Now, you may be asking yourself what does a wood elf ranger have that puts <br>him in the ranks of Nagafen and Vox? Well, Kithicor hits for 554 with 265 <br>dmg arrows, 100% mr and 32000 hps; in a word, ouch! :)<br><br>Our group buffed up, attacked, and executed an extremely detailed plan. <br>After a ten-minute grueling fight in which several members were lost, <br>Kithicor was finally slain!

Gordon has been posting up a storm today on the Gameplay Board.  Here's excerpts and quotes from his latest round of posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031507.html"><b>When will the Hate drops be fixed?</b></a><br>In the data patch tomorrow. <I>(Note: this was posted yesterday)</I><P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031636.html"><b>Future Servers</b></a><br>Yes, 4 new servers are planned in the very near future. Our current plan is for two of these to be split-servers (like Druzzil) and the other two to be clean-slate.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031658.html"><b>Camping Big Spawns</b></a><br>I really don't think that this is possible any longer. Some time ago we put in code that added a random component to the spawn timer for the longer spawns. Though I can't specifically announce the size of the random component, I can say that the window for a dragon-type spawn is in excess of 24 hours. That means that even if they had it timed before we did this, they'd have to sit around a LONG time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031640.html"><b>Patches and the Expansion CD</b></a><br>The expansion CD will include all of the patches made through about the middle of last month when the master was burned.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031802.html"><b>Adding New Classes</b></a><br>Adding new classes is a very complicated process. It raises all sorts of balance issues that have already been dealt with concerning the original 14. <P>Except for the art, new races are comparatively easy. <P>In any case, we have no short-term plans to add new classes at this time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031799.html"><b>Will there ever be Agnostic-only weapons?</b></a><br>No plans for this. We really don't see it making sense in the grand scheme of things. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031799.html"><b>Will we ever be able to change religions?</b></a><br>No plans for this either. It's really no different than someone being unable to wield/wear an item due to their selection of race or class.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031817.html"><b>Removing Rare Spawns from Tracking</b></a><br>It has long been our stance that the ability to track down rare spawns is a benefit of having tracking. Removing rare spawns from the tracking list as you request would negate that benefit.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031823.html"><b>Logging out in the PoH</a></b><br><i>[Quote from original post: My question is this: when i log in today, should i expect to instantly die to a horde of new roamers you put in there? that would, to say the least, suck...]</i><P>Well I of course can't comment on any specifics, but I would recommend that you arrange for a suitable army to meet you upon login.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031822.html"><b>Qeynos Hills to Western Karana Zone Bug</b></a><br>It hasn't been overlooked, it's just difficult to fix without requiring a 4+ MB download for everyone. It's on the list for repair.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031834.html"><b>Patch Message Inaccurate?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Also, for enchanters, DDD did NOT have its casting time reduced. The RECAST time was reduced. I'll post up a message about getting this changed in a minute unless Gordon reads this one.]</i><P> Doh! It's right on the list that GZ gave me, I apparently wrote it down wrong. I'll see about getting it updated after we wait a little while to see if I missed anything :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031835.html"><b>I cancelled my account, are my characters still there?</b></a><br>They are probably still there. To my knowledge we haven't yet had to clean up old accounts. That's not to say that we won't do it some day (I believe that we are only required to hold them for 90 days), but drive space hasn't become an issue at this point.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031841.html"><b>Changing the Terror Forged Mask</b></a><br>The same day that the terror mask was first found, we announced that the spell effect on it was a mistake and that it would be changed back. In addition, the NPC that hands it out had his quest dialogue changed to tell people acquiring it that the mask would soon lose its current spell effect and gain the power of fear. <P>Though it is true that we try to keep existing items as is, there are cases where an item is so severely overpowered that it must be changed in order to maintain the integrity of the game. This was such an example. <P>All of that said, I'm sorry that you are upset. It is next to impossible for us to insure that every player is made aware in advance for every issue in the game. We rely heavily on the news sites to help spread the word when something interesting happens.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031857.html"><b>Patch Issues</b></a><br>I'm chatting with the team about these issues now. Of the people that have noticed a problem with footsteps getting louder, what sound card(s)? Also, is it your footsteps, or others footsteps? <P>As for "No change to Kerra Ridge", it was patched incorrectly and is being redone now. We're still looking into the beggar.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031848.html"><b>Why does root and/or snare not have a "message" when it breaks like the DOTs and charm?</b></a><br>As they are offensive time-based spells, they should be issuing a message when they break. I've asked the programmer to look into it.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031847.html"><b>Blackburrow's History</b></a><br>Hahah, I remember when Blackburrow was the only dungeon. Dang, that was nearly 2 years ago.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031864.html"><b>Gating Spells</b></a><br>Good thought. We just gained this ability (a cast-on-others "go home" spell) recently. I've also raised the idea of a "Group Gate to the Wizard's Bind Point". I'm not winning that argument though, so please don't hold me to it :)<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031881.html"><b>Deity Restrictions</b></a><br>By choosing "agnostic" a person makes a choice to avoid both the positive and negative aspects associated with choosing a deity, in the same fashion that his selection of a race or class allows him to avoid the positive and negative aspects of another class. By the same logic that we do not allow people to change their race or class selection based upon new items or spells in the game, we likewise won't be allowing the change of deities based upon the same. <P>EverQuest is a game that is subject to change, and when a person makes a choice that choice not only affects them in the present, but for the future as well.</UL>

I received a report of a GM event from Malfane:<BLOCKQUOTE>I wanted to take a moment to thank the GM's on the Luclin server for the <br>outstanding job they have done thus far.<br><br>A fine example of this was the small scale event they held last Friday night <br>in Qeynos Hills, Blackburrow, and Everfrost.  Three merchants, the Goodbuys, <br>were walking through the Qeynos Hills area shouting that they needed an <br>escort to Halas so that they could deliver supplies to the Wolves of the <br>North.  A small group composed of many levels gathered around as they made <br>their way to the mouth of Blackburrow.  There the impromptu party set forth, <br>guiding and guarding the merchants through the home of the gnolls and out <br>into the mountains of Everfrost.<br><br>Here the fun began! The party was small, perhaps 15 people and by some odd <br>chance NO ONE was sure of the road to Halas.  The GM's were surely falling <br>out of their chairs with laughter as we made several stumbling attempts to <br>find Halas.  Finally we met a few kind Barbarian souls who guided us in to <br>Halas.  Throughout it all, we protected the merchants and had a lot of fun.  <br>The only sad point came when we suffered a single death due to someone who <br>was KOS approaching the guards too closely.<br><br>In appreciation for our efforts to guide and guard them, the merchants <br>handed out Black Pearls as a reward to many of their protectors.<br><br>This was a fine example of a well run and quite humorous GM event, with the <br>only death due to the GUARDS!<br><br>Thank you GM's of Luclin, keep up the good work!<br><br>Malfane<br>Warrior of The Way</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Malfane!

A new message was just added to the EverQuest Patch Server:<UL>April 10th, 5:30am<br>-------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>The following is a list of changes that were implemented on the Live<br>EverQuest servers today:<br><br>*Spells*<br><br>- You will now receive a message when attempting to mesmerize a creature<br>that is immune to that type of spell.<br>- You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what<br>instrument skill is used by the spell.<br>- Dyn's Dizzying Draught has had its casting time lowered significantly.<br><br>- Corrected a bug in the Druid root+damage spells (Enveloping roots<br>series) that caused the spell's damage to have a chance of breaking the<br>spell.  They work much better now.<br>- The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<br>- The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from<br>"Outdoor only" to "Night only".  It may now be cast in dungeons.<br>- Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to<br>inscribe the Malosi spell.  It was not intended for magicians under<br>level 50.<br><br><br>*General Changes/Fixes*<br><br>- Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity.  If a deity<br>restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you<br>right-click-and-hold on the item.<br>- The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.<br>- The Terror Mask will now cast "Fear" instead of "Call of Bones" as<br>previously announced.  The "Call of Bones" effect was placed on this<br>item by mistake.<br>- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<br>- The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<br>- Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<br>- Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of Ro<br>(Paladin) quests.  They have been fixed and Paladins should have a much<br>easier time of obtaining their armor.<br>- Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<br>- Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate<br>action of the spell.  Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell<br>line-up.<br>- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument<br>in use.<br><br><br>*Kerra Ridge*<br><br>Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped.  The target level-range for<br>the zone has been slightly increased.  In addition, many new quests have<br>been added to the zone.  The faction for Kerrans has been changed so<br>that those who killed them indiscriminately before today's update can<br>take part.  Be warned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.<br><br>*Paw*<br><br>Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment.  In addition, item<br>drop percentages have been increased.<br><br>*The Plane of Hate*<br><br>The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp.  Take<br>care in your exploration of this zone as many things have changed.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Zykstar!

A new message was added to the Patch Server today.  I believe Brad posted a similar message on the boards, but in case you didn't see it the first time around here it is again:<UL><br>***ANNOUNCEMENT***<br><br>Hello all, I just wanted to say thanks for playing EQ and to encourage all<br>of you to purchase the Expansion via our online store.  I also wanted to<br>clarify a few things:<br><br>1. The EverQuest Expansion is for ALL EQ players - there are plenty of low,<br>mid, and high level adventure zones in Kunark.<br>2. You CAN use a new credit card when you upgrade even though it asks for<br>the same one that is associated with your account.  To do this, you need to<br>go to the Account section from the main screen and change the credit card<br>you use for regular billing first.<br>3. To increase your chances of getting the Expansion on or near the 24th,<br>when we'll be turning on the new continent, we encourage you to upgrade<br>soon.<br><br>Thanks all - I'll see you on Kunark!<br><br>-Aradune</UL>

Gordon has made several more posts since the first infobit post today.  Here's what he's posted since the original news post:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031419.html"><b>More on International Shipping</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I can order RoK and have it shipped to a friend in the USA for $7, he can then send it to me for $10-$15, and it will get to me as fast (or faster) as the $57 S&H quoted to Australia.  Does Verant have any stance on this - is it perfectly ok for international customers to do this (ie no legality issues)?]</i> <P>We wouldn't have any problem with this. Our responsibility for the package would end upon it arriving at your friends in the USA. What he does with it after that is up to him. <P>As for your other questions, I believe Brad's post (part of which you've quoted) contains all of the information available to us at present. I apologize that I'm unable to elaborate further.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031470.html"><b>Kerra Isle Revamp</b></a><br>The revamp of Kerra will be going to the live servers tomorrow morning. There have been quite a few new things done with this zone. As for your specific questions, we prefer to leave them up to the players to figure out. I will say that we didn't overlook anything in regards to the Paw of Opalla, but I can't say whether or not it will still be obtainable after the zone goes live.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031472.html"><b>Why is CON not adjusted for group size?</b></a><br>There's a learning process. Players have to learn how to react in certain situations, and those decisions directly affect the difficulty of an encounter. For instance, I've seen a group of 18 attack and kill a dragon. I've also seen a group of 40+ fail to kill the same dragon. There's no way that an automated system can take group size and tactics into account and always provide an accurate /con statement, nor would we want it to. <br>--<br>Realizing that my list message might not have been too clear, by saying "nor would we want it to", I meant that we don't want to tell you in advance what the outcome of a battle will be to a mathematical certainty. <P>The /con message should represent the difficulty of an encounter assuming that the entity engaging in it is using the appropriate complement of people and tactics. Sometimes a solo player is the appropriate complement, sometimes it's a group. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031512.html"><b>Icon Issues</b></a><br>Your point is well-received.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Verant's Gordon Wrinn has made several new posts on the Gameplay Board today addressing several topics and issues.  Here's a quick rundown of them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031337.html"><b>Caster Cap Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  Just wented to know if you can tell us whether or not the int "cap" of 200 (and similar stats) will be raised in the expansion.]</i><P>Casters will continue to get more mana per level, but there's no reason to raise the "int cap" that people speak of. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031592.html"><b>Why Should Anyone Under Level 40 Get RoK?</b></a><br>There will definitely be areas that you fight in and explore. We're starting an entirely new race over there, so lower level areas were a must. The new lands aren't exclusively high level.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031431.html"><b>Server Limit</b></a><br>1800 was the target that we agreed on pre-expansion, and we have no plans to raise that target after the expansion is released. We're pretty confident that the 4 new servers that we are bringing up (2 of which will be populated by allowing people from the more crowded servers to move to them) will help aleviate the existing overcrowding problems.<P> We will continue to address these and other issues as quickly as we can.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031563.html"><b>Skin Like Steel and Bravery Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post:  I have to tell them NOT to cast SLS while I'm in the group, or they will be hurting, not helping. Shouldn't SLS be cancelled by bravery? Or is there a component of SLS that I don't know that causes it to be stronger? (damage absorption, duration, some non-obvious number, because clearly SLS is inferior when comparing to bravery in hit points).]</i><P>The spell hierarchy compares all of the effects of the spell to determine the cases where one spell overwrites another. In this particular case, it sounds like the duration of Skin Like Steel is causing it to overwrite Bravery. <P>That said, it's not unusual to have to educate other classes that you group with on the capabilities of your class. My character, a necromancer, is sure to remind druids to avoid snare and other casters to refrain from root. Enchanters frequently have to remind all of their party members not to attack the mezed critters. In this case, you may have to remind druids above your level to forget SLS while in your group.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031552.html"><b>Kunark Spells</b></a><br>I should also clarify that we won't be commenting on them until a reasonable number of people have them and what they *really* do is widely known. This probably won't happen for some time after the expansion is released.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031581.html"><b>Rogues can be banned for pickpocketing?</b></a><br>No, they can't. I discussed this issue with the customer service team today, and they are in the process of getting the word out to the GMs and Guides to be sure that everyone is clear. <P>What rogues (or anyone for that matter) could be banned for is being anti-social and trying to cause problems, though these actions have to be judged at the time that they are committed.<P> For instance, there's no problem with you pickpocketing MobX. However if you chose to following around a group emoting "/em steals 3 platinum from a_gnoll_scout00", while taunting them in /say with "Haha, I'm stealing all your money", thus trying to ruin their gameplay experience, it could be considered harassment. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031579.html"><b>Verant.com Updated</b></a><br>We recently updated our web site at www.verant.com. We have quite a few job listings posted, as well as some other interesting information. We've also posted our "Featured Site" for the next week or so, da Grobb Skwad, a well done guild site for those greener of skin.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031462.html"><b>Give Clerics a Turn Undead Ability</b></a><br>Well we won't have this in the form that you ask, but there is a pretty nifty anti-undead spell that clerics can look forward to at later levels. I apologize, but as it is part of the expansion, I can't really comment on it quite yet.</UL>

Brimstone sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Tibbit of LOA reported the following event from Veeshan. I thought that theplayers of our community might also like to hear ofthis:<blockquote><i>Normally, I don't get too emotional over stuff in Norrath,but this was an exception.<P>I was minding my own business late last night soloing some birdies in LakeRathe when I came upon a small guild holding a funeral for one of theirguildmates. (It was located on the island with the bonfire.) I wish I couldremember the guild and the name of the fallen.<P>From what I could discern (I dared not interrupt), the guildmate was killed inRL in a horrible car/plane accident. Since it would have been supremely hardfor them to all attend a RL memorial, they held it in Norrath. His corpse wasthere (Human paladin, full plate), and the guild (45-50 people) was assembledin a circle. Prayers were read, memories were reflected on, and in general itwas really touching.<P>But what I thought was the most emotional was a silent 21 firebolt salute from7 of the guilds wizards. they all stood atop a rocky crag, and simultaneouslylet loose with three 7-bolt volleys across the zone of Lake Rathe. They wereall sent in the same direction, and all 21 bolts were visible for about 5seconds. <P>A guide/gm was then summoned, who placed the corpse in the fire and thenremoved the character. I guess it was about as close to cremation or a funeralpyre as norrath can get.<P>It was quite a sight to see, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a pangof emotion throughout the whole event.<P>=Tibbit=</i></blockquote><P>Submitted by Brimstone of <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/"target="_top">Akalabeth</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

Brad McQuaid had a big change of heart regarding Verant's policy toward releasing information about stats.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031368.html">his post</a> directly off the Gameplay board:<UL><I>In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats do. <P>I'm going to post them here. <P>This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds. <P>That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than others. <P>We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year. <P>Anyway, here you go: <P>DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows <P>STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills <P>STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath <P>INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights <P>WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. <P>CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular) <P>AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit <P>-Brad</i></UL>Thanks Huntre and Shadow!

Verant I-Net Relations Manager Gordon Wrinn spent some time on the Gameplay board this weekend.  Here's this weekend's round of infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030583.html"><b>Any plans to implement a quest to change starting stats?</b></a><br>We have no plans for this. It was part of the core design of EverQuest that base stats would be fixed.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031152.html"><b>The Consider</b></a><br>The /con system is an indication of level. It makes no note of special skills, abilities, or attacks. For example, some encounters of a specific level might be more difficult than others. <P>As people level up, they get stronger. However NPCs get stronger on a steeper scale. For this reason, the /con system goes from being representative of solo abilities to being representative of group abilities. The rate at which this happens varies for all of the classes. <P>NPCs of a higher level MUST be stronger than a solo player, or groups will tear through them with no problems and no risk. For this reason, the /con system is not broken. At lower levels it fairly well represents the abilities of a solo player. At upper levels, it very closely represents the risk to a full balanced group.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031165.html"><b>On releasing Kunark early for those who ordered on net</b></a><br>Actually I think it was Brad that mentioned that. We're still aiming for it, but it's too soon to guarantee it, so the official date is still 4/24. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031256.html"><b>Can you tell me how to get Kunark?</b></a><br>There will be two ways to get to Kunark. Teleports and ships. If you haven't purchased Kunark, the teleports just won't work for you, and if you are on the boat, you'll be transported back to the dock when the boat zones to a Kunark zone.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031259.html"><b>Why Even Have Zones?</b></a><br>Massively Multiplayer RPGs have a long development cycle compared to other games, and the graphics engine is the first thing that is designed. Back when development started on EQ, the development team had several goal for operation of the game. For example, they wanted to minimize the effect of internet latency. They also wanted to have each "area" have its own look-and-feel, with its own set of appropriatly placed NPCs. <P>At the time, the "Zone" technology was the best technology available to meet the goals of the development team. Of course since then, new technologies have been developed, and though it makes sense that we would take advantage of them in future products, EQ will always have zones. You just can't change graphics engines on the fly post-production.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031293.html"><b>Blacksmithing Bug?</b></a><br>The "Block of Ore" listed in the blacksmithing manual is just for the purpose of scaling measurements. For instance, the book says "3 large bricks = 1 block", therefore when a recipe calls for "a block of ore", you can substitue "3 large bricks". <P>You can't combine 3 large bricks to make 1 block. 3 bricks is the equivalent of 1 block. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031346.html"><b>Are Ogre's "unstunablitiy" by design? </b></a><br>Yes, this is by design. It is one of the advantages of their large size that offsets the disadvantages. I think that it could be arguable that they should be stunnable while shrunk, but it might be too late to see that if it isn't there already.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031328.html"><b>Summon Corpse Nefed?</b></a><br>I'm not sure where the rumor came from, but the spell hasn't been changed to self-only. As a precaution to insure that something inadvertent didn't happen, one of our testers checked it out. Nothing has changed with the spell.</UL>

(Blizzard, for example, has no problem working on 2 flagship titles, Warcraft and Diablo -- neither will we).<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031003.html"><b>Barbarian Shield Fix</b></a><br>The fix will be patched when we launch the Expansion (or very close to it, at least) and will be a global patch and it doesn't require one to purchase the Expansion.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031173.html"><b>EverQuest Price, Overseas Shipping, User Count</b></a><br><I>[On number of active subscriptions]</I> Xhen: correct -- 208038, to be exact :)<P><i>[On overseas shipping]</i> tinman_au : I agree -- it would be great to offer a longer shipping time for less cost to overseas customers. I'll see what I can do, but I don't have a lot of influence in this area :(<P><i>[On price of the current EQ client]</i> Toekutter : The price of the original EQ box has been lowered to 19.99 to clear it out and make way for the new Kunark box, which contains both the original EQ plus the Expansion. The Kunark box will be back at full price (MSRP 39.99 I believe).</UL>

EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid addressed the high cost of international shipping of Kunark in a recent response to a post made on the Gameplay board.  Here's the thread:<UL>Hi, <P>All prices here will be in US. Destination is Australia. <P>I can order the full priced box of RoK from www.dragon.ca for $37.95. The shipping and handling, Air Mail (7-21 days), costs $7.95. The last game I ordered from them took 7 days from shipping to delivery. This is a total price of $45.90. <P>Purchasing "direct" from you via your agent will cost $16.95 plus $57.90 S&H for a total cost of $74.80. <P>With this in mind: <P>1. Is there a possibility that VI/Zomax could change its delivery method? <P>2. If not, is it possible to cancel my order? <P>3. Can you explain the disparity between these costs (I.e. Why Zomax are charging so much for delivery)? <P>4. Did you ask the company to deliver before the 24th of April with delivery cost in mind, or as quickly as they possibly can sparing no expense? <P>5. (Just for the record) Do Verant, Sony or any other company owned/operated by them have shares or holdings in Zomax or their chosen shipping company?<P> I find it absolutely amazing that I can get 2 copies delivered from an independant reseller for $10 US more than 1 copy from the producer/manufacturer. <P>Don't you?<P><b><i>The intent was to give international players an option to get RoK quickly, preferably on or before the 24th, so they could play right away. <P>In the past international players have had to wait quite some time to get EQ. <P>We wanted to give them the option (buy directly, albeit at a high price due to the quick method of shipping, or wait for the boxes to get to the various countries). <P>The prices are 'high' for two reasons: <P>1. The shipping is fast so you get it on or around the 24th. <P>2. We don't do a ton of international shipping and therefore don't have access to big discounts you might find at amazon.com or some such. We basically had to use dhl/ups type methods. <P>I think we should have been a lot more clear about this, and I apologize for not explaining this stuff and our intent beforehand. <P>-Brad</I></b></UL>

I received the following from Mlaria:<BLOCKQUOTE>I wish to stage Norrath's first "War of Flowers." This is a name taken<br>from a ritualized war that the Aztecs would have with the tribes that<br>lived in the surrounding area. They were wars that were conducted in<br>times of peace so that warriors could "prove" themselves on the field of<br>battle, as well as to capture human sacrifices to offer up to the sun.<br>(This is a simplistic explaination of what the "War of Flowers" or<br>"Flowery Wars" where. It's some damn intersting reading and I suggest if<br>you have any interst in this sort of stuff to do a search on the web<br>about it.)<br><br>                        This war will take place in 3 zones:<br>                        West Commons.<br>                        East Commons.<br>                        Desert of North Ro.<br><br>Object and Rules:<br>1. Each team will pick 4 players that are their Standard Bearers<br>(Standard as in a flag)<br>2. The Standard Bearers will be of levels 9th-11th, 16th-18th, 23rd-25th<br>and 37th-39th.<br>3. Each Standard Bearer will be given a jewel (the standard) that must<br>stay in a lootable slot.<br>4. Each Standard Bearer MUST stay in the 3 war zones with his anonymous<br>and roleplay turned off so his/her location can be verified at all<br>times.<br>5. The war is won when 1 side has looted all the opposing teams<br>standards. (jewels)<br>6. Teams will be Good vs Evil.<br>7. Out of Range healing is acceptable.<br>8. CR will not be respected (except as stated in rule 11)<br>9. If the Standard Bearer leaves Norrath for any reason, he is in<br>essance dead. Wether LD, RL or whatever.<br>10. If a Standard Bearer leaves the 3 zones, wether getting killed and<br>returned to his bind point by a MOB, accidentally zoning, gets knocked<br>out of a war zone by something like a wiz spell or any other reason,<br>they are dead and must surrender their standard.<br>11. If a Standard Bearer is killed and his Standard (jewel) is not<br>looted, then the Standard Bearer will be afforded standard CR<br>privilages. If the Standard Bearer does not return to his corpse within<br>15 minutes then he is dead and must surrender his Standard (jewel).<br><br>Discussion on rules/team leaders/etc will continue on the War of Flowers<br>msg boards at:<br><a href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/bministryofhate.html">http://pub8.ezboard.com/bministryofhate.html</a><br><br>In the Service of Innoruuk,<br>High Priestess Mlaria Thex<br>Ministry of Hate<br><a href="mailto:mlaria_thex@hotmail.com">mlaria_thex@hotmail.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Banelron sent in an interesting report claiming that Aradune (aka Brad McQuaid) visited the EQ Chat Server this evening and revealed some interesting information about the new expansion race the Iksar.  I <b>have not</b> been able to confirm the legitimacy of this report so as of now consider it a rumor at best:<BLOCKQUOTE>Aradune made an appearance in the EQ Chat earlier this evening.  Inanswering some questions, he did reveal a few things about the Iksar that Idon't believe had been previously announced.<P>Iksar won't be able to wear plate mail.  "It chafes their scales" was whathe said, but he did also say they would get an innate AC boost.  Also, theywill have infravision, regeneration, and very good innate swimmingabilities.  That's all I got as he left not long after I got there.  <P>Thanks!<P>Banelron, Tunare</i></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Banelron.

A report of a recent event on Veeshan was sent to me by Krimson Klaw:<BLOCKQUOTE>Congratulations to all the winners in each lvl bracket. With the help of many of Veeshans finest, the contributions exceeded 40k platinum in prize give aways to the winners. <P>Know this, You the players of Veeshan came through in this event and made it a hit. I started it, but you all finished it with a bang. thanks from me and FoH to all of Veeshan for your participation and contributions to this event. <P>The bloodlust got to many people in the final event and many disregarded rules in order to slay their foes, which is tracherous to say the least=). With so many people entering and re-entering the arena I had to choose the person I deemed most worthy of the final Prize based on kills. I personally witnessed Crip the mighty Bard slay 6 people before 3 people re-entered th arena and laid him to rest. With people re-entering there would never be a last man standing so he was awarded the final prize. While this made the final event very hard to judge, it was very treacherous and Innoruuk applauds you, as do I. <P>The Blood Rain guild showed up en masse and totally DOMINATED the melee bracket lvl 41-50, well done. One person of note that needs mentioning is Inosolan who feigned at the very start of her event bracket, then got up and laid waste to Lolmarthe mighty necromncer who had slain many himself....right when I was declaring the small gnome the winner he began to writhe in the grip of agony. This was the most treacherous event of the night and deems her the title of Inosolan the Treacherous from me personally (wish I could give you the title). As I write this there are still 50+ people STILL in the arena overcome with bloodlust and fighting to the death hehe. No one spreads hate as much as Krimson. Well done, and see you in Norrath at my next event! <P>Lord Krimson Klaw <br>Dread Knight of Veeshan </BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for the report!
