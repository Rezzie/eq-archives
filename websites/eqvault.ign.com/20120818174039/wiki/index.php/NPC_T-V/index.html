<p><i>As described in the Iksar Lore Books in Cabilis:</i> 
Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist ever to walk within the Court of Pain. His speed rivaled that of the great Grandmaster Tynn. He could often be found within the local taverns demonstrating the awesome speed of his fist.
</p><p>Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this caste. Although quick with fist and tail, the speed of his left arm was not to come to blossom for a couple decades past his rebirth. It was to follow his captivity by the accursed Samak.
</p><p>Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon went on a wandering retreat into the dangerous outlands of Kunark. He was not seen from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to Cabilis he told of his captivity within an ancient city of Iksar now claimed by the Sarnak. He told of intense torture. He survived the ordeal. He escaped from the claws of the Sarnak with numerous scars which proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars were never to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars underneath were for no lizard's eyes. His great perseverance gave him an inner strength no other monk could lay claim to.
</p><p>He now possessed incredible, almost blinding speed with his left arm. He could tap a foes arm with his left and strike with as if having a third arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails. All the empire under respected or feared him. None would spar him outside of the taverns. 
[Ed. Note: some lore seems to be missing from the book, which does not finish the adventures of Talon Southpaw or give the manner of his death ]
</p><p>Upon his death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn removed his hands in a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze upon Talon's body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic which would stay within the Tower of Kurn. His body was dusted. This is his tale as told by Rinmark.

<p>The race of dark elves, created by Innoruk from the torture of the elven king and queen during the elder age.  See Dark Elf. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p>===Thex Family===: the royal elves in Norrath are all of the Thex family.  
</p><p>===Thubr Axebringer===is a master weaponsmith and dwarven adventurer.
</p><p>Thubr Axebringer was born Thubir Axebringer to his parents Mor and Vanka Axebringer. Thubr's younger sister, Laka, had trouble pronouncing the "ir"sound in his name, so she called him Thubr (pronounced Thoob-r). The nickname has remained with him since that day.
</p><p>Growing up in South Kaladim, Thubr spent many hours playing in the areas around the arena. Fascinated by how weapons were made, he would often peek through the windows of the Staff &amp; Spear weapon shop to watch the storeowner, Didek Stormhammer, cousin of King Kazon, hard at work. When he wasn't peeking into windows, he sat on the rooftop of the building to watch the great warriors fight in the arena nearby. He did this not merely for entertainment, but Thubr studied their fighting techniques, committing them to memory, developing his own skills.
</p><p>One day, Thubr sat in his usual spot atop the Staff &amp; Spear, waiting for the battles to start, while banging a small pipe with his hammer. He had carefully shaped the dull piece of metal into a tiny dagger. Hearing the noise on his roof, however, Didek Stormhammer went up on the roof and pulled Thubr back down by his ear.
</p><p>"Child, what were you doing on the roof of my shop?" Didek asked. Before Thubr could answer, Didek spoke again. "Where did you get this from?" He pulled the tiny well-crafted dagger from a pocket in Thubr's pant leg. "Siirrr…" Thubr stammered, "I made that from an old pipe I found behind the shop. 'Tis mine, give it back t'me."
</p><p>In disbelief, Didek asked again, "You are too young to have made such a finely crafted weapon, where did you get this from?" "Aye, I did make it," said Thubr, undaunted, "give it back, 'tis mine. I learned how to make it by watchin' weapons bein' made through the window o'ye shop.”  Didek, seeing promise in the lad, asked Thubr to come work for him as an apprentice. Through the years, the young dwarf learned how to make many weapons. He also continued his rooftop study of the arena combatants.
</p><p>It was years later that King Kazon Stormhammer came to the shop to look for new weapons for his Stormguard. Browsing over his cousin's inventory, the king found nothing that sparked his interest. About to leave, he spotted Thubr standing before his workbench. The King told Thubr to step aside that he might examine the weapons upon his table. "Didek!" the King shouted over his shoulder as he perused what lay before him, "Why did you not show me these weapons?" "Cousin, those are just ones that the boy is working on," said Didek, gesturing toward Thubr, who was now a young man. "I did not deem them of the best quality."
King Kazon turned to Thubr and told him he wanted the weapons for his Stormguard. After pausing but a moment, Thubr responded, "The high quality weapons I make on me own time are too good t'give to anyone else. I keep 'em for m'self because I am a great warrior and deserve the best."
Marveling at the audaciousness of the youth, the King asked, "What is your name, boy?" "He is Thubr Axebringer, milord," interrupted Didek.  King Kazon studied the young man, sizing him up. The pause was awkward only for Didek, for Thubr stood steady under the scrutiny. Finally, The King said, "If you are truly a great warrior, as you say, you should be in the Stormguard." Lifting his sword, the King beckoned Thubr to kneel before him and tapped him on the shoulder, proclaiming, "Thubr Axebringer, the great warrior, is now a member of the Stormguard." He sheathed his sword and said to Thubr, "Report for duty immediately. And bring the weapons with you!" Thubr, for once, was speechless. He stood then bowed. "Yes, Sire," was all he said.
</p><p>Thubr spent many years with the Stormguard, learning new tactical skills and honing the ones he had acquired on his own. He also continued to improve his blacksmithing skills, creating stronger and better weapons for the Stormguard.
In South Kaladim, at the Pub Kal, owned by the Darkfoam family, he ran into many interesting people while drinking. It is here that he was tricked into becoming an ambassador for Kaladim. Although he was good at getting the job done, Thubr was not the typical ambassador. He shares the traditional dwarven qualities of stubbornness and love of drink. When he is drunk, however, he is very friendly.
Thubr became a master brewer through his years as well, adding to his reputation as an expert blacksmith and fierce warrior. The owner of the Grub &amp; Grog, Retchin Krundd, a decidedly unattractive but friendly and flirtatious female Dwarf, lost a bet with Thubr and, consequently, part ownership of the pub to him as well. Located in East Freeport, this establishment is considered one of the roughest taverns on all of Norrath, frequented by course adventuring types and the notorious Freeport Militia.
Throughout his adventures and difficult battles, Thubr has traveled with many people. Some of these he even regards as friends. He has battled along side the likes of Firiona Vie, Al'Kabor, Dreezil Pocketdip, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, Dagda Icefury, Lorisyn Oakwynd, Lyirae Oakwynd, Sionachie Heartsinger, and Sir Jevik Isqual to name a few. Of these, he would speak most highly of Firiona Vie, Al'Kabor, and Dreezil Pocketdip. Though he views Al'Kabor as an arrogant and longwinded Erudite, Thubr gains much entertainment from him, often following him around. Firiona Vie he respects, as most do, and is always concerned for her safety.
</p><p>Dreezil Pocketdip, a shady halfling, is one of Thubr's favorite drinking buddies. After long battles, the two can be found visiting the nearest bar to guzzle down many types of ale together.

<p><i>The Adventures of Tillerman Jairik</i>[see the entry for Al'Kabor for the beginning of this story]
</p><p>Excited at the prospect of adding this scroll to his "Shopping List of Armageddon," Al'Kabor once again recruits a party to seek out Tillerman Jairik, and convince him to return to the site of the wreck to assist in the retrieval of the lost cargo. The wizard's knowledge of Jairik is limited to his general location. "The wretch has reverted to the meaningless existence of an arms monger, peddling his wares in the cave of East Commonlands. Were it not for the fact that within his tiny skull is locked the key so conjunctive to my research, I would give no more thought to his death than I would afford a mosquito in Feerrott."
</p><p>Tillerman Jairik has no knowledge of the cargo of the ship, though he knew it was valuable. He avoided the hold of the ship when the item was loaded, and was issued strict orders by the captain not to snoop. He felt an eerie presence even as he boarded the ship that rainy evening. "Arr, what a man don't know about, won't show up later to bite him in the arse!"
</p><p>Jairik has a mild fear of the sea now, but he overcomes it in order to accompany the adventurers to the location of the wreck. "Me ol' bones will feel more at ease knowin' me crewmates be at peace in their watery graves, aye." Because he was swept overboard before the attack of what Al'Kabor identified as a water elemental, he has no knowledge of the beast. He fully expects the ship to be in ruins with its cargo plundered long ago. Little does he know, the elemental has taken up residence aboard the lost ship.
By the time the ship reaches the docks in the Ocean of Tears, Jairik has regained his sea legs, and has no problem swimming to the rocky isle. "C'mon, ye scurvy dogs! The salty brine will keep ya afloat, like an egg on a glass table!"
</p><p>"Prexus! Don't be takin' me now!" Jairik exclaims when he sees the ghostly Shark's Bane docked at the isle, and the great Water Elemental floating upon its deck. "Ach, I dinnae want to be fish food!"  The water elemental disembarks and attacks the adventurers. Jairik, overcome with terror, only assists in the battle when the party becomes overwhelmed, and even then only half-heartedly.
With the defeat of the water elemental, Jairik continues on with the party to the Sisters of Erollisi island, where Al'Kabor awaits them. Anxious to return to his laboratory and continue his research, Al'Kabor quickly rewards the adventurers. The party's questions annoy him, they being far too simple to comprehend his plans, and he rudely departs.
</p><p>Tillerman Jairik, the Swashbuckler, returns to the Commonlands and resumes his peaceful mercantile life.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=NPC_T-V&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="NPC T-V">edit</a>]</div><a name="Trakanon"></a><h3>Trakanon</h3>
<p>An ancient dragon.  The once ruler of Sebilis after he defeated the Iskar. Those loyal to the undead dragon are mostly his guards and the population of Old Sebilis.  Trakenon at one time befriended the trolls, but then abandoned them.  Trakenon opposed the Ring of Scale in the war against the Iskar, taking a band of dragons and killing King Rile.  Trakenon is shunned by the other dragons because he started the war with the Iskar.  He looks wounded at the present time because he was hurt during the battles and the Iskar shaman magic kept him from completely healing.
</p><p>Another tale recounts that he was once the companion of Phara Dar, daighter of Jalad Dar.  Wishing to be the ruler of Veeshan’s Peak, he tricked Jalad Dar into fighting with the Iskar Ganak and dying in the process.  When Phara Dar learned of his treachery, she shunned him.  He was not able to take the throne in Veeshan’s Peak.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=NPC_T-V&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="NPC T-V">edit</a>]</div><a name="Trakenon.27s_Prophecy"></a><h3>Trakenon's Prophecy</h3>
<p>Three great warriors were chosen by Trakenon to be the saviors of man:  Miragul, the necromancer, who was given grat magic; Nalikor, the troll, who was given a great sword, Edril, the elf, who was given a dragon pendant.  These three will be reborn in bodies of others and can combine their gifts to enhance a fourth, yet unnamed, person who will destroy all of Norrath.   Edril is buried with his amulet in Elizerain Lake in Faydwer, which is hidden at the present time.
</p><p><i>Of Trakanon's prophecy, excerpt from "The Book of Edril" by Edril's late wife Almaril:</i> 
The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on his son and smiled widely. "So," Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook the very ground, "at last you have come." Edril, great among the elves, felt himself begin to tremble as he stared deep into the dragon's fiery eyes. "You have no reason to fear me, warrior, even though you have come here to kill me. But I doubt that even you could perform such a task. You see, child, I was born before the stars were made, before the foundation of this world was ripped by Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth to the elder races. I have been and always will be the eternal mystery between life and death and gods and man." With that said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow knew the great beast spoke the truth.
</p><p>"And yet," the dragon continued, "I am but a watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse of all my kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it die. Take heed, warrior, because Norrath's death is fast approaching." Edril lifted his head, his eyes wide in a look of shock and fear.
</p><p>The dragon simply nodded. "Yes, Edril, Norrath's fate was decided long ago, or so the gods think. But the visions of your gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness, the future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong. The gods made you all as a means to an end in their struggle and as the wars of the elder races escalate, so shall the gods descend from their planes of existence and make the whole of Norrath suffer. But there are those among the races untouched by the taint of immortals whom I have chosen as the saviors of man."
Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with his left claw and ripped the bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one powerful stroke of his arm. Edril looked over the sides of the newly formed chasms and noticed the walls glowing a bright red. A face began to form from the blackness deep within the cracks, and Edril could clearly make out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad eyes, gaunt cheeks, and long silvery hair.
</p><p>"His name is Miragul," said the dragon, "a human mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend the laws of life and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell, wandering his tombs filled with powerful magics." 
The next face that formed was that of a troll, but surprisingly it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran from both eyes down to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and unwavering. "He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my kingdom and find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest among his soldiers, and was able to lead his people from death and starvation to a powerful kingdom." 
</p><p>The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. "You, elf, are my third chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier and great hero. Death haunts you at every turn but you are always able to overcome your obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer of Norrath, and a lord among elves. And now I award you with a much bigger destiny." Trakanon spoke deep in a language Edril couldn't understand, and suddenly a small pendant flashed into existence around Edril's neck. "To Miragul I revealed the existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane arts. To Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior prowess. To you I give this: a small pendant that will allow you to talk with me always. But it does much more. My strength is finite, Edril, and already my powers begin to weaken. Soon either the gods or the elder races will find the means to my destruction, and when that happens then the final war for Norrath shall be waged. But when I die, before I leave for the afterlife, I will impart my power to the bearer of this pendant, and he shall have all the wisdom and the strength of the most ancient of creatures."
</p><p>Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the floor of his cave. "That time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy, young one. Everything I say now shall soon come to pass. When the wars of the elder races begin to come to fruition, the gods shall take notice and plan for their coming into the world. Then, on the third day of the third season, in the dark of the night on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn my chosen in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues: good, evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will arise to the call of a fourth chosen, great among them, who will collect my gifts unto himself: the magic enhancements of Miragul, the flaming sword of Nalikor, and your dragon pendant. The peoples of Norrath will revere this one as Trakanon's chosen, and he will watch the whole world burn."

<p>Followers of The Tribunal seek one thing above all else: justice.

Retribution, vengeance, and punishment are sacred duties. Followers of The Tribunal are methodical, patient and just. They must be so, for it is their belief that if they punish an innocent, The Tribunal will pass judgement against them, and doom them to an eternity. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)

<p>Vahlai Ka'Izal is a very proud and arrogant Dark Elven Wizard. She has a strong disdain for every other race, including other Dark Elves who do not follow her philosophies. To her, Warriors, and those who take up the blade, are mere idiots utterly lacking in the intelligence necessary to master the true powers, the force of magic.
</p><p>Vahlai has been an enemy of Firiona Vie and her companions--namely Dagda Icefury--for countless years, since before the group of hearty adventurers set out for the undiscovered lands of Kunark nearly ten years ago. Vahlai has since kept an eye upon the returned party. Her goal was to wipe them out one by one while they were still weak, but the abrupt return of Firiona interrupted Vahlai's plans. Though she holds a great hatred of Firiona and her followers, Vahlai harbors a secret respected for Firiona's Erudite companion, the wizard Al'Kabor. She would never express this publicly, however. Rather, Vahlai wishes to have her twin sister, the highly respect Tier'Dal necromancer Kiathrelle, examine the Erudite's brain and perhaps perform the ceremony Vahlai and her troll servant Rogkasth underwent. By taking some of Vahlai's brain and placing it into Rogkasth, Kiathrelle bestowed upon Rogkasth a singular intelligence unattainable by normal trolls. Vahlai was affected slightly by the process.

Many humanoids have gained great riches and ancient knowledge through servitude to the Wurms, but these gifts came with a high price...knowing that one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they can take your messy life whenever it suits.

<p>Venril Sathir was the Emperor of the Iskar empire.  He united the five tribes and brought them together as the Kingdom of Sebilis to conquor most of the continent of Kunark.  Their rising power eventually attracted the attention of the Lords of the Ring of Scale, the Dragons of Veeshan's Peak.  Sathir and his Kunzar armies conquered and annexed the other tribal states into Sebilis, which Sathir as King.  Sathir captured the giants and frogloks to help him to maintain his powerful empire.  
</p><p>There are two stories about Sathir's death: The first is that King Sathir did not want to die, so he made a pact with Innoruk to rise, undead and immortal, but his son Rile thwarted his plans and trapped Sathir's soul in an amulet.  He burned his father's body and the amulet with it. 
</p><p>The second version of the tale tells that Venril Sathir indeed did become a lich and now focuses on regaining the Iksar throne from his stronghold in Karnor's Castle. (Allakhazam’s Magical Realm.  The outpost of Drow in the Overthere are loyal to Venril.  It would seem that this might be the truer of these two tales, and Venril Sathir is known to walk the earth at this time
The inhabitants of Karnors castle are maintained in their unholy life by the eternal iksar vampire, Venril Sathir, as are the spiders in Kaesora dungeon. (Eq Atlas)
</p><p><i>As described in the Iksar Lore Books in Cabilis: </i>
The greatest lizard to walk upon the land was Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe. All that is known of his youth was that he was a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This was during the time of division among the tribes of the Iksar. He was said to have never been a mere broodling. He was forever a master of combat. 
</p><p>Venril would soon slay his father and take his rightful place as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the Kunzar on many expeditions into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He sought knowledge and weapons. 
</p><p>In his late youth, he find the hidden library of the necromancer, Kotiz. He would come to open a large book which opened into a small room. Climbing into the book he finds a floating book. The Unholy Writ of War is its title, made of Iksar skins and containing great knowledge of combat. Venril becomes the books master. 
</p><p>Venril soon shows signs of dark knowledge. He begins to wield the forces of the dark circle and his knowledge of combat tactics becomes supreme. He trains his army new tactics and even raises the bones of the fallen to fight yet again for their master. His army grows and marches to all corners of Kunark. 
</p><p>Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He shall soon plot the union of the entire Iksar nation. He no longer wishes to be just Chief, but rather, Emperor. Under his direction the four remaining tribe states of Iksar shall unite and a new age shall dawn.   313 A.G.  (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><i>The Plot to Capture Firiona Vie and Rule the World</i>
Venril Sathir moved back into Karnor's Castle some 50 years ago. Before that time, the Iksar Lich-King spent more then a century in hiding in The Bile at his Fortress Varis, after his defeat at the hands The Alliance of Stone. The Alliance of Stone's victory came only after the leader of Venril's Lycanthrope army, an Iksar wizard serpent changer by the name of Thuuga, was deceived by the Ring of Scale and joined the Alliance.
</p><p>Venril Sathir vowed to rebuild his empire to its former terrible glory of two thousand years past. However, he had learned a valuable lesson at his last defeat. Choosing to stay out of the public's eye from now on, he has since become secretive and has been rebuilding his strength quietly, biding his time as the tendrils of his influence snake their way into all levels of society. He has many agents and moles placed strategically all across the continent that report to him and see that local politics resolve themselves in a manner favorable to his designs.
</p><p>One such agent is a shapeshifter by the name of Korucust. Appearing as a Sarnak, Korucust managed to become a member of Sarnak Overking Bathezid Di'zok's council. The Ring of Scale had a representative that once sat upon the Sarnak king's council but he disappeared mysteriously around one year ago, shortly after Korucust was elected. The truth of the matter is that Korucust assassinated this representative at Venril's behest. One of  Venril's goals is to subvert the influence that the Ring of Scale has over the Sarnak. Indeed, he viewed the Sarnak as a means of eventually destroying the Ring of Scale.
</p><p>Before he ordered the assassination, Venril learned very important information about the Ring of Scale through the reports he received from Korucust. He found that a few years back the Ring of Scale were able to steal the memories of a certain High Elven Paladin. The notion that it was possible to actually steal the memories of another and take them as your own was one that was quite attractive to Venril. 
</p><p>Venril has been watching the elves and their small settlement with interest. Far from posing any sort of threat, they have been creating a pleasant distraction that has kept the Frogloks, giants and others busy much to his delight. Nevertheless as in all things, he pays close attention to their activities through his spies. He favors the Lycanthropes, those that still remain loyal to him, for that particular duty. Their superior senses allow them to watch and hear things from a great distance, without alarming the elves.
</p><p>He was fascinated when he began to hear that the elves were telling stories, once again, about this certain High Elven Paladin that had her memories stolen. The rumors say this High Elven Paladin currently has in her possession a staff, allegedly given to her by Tunare, which seems to have an enchantment upon it that is helping the High Elf to regain her memories. Furthermore, Venril hears that this High Elf will be travelling to this elven small settlement very soon, to embark upon a journey to find and confront the Ring of Scale.
</p><p>Upon hearing that the Paladin would soon be traveling to the continent, Venril swore that he would learn the secret of stealing memories. He sees this as a way to exponentially increase his knowledge while destroying his enemies at the same time. Indeed, a ruler without memories is one whose kingdom is easily conquered. If he can gain access to this ability he feels he may finally realize his goal of total control of the continent and eventually, the entire world.
</p><p>Venril Sathir wants both Firiona Vie and her staff, The Lifeguide, so he can study them both and learn how it is that he can steal the memories of others and take them as his own. Venril begins to hatch a plot to bring this about.
</p><p>Of course, the last thing Venril wants is to gain the attention of Ring of Scale or anyone else for that matter. He tasks a powerful shaman by the name of Danak Dhorentath with kidnapping Firiona. He will have her hidden in a remote location, far away from his Castle Karnor. Venril knows without a doubt that there will be elven search parties and the like for a time after her disappearance but he is not concerned. Patience is a trait he has learned in his roughly 400 years as a Lich. 
</p><p>Danak Dhorentath hatches a foul plan to accomplish this goal. Venril lends Danak a powerfully enchanted magic necklace. This necklace has the ability to open a gate to remote encampment far from Venril's domain. Taking a team of four Lycanthropes and a lesser Initiate of The Arisen, Danak and his party make their way to the small elven settlement to fulfill his dark master's wishes and capture the High Elven Paladin.

<p>As described by the Iksar Books of Lore in Cabilis: 
370 A.G.: Vlzk, student of the 5th rung, becomes the youngest Iksar monk to attain the title of Tynn Master. He takes his place among the masters of the Court of Pain.
</p><p>371 A.G.: Master Vlzk becomes the only Iksar monk to be promoted to the rank of Captain within the Iksar Navy. He is promoted by the great Emperor Rile. This act solidifies the alliance between the monks and the Legion and ushers in a new age of disciplines.
</p><p>372 A.G.: During a coastal patrol being conducted by Captain Vlsk, a fierce and sudden water spout hits and splinters his ship. The Navy searches for survivors and none are found.
</p><p>406 A.G.: During a Deep Range Patrol, a group of Legionnaires is greeted by Captain Vlsk. He has survived in the Outlands with no aid. His once proud tail has bee ripped from his body by a Trakanasaurus. He becomes a hero. The blacksmiths are ordered to create a tail made of iron. He is now Captain Irontail.
</p><p>Captain Irontail is promoted to Captain of the Iron Guard, a roving coastal armada. He is also rewarded with great items of magic. In his honor, the Baron and the Arch Duke create an awesome weapon called the Storm Sabre. They also create a lesser blade for all who serve in the Ironguard--The Tynn Foil.
</p><p>406 A.G.: During the Infamous Battle of Timorous Deep, Captain Vlsk Irontail is defeated as well as most of the Sebilisian Navy. A horde of dragons descended upon them. The navy was vastly outnumbered. So was the end of the great Captain Irontail. Long live his spirit.
