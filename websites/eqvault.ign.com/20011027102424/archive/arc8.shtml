Absor on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000265.html" target="_blank">Developer's Corner</a>:<br><blockquote><b>Any chance there will some explanation of why giants in Kael can no longer be charmed? Seems odd that the zone would come down out of the blue and giants no longer charmable. Crowd control? I personally think it was a bad move since giants cannot be charmed... and I have an idea it was due to Avatar of War being killed, but I'm sure if a comment was mad it would clear things up.. Thanks!</b><br><br>I'll do my best to explain the situation.<br><br>Most of you are aware that there is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the aggro code. In Kael there are a lot of NPCs that can be charmed that are significantly more powerful than any pet. Some folks were using this combination of bug and situation to make encounters much more trivial than they were intended to be.<br><br>Fixing the bug will require a full patch, and a largish one at that. We weren't willing to make a large emergency patch, taking down all the servers and requiring all that downtime for our customers to fix a bug being abused in one zone.<br><br>This left us with pretty much three options.<br><br>1) Allow folks to continue to use the bug to their advantage.<br>2) Begin punishing people for using the bug until it could be patched.<br>3) Remove the ability to use the bug in the situation where it was most abusable, Kael, and then fix the bug with the next patch and remove the temporary fix.<br><br>We chose the third option.<br><br>We don't want people using bugs to their advantage. We feel that it harms the game integrity and the gameplay of those that don't use bugs to their advantage. We couldn't take option one.<br><br>We could choose option two, but policing such things requires resources, and banning people isn't something we like to do. This is a new bug, and perhaps people were unsure that it is indeed a bug. And in most circumstances this bug only changes the play style of some people. Only in a few circumstances does this bug become abusable. So fixing the specific circumstance is better than giving warnings to players.<br><br>I know the next question, and let me answer it right now. This is a new bug, and it could be argued with some conviction that players using it to their advantage were unaware that it wasn't purposeful code change. In the case of the abuse of safe zones, it is well known that using such locations is against our rules. It can't be reasonably argued that any player with a character over 50th level doesn't understand that.<br><br>In any case, we plan to fix the bug with the next patch. Until then, the NPCs in Kael will probably remain uncharmable. We understand that this adversely affects single and double group raids in that zone, and for that we are sorry. But things should be back to normal soon. Assuming anyone knows what normal is anyway&#8230;</blockquote>

However I have to admit that the "inspect" message bugs the @#$% out of me. In my experience, people don't inspect to see your character story, they do it to check out, at obnoxiously close range, the make of your armor or the detailing on your sword (i.e. how many plusses you have and whether you are twinked). They usually do it without permission. And even I, as rarely as I get to play these days, have had the unpleasant experience of being accosted in this manner by someone looking to buy my hard-earned equipment right off my back. <br><br>For me, the "so-and-so is inspecting you..." line has become analogous to the creep who stands three and a half inches behind you in line, with his breath ruffling the hairs on the back of your ears .... *shudders* That's why I've taken my carefully considered character commentary OUT and replaced it with the sarcastic remark "Didn't your mother ever teach you not to stare?" Sometimes I wish Daliah could carry mace.<br><br>[b]Which is all by way of saying 1) I think the character box COULD serve a descriptive RP purpose given some of the restrictions that have been proposed (e.g. the 5x change rule), but 2) whether or not you decide to keep it, can you PLEASE let us turn off that (let's face facts) useless-for-non-PvPers message so that we don't have to experience such a constant invasion of our personal space in order to forward our stories? Not that I feel strongly about this or anything ... </b><br><br>You already can turn off the inspection message. Here's a quote from the eqmanual_supplement (highly recommended reading for everyone):<br><br><b>"ShowInspectMessage</b> = TRUE or FALSE<br><br>Sets whether or not you want the &#8220;CharacterName is inspecting you&#8221; message to be displayed when you are inspected by another character."<br><br>You can just open up your eqclient.ini and change the default TRUE to FALSE and you won't see the messages any more.<br><br><b>>>Most of the quirks that you might give your character can be shown by his or her actions in game, using emotes and such (/em scratches the scars on his cheek as he stares off at the horizon).<<<br><br>As someone else has pointed out, a language check on emotes would make the above impossible for anyone who didn't speak your language. As I pointed out in an earlier email, I think I should be able to make my female character curtsey and have everyone understand that's what the duck graphic was supposed to represent, even if they don't speak my language. I'm sure that there are thousands of other inventive, imaginative emotes that your players have dreamt up in the last couple of years. It'd be a shame to lose them all to a language barrier. The range of canned emotes provided by EQ is impressive, but can never match the imagination of a determined RPer. </b><br><br>Agreed. We don't want to lose the functionality either. But, as is always the case, it will come down to a decision about which is the lesser of two evils, losing the ability for everyone to see those emotes, or leaving an easy way to avoid the language restrictions.<br><br><b>Finally, would like to know how we can find out when this proposed server is available for testing? I've never played on a test server yet, but for this, I would. Eagerly. <br><br>Thanks for paying so much attention to our comments and concerns.

Although this has nothing specifically to do with EverQuest, @home users may experience some potential network problems that could cause some degradation of their network performance. Once the Code Red virus infects a machine, it attempts to infect other machines. Users that have firewall logs may see random IP addresses attempting to access port 80 (which is the HTTP Port). This is the Code Red virus attempting to spread itself. We thought it would be a good idea to let people know about this. <br><br>*** UPDATE *** <br>It appears as though this virus is a variant of the Code Red virus called Code Red II. <br><br>*** UPDATE #2 *** <br>It looks as if this virus is all over the place now, not just on @home.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I received the following from Dynamite Shortfuze:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail, Wizards of Fennin Ro!<br><br>    I come before you once again, as I have in the past, with news of<br>this month's Wizard Faire! I have been collecting runes earnestly in<br>anticipation of this month's faire, and I hope all of you have been<br>doing the same!<br><br>    Firstly, I would like to apologize to one and all for my lack of<br>presence last month. I was there for the first half hour or so, but then<br>my ISP went down for the rest of that night and I was unable to attend<br>properly. I received several tells and emails, however, thanking me for<br>organising the event, and with a couple requests pertaining to the time.<br>These requests shall be honored, but first I would like to share with<br>you some exciting news.<br><br>    Taedirk Fyreslinger, fellow wizard of Fennin Ro, has been wanting to<br>organize a language faire, and we have decided that we could hold our<br>faires together for all wizards to benefit. To this end, we would like<br>to organise the language training area near a zone line. This must be<br>easily accessible by most, and must be in a neutral area where none<br>shall worry of being KOS. As the rune trade is normally held at the<br>Toxxulia wizard spires, Taedirk suggested that we do this at the Kerra<br>Ridge zoneline, which I feel is a good idea. If anybody has any<br>objections, or feels that there is a better place to do this, then we<br>will welcome all suggestions.<br>  <br>  At the present time, the details of the faire are as follows:<br><br>--<br><br>Where: Toxxulia Wizard spires / Kerra Ridge<br>Starts: 4 PM PST ( 7 PM EST ) Saturday 4th August<br>Finishes: When we're done! =)<br><br>--<br><br>    For newcomers to the faire, the concept is simple: bring all your<br>runes and research materials to the faire. If you are in need of a rune,<br>then ask for it, and if anyone has one they are not in need of, then you<br>will get it. Consequentially, if you have a rune that you have no need<br>of, and someone else asks for it, then it is expected that you will give<br>that rune to your fellow wizard. The language trading part, I will leave<br>to Taedirk to decide the rules at the faire, but I imagine people will<br>be split into groups of five students and one teacher and then go about<br>learning.<br><br>    This faire is held for the community, by the community, and we are<br>all here to help each other. Even if you haven't any research to do, I<br>strongly encourage you to come out and meet all your fellow wizards.We<br>can only grow stronger as a community, and we can only grow better as we<br>gain friends.<br><br>    Even though this faire is primarily geared towards wizards, I invite<br>everyone to attend. We have had mages, enchanters, even warriors and<br>monks visit us in the past, and we continue to welcome any who wish to<br>join us. The community is not restricted to any one class, and friends<br>do not come in any specific race or class.<br><br>    As I have in the past, I will put forth an effort to brew sufficient<br>refreshments to appease the masses, but I am only one person. If you<br>practice a trade skill, then I encourage you wholeheartedly to bring<br>with you the product of your trade. Taedirk, I know, makes some of the<br>finest lizard on a stick I've had yet, and I hope he will bring some of<br>his own work to share with us, as I hope that you will bring some of<br>your own.<br><br>    If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or ideas pertaining<br>to the faire, please contact me at <a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a>. I will get<br>back to you as soon as I possibly can, and I hope to see you, one and<br>all, at the faire.<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Two updates were made on the Developer's Corner by Alan today. You can view them both here:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000257.html"><b>Sullon Zek Point System</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Question, if I ding 60 and I want to go wipe out a level ~30 dungeon and corpse camp like 10 people at a time till they're deleveled to level 20 .. Will this give negatove points to my "team" or just me? Could a single person doing this eventually drive their entire "team" into the negatives? If so, what if I made an alt on another machine and leveled him to 60 for the sole purpose of camping level 20-30 dunegons to lower THEIR points into the negatives? <br><br>I don't think I get this losing points bit.. If anything a green con kill should provide no points, otherwise this is going to be abused hardcore. And you might say "well, im sure someone will come get revenge on you" .. Sure, i'll just camp out and come back an hour later and start it all over again. <br><br>Or am I totally off base here? <br><br>-Bilden soon to be level 60 AE Wizzie ]</i></font><br><br>The level 60 is not causing any experience loss to the level 30s, so he can't de-level them. <br><br>Yes, your points reflect on your team. So if you lose 5 points, so does your team. But the idea that someone would level a character to 60th just to cause his own team to lose experience is pretty extreme, and very unlikely. Sure it's possible. <br><br>You worry that this might 'be abused hardcore'. The problem is that without a point loss for killing characters that are too low level, there will be far greater abuse. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br><br>I've had a lot of questions about points for under level 20 PvP. <br><br>There are none. <br><br>Killing someone under level 20 yields no points at all. Never has, probably never will.<br><br>It says on the point system rules that the VICTIM must be over level 20 to get points, but it says nothing about whether the killer needs to be over level 20. If I am level 19 can I kill folks over 20 and gain points with no risk of giving them points if I lose? <br><br>- Elaenya of SZ ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it's all about the level of the person killed. A level 19 that kills a level 20 will indeed gain points and be able to collect an insignia. <br><br>Keep in mind, we may change all this again&#8230; We're still keeping the records and just adjusting the point values for actions. You all know that we're not going to award toasting folks much lower level than you are, so if you're worried about points, try to avoid it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000260.html"><b>Fan Faire</b></a><br>Here's the announcement. <br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Verant has joined with Ubisoft, our European distributor, to bring you the first Fan Faire to take place outside if the United States!

A few hours ago Auric posted another round of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000255.html">Scam Warnings</a> on the Developer's Corner:<UL>Hail and well met all!<br><br>I am including another two scams that have been currently going around. We want to keep you aware of these scams as much as possible. Please regularly come back to this thread to see if any other scams have been added to the list. Also, to clarify again, we at Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive will NEVER ask for your password by email or in game. The only email addresses official SOE/Verant communications are done by, are @station.sony.com or @verant.com.<br>Safe journeys :)<br><br>Auric <br><b>Example 1 explained: </b><UL><P><br>--------------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>I have read the many warnings on Everquest scams and I have heard of an idea you guys might want to post or something. What these people do is make a character that seems like a Verant employee (i.e. "VerantWorker" and similar names) and then they tell people that if they want to see a list of the new items <br>in the expansion then they can just type in the away from keyboard message command and then their password. After the unsuspecting person types this in, the scammer quickly does a "/t" so that they get the password as an away message. I have heard of people doing this frequently on Diablo 2 and I have heard of some people who say they want to try this out on Everquest as well.

A few updates were made this afternoon by Alan VanCouvering on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>Majelix wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I realize you are busy with SoL, and the "RP server" hasn't gotten much more than beyond the discussion table at Verant, but I'd like to ask, will the race/class restrictions be removed for the rp server? <br><br>IE, it would be fun to play a halfling paladin or a drunken ogre bard. Of course, this presents the problem of the odd combinations becoming common, which is exactly why you disallow them on normal servers. <br><br>Rather than race/class restrictions, perhaps you could have diety/class restrictions? IE, since iksars -have- worship CT, they can not be paladins. ]</i></font><br><br>It seems unlikely that we'll change any of the class/race combinations for this server. There is no roleplaying need to do so, and there are no balance or gameplay issues that would be created by this server ruleset (unlike Sullon Zek) that would require such changes. <br><br>No doubt someone could come up with a reason for a halfling to be a paladin, or an ogre to be a bard. But the race/class combinations are set up as they are to represent the way things are in Norrath. <br><br>And if there is some concern that there would be a disproportionately large number of halfling paladins in Norrath on a regular server (though I've never heard anyone voice a concern over it&#8230;), then the same would apply on a roleplaying server.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000257.html"><b>Sullon Zek Point System</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>When you say you will lose 5 points per level if the victim is 6 or more levels lower, is that on top of the base points per kill? IE, a level 30 kills a level 24... will they get 95 points, or -5 points? <br><br>Sugarplum ]</i></font><br><br>A level 30 killing a level 24 (for the first time in over an hour) would get 100 points, less 5 points for each level lower because the victim was more than 5 levels lower than the killer.<br><br><br>So it would be 100 &#8211; [5*(30-24)] = 70 points. <br><br>Whereas if the victim were one level higher, 25th, the killer would get 100 &#8211; [2*(30-25)] = 90 points. <br><br>The idea here is to reduce the value of killing folks that don&#8217;t /con as even to you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: QUOTE: <br><br>"Look for a News section on the Sullon board for more info in the near future. <br><br>Hobart" <br><br>Where is this 'Sullen Board' could we get a link? ]</i></font><br><br>I think I listed the link earlier in the thread, but here it is again. <br><br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp</a><br><br>There isn't a news section up there yet, though.

It seems that someone has already updated the rules. They're on the ball, that's for sure. <br><br>Grumples wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think there may be an error in the SZ point calculation. <br><br>According to the updated points rules, we still get 100+2x(level difference) for even con kills. <br><br>Yesturday I killed two even cons and did not die. I got 225 points. <br><br>For me to get 112.5 points per kill, they would have had to have been:<br>100+2Z = 112.5<br>Z = 6.25 levels over me. ]</i></font><br><br>Let's look at that again. <br><br>You didn't give your level, and it might matter, but killing someone 5 levels higher than you would produce 110 points. Two of them would produce 220 points. This leaves 5 points unexplained until you remember that insignia also give you points. I'm not sure how you would get exactly 5 points from them in this fashion. The point system might not be perfect, but it's pretty close. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: They weren't red though, so I know that's not true. <br><br>It appears you are using 100+5x(level difference) for all kills now? ]</i></font><br><br>If it was, the numbers would be a lot more off in the scenario you described. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is fine by me, I think it's better -- level difference should count for more going up as well as down, I'm just not sure it's Working As Intended. <br><br>Also -- does this mean if a level 60 kills a level 20, he gets 100+5*(-40) = -100 points? Or is there a minimum cap? <br><br>I'm somewhat worried about getting negative points for kills, because if you're level 60, a level 54 will con as green as a level 20. You won't realize he's so low until you blast him dead in one shot and lose 100 points. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, a level 60 killing a level 20 will lose 100 points. <br><br>Right now we don&#8217;t plan to add minimum cap. If you are a level 60 character that blasts everyone you see without conning them, then you'll lose points. If you're a level 60 hanging out in a level 20 dungeon killing folks, you'll probably loose points. <br><br>Slowmotionz_SZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Under this change a level 60 defending themselfs from a level 20 would lose 100 points just for defending themselfs.

A player with a 60th level character will be able to tell that the person that ambushed him is casting spells or doing damage that does not match with a character over 30th level or so. He will have the choice to make a dignified retreat, or to teach the person a lesson and blow them to bits. <br><br>But there's really no chance that the situation you described will cause the 60th level character to be losing those points without at least understanding that they will lose points for killing their opponent.<br> <br>The penalty exists to reduce the&#8230; bottom feeding. In any case, 0 would never be the lower limit. A penalty is required to reduce the desire for folks to blow up those that are just way low level. Right now, a 60th level character could toast a 40th level character with no penalty. That seems like a pretty large range. And, well, the effective limit is &#8211;100 points. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Can someone please explain how points are given for PvP before level 20?

I received this report from Viergang of the 7th Hammer server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail!<br><br>A GM event took place very recently on the 7th Hammer server. Pokkah and Scatters (a<br>couple scarecrows) attacked the grounds surrounding Kelethin, wishing death<br>to the druids. They complained about being mistreated in the fields, and<br>essentially blamed the druids. Now, as a druid of Karana I think this is<br>strange. The only scarecrows I'm aware of are on the Western Plains of<br>Karana, and the druids there are human druids (who assumedly worship<br>Karana)...why did Pokkah and Scatters attack Kelethin? Wouldn't their grudge<br>have been against Surefall?<br><br>Ruala told me:   'pokkah wished revenge for the inoppropriate use of<br>scarecrows.  He blamed the druids and sought to destroy them'<br><br>I think clues (if there are any) would be best searched for in the Western<br>Karanas, or perhaps in Rivervale (Shakey the Scarecrow is at the druid's<br>guild).<br><br>Enclosed is a picture of the foul creature's corpse, for the amusement of<br>your readers everywhere.<br><br>As an addendum, might I add that several cowards offered to throw in with<br>these scarecrows, the most vocal being a high elf male by the name of<br>Naveed. Several others were Weehealer, Beklar and Kandace. Druids meeting<br>these wretches on the 7th Hammer should think twice about assisting them, as<br>they were calling for our death only tonight!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Viergang Von Sicherfalle<br>Druid of the 29th Season,<br>Wardens of the Wood<br>7th Hammer<br><br><br><br>Some sample Text:<br><br>Pokkah shouts, 'come haters of druids!

They come in three forms: <br><br>Cantatus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Instead of adding more spell slots, how about adding some commands that make it easier to switch spells. <br><br>/unmem 1-8 - This command removes one of your spells from the spell gems starting with 1 at the top and 8 at the bottem. <br><br>/mem 1-50 1-5 1-8 - This command replaces one of your availalbe spell gems with another spell. 1-50 picks the page the spell is on, 1-5 picks the spell and 1-8 picks the spell gem it goes in. <br><br>With these two commands, I could set up a hotkey like this: <br><br>/unmem 1<br>/mem 5 1 1 <br><br>This would enable me to switch the spell in my top spell gem without sitting down. ]</i></font><br><br>(Note: No matter what, any solution like this would require that you sit down. It wouldn't bypass the spell memorization restrictions, it would just make it so that the player doesn't have to click as much.) <br><br>And&#8230; <br><br>Hardcorecletus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The problem most people have is that switching gems is tedious. The downtime is OK - it's the constant clicking to accomplish it. <br><br>Here's the solution that is not unbalancing - have multiple "sets" of gems. You can't just switch between them - your character sits down and automatically switches them for you. And perhaps you could be nice and make it check against ones you already have mem'd, so it doesn't take the time to mem those again. (still reorders them tho') But - here's what makes this easy way a little different than doing them one at a time (which you still should be able to do) - if you are interrupted while switching gem sets, you go back to the one you were at. Even if you had 7 of them done, you go back. No half-way done stuff here. This means it's still not a way to swap out during fights. But it makes it less tedious during normal times. ]</i></font><br><br>And&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings, <br><br>I agree with all that was said by both parties about spell slots. I think a solution is possible to please both arguments. That solution is to make the eight memorized spell slots dynamic and relating it to the character stats or experience. <br><br>What I mean by dynamic is that it would make sense to me that either the older you are (your level) the more you can memorize OR even better and makes more sense... is that the more Intelligence or Wisdom you have the more spells you will be able to memorize! If you loose your items... you loose the ability memorize more spell. (You go back to 8 slots until you get your items back) <br><br>For example (and this is an example)...<br>If a characters Wisdom or Intelligence is between...<br>0-170 you get 8 spell slots<br>171-185 you get 9 spell slots<br>186-205 you get 10 spell slots<br>206-220 you get 11 spell slots<br>221-up you get 12 spell slots max.. <br><br>I know this may be a coding problem, but it sure would enhance the game in that casters would be more active and EXCITED about getting their intelligence or wisdom beyond 200. <br><br>-Tuetatesu Ishwar<br>45th Wizard of Bertoxx ]</i></font><br><br>And I'll certainly pass all those ideas to the team. But with Shadows of Luclin in the works, any sort of rather large programming issue like this will have to wait. <br><br>Other ideas have come up as well, such as spells cast from scrolls and directly from spell books. I'll mention those as well. And a lot of you have sent in comments both agreeing and disagreeing with the idea that the eight spell slots is a strategic element of the game. <br><br>Thanks for all your input. I just wanted to let you know which ideas we've already heard.

Hot off the Developer's Corner is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000257.html">this news</a> announcing a change to the Sullon Zek Point System:<UL>As I mentioned, we're storing the stats and determining the points from those stats. This allows us to adjust the point system as needed. Here's an update from Hobart:<br><br>quote:<UL><P><i><br>Greetings,<br><br>Yesterday we made a change to the way kill points were calculated on Sullon. The change is now that you will receive -5 points per level difference of your kill ONLY if your victim is 6 levels or greater below you. For example. A level 40 kills a level 20. He will receive 0 points for the kill assuming his base points were at 100.<br><br>We had to recalculated all the points to this date with this new formula.<br><br>Sorry for the short notice... Been really busy.<br><br>Look for a News section on the Sullon board for more info in the near future.<br><br>Hobart</I></UL><P><br><br>Busy would be an understatement. Thanks Hobart.<br><br>Alan</UL>
