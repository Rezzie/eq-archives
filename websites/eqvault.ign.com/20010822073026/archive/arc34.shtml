From Aracnakat:<BLOCKQUOTE>As the dust settles and the fog clears, shapes begin to take form within the clouds.

It has been a long time in the making, but some sort of shrine needed to be built and who better to craft one than the dwarven workers of Kaladim.<br><br> The spire shot forth into the sky in splendor and magic seemed to be naturally imbued in the stonework as a blue glow emanated from the structure.

Two new patch messages have been posted very recently on the Patch Server:<UL>December 8th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Velious Subscribers*<br><br>Please run the "Velious Patch" off of the patch program.<br><br>*New Patch*<br><br>We appreciate everyone's continued patience over the past couple of days, and are happy to see that the problems that have been experienced are relatively minor compared to those of the past.  Tonight's patch is expected to be the last one we'll have to do for a while, so we hope to have you enjoying Velious over the weekend non-stop.<br><br>Today's patch corrects the following issues:<br><br>- The user interface problems that occurred as of last night have been addressed, such as window positioning and transparency.  Also addressed were problems with targeting, enabling and disabling windows, and switching to and from resolutions above 1280x1024.<br>- Corrected a problem that would cause some Voodoo card users to lock up when killing giants.<br>- Added messages for some new skills that some NPCs have (e.g. Rampage, and Flurry).  <br>- Fixed items and item drops in a number of zones.<br><br>Enjoy your weekend!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>December 7th, 4:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch addresses a few issues brought up by players over the last several days:<br><br>- Fixed an issue with /split that would cause people to go linkdead in the event that they used the command in quick succession.<br>- Fixed a bug where you could not edit socials or skills (via the hotbutton window right click) in fullview mode if you had hidden your "MainMenu" window.<br>- Fixed a bug where you would not see hotbuttons in "normal" mode if you had hidden that window in fullview mode.<br>- Fixed it so you can't use hotbuttons when looting, trading, banking, or using a merchant in fullview mode (which is how it is in normal mode, but with the inventory working in fullview mode now it wasn't blocked properly for that).<br>- Fixed the message for the /dynamiclights command to report properly.<br>- Fixed a problem where INI setting were not being read properly if you had camped or went LD to server select then reentered the game. This was causing various UI problems with window positions and colors being wrong.<br>- Fixed a problem with Sirens Grotto - Some people entering the zone were getting stuck.<br>- Fixed a problem with passage from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar.  Travel in that direction was supposed to require a key.<br>- We believe we fixed a problem where NPCs sometimes would hit a pet-owner no matter how far away the owner was from the pet and the NPC.  <br>- Corrected loot drops in Thurgadin<br><br>We again appreciate patience while we stabilize following Velious launch.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

But they are necessary, or we wouldn't do it. I'm sorry that these things are inconveniencing our customers, that's never our intent. <br><br>Honestly, this release has been much smoother than Ruins of Kunark. The problems that we are encountering have rarely been devastating. And considering the shorter production time on this product and the ambitious nature of the product, I think we've done a fair job. <br><br>We certainly wanted the release to be flawless. It wasn't. But we're getting closer each time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038693.html"><b>Item Inspection Window Name</b></a><br>My guess is that it's these entries: <br><br>ItemDataWinY=225<br>ItemDataWinX=200<br>ItemDataWinH=150<br>ItemDataWinW=400 <br><br>There should be one set for each resolution. <br><br>But I'm not Rowyl, and he's not at his desk at the moment... so use at your own risk.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038136-3.html"><b>Nerfed SoV Items</b></a><br>This was, by no stretch of the imagination an injustice to anyone. <br><br>We changed the weapon into something that was appropriate for the creature that it dropped from. The item that was dropping there shouldn't have been dropping. <br><br>We corrected our mistake. <br><br>Leaving it as it was would have been the greater injustice. It would have promoted the idea that getting the expansion first entitled a player to items that they gained due to an error in our data. <br><br>I can't comment on the reasons for past actions about matters like this. I personally feel that this is the proper response to this situation. <br><br>I am sorry that we had to change that item. It wasn't done to anger anyone. It was done because it should have been done, to keep things in balance. There was no intent to 'bait and switch' anyone here. Yes, we missed this problem, but we fixed it as fast as we could. I'm sorry if any of you had your items changed. <br><br>Msully wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "&#8230;but did they have to rub your nose in it?" ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, we were rubbing our own noses in it&#8230; <br><br>Axterix said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Verant can't win in this sitaution, really." ]></i></font><br><br>That's pretty much true.

The only reason that someone would drag off a corpse would be to restore his life. Friend or not, that NPC doesn't want you to do that. Just because you are a friend of the NPC and the dead guy is your friend, that does not make the dead guy the friend of the NPC. That is an illogical conclusion. <br><br>But the real reason for the corpse dragging thing is because people could use this feature to bypass parts of the game that a feature isn't supposed to let them pass. The choices were, basically, remove the feature entirely, never implement interesting new gameplay that the feature would make worthless, or modify the feature.

Alan announced some new changes to the disciplines today in an announcement posted to the Gameplay Board.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037502.html">complete post</a>:<UL><i>We've decided to change a few of the new disciplines. These changes will go into effect with the emergency patch (though this is not the reason for the patch, just something that we are slipping in while we're at it).<br><br>Resistant &#8211; At 30th level the resistance gain will be +3. This will increase at increments until 50th level, where it will reach its maximum of +10.<br><br>The Ranger True Shot &#8211; The chance of hitting with a bow while using this discipline will increase, along with the other benefits.<br><br>Shadowknights Unholy Aura &#8211; along with the 25% increase in damage, this discipline will also make the Harm Touch less resistable, along the lines of a Lifetap resistance.<br><br>Paladins Holy Forge &#8211; the ability to critical with this discipline in use will be doubled. It will, of course, still only affect the undead.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Creating a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037509.html">new thread</a> on the Gameplay Board, Alan gave the following update concerning Innate Resistances:<UL><i>Another change that is going in with this patch (again, not the reason for the patch, just an extra), will be a change to the way innate resistances work.<br><br>Some of you may remember about a year ago when we boosted the innate resistance for certain classes. It turns out that, because these were created before the ability to gain levels beyond 50, these resistances were not being calculated properly for most classes as they passed level 50.<br><br>This means that, once this is fixed, all classes with these resistances will see an increase in their innate resistance bonus that may be as high as 11 points.<br><br>The exception is warriors, whose resistance bonus was working just fine.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

As we mentioned earlier today, you need to hit the Velious patch button before venturing to the new land.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037454.html">latest reminder</a> from Alan:<UL><I>If you are new to Velious you will need to run the Velious patch. After starting EverQuest the patcher will update your standard EverQuest files. Then at the bottom you will see several option buttons for updating specific parts of the game. If you have just installed Velious, you will need to choose to update Velious by clicking on that button.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

From Nikki:<BLOCKQUOTE>grrlgamer.com posts an answer to the detractors of EverQuest in "The Shared Dream for EverQuest"<br> <br><a href="http://www.grrlgamer.com/gamegrrl.htm">http://www.grrlgamer.com/gamegrrl.htm</a><br> <br>"There&#8217;s been a lot of talk lately about &#8220;the failure&#8221; of EverQuest, both as a game and as a customer service oriented entity. In a piece posted in the EverQuest forum, an ex-player named Skyrain Dreamweaver has left his mark with an editorial called &#8220;Bullies on the Playground&#8221;. It&#8217;s a great piece, and makes some interesting and valid points about playing EverQuest. And yet on the whole I believe that the &#8220;failure&#8221; mentioned in this article does not belong to the game. It belongs to the players."<br> <br>Nikki Douglas<br>Editor<br>grrlgamer.com</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
