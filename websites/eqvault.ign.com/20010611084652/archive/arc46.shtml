The following word was sent in by Azriel:<BLOCKQUOTE> POVAR NEWBIE EVENT - 20 September 2000, 7PM EST<br> <br> I awoke today to find my older sister missing from her bunk. I have searched the area, and now suspect foul play. My sister is a formidable person, with many enemies, and yet all her items of power were found laying strewn around her bedroom. She would never have left our abode without them. I have followed the trail as far as I can, but the attitude of the guards of Qeynos prevent me from venturing further, they seem to want to lay waste to my young inexperienced self. I am searching for brave GROUPS of adventurers to rescue my sister. I have a few clues which may lead in the correct direction, but I can follow them no further. If you're a brave adventurer, and would like to help me search for my sister, please we are gathering in Qeynos Hills, close to the border of West Karana at 7pm 20 September (this date and time in the mystical world knowns as Eastern Standard Time, Earth). I will give ALL my earthly possessions to the group of adventurers that return my sister to me alive. And so far many donations have been given by friends of my sister to add to the rewards. We are seeking groups of six adventurers from the 1st to the 18th Cycle. Prepare well, for if they captured my sister, then they must be powerful themselves.<br> <br>Young Warrior Azriel, brother of Angelodeth Azriel</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

Dwynn's own words best describe the event:<br><br>	"Our goal has been reached<br><br>	It has been a long time since Orb firs posted his Rant, which grew and<br>flourished into the monstrosity known as Rant.

I received the following from Dirge:<BLOCKQUOTE>Cresting the last of several gentle hills, the exiled<br>Teir&#8217;dal woman narrowed her eyes, focusing on the<br>stoic grandeur of the walls of her second home&#8230;<br>Qeynos.  Amorsaylnn Frost smiled to herself.  The<br>humans had come to accept her, though many still<br>harbored some doubts about her intentions.  Her musing<br>was cut short by a cry of pain.  "Ahhhgggg&#8230;"  It<br>emerged from a young man, leaning against the<br>unforgiving stones of the wall.  <br><br>Amor turned, fumbling in her pack for spare bandages,<br>but his wounds were quite serious, beyond her ability<br>to mend.  He tried to speak.  "Those mangy dogs put up<br>a tough fight.  If I don&#8217;t make it back to the Clan<br>House soon, it&#8217;ll all be over for me."  There was a<br>brave, determined look in his eyes.  Amor had seen<br>death many times in her short life, but most often<br>people crumpled, whimpering for forgiveness and<br>safety.  This man was different, strong and would<br>accept death if she chose to embrace him.<br><br>"What dogs?" Amor asked, trying to support him.<br><br>He answered between gasps for breath.  "It&#8217;s those<br>Darkpaws&#8230; They&#8217;ve beat me pretty badly&#8230; but they&#8217;ll<br>get theirs soon enough!"<br><br>Amorsaylnn was not very interested in politics.  Truth<br>be told, she was very much a mercenary, having been<br>hired by another Teir&#8217;dal known as Shivrehel Despana<br>and his House, Winterborne.  She had fled Neriak in<br>the night, sent by her father, Makaz, to find this<br>Teir&#8217;dal and follow his path.  As it turned out, he<br>had strange connections with Lady Vox, the mythical<br>dragoness of the North.  Now she found herself<br>traveling frequently with his consort, a barbarian<br>witch by the name of Shar Hel Despana&#8230; and they made a<br>good team.<br><br>But being near Shiver meant hearing a lot of rumor and<br>suggestion.  He was a politician, at heart.  The last<br>bit of news she had heard before heading out to the<br>southern reaches of the Karanas was about a man named<br>Tomer Instogle, a member of the Silent Fist Clan.  He<br>was missing since he helped try and defend the Qeynos<br>Gates against the gnoll forces.<br><br>Amor knew there had been no formal alliance between<br>the monks of the Silent Fist and House Winterborne,<br>but they were, in theory, given to a similar purpose. <br>They were sworn to upholding the strength of Qeynos. <br>She whispered to the wounded man.  "I will take you to<br>your Clan House, Tomer."  He asked that she carry his<br>backpack for him.  It was the least they could do.  In<br>moments, she had escorted the monk to his House and<br>handed his backpack to his brothers that came to<br>assist.<br><br>Master Seta Bakindo was greatly relieved.  "We thought<br>that was the last we&#8217;d seen of him.  Thank you!"<br><br>The Teir&#8217;dal nodded, smiling slightly.  "It was the<br>least I could do.  House Winterborne is quite<br>interested in assisting the other noble Houses of<br>Qeynos.  These gnolls have caused much harm.  We would<br>be your allies, if you are interested."<br><br>Tomer was overcome with joy.  "Oh, you have the<br>makings of a true hero.. The Silent Fist Clan is proud<br>to have you as ally. May your soul guide and protect<br>you through these chaotic times!"<br><br><br>OOC ~ Winterborne will be hosting a newbie give-away<br>on the Xegony server, Monday the 25th at 8 PM EST. <br>Characters of level one (1) through five (5) who are<br>not anonymous may turn in three gnoll scalps at the<br>gates to Qeynos for a reward from among the following<br>prizes: medium banded armor, raw silk armor, fine<br>steel and forged weapons, and jade-silver rings.  Each<br>character may receive a maximum of three prizes (nine<br>gnoll scalps, total).  We will also be providing<br>buffs, healing, drinks, and excellent company&#8212;all<br>in-character&#8212;for those participating.  Even if you are<br>beyond this level range, we would welcome the<br>fellowship.

I realize that there is a Button to confirm item destruction, but thats just another button to have to click during loots. Most of the time in dungeons the game lags bad enough without having to deal with more twitching.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd have a hard time convincing the guys that yet another level of security is needed here. Sure, I've accidently destroyed items while looting, and when that happened, I turned fast item destroy off. I'd hate to not have the ability to destroy and item while looting, since that's where the majority of my destroys take place. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015023.html"><b>Mages and mana Regen Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Magicians ever get Mana Regen spells? it really seems to me that all other pure casters have this. It would greatly help mage Magicians a more robust class.]</i></font> <br><br>Beyond meditation, no. Mages are pretty robust as it is, and the complaints that I've heard don't appear to be tied to mana.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015049.html"><b>Real Issue on Posting</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Many players post with more than one idea/issue/rant/etc on mind. The post is usually mixed with emotion and feelings and facts all jumbled up. Next step is Gordon (or whomever) reads the post and answers the post. Now the postee may have had 8 points in the post but all revolving around a central issue. Gordon (or whomever) replys to 1 or 2 or more of the points but may miss the main point. <br><br>I suggest that we number our issues 1 by 1, making it hard for Gordon (or whomever) to "accidently" miss answering a point. Make your posts clear and concise. What Im suggesting is an unofficial format.]</i></font> <br><br>It's a good idea. Clear and concise points are more likely to be addressed. This of course assumes that it is a point that I want to address. In all fairness, those 8 point posts that you mention often only have 1 or 2 points that it would be beneficial to address.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014462-2.html"><b>Harvest: Make It Like Harm Touch/Lay of Hands</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is one thing that REALLY bothers me about Harvest though. It permanently uses up a spell slot. Now, you might say necros need to use a spell slot for lich, but once they cast it then they can unmem it until they need it again. Same goes for clarity.<br><br>Wizards can not afford to EVER unmem harvest ]</i></font><br><br>It's a tradeoff. Wizards decide whether or not they want to have the spell available always, and "pay" for that decision with a spell slot should they choose that they do. <br><br>It's a good enough spell that it is worth a slot, at least for those who keep it memmed all of the time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011329-2.html"><b>Why is it NO-Drop?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant-Abashi: Why is this Item NO DROP???<br>Item: Sarnak Earring of Station ]</i></font><br><br>I don't know, perhaps it's used for a quest? <br><br>Anyway, this really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. There are over 10K items in game now, and as we get more and more it gets harder to insert them into the same mesh as others. Some are bound to have stats and settings that have no great plan behind them, or have one that isn't apparent at the time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014922.html"><b>Playing Your Class</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: yes, the only answer we have got, was something like: learn to play your class right and show others what you can do. i found this very insulting. someone who has no clue about hybrids (not a flame gordon, noone knows everything about every class..... )past 50 tells a lot of good SKs to learn more.......]</i></font> <br><br>Thankfully I have someone playing every class pretty close at hand :)  Yes, that includes the SK. One of the most avid EQ players in house here has a high level SK built from scratch. He's also one of the decision-makers, so it works out fairly well. Suffice it to say that he thinks that SKs are fantastic, and I'll agree with him on that point, despite the issues that you brought up. </UL>

There's a few posts to report today that Gordon Wrinn made recently, and for a nice Sunday change all of them are light hearted.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014721.html">post #1</a>:<UL>This taken from MSNBC:<br>"Gordon was moving at 60 mph and was expected to become a hurricane sometime Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said."<br><br>Gordon, are you leaving Verant to create large waves and intense winds in the Gulf of Mexico?<br><br><b><i>Rofl :)<br><br>-Gordon<br>-A mere storm at the moment...</b></i></UL>Here <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014642.html">post #2</a>:<UL>One day little red riding hood was going through the woods and stumbled upon a small bag on the path. Once she picked it up she realized it was really a rat ear. "EWWWWWWW" she said as she threw the disgusting article away and it magically became a small bag again. So she walked a little further along the path and a HUGE!!! guy with blue paint all over his body was on it. So she said "Hi I"m little red riding hood" Well he said "OK OK I'LL GIVE YOU SOW JUST STOP ANNOYING ME!!!" and so he cast SoW on little red riding hood. So along red goes down the path and passes through the agro radius of a Shadow Wolf. Since she is running so fast it doesn't catch up to her until she reaches her grandma's house. She tries opening the door, but can't. Then she taps on the door and it opens for her! So in she goes and she sees three people: Mira Sayer, Nilipus, and her grandmother. <br><br>Mira and Nilipus leave after Red enters. So Red riding hood gives her grandmother the basket, and then her grandmother says "Thank you very much dear, here is a little something for bringing me [dencher cleaner]. <br>You receive 1 silver 4 copper.<br>Your faction with OldPeople has gone up<br>Your faction with Mayong Mystmoore has gone up<br>Your faction with Nagafen has gone down<br>Your faction with Bixies has gone down<br>You gain experience!<br><br>Then out of the wall runs in the shadow wolf and bites red for 5 points of damage. She screams for help but to no avail until a newbie hunter walks by and enters the house. With an agile thrust he slays the shadow wolf. Then he says "d4mn, n0 ph4t l3w7" and then he looks at red and says "give me mny plz". Red give him the silver and copper she got from her grandma and the newbie says "You sux0r, and U r st00p1d."<br><br>Fifteen minutes later red receives a tell from Etermelody saying her name is against the naming policy as it is based on a popular novel so then she receives a name above her head which says "Limmle Reda Ridon Herld".<br><br>The End<br><br><b><i>I'm sorry, but the Crimson Hooded Cloak of the Equestrian is severely overpowered and as such will no longer drop. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014359.html">post #3</a>:<UL>When he plays, I'm sure he doesn't play his character named Abashi.

Gordon was up late again making the following posts to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014636.html"><b>Trade Skill Speciailization</b></a><br>There's been a number of requests along these lines. I'll bring the issue up at the Tuning Meeting Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014638.html"><b>The Delayed Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Im fine with it. But the problem is that i have an error / crashing problem that this patch fixes. why cant i get the appropriate files for that, or why cant the be released befroe the full patch?]</i></font> <br><br>Because other changes to the files for that require underlying changes in other parts of the patch. The client is also tied to the version of code running on the server in most cases. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive spent hours on test server w/ no crashes, but on Torv it crashes in 10 minutes or less every time i log. The solution is out there, and i just need to get my hands on it, how is this usually handled?]</i></font> <br><br>I really apologize for the delay.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014639.html"><b>More Illusions</b></a><br>Unfortunatley "Illusion: Animation" wouldn't work, as the race of an animation is one that we call the "Invisible man". The only reason that the sword and shield show up on the animation is because he's actually got them equipped. <br><br>An enchanter wouldn't have those items equipped, so wouldn't show up. :(<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014614.html"><b>Splits</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is there any way that when you lock a thread due to size you start another on the same subject, have seen it done on a few boards, maybe this one too and Im just blind]</i></font> <br><br>We used to do that, however it seemed to turn the thread into a contest to get it to split. I think we had one thread up to about 12 splits before we decided to stop splitting them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014621.html"><b>Direct3D Mip Mapping</b></a><br>We have a plan for the MipMap issues, as well as others present with some of the more advanced features and performance found in new games. It involves upgrading the level of DirectX that the client uses. This would require that everyone update their DirectX drivers to the most recent version. <br><br>We'll have more information to post about this next week. We plan to give a couple of weeks lead-time before making such a big change, so the updates won't be in Tuesday's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014625.html"><b>Credit Card Safety</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I can't seem to communicate to my mom that giving out one's credit card number to Everquest is a reasonably safe procedure. She believes that under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone give that out. Naturally, this prevents me from trying out my brand spanking new game. Could anybody out there tell me where to go to inform her better about this, or at least give some information coming from an experienced user?]</i></font> <br><br>This is actually one of the things that keeps internet commerce from growing faster than it is, and is mostly due to misconceptions spawned by the entertainment industry (movies, television). Our interface uses a secure encrypted protocol to ensure that the data remains safe. <br><br>In my opinion, purchasing services on the internet from reputable companies is far more secure than handing your card to the waiter at the local restaurant. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014551-3.html"><b>Board Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon or UBBAdmin can something be done about Snoota and his "group"? ]</i></font><br><br>I really don't think that there's anything wrong with a little levity to take the edge off. If it begins to cause problems with communications on the board, we'll ask them to reign it in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014584.html"><b>10 Things I Love & Hate</b></a><br>That's interesting. Personally, as I was reading the "hate" list I was thinking that those are some of the best things in life :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014536.html"><b>Turning EXP Off</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There was some talk in the past about a option to turn of XP gain. Well I was wondering if this ever could happen. I know that one of the best times me and my girlfriend have in the game is when our characters are the same level but sometimes you just have things that happens where you get a level or so ahead of the other. I think this would be a good time to bring it back up with the response to Abshi's poll on how many families play the game together. ]</i></font><br><br>I mentioned this to the team a while back in an email, but we had a few things going on at the time that were monopolizing the time of the developers. I'll bring it up again in the Tuning meeting Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014519.html"><b>No Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Make all the items NO DROP. If you want something then earn it.]</i></font><br><br>This is actually covered in the FAQ: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014508.html"><b>A Complaint</b></a><br>It's possible that they may be using the wrong animation, but that should be controlled by the type of skill that it uses. Perhaps it's a dwarf thing. Do you know if gnomes have a similar problem? I'm just looking for as much information as possible before taking it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014488.html"><b>Abuse and Harassment</b></a><br>The policies regarding name changes, and the fact that they usually aren't done except in cases of a violation of the policy, is to keep people from using namechanges to escape their bad reputation. I realize in this case you want a name change to escape someone ELSES bad reputation, however the GMs have no way to know whether or not that really is the case. As you might imagine, people with bad reputations really aren't all that straightforward about their situations when talking to GMs. That other person with the similar name could very well be asking the GM for a name change because of you. <br><br>If we do this name change we open ourselves to doing all sorts of them on the basis of the name being similar to someone elses. As we cannot maintain our plan of having reputation as a factor if this happens, the current policy is the only fair one. <br><br>My best suggestion is for you to work on building th reputation of your name and explain that you aren't the person with the bad reputation. This should be pretty easy, especially when that person is online. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014498.html"><b>Abashi and Lum</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My personal choice is #2. I've grown tired of seeing the same old retoric in response to issues. I've grown tired of seeing well thought out posts with logical, proven empirical data in them get seemingly blown off.]</i></font> <br><br>Hi Brent, welcome back to the boards. <br><br>I frequently give complete explanations to the issues, for at least the first few times that they come up. The FAQ is a good example of those complete explanations. However, once all of those explanations are stated, and more information is requested over and over, we wind up at a pure and simple "No, it's not up for debate, and we won't do it." Now I don't think that I've ever used those words, and I usually try to add some padding, but I try to be as straight forward as possible in these instances. <br><br>There are other cases where it's impossible to come up with a quantifiable explanation of the way things are. This is espicially true when the reason behind something is that it just wasn't what we had in mind. This lead of course to the "Not in the vision" parodies. I even tried to put something in the FAQ concerning these issues, but they still come up, leading me back to a simple "No." <br><br>The reason why clerics don't get SOW, rangers don't get see-invis, shamans don't get clarity, and magicians don't get summon corpse are basically all the same: It wasn't what we had in mind for those classes. There's no way to quantify this with a formula. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Besides, most of the game is not up for debate. What Verant does is they take user input and feedback, but then use their own judgement. If they think something is underpowered, then they will change it. Likewise if they think something is overpowered. It's a small, but important distinction; and it gets blurred quite frequently.]</i></font> <br><br>Very true and well said. We have to be the ultimate arbitrators of what should, shouldn't, will, and will never be. If we don't take up that role, the game will lose focus and sooner or later become something that people do not want to play. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014506.html"><b>"Please remove warning spam from Song of Travel "</b></a><br>Good point. I'll mention it to the team on Monday.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
The latest Discussion of the Week has come to an end.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014611.html">the final thoughts from Bill Coyle</a>, one of Verant's Game Designers:<UL><I>First off I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who participated in this discussion. As I read through all the posts I was very pleased to see that most of the ideas, requests, and suggestions you all have here mirror my own ideas as a game designer. I thought I&#8217;d take this opportunity to address some of the key topics and concerns brought up and give you all my perspective on them.<br><br><b>On Announcing Quests to the Public</b><br><br>While we&#8217;d ideally like to have everyone involved in our dynamic quests, the reality of limitations such as internet latency, zone overcrowding, and sheer lack of manpower make this difficult to do. If you announce that a huge quest is going to happen in Qeynos Hills for example, chances are that everyone who can get there will. With a limit on the number of GMs and Guides who can facilitate the quest, this can make it almost impossible to run. And although we&#8217;ve increased our functionality to facilitate these quests by a lot, we&#8217;re still not at the point where we can have a large scale quest involving an entire player base of 2000+ people at once. Until that time dynamic quests are always going to have the luck factor of being in the right place at the right time.<br><br><b>On Rewarding Role-playing</b><br><br>I am a firm believer in the principle that for most dynamic quests the rewards to be reaped should go to those who role-played the quest best and made the biggest mark in the story line of it. The biggest problem with rewarding role-playing is that it is a completely subjective thing. What one person views as good role-playing another sees as acting like a fool. The other inherent problem with this is that we can&#8217;t watch everyone at once. You may be doing the best job in rallying the troops to defend Rivervale against the invading goblin army, but if no one facilitating the quest sees you do it they can&#8217;t reward you for it. We have a limited number of people who run these quests, and while we often do have a bunch of invisible people running around, we don&#8217;t see everything. At the end of such quests all the guides and gm&#8217;s who participated will usually talk about all the people they thought were doing a good job and vote on who to give the treasure to. If you can think of a fairer way to accomplish these I&#8217;d love to hear the suggestions. <br><br><b>On Being the &#8220;Hero&#8221;</b><br><br>Let&#8217;s face it, everyone in any fantasy role-playing game wants to be the hero, central figure in which the world revolves around. This is perhaps the greatest challenge for a massively multiplayer game to meet. Rather than just saying this is impossible I choose to look at it from a different perspective. It is my belief that everyone can be a hero in his or her own mind and in the minds of those around them. The 12th level warrior who makes a stand to hold off the gnolls while his party escapes is indeed a hero to that particular group. The 50th level cleric who travels the world resurrecting and healing those in need could be considered a hero on the server in which he does this. The point I&#8217;m getting at is that you, the player base, decide who your heroes are based on the way they act and the things they do. We provide the content, the background, and the stage. But you all are the real dynamic actors, the heroes of our world.<br><br><b>On GM Slaughter Sprees</b><br><br>We&#8217;ve all heard the tales and some of us have even been a victim. &#8220;I was sitting there camping something when all of the sudden a Red mob came running at me and killed me before I had a chance to think. Then I found out it was part of some GM quest&#8230;I have become a victim of a vicious GM out to get players.&#8221; This is a common tale told on message boards and in taverns and I&#8217;m not going to say it doesn&#8217;t happen that way. What I do want to know is what is the difference between that and a rare spawn popping in the zone and killing you? I remember one of the first times I was hunting in Oasis with my level 15 cleric and got a visit from Lockjaw. He was bigger, meaner, and scarier than anything I expected to run into there&#8230;and I didn&#8217;t stand a chance. There are encounters like this throughout all of Norrath; it&#8217;s that extra rare danger that makes things a little more dynamic and exciting. When a GM or Guide assumes the role of an actor in a quest they have a responsibility to portray that character properly. And if that character happens to be a bloodthirsty monster or a vicious dark elf, then you would expect them to kill people. Most quests have a certain level range in mind that goes along with the back-story of a quest. One of the biggest complaints I&#8217;ve seen is that quests often use npc&#8217;s that are a much higher level range than the players who typically frequent the zone the quest takes place in. The biggest reason that this happens is that it fits in best with the story. Dark Elves wishing to invade Qeynos for example would probably send some pretty tough troops in to throw at the city, and the fact that many newbies hang out around cities is none of their concern, invading Qeynos is. My advice to those of you that suddenly find yourself in a situation like this is to hide behind something and call for reinforcements. Whether you like it or not you are now part of a dynamic quest, you&#8217;re the victim of the story that people need to save =).<br><br><b>On Dynamic Quest Etiquette</b><br><br>Another big concern of most people, myself included, are the antisocial players who just try to ruin a quest for others. These are the people that run up to the dynamic Npc&#8217;s and shout, &#8220;Stop messing around you stupid GM&#8221; or &#8220;Gimme ur Ph@t L3wtz!&#8221; It should be noted that these people would promptly be ignored or worse by most dynamic quest npcs. In the type of quests requiring more interaction and role-playing, these people aren&#8217;t going to get anywhere and if they become too disruptive we are committed to removing them from the quest entirely. Recent additions to our functionality now give us new powers to more strongly control situations like this. One of the best new features we&#8217;ve added recently is the ability to set a maximum player level range that can still hurt the mob. This will allow us to create a lot more lower level quests without the concern of higher level players &#8220;stealing the quest&#8221; from those it was designed for. Just remember, if you want to participate in a dynamic quest portray your character and leave the ooc comments out of it, you&#8217;ll find that the npcs will interact with you a lot more and you&#8217;ll learn more of the story going on. And please, if you don&#8217;t want to participate in a role-playing type of quest, just leave the zone and let those who do have it. But whether you&#8217;re role-playing or not, don&#8217;t be surprised or angry at your swift death if you attack a npc for no reason, they will retaliate just as you would in their position.<br><br>In conclusion I&#8217;m happy to see that many of things I saw suggested in this discussion are actually in the works right now. We have a dedicated team of Quest Masters who are working day and night on just this sort of thing. As our functionality increases, so will the frequency and quality of our quests. There will always be many varying kinds, from pure combat ones like a rabid wolf in Qeynos Hills to pure role-playing ones involving only npc interaction and figuring out some kind of puzzle. We are committed to conveying more of the history and story of Norrath to you all, so you can better understand the world in which you&#8217;re character lives. I think everyone will be pleased with some of the new dynamic content coming out, and even more importantly nearly everyone will get a chance to participate. <br><br><br>Bill Coyle<br>Game Designer, EQLive</I></UL>Here's a follow-up:<UL>I think the biggest complaint I have seen about GM events is that single players, playing in a particular zone getting killed, then the high level players swarming the zone to kill the MOBs(GM controlled) and the high levels getting rezes and rewards and the bystanders that got killed get nothing."<br><br><b><i>This has been a longstanding problem in dynamic quests that we recently got the solution for. Now that level 50 players can no longer do hurt a level 30 npc in a dynamic quest designed for level 30's this shouldn't continue to be a problem. It should also be noted that with the exception of pure combat quests, the reward for the quest is not necessarily given to the people who kill the end monster, but rather the people who were involved in the quest the most. This kind of system should also solve the problem of people stepping in at the end of a quest and getting the reward.<br><br>PS: Thanks for the welcome :)</b></i></UL>Thanks Gordon!

More posts were made this evening by Gordon Wrinn of Verant Interactive:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010896.html"><b>Server Location</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why aren't there east coast/west coast servers?<br><br>I live on the west coast, and on almost every weeknight raids of thigns like the planes begin around 3 or 4 PST, when the east coasters can play and I'm at work.]</i></font> <br><br>Our servers are all in basically the same location geographically (which doesn't necessarily translate to the same location from an internet standpoint). I assume that you are asking that some be labeled as East Coast/West Coast/Overseas etc. While I definitely see your point, people playing at different times will probably always be an issue. Since the servers are in the same place, and there'd be no real advantage to choosing a server based upon the label, I imagine that people would whatever is the least-populated server regardless of location.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014375.html"><b>Kunarkrefund@verant.com Inactive?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Since I didn't get a reply to my emails directed to kunarkrefund@verant.com and accounts@station.sony.com : where should I direct my email if I still got an unresolved issue concerning a double billing for one copy of RoK?]</i></font> <br><br>If your issue is still active, I'd contact gscotto@station.sony.com directly. I sincerely apologize for the problems resolving your issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014395.html"><b>EQ Chat</b></a><br>It depends on what IRC Network you are on. The big international ones are probably listed in your IRC client (such as Efnet). Some of the EQ-related news sites also run their own IRC servers, but you'll have to go to those sites to get their address. <br><br>Also, EQ channels are not necessarily specifically labeled as such. I know of many guilds who operate their own channels who don't throw "EQ" into the description.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014398.html"><b>Warriors in Cloak</b></a><br>Well the issue right now is the number of meshes that we have available. Robes were only allocated to those races who could be casters to limit the number of different graphics that could be displayed at any one time in order to adhere to the system requirements. <br><br>We do have some new ideas going forward and you'll see a lot more interesting things on the characters. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014465.html"><b>Responsibility</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But sometimes they make mistakes. Sometimes thay make big ones. And when big mistakes are made, it is my firm belief that it is a customer's responsibility -- even duty -- to bring it to the attention of someone who may be able to rectify it.]</i></font> <br><br>I definitely agree with this statement. The players are the ones receiving the support, so should be involved in the process. <br><br>However, from your story, I really don't see anything being done wrong. These cases are often subjective and we have to trust the judgement of each GM involved. It sounds like the GMs bent over backwards to spend the hours you mention rectifying the situation. The actions and decision of the first GM were appropriate given the circumstances, and the second was most likely a lead who decided that it was taking too long to render good support in this case and stepped in. </UL>

Gordon asked an off-the wall question early this morning on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014341.html">the thread</a>:<UL><I>Hey there,<br><br>I'm up late tonight and was just thinking about the number of EQ families out there. I've gotten mail from quite a few people out there where the whole family plays EQ. I've even heard of several families, spread across the country or the world, who get together every night in EQ to have some fun. <br><br>So, just how many spousal/significant other/family teams are out there?<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Post #2:<UL>"Daddy, Billy trained me again!!"<br>"Did not! I told you to to use that rain spell!!"<br><br><b><i>Hehe, you have to watch those "little brothers", the things they do with people's accounts when the owner isn't looking is amazing :)<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
