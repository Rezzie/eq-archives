Brad "Aradune" McQuaid visited the Gameplay Board several times over the last few days.  Here's the complete scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069369.html"><b>Aradune Q&A Session, Pt. 2</b></a><br>RunDMZ: I'm still reading, but very busy, so I'm not sure when I'll have more time to respond to many of these. <br><br>Also, most of the posts are either agreeing, or disagreeing, with what's already been said. That, or an attempt to get across very specific class agendas (which really belong in other threads).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069619.html"><b>EQ Going The Way of the Dodo?</b></a><br>Actually, comparing EQ to other games, and going over the positives and negatives, and different approaches and philosophies is fine. <br><br>Please, though, I hope nobody viloates their NDAs that exist with some of these games in beta. <br><br>Anyway, the description you gave of AO is so general, as noted by Logan9, that it doesn't really separate itself from other games (or promises of other games) that are either out or coming out (I'm not saying the game's do or don't -- just the description you gave). <br><br>First, a skill based system (no classes). Actually, EQ is in the minority here -- most MMOGs use or intend to use skill based systems. This could be a thread unto itself, going over the advantages and disadvantages of class vs. skill systems. IMHO, they both have their plusses and minuses, and here at Verant/SOE, we're working on some games that are class based and others skill based. In a nutshell, classes are easier to balance and easier to create interdependece with. But they are also less flexible, and they can be more prone to 'class envy' issues after launch. Skill systems, on the other hand, are more flexible, but harder to balance, and can lead to 'tank mage syndromes' and serious lack of interdependence problems. Also, if complex enough, they can intimidate new users. (For the future, we've some ideas on several of our products, to address the deficiencies of both systems, as I'm sure our competitors do as well). <br><br>No camping and random spawns... well, again, this is pretty general. We've tried to do more randomization recently, and with decent success. The trick is, IMHO, to reduce camping but not have so much randomness that you lose context, storyline, and setting. And, again, this could be a huge thread too :)<br><br>Ah, the solo vs. group issue. I've really yet to see this one solved. It's pretty tough, because first you want to encourage grouping and interdependence because it forms bonds and community, which are vital in MMOGs. Second, if you create something challenging for one player, a group of players will demolish the encounter. The solution is probably to somehow make sure you've content for both, but of course the reward for the 'solo' encounter cannot be nearly as great as the reward for the 'group' encounter. This is another great topic for debate. <br><br>And no comment on customer service -- first, it's a beta and there aren't a lot of people involved, and second, people have all sorts of different ideas as to what customer service is, what to expect, etc.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069321.html"><b>The Aradune Q&A Chat</b></a><br>No, honestly, I was sober :)<br><br>I was just up that night, reading, and saw the initial post that started it all, asserting that the chat with me was sugar coated and that we're not blunt and up front and honest when we communicate... <br><br>And I guess I was just in one of those moods where somebody thinking something about me/us that just isn't true bothered me enough to stay up the next 6 or so hours and post like a madman :)<br><br>I think it's probably a character flaw, that I care so much when someone thinks something negative of me that isn't true... I mean, if someone's upset about something that is true, then it's ok -- sometimes people just need to agree to disagree. <br><br>But I know how much my teams care about this game, and how hard they work, and how much we listen to and care about our customer base and their happiness, and how difficult it can be to make some of the hard decisions we occasionally do to safeguard the long term health of the game... <br><br>And, so, sometime's a criticism/flame/troll whatever that implies something contrary to what we so deeply care about just sets me off... <br><br>In general, Absor and the other community relations people are instructed to not 'fan the flames', so to speak... and I typically try to do the same thing... but then every once in a while I guess I slip :)<br><br>The reactions have been on both extremes, and everywhere inbetween... many in support, thanking me for being up front, and then others who think I was 'disrespectful' to paying customers. <br><br>In any case, it's not the first time I've stayed up late on a weekend and communicated with as many people on the boards as I could and in a very upfront and honest manner -- if you dig around, you'll probably find other stuff from the past as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069084.html"><b>Another Developer's Response To Customer Suggestions</b></a><br>Nrodalog: Wow, thanks for posting this. Boy are the parallels uncanny, eh? :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069048.html"><b>Roleplaying Server</b></a><br>"1. Implement Trivial Combat code everywhere" <br><br>"What the heck does this have to do with Roleplay? Yes, if you re-configured the loot tables for the whole game it *might* work, but it has absolutely nothing to do with roleplaying. No role-playing game ever had the loot "disapear" if the person who killed it was too poweful." <br><br>See, people disagree on what RP is, and isn't. <br><br>In any case, I'll explain why I think removing bottom feeding has a LOT to do with RP. When I'm in a dungeon adventuring and I encounter farmers and other characters too high level, it abruptly and forcefully removes me from suspension of disbelief -- it severely damagers the immersiveness of the game. And I think that's directly tied to RP, just as some guy using d00d speak hurts an RP environment, or seeing a Troll ally with a Paladin. <br><br>In D&D, it just wouldn't be allowed. No DM worth his salt would allow a group of level 8 players to slaughter through a level 2 module... and even worse, to allow another low level group in the module simultaneously. <br><br>Or how about from fantasy literature... how 'RP' would it have been if, as the hobbits were fighting against goblins and wolves, they rounded a bend in the forest to find a group of Valar slaugtering the evil denziens with blinks of their eyes? <br><br>"4. Disallow Paladins grouping with Shadow Knights, etc." <br><br>"Well there are some RP +S and -s to this. For one thing, clerics are both good and evil, why not paladins? The 'sks are anti-paladins' are ok I guess, but the point is, if the god allows clerics to heal - why wouldn't he have his own "paladin-type" of healing warriors? Also, some gods seem to be neutral (they have both good and evil followers), I'm not sure its paladins wouldn't be "ok" with grouping with SKs. Overall its an ok idea though." <br><br>The paladin/sk bit was just an example... I'd also apply it to clerics who follow opposing gods, etc. <br><br><br>"Your opinion Mr.Programer is yours, no doubt about it. If they are/were well thought out and prepared for I would like those changes, but several of them have nothing to do with "role-playing". Don't kid yourself." <br><br>I disagree, and I think that even though we disagree, both of our opinions are valid, and neither of us are 'kidding' ourselves. <br><br>By the way, I'll hereby slightly adjust our opinion as it relates to an RP server... <br><br>Now that we have so many servers, perhaps it wouldn't be so dangerous to set up a server with a slightly different ruleset and call it an RP server... even though many, many would disagree with the ruleset (whether it was fair, or truly RP, or whatever), there are perhaps enough people now who play this game that we could fill the server... <br><br>Anyway, just some thoughts... We'll think on it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069003.html"><b>The Warrens</b></a><br>One of the core ideas behind the trivial combat code is to enable us to entice low and mid level players into low and mid level dungeons without fear of bottomfeeding.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069024.html"><b>Five Important Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. How's life? <br>2. If it's so good why are you sitting at home responding to flames? :)<br>3. When's EQ7 coming out? <br>4. Did you think this post was a bigger waste of time then if I'd asked a 'serious' (ha) question? <br>5. How many people do you think will tell my to shut up in this thread? I say 7.]</i></font><br><br>Heh. <br><br>1. Overall, very good :)  Things are going very well for Verant/SOE, our games are coming a long great, and we're in a position to really lead this emerging genre (MMOGs) for quite some time, which is exactly what I personally want to be involved in. <br><br>2. That's a really good question. I guess it's because some idealistic and perhaps naive part of me truly wants to believe these boards could be made better. That, and because I've a character flaw such that when someone thinks something bad about me, my teams, my company, etc. that isn't accurate, it BUGS THE HECK OUT OF ME. In other words, if someone doesn't like something we do that we believe is the right thing to do, then that's fine... we listen, and sometime's have to agree to disagree. But when some people assert that we don't care, or are dishonest, or are just out to make a buck, or that we don't listen, or that we don't want to make a great game that appeals to all sorts of people (all of which are patently false)... well, it gets under my skin. Which is why, honestly, I don't post much. And it's also probably what made Abashi get more and more upset over time. And it's probably what's making even Absor, one of the most mellow, even tempered, and polite people I know get a bit edgy in some posts as of late. And which is why we are seriously debating shutting these boards down. <br><br>3. Well, assuming it takes approximatley 3 years to make an MMORPG, and assuming a good one can entertain people for more than 3 years (take a look at UO -- fantastic game, and still going strong)... how about the year 2037? :)<br><br>4. Nah :)<br><br>5. Oh, I think 7 is a far too conservative guess :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069002.html"><b>Gameplay Board To Shut Down?</b></a><br>I do want to stress, again, that if we do shut down the boards, that we will make sure there is still a very real and hopefully even more useful 2 way path of communication between us and the playerbase. <br><br>We've no intention of losing the great feedback and ideas we've received thus far from our playerbase, nor the information we provide to our playerbase.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068929.html"><b>Zone to Stoneburnt Mountains Found</b></a><br>This may indeed be the future tunnel that will lead to Stonebrunt -- if people are getting stuck there, we'll look into it and address it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068965.html"><b>Server Side Filters</b></a><br>As a matter of fact, we're working on implementing server-side filtering. <br><br>Let's cross our fingers and hope this helps with large raids and such.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068974.html"><b>Review Of The Warrens</b></a><br>thanks for the comments -- they've been passed on to the Live team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068883.html"><b>Neat Anniversary Stuff</b></a><br>Many of you have already probably noticed this, but for those of you who haven't, there's all sorts of neat EQ 2nd anniversary stuff at<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com:80/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com:80/2ndanniversary/index.jsp</a> <br><br>There's some cool concept art, an EQ .avi movie, some Parkinson sketches, chat transcripts, and even a very early build of EverQuest when it was only 5 months old (from August, 1996 when I was still a programmer on the project, and there were only 3 or 4 of us on the whole team)! <br><br>Anyways, check it out :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068889.html"><b>On Tech Questions</b></a><br>We've gone through several times and looked at the max_clip value for each zone, and set that value to the maximum the zone was exported to. <br><br>When the zone was exported from the tool that was used to create the zone, a maximum visibility value was used by the zone creator. Setting the max_clip to beyond that will create all sorts of strange visual artifacts. <br><br>The newer the zone, the farther we typically export the zone's clip at. <br><br>The exception, of course, are zones meant to have limited clipping planes for effect (fog enshrouded forests, under water, etc.). <br><br>I'm sure there may be some zones still out there that could have their max_clip extended even further, meaning we missed them when we went through them all last time. <br><br>There may also be an obscure bug that doesn't always set the client to max_clip even when the slider is set all the way (Darkmatter will attest to this until the end of time :) It may also be possible that when the rain stops, the clip plane moves beyond the max_clip set for that zone, revealing visual artifacts, albeit temporarily. <br><br>Since this comes up occasionally, I'll bring it up again on Monday and have a game designer play with turning rain on and off in the Karanas and/or Qeynos hills, to see if he can get the clip to go beyond what the value is set at in the zone. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068804.html"><b>Trival Combat On All New Servers</b></a><br>This is something we might consider (having the next new non-split server launch with this new ruleset applicable to all zones).</UL>

Assuming it's really as easy as you suggest it is to fix&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: For the person that thinks a 2 hour day is a long day of EQ (the way I was for the first 6-8 months I played), that's crippling.]</i></font> <br><br>This is something that I just don't understand. I play casually. If it takes two hours to do something for the player with a lot of time, it still takes two hours for the casual player to do. The only difference there is that the casual player (or whatever you want to call a player without a lot of time to play each week) needs more real-life hours to pass before he or she gets the same task done as others that play more. Honestly, a casual player should know that this is pretty much normal. Heck, I've got a really cool model sitting on a bookcase in my bedroom that only needs a few more hours work to finish. But it's going to take me months to get it done. That's ok with me, because I know that I have little time to dedicate to it. The fact that someone else might have completed it over a weekend has no bearing on it. <br><br>Yes, there are some times when the time lost because of short game sessions (like looking for groups) is really lost time. But travel time isn't one of those times. It's time you need to spend regardless of how many sessions it takes you to get it done. I guess that's part of the reason why I think of it as a convenience than a need. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is that clearer?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes it is. Do I agree that this is a good idea? I don't know. I'll think on it some more. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alan, if the only good thing to come from this conversation is that this idea is given serious consideration, then the post was worth the effort.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, you've certainly gotten me to think about it. I've also passed a link to this thread to the Live Team&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, can you check into the Onyx Encrusted Urn thing? I'd *love* to burn the 100 plat I earned last night experimenting further.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry. It's been such a long time since I responded to this thread, I have no idea what that was all about&#8230; <br><br>Howsabout this. I imagine you have a list of stuff that you want fixed for trade skills. Send them to me and I'll pass them on. Underline the Urn. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The point I was trying to make was this: one of the reasons you have such an outcry over nerfs -- even one as justified as this -- is that VERANT created an environment in which the PLAYERS developed an us-versus-them mentality.]</i></font> <br><br>And, well, I'm not sure how that happened or how that could have been prevented. <br><br>Obviously one of the goals of a game like this is to get people involved and attached. We want enthusiasm from players and developers alike. Unfortunately a side affect of making a good game is that you have to keep it good. Being willing to make changes is important. And when those changes affect something personal, something that the player is enthusiastic about, like his character, the players react. That's a good thing, really. Without it, the game isn't compelling and nobody is here talking about it. <br><br>Obviously we don't want to develop any sort of us-versus-them mentality. It makes things muddy. It is very hard to get points across to people that feel that we are out to get them. And, by the same token, it's hard to understand the points that people are trying to make amidst finger pointing and anger. <br><br>So, sure, maybe it is our fault that people feel so strongly about the game and their characters, we want that. And, yes, we feel strongly about the game itself (if only you could hear a hotly-debated tuning meeting&#8230;). But there is no need for any adversarial relationship between players and developers. At times, though, we are going to make changes that will upset people. And people will say things that upset us (or me, I can't really talk for the whole company on that point). The real trick is to understand that we are all passionate about how this turns out. <br><br>Heh, lots of words but no resolution&#8230; I don't have one. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: That is, it is my opinion that the fact your clients have been treated as victims in the game contributed to the way those same clients react to "metagame" changes.]</i></font> <br><br>That might be true, I don't know. I've never been a part of a GM quest myself. But, well, those sorts of quests are long in the past now. I would hope that changing for the better would count for something. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does that sound better?]</i></font> <br><br>I understand what you are saying. I've done exactly that, but in reverse. Went to a game at a friends house (a long story, but we play with them semi-annually instead of going to conventions &#8211; when we went to conventions we pretty much only played with these folks anyhow&#8230;) and when it was over I just erased items that I had gained off of my character sheet (I kept one). Their world was too rich in items compared to ours. <br><br>I guess the point here is that, and I think you hit on this, the 'loss' in the 'victim' scenario EverQuest is at most going to be some experience points and some time. If I play the victim in my regular campaign, I'm going to genuinely lose. For example, we once had to 'bribe' our way out of Baba Yaga's hut. That was a mess. I was playing my greediest character, therefore he had the most stuff to offer. He was practically itemless when it was over. And this was a 'victim' situation, the Witch would have destroyed us. That was a far greater loss for that character (and, therefore, for me) than a level in EverQuest would be. <br><br>And yet, that was a very fun game for all of us. Five years later my character still complains about it, and he still hasn't recovered much of his stuff. <br><br>But, yes, I agree that to expect a random EverQuest player to play like I do is probably not reasonable. And I still want to stress that this sort of thing just doesn't happen anymore. <br><br>Alpheus-SoL wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fighting Strahd Von Zarovich, Alan? ]</i></font> <br><br>Him too&#8230; <br><br>But the instance I was thinking of was a trap. Crying child turns out to be a vampire child. Once close enough, charm and that's it. It nailed me and turned my character into a vampire. I had no chance, really. Then, though, the fun began. As the 'victim' in this case, I got to hunt down and kill the rest of the party because I knew that they would tell people that I had become a vampire and I'd have to run from them the rest of my life. <br><br>I'm not sure if I was the victim or if the party was. Be we all lost that day. <br><br>Grimstaff wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Alpheus, nobody likes being the victim. Volunteering to be a victim in a game or play is one thing, but being one because you zoned in and A_GM_God_Creature01 butchers you is not fun.]</i></font> <br><br>But that's really my point. By signing on to play in a roleplaying game you need to accept that the world goes on around you, and getting caught in the wrong place at the wrong time can happen. In a way, that's part of what makes the setting real.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/069356.html"><b>PvP Talk</b></a><br>Hi all. <br><br>As with the class talk threads, I'll be certain to get you any information as soon as we've made some decisions.

From Mennix:<BLOCKQUOTE>As I'm sure most of you already know, EverQuest celebrated its two year<br>anniversary on March 16. To mark this occasion, various teams associated<br>with EverQuest dug deep into their archives and came up with a few things to<br>share with the EverQuest community. What did they find? Well first, they<br>came up with some alpha screenshots. Ever see a Dark Elf with a Mohawk? If<br>not, then you must check out the screenshots. We were also able to obtain a<br>very early EverQuest client from Brad McQuaid himself. This is a must-see<br>along with a pre-alpha movie.<br><br>The SOE Art Department did their share also. We recently got the appropriate<br>equipment to create our own movies and the art department has been giggling<br>like school girls ever since. Their first creation was a EQ 2nd Anniversary<br>movie that is now available for download at the EverQuest site. And now<br>completely mad with power and overflowing with ego, the art department has<br>also created the first EverQuest screensaver which will be available for<br>download soon.<br><br>Yet, that is not it. EverQuest concept art is also available along with 12<br>scans of early Keith Parkinson sketches. <br><br>Check out the EverQuest 2nd Anniversary site and help us celebrate a<br>remarkable two years of gaming.<br><br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">EQ 2n Anniversary</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Mennix!

From Ubergamer:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings All,<br> <br>    Just wanted to say I've added a whole new service at Ubergamer's EverQuest Art Site -- I'm now also doing Character Paintings in addition to my Hand-Drawn Portraits.

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068770.html">Move Log reminder</a> was written and posted to the Gameplay Board by Alan today:<UL><i>Folks, please wait until the move log has been opened before trying to use the command. If you use the command before it is opened, your request will not be captured by the log. So if you have already executed the move log, you will need to do it again during the proper window. Here is a copy of my recent post about this:<br><br>We will be opening a new server and moving characters from the E'ci and The Rather severs to this new server upon the request of the customer. If you choose to move your characters to the new server, please be aware that all of your characters on the old server will be moved to the new server.<br><br>To request to have your characters moved to the new server, all you need to do is type "/movelog yes" into the chat window while playing a character on that server during the time that the move log is open.<br><br>We will be opening the move log for these two servers on Friday, March 16th, 2001 at 6:00 pm. PST (which is Saturday morning at 2:00 am GMT). We will be closing the move log on Sunday, March 18th, 2001 at 11:59 pm PST (7:59 am on Monday the 19th GMT). The new, yet unnamed, server should be opened some time during the week of March 19th. We'll announce the exact date as soon as we can.<br><br>There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing to move your characters to the new server. The most important thing to keep in mind is that character corpses will not be moved with the characters. So it is important to make certain that you have looted all of the corpses that you want to loot before the characters are moved.<br><br>Also, characters names are unique on the new server. Because characters will be moving from two separate servers onto the new one, there may be cases where two characters with the same name are created on the new server. Because character names must be unique, one of the two characters will be chosen at random and have an 'x' added to the end of their name. If you find that one of your characters has had an 'x' tacked onto their name after the move and you would rather have a new name, please contact your GM by using the /petition function. The GM will help you to change the name of your character.<br><br>Guild structures do not follow the characters to the new server. We will be unable to reestablish guilds until at least a week has passed after the split. On any day after the new server has been up for eight days, the guild leader can /petition for a GM to help them reestablish the guild. Please do not petition for this before seven days have passed, we will not be able to set up your guild before then.<br><br>We will not be moving characters back to the old server, so make certain that you want to move your characters before you type "/movelog yes". And we will not be moving characters for those that fail to execute the movelog command during the stated window of opportunity. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

The only problem is, while almost every other class has a reasonable easy time getting their epics, Verant has made it very, very difficult for paladins. Problem being, since you implimented the level limit on Vox/Nagafen, you have hence punished us paladins who have lvled up. So, basically, if we can manage to get the levels together to kill Gorenaire, etc, then MAYBE we might be lucky to get a book drop. This is ridiculous.]</i></font><br><br>One of the designers pulled me to the side and explained something to me about this whole situation. <br><br>Let's look at the whole picture here. <br><br>Most people seem to agree that the way it was before the caps on Naggy and Vox was just fine. The quests were hard, but not too hard. Drops were not too infrequent. <br><br>For characters of the right level, that challenge hasn't changed, so that should still be fine. <br><br>Now, consider that it takes about the same number of people to kill the tougher dragons as it does to kill the old ones (35 or so at the low-end and as few as 18 at the high end). Also realize that the books drop at about the same rate off the old dragons as they do off the new ones. <br><br>So, basically, Paladins have twice as many opportunities to get these book as they did in the past. I would like to know how this is grossly more difficult than any other epic quest?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068726-3.html"><b>Multi-Questing Ruined on Test?</b></a><br>We have not put any new code on Test that has anything to do with multi-questing.

Alan only made a few posts to the Gameplay Board today.  Here's what he's said so far today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066153-2.html"><b>Bashing Guilds On Official Boards</b></a><br>If the link you posted was offensive to you, then you most certainly should not have posted it here (I'll remove it). And, well, regardless of my personal feelings on the matter, this is not the place to attack people or guilds. So I'm going to close this thread.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068186.html"><b>Temple of Veeshan Changes</b></a><br>Actually, the changes you are talking about were rather minor, and only took place near the entrance.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/068394-2.html"><b>Publicly Attacking Guilds, Again</b></a><br>Again, this is not the place for anyone to be attacking any guild, regardless of my personal feelings about such a guild. <br><br>And we will not be discussing and action, or lack thereof, taken about something like this in any public forum.</UL>
