<span class=dateline>February  21, 2000</span> - &#8220;Why here&#8230;why now?&#8221; mumbled Bosk, starring grimly out of the tunnel into the lands of Clan Crushbone.  The sky was bleak, covered with the same thick clouding that covered the Faydark forests and the air held a tension to them, like something would happen soon.  The normal patrols were not around, in fact the only guards that any of them had seen was the original band of Orcs at the entrance.
	&#8220;Should we go in?&#8221; asked Toldan as he walked up to Bosk&#8217;s side.
	He grumbled to himself.  &#8220;I should&#8217;ve paid more attention, watched out for her.&#8221;
	&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; exclaimed Cailet, already by his side.  &#8220;You did what you could.  There was no way to watch out for everyone.&#8221;
	&#8220;She&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Oscruncher.  &#8220;We all focused on the danger in front of us like we normally would instead of thinking about the little girl.&#8221;
	Bosk clenched his fist.  &#8220;If I find one mark on her&#8230;&#8221;
	Alfadar put a hand on Bosk&#8217;s shoulder and said, &#8220;Calm down.  We will find Geraine before the Orcs get to her.  We just need to move now.&#8221;
	Bosk nodded.  &#8220;Alright, best to split up into two groups.  Toldan, Oscruncher, and Cailet stay here in case she wanders back.  The rest of us will go inside and look.&#8221;
	&#8220;What about Andriana?&#8221; asked Revea.
	&#8220;If we run into Andriana and Saldyar then we will keep them with us.  If they come back here then keep them here.  We don&#8217;t need to give the Orcs any more of an advantage than they already have here.&#8221;
	&#8220;Bosk,&#8221; said Cailet.
	He turned to look her in the eyes.  &#8220;We will be back.  Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;
	She nodded and said, &#8220;Be careful&#8230;&#8221;
	He smiled slightly and started off, followed by Revea, Elventear, and Alfadar.  They stayed close together, keeping an eye out for any sign of danger.  The area seemed deserted with no guards, patrols, or even raids.  Normally one could find a band of adventurers trying to weaken the Orcs in some capacity, but today it was all deserted.
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this,&#8221; said Alfadar.
	&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; responded Elventear, holding his hammer tightly and his shield close to his body.  &#8220;This is not like the Orcs to just leave their domain open like this.&#8221;
	They reached a small hut deep inside the Orc&#8217;s territory that was rumored to be inhabited by a couple of Dwarven smiths and an Elven Priest.  Normally this area would be full of centurions and slavers, with the occasional legionnaire, but today there was nothing around.
	&#8220;Should we check the slave cave?&#8221; asked Revea.
	&#8220;That would be a good idea,&#8221; said Alfadar.  &#8220;Geraine may have gone to look for her parents.&#8221;
	Bosk nodded and led the way.  As they got to the entrance to the cave they heard a commotion inside and stopped immediately.
	&#8220;ARGH!&#8221; shouted a male Dwarven slave as a slaver landed a solid hit with his fist on the Dwarf&#8217;s shoulder.  The crack echoed against the rocky terrain for a few moments before dying away.
	The slaver chuckled to himself as he walked on, leaving the Dwarf in agonizing pain, but was stopped by the Taskmaster, whose face was over come with a fear-driven anger.  &#8220;Why did you do that?!&#8221; he voice boomed and echoed through the cave.
	The slaver was shocked for a moment.  &#8220;I&#8230;I wanted to&#8230;&#8221;
	The Taskmaster stared into the slaver&#8217;s eyes coldly and snarled, &#8220;You wanted to get me killed, is that it?&#8221;
	Scared for his own life now, the slaver tried to defend his actions.  &#8220;I wanted to drive fear into the slaves as always.  We can fix it again if we get an oracle and&#8230;&#8221;
	&#8220;MORON!  Don&#8217;t you remember the inspections today?!&#8221;
	The slaver&#8217;s eyes grew wide and his blue skin lost a great deal of its color.  &#8220;I&#8230;I&#8230;&#8221;
	&#8220;Get that Dwarf out of here before I summon an oracle.&#8221;  The Taskmaster grabbed the slaver and pulled their faces close to each other, then said in a low growl, &#8220;And it will not be to heal&#8230;&#8221;
	The slaver gulped and ran to the Dwarf; quickly carrying him away while another slaver covered the Dwarf&#8217;s position with a female Wood Elf.  The Dwarf was carried away in the direction of the Elves, which caused them to panic some.  As the slaver exited the cave and passed by them, the fire elementaling charged out to meet him.  The Elves&#8217; eyes grew wide and they saw the elementaling approach the slaver, then punch him in the back with fiery fists.
	The slaver growled and turned to see the fire elementaling and the Elves then shouted, &#8220;You dare come here into our lands?!&#8221;  He threw the Dwarf aside and began to attack the fire elementaling.  The Elves knew that they were in a fight now and charged to help the elementaling, quickly dispatching the slaver.
	&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; shouted an Orc from the cave.  The Elves turned around and their hearts sank, seeing a several slavers, centurions, and a few legionaries.
	&#8220;This does not look good,&#8221; said Elventear.
	Bosk smirked.  &#8220;If that isn&#8217;t an understatement then I don&#8217;t know what is.&#8221;
	As the Orcs began to approach them, Revea shouted to her elementaling, &#8220;Jartix!  Attack!&#8221;
	The fire elementaling surrounded itself with a fiery aura and few into the center of the group of Orcs.  The Elves began to run as fast as they could when they heard Jartix, the elementaling, shouting as it died.  The Orcs then turned to the Elves.
	Bosk had an idea and halted to a stop.  &#8220;Keep running!&#8221; he shouted as he turned to the Orcs.  The others turned to get him but he turned back and began to hum awful notes that rang with horrid dissonance, slipping words into the piercing notes.  &#8220;Go now so we can all live.&#8221;  They turned to run while Bosk pulled his hand drum out.  Grinning from ear to ear he thought, &#8220;Hope you guys are in good shape,&#8221; as he began to play the beginning rhythm to Selo&#8217;s Accelerando.
	The sound of the rhythm created an aura of sound around his body that penetrated to his leg muscles.  Digging his feet into the dirt, Bosk jumped forward into an instant dash, moving faster than the Orcs could hit, and shot past the crowd of Orcs before they realized he was off.  To keep their attention, Bosk belted out a few dissonant notes to aggravate the Orcs a little more, then resumed the Accelerando to stay well ahead of them.  He was happy to see most of them following mindlessly like the last two times he used this trick to save his friends and keep ahead of his opponents.  He just hoped that everyone else was safe.
	Saldyar kicked a stewpot over as he reached the top of what was called Taskmaster Hill, a place where the Taskmaster has vigilance over the slavers and the slaves, his anger still all to fresh in his head.  He looked at the three centurions he had already slain and spat.  &#8220;Too easy.&#8221;
	&#8220;Really?&#8221; asked a harsh voice to his side.  Saldyar was spun to his right in a defensive posture to meet face to face with the Taskmaster.  He came from the slave caves as the other Orcs left to fight the Elves.  There were a couple of slavers left to enforce the strict mining rules so the Taskmaster felt he should over see the other sites before it was time.  He snarled and said, &#8220;How about me then?&#8221;
	Saldyar clutched his sword tightly with a grim, determined look on his face.  Shrugging, he replied, &#8220;Why not&#8230;I need to relieve some anger.&#8221;
	The Taskmaster nodded and they came together, both dealing and receiving wounds.  The last time Saldyar used his last lay hands skill was only a few moments ago with the centurions.  He was still injured from the battle in the tunnel when he met the three centurions and now he was without it for a whole day.  Both warriors were good, but the Taskmaster was just that because he was one of the strongest and fiercest there were in the Orcish society, and Saldyar was already tired from the two previous battles.  This battle was taking its toll on Saldyar and both of them knew it.
	&#8220;If you are done playing, boys, would either of you mind if I join?&#8221; asked Andriana a few yards away.
	Saldyar turned for a moment to see her and gave a sigh of relief, then made sure she did not see it.  The Taskmaster laughed haughtily and Andriana joined the fray, first laying her hands on Saldyar to heal the majority of his wounds and then beginning to hack and slash with her long two handed sword.  The Taskmaster made easy adjustments to his strategy and soon he was holding his own and neither side was gaining an advantage.
	&#8220;Give up, Elves!  Clan Crushbone will destroy your weak Race!&#8221;
	Andriana grinned and taunted the Taskmaster, &#8220;Then why are we always the ones to invade your puny realm?&#8221;
	The Taskmaster did not like this and began to focus on Andriana.  She was holding him back, but just barely.  Her own health was declining while the Taskmaster was seemingly staying in relative health.  Both Elves backed up for a brief moment as the Taskmaster grinned at them as if toying around.
	Saldyar turned to Andriana and asked, &#8220;Why did you lay your hands on me?&#8221;
	Andriana replied, &#8220;Because you were injured badly and needed it.&#8221;
	&#8220;But you could still be fighting if you laid your hands on yourself.&#8221;
	Andriana gave him a deep look.  &#8220;Then you would be dead,&#8221;
	Saldyar began to argue this point but the Taskmaster interrupted.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s end this now,&#8221; he said and charged the two tired Elves.  They braced themselves and awaited an attack that never came.  Behind the Taskmaster jumped a Wood Elf with two long rapiers, shimmering with an aura that was just beyond the sight of the High Elves.  The Wood Elf jabbed his rapiers into the Taskmaster&#8217;s back and looked to the two High Elves to help finish the job.  Both Andriana and Saldyar looked to each other for a brief moment and then charged the Taskmaster, landing their killing blows.  The Taskmaster fell to the ground with a final breath and the three Elves stood there for a moment in awkward silence.
	&#8220;Are we almost there?&#8221;  Lyrial asked Arihel quietly.
	She sighed and responded, &#8220;Not yet, but almost.&#8221;
	&#8220;What are ye whispering about back there?&#8221; asked Rooks.
	&#8220;Nothing, my Dwarven friend.  Just talking,&#8221; replied Arihel.
	Rosa looked back to them and said, &#8220;You know we never learned your friend&#8217;s name.&#8221;
	&#8220;She is shy,&#8221; Arihel blurted out before Lyrial could make a comment.
	Rosa thought a moment about that answer and shrugged to herself, looking forward again.  Soon the foursome reached the entrance to Clan Crushbone.  At Arihel&#8217;s request they took a less traveled route, staying near the ridge that separated the Butcher Block region from Greater Faydark.  The area was relatively clear except for a few adventurers trying to keep the Orcish forces from regrouping.
	Rosa knelt down and examined the ground.  &#8220;There was a battle here.  The ground is scorched here, here, and&#8230;here.  The bodies are gone but it was recent.&#8221;
	Lyrial furrowed her brow under the hood she wore and asked under her breath, &#8220;How&#8230;&#8221;
	Rosa turned to smile at Lyrial and answer her question.  &#8220;I am a druid, I know the land I walk on even if it is foreign.  I am at one with it and it with me.&#8221;
	Lyrial was taken back a moment, thinking she was not heard, but nodded underneath the robe and looked to the entrance tunnel.  &#8220;So this is the entrance to Clan Crushbone.&#8221;
	&#8220;Aye, a very dangerous place for those who are not careful,&#8221; replied Rooks.
	&#8220;Shall we?&#8221; asked Rosa.
	&#8220;Aye.&#8221;
	&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Arihel.
	&#8220;Yes,&#8221; muttered Lyrial as she thought, &#8220;Ready to meet the great D&#8217;Vinn.&#8221; 
	Geraine peeked out of her little hiding place.  When the fighting started she became very scared and ran without thinking, only to see a small patrol of Orcs coming out of the slave caves.  Fear surged through her veins and she jumped behind some rocks, quivering in silence.  Soon she heard the shouts of her Elven protectors and the familiar sounds of Bosk&#8217;s drums, but even then she was too scared to move.  After things calmed down and the silence returned, Geraine heard the sounds of suffering coming from around the area where the Elves shouting earlier.
	The Dwarf tried to stand up but the pain shot through his arm and shoulder.  With a wince he just lay there and awaited the Orcs&#8217; return to finish him off.  &#8220;Blasted Orcs,&#8221; he mumbled.  &#8220;A curse to the underground.  Egh&#8230;Brell, hear my call&#8230;if you send help to me I will vow to rid the underground, the aboveground, any ground you wish of those&#8230;argh&#8230;&#8221;
	Geraine carefully walked over to the Dwarf with a look of terror in her eyes.  &#8220;Are&#8230;are you ok?&#8221;
	The Dwarf jumped as she spoke, aggravating the damaged shoulder even more.  &#8220;Argh&#8230;what are you doing here?  You are&#8230;to young to be here.&#8221;
	&#8220;I&#8230;I am&#8230;I,&#8221; was all she could mutter out.  She was scared and out of place here.
	The Dwarf sighed.  &#8220;Well if you are not going to talk then can you find some help for me?&#8221;
	Geraine could not respond.  She looked over him and saw various places where his clothes were torn and wounds inflicted.  Her face became pale.
	&#8220;It is time!&#8221; shouted an Orc in the cave.  A few seconds later two rows of Orc centurions lined up at the entrance to the slave caves, creating a protective path to walk through.  Then from around the bend came one of the most frightening sights Geraine had ever seen.  Two large and powerful looking legionaries proceeded two of the royal guard.  Following the guard was the Prophet, the most powerful magic user in the Orcish realm, with Lord Darish close behind.  Darish had a reputation of being the second most skilled Orcish warrior in Crushbone, second only to Emperor Crush himself, who turned the bend himself with Ambassador D&#8217;Vinn, the Dark Elf and the most threatening person in Crushbone.
	The procession proceeded past the Dwarf and Geraine until the Prophet came to them.  He stopped suddenly and turned to look at Geraine with awful red eyes and growled.  &#8220;What is a Gnome child doing here?&#8221; he asked.
	The lead slaver ran to him and looked to the Dwarf and Gnome and, with obvious fear in his voice, replied, &#8220;The Dwarf became lame and the Gnome&#8230;I&#8230;don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8221;
	Darish approached Geraine and knelt down, smiling coldly.  &#8220;Perhaps we will have roasted Gnome this eve.&#8221;  He chuckled evilly as he reached out to touch Geraine, testing the toughness of her flesh.
	&#8220;Touch her and die,&#8221; said D&#8217;Vinn dryly.  Darish looked back, offended, and was about to protest when he saw the determination in D&#8217;Vinn&#8217;s eyes and knew to back down.  D&#8217;Vinn looked to Crush and asked, &#8220;How did a little Gnomish girl get here from Steamfont?  Is your defense that weak or incompetent?  Maybe it is both.&#8221;
	Crush replied, &#8220;I assure you I will look into this.  Darish, kill the girl now!&#8221;
	&#8220;No,&#8221; replied D&#8217;Vinn.  &#8220;She may be useful to us.&#8221;
	Crush stared at D&#8217;Vinn, trying to understand what he meant.  &#8220;What?  How do you mean?&#8221;
	&#8220;Look at her you fool.  She is much too scared to even be here, much less approach this place.  The color is gone from her cheeks, what little was ever there.&#8221;  D&#8217;Vinn studied Geraine a moment more before continuing.  &#8220;She was obviously brought here by someone else.  I want you to run a check on all the patrols.  Now.&#8221;
	Crush looked to Darish and nodded, then Darish ran with the royal guard to the various checkpoints.  &#8220;They should return momentarily,&#8221; replied Crush.
	D&#8217;Vinn walked to Geraine and knelt down to her.  &#8220;Tell me, why were you brought you here?&#8221;
	Geraine, on the verge of crying, muttered, &#8220;To&#8230;to find&#8230;my parents&#8230;&#8221;
	D&#8217;Vinn&#8217;s eyes narrowed and turned to Crush again.  &#8220;Did you take any Gnomes hostage?&#8221;
	&#8220;There is only that magician,&#8221; replied Crush, &#8220;but he has been here for much longer than she has been alive.&#8221;
	&#8220;Then there are no other Gnomish slaves, correct?&#8221;
	&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Crush.  &#8220;They are not good workers.&#8221;
	D&#8217;Vinn turned back to Geraine and asked, &#8220;Who brought you here?&#8221;
	Geraine began to cry now and mumbled, &#8220;I&#8230;I&#8230;want Bosk.&#8221;
	&#8220;Ah,&#8221; let out D&#8217;Vinn.  &#8220;Bosk is it?  Come with me.&#8221;  He grabbed Geraine forcefully and picked her up, carrying her away.  &#8220;The inspection is postponed.  I want to meet this Bosk, NOW!&#8221;
	Crush turned to the centurions and yelled, &#8220;FIND HIM!&#8221;
	One of the legionnaires looked at the Dwarf and asked, &#8220;What about that Dwarf?&#8221;
	D&#8217;Vinn sharply turned to look at him and said, &#8220;Kill him.  He is of no use without that arm.&#8221;
	The legionnaire grabbed the Dwarf roughly, causing a surge of pain to flow through him and twisted his neck, snapping it in two, then dropped the corpse to the ground.
	D&#8217;Vinn took his small detachment of legionaries and royal guard to find his prey.
	Bosk was now way in front of the pack of Orcs, but he did not want to take any chances.  He was behind Crush&#8217;s Castle, running next to the moat that surrounds it.  As he rounded the bend, Bosk saw someone fighting a legionnaire and a centurion.  Looking behind him he knew that it would be very bad for this person if he brought a horde of Orcs down on him, so Bosk aimed for the legionnaire and ran as fast as he could.  The three figures were next to a bridge so if he timed it right, Bosk could knock the legionnaire into the moat.
	&#8220;RUN!&#8221; he shouted as he jumped and threw his whole body into the legionnaire.  Luckily the legionnaire was just a little too heavy so Bosk stopped immediately while the legionnaire lost just enough of his balance to fall into the moat.  Bosk turned to the other two to see the centurion fleeing and a Human laughing at him, a scantily clad Human.  Panting, Bosk asked, &#8220;What in the name of Tunare are you doing here alone Human?&#8221;
	&#8220;Heya!  Thanks for the help, but I didn&#8217;t need it.&#8221;
	Bosk turned to see the Orcish horde almost to them then he grabbed Malin&#8217;s wrist and said, &#8220;Shut up and keep up.&#8221;  Bosk began to run, still feeling the energy in his legs and feet, and began to sing the Accelerando again to give it to Malin, then he began to play his drum.  Malin was confused but Bosk did not have time to even worry about that, all he knew what that he had to get this Human away from the crowd of Orcs charging behind them.  Another turn and the exit should be near.  &#8220;I hope everyone else is ok&#8230;&#8221;
	Malin turned to ask, &#8220;What is going on here?  Why are we running?&#8221;
	&#8220;Look behind us,&#8221; panted Bosk.
	Malin did so and saw the horde of Orcs and said, &#8220;Oh&#8230;that&#8217;s why.&#8221;
	&#8220;You sound disappointed,&#8221; said Bosk.
	&#8220;Actually impressed that for one the Orcs want you that much which means you&#8217;ve been bad to them and two you have avoided that many of them,&#8221; he replied.
	Bosk chuckled.  &#8220;Just try to keep up and we should be fine.  I have friends waiting at the entrance for me.&#8221;
	&#8220;Hey, never caught your name.&#8221;
	&#8220;Bosk, one of the Song Weavers of Faydark.  You?&#8221;
	&#8220;Name&#8217;s Malin of the Ashen Order in Freeport.&#8221;
	Bosk looked to Malin for a moment.  &#8220;A monk?&#8221; he asked.  Malin nodded.  &#8220;Great&#8230;not only is he a Human but he doesn&#8217;t even dress himself due to principle.&#8221;
	&#8220;Hey, I feel more free then I do in binding armor,&#8221; replied Malin.
	Bosk chuckled again.  &#8220;Just hope we survive to be free from this place.&#8221;
	&#8220;We will.  You have me on your side.&#8221;
	Bosk grinned and increased the tempo of the Accelerando, giving them a little added boost in speed.
	&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked Andriana, starring at the Wood Elf.
	The Wood Elf&#8217;s lips curled into a grin and he bowed, saying, &#8220;I am Quintar, Scout of Tunare.&#8221;
	Andriana leaned slightly to Saldyar and whispered, &#8220;A real gentleman&#8230;you could learn from him.&#8221;
	Saldyar sniffed and asked, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;
	Quintar replied, &#8220;What else would a Scout of Tunare do, scouting out Crushbone for a possible offensive.&#8221;
	Saldyar narrowed his eyes.  &#8220;By &#8216;scout&#8217; you mean one of those rogues, right?&#8221;
	Quintar nodded.  &#8220;Correct.&#8221;
	Saldyar raised his sword and began to recite something about defending Felwithe when Andriana elbowed him in the side and said, &#8220;He just saved us.  You could have a little more respect.&#8221;
	&#8220;He is a rogue!&#8221; shouted Saldyar.
	&#8220;A rogue, yes, but I am not an average thief that just steals anything.  I have a purpose, to defend Kelethin and make a little profit on the side.&#8221;
	&#8220;Typical rogue,&#8221; mumbled Saldyar before the sounds of a drum filled the air.  &#8220;What is that?&#8221;
	&#8220;That sounds like Bosk and his accel, accelana, oh&#8230;that song he sings to make us run fast,&#8221; said Andriana.
	&#8220;And that sounds like a group of Orcs are after him,&#8221; commented Saldyar.  &#8220;We should help.&#8221;  Andriana looked at him sideways for a moment, noting the out of character response, but was thrown back into reality when he said, &#8220;He would&#8217;ve been dead if I was not here.  Why let him die now?&#8221;
	Andriana snickered and turned to Quintar and asked, &#8220;Would you like to help us?&#8221;
	Quintar smiled and said, &#8220;I would be honored.&#8221;
	The three of them ran down the hill to meet Bosk and Malin.  Bosk exchanged glances with Andriana, telling each other not to ask about their newfound friends until later, if there is a later.  As they reached the tunnel where the exit to Greater Faydark is they saw a dark situation.  The whole exit was blocked with Orcs, surrounding the small group of Elves that stayed behind and the Elves that were with Bosk.  D&#8217;Vinn was holding Geraine in his arms and smiled a deadly smile when she attempted to reach for Bosk.
	&#8220;So&#8230;the bard is called Bosk, eh?&#8221; he asked.
	Everyone froze.  Even the pursuing Orcs stopped cold when they saw the rest of the Orcs guarding the exit.  Bosk put his drum away and stepped forward.  &#8220;What do you want, D&#8217;Vinn?&#8221;
	D&#8217;Vinn chuckled.  &#8220;I want to know why you are here.  All these&#8230;&#8216;people&#8217;&#8230;here to find one girl&#8217;s parents?  It does not make sense.&#8221;
	&#8220;Maybe not to you,&#8221; interjected Andriana, &#8220;but we like helping those in need.&#8221;
	Crush began to laugh harshly.  &#8220;Help others?  HA!  That is your weakness, puny Elf!&#8221;
	&#8220;We consider it a strength of ours,&#8221; replied Revea defiantly.
	D&#8217;Vinn looked at her and darkly said, &#8220;Really now?  Try helping yourself,&#8221; before deftly drawing a knife out of his coat and throwing it with pinpoint accuracy to Revea&#8217;s throat, burying itself to the hilt.  She fell to the ground, coughing up blood.
	Elventear ran to her, trying to hold himself together to focus on healing her wound, but the damage was too extensive and his grief to overwhelming.  Revea grabbed his neck and managed to whisper, &#8220;Finish&#8230;this&#8230;save&#8230;Gerai&#8230;&#8221;
	Elventear&#8217;s face became soaked with tears as he said, &#8220;My dear, sweet Revea.&#8221;
	&#8220;Help her now, healer.&#8221;  Elventear looked to D&#8217;Vinn, rage burning the inside of his being, and said nothing.  He could not say a word or else he would not be able to contain his rage.  D&#8217;Vinn smirked and said, &#8220;I thought not.&#8221;  Everyone stood there, motionless and starring at Revea&#8217;s blood soaked body.  D&#8217;Vinn raised his voice, &#8220;What is the point of helping others when you can not help yourself?&#8221;
	&#8220;I agree, master D&#8217;Vinn,&#8221; said a voice from inside the tunnel.  	Everyone turned around to see a High Elf, a Dwarf, and a Wood Elf starring at a robed figure in shock.  The figure stepped forward and removed her hood to reveal the face of a female Dark Elf.  She walked confidently to D&#8217;Vinn, not afraid of being attacked.  &#8220;I bring you a gift, masterful D&#8217;Vinn, from the outcast Dorn.  He begs your forgiveness.&#8221;
	D&#8217;Vinn raised an eyebrow.  &#8220;Dorn?&#8221;  He scoffed a moment before asking, &#8220;Where is it, woman?&#8221;
	&#8220;My name is Lyrial, master D&#8217;Vinn.  Here is the gift&#8221;
	Arihel stared at Lyrial in disbelief.  &#8220;How could you, Lyrial?&#8221;
	Lyrial looked back as if to reply.  &#8220;I must.&#8221;
	Rooks and Rosa stood ready for anything.  &#8220;Tis not looking well, my dear,&#8221; commented Rooks.
	&#8220;I should think not,&#8221; replied Rosa.
	&#8220;My forgiveness,&#8221; asked Arihel.  &#8220;I did not know about this.&#8221;
	&#8220;Tis not your fault&#8230;the Dark Elves are a deceitful Race,&#8221; assured Rooks.
	Toldan and Oscruncher held close to Cailet.  &#8220;Looks like this may be it,&#8221; whispered Toldan.
	Oscruncher nodded, not taking his eyes off the surrounding Orcs.  Cailet was too scared to move, never seeing so many Orcs together in all her life.
	Malin leaned in to whisper to Bosk, &#8220;Can you tell them I am not with you?  I&#8217;d rather not die if I can help it.&#8221;
	Bosk grimaced.  &#8220;Thanks for that reminder that I am responsible here for this.  I always wanted my last moments in this realm to be filled with grief.&#8221;
	Malin nodded and said, &#8220;Not a problem.&#8221;
	Lyrial gave the small package to D&#8217;Vinn, who set Geraine down on the ground.  She attempted to Bosk but was blocked by a royal, to which D&#8217;Vinn laughed and said, &#8220;Let her go.  She can die in his arms.&#8221;  He took the package and examined it.  It was not ornate like the packages he was used to receiving, but it was traditional for his Race as far as color scheme and design.  D&#8217;Vinn felt that the gift could make up for it if it was worthy enough to do so.  Just as D&#8217;Vinn began to carefully open the wrapping of the box, three Wood Elves looked down from on top of Taskmaster hill.  The leader, a male, whispered to his female apprentices, &#8220;Show no mercy on the vile beasts!&#8221;
