						<p><b>Galeth Verderth</b><br />
Galeth is a hero among High elf paladins.  Rescuer of Firiona Vie in the battle with the Iskar Danak Dhonrentath. 
</p><p><b>Ghargin Bumblok</b><br />
Ghargin Bumblok is an ogre shaman, and lives up to the reputation of his race. He has wisdom enough to hold a staff and cast "purdy sparklies," but little more. Ghargin has a deep fear for Rogkasth and Vahlai, which they exploit to press him into service. He always performs their orders without question.
</p><p>Ghargin also has an adoration for Teir`Dal in general. He views them as superior beings, thanks to the propaganda fed to him by Vahlai. The other races are "stoopid ants for Ghargin ta squish wit his sparklies."
</p><p><b>Gate Callers</b><br />
The Jaevins school of magic is where young magicians in Erudin go to practice their art under the guidance of Guildmaster Markus Jaevins. Located in the Erudin Palace in the Gatecallers hall, magicians of all ages study their art. The Gatecallers support the High Council of Erudin and the High Guard of Erudin.

The lost art of the Combine Empire. 
</p><p><b>Geonid Collective</b><br />
The rock men, the Geonids are found in the Crystal Caves and in a cave in the Wakening lands.
</p><p><b>Gharol the Orc</b><br />
Of the border struggles and the great burning:<br /> 
The elves of Kelethin were tentative at first and the lord of Kelethin, an old elf by the name of Carandril, sent many messages to Gharol to ask what his plans were in moving his clan eastward. To this day no scholar can really be sure if Gharol was able to decipher the letters or not, as it is general knowledge that most orcs can't read a word of any written language, but it is certain the orcan lord was angry to find that another race had already taken residence in the eastern lands. Carandril never saw any messengers he sent out again, as they were all killed by Gharol immediately as the letters were exchanged.
</p><p>Acting purely on his instincts, the leader of the crushbone clan told his followers of this "new" race and how they had "stolen" the east from the orcs. Gharol then started to plot a new plan which would entail the complete destruction of Kelethin and the enslavement of the elven race, as he thought kelethin was the only city of elves and the center for the entire elven empire.
</p><p>Both assumptions were false and the forces of Gharol were met with bitter, however surprised, resistance on the borders of the greater faydark. Most of the orcs leading this first attack were killed and the rest were turned quickly away. Angry at this new defeat and jealous of the elven strength, Gharol started to plot a new system of attack. He understood that most of his soldiers had been slaughtered from elves high in the treetops who would rain showers of arrows down on his forces. So for the second attack, Gharol put his orcs into a long line of attackers, gave each soldier his own makeshift torch, and then ordered the entire host to run into the borders of the greater Faydark and burn whatever they could touch. The Crushbone orcs set fire from everything to the tops of the trees to the grasses on the forest paths. Nothing but ash was left in their wake. The elven archers high in the trees were burned to death and the remaining elven soldiers, horrified and shocked at the tactics of their strange enemy, began to make a hasty retreat. The wood elves would later call the incident "the great burning." Gharol, seeing  how effective his new methods were, gathered his clan into many small camps around the greater Faydark and ordered the construction of hundreds of torches for a second assault.
</p><p>The lord of Kelethin, desperate for help, sent word of his plight to the heart of the empire: Felwithe.
</p><p>The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request was a young soldier named Edril.
</p><p><b>Ghoul</b><br />   
Ghouls are loathsome creatures with a taste for living creatures and even corpses. Being creatures of the night, ghouls are susceptible to holy or blessed weapons. Take care to avoid being touched by a ghoul -- their grasp can cause paralysis and sickness.  The Ghouls of Neriak guard the Lodge of the Dead, the necromancers guild, but that is the only place you will find them in the inhabited cities on Norrath.
</p><p><b>Goblin</b><br />
Created by Rallos-Zek, their race was cursed as part of the gods’ reprisal against Rallos-Zek's war on Norrath in the Elder Age. No writings remain of their punishment as they no longer keep records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to the severity of their curse). <i>[note:  but see below.]</i> However, they are said to be in possession of the Staff of Anexen, parts of which were given to four goblin races on Norrath, aqua, fire, slime, and ice.  (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p><i>The History of the Goblins:</i>
This ancient tale of a civilization long since forgotten by the name of Ankexfen was handed down to me by a visiting priestess in Najena by the name of Aerthane D'Zitherak, a Priestess of Innoruuk, and seeker of the Fabled and Ancient Staff of Ankexfen.
</p><p>Long ago, there existed a race known as the Ankexfen, after their progenitor Hazeg Ankexfen, who were created by Rallos Zek during the Elder Age.  This race was quite intelligent and cunning.  They quickly expanded their knowledge of magic and the other planes, yet constantly yearned for more power.  So, along with their ogre counterparts, they set out to master the Plane of Earth.  Alas, their attempts proved futile and the combined might of the other gods forced Rallos Zek back to the Planes of Power, leaving his creations to the whims of the other gods.
</p><p>The wrath of the unnamed gods was grim.  Thousands of ogres were instantly slain - their empire left to crumble under the hand of retribution.  The giants were flung across the face of Norrath like seeds to the wind.  The Ankexfen's fate was more severe.  The entire race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born the four goblin races.  Exactly how this happened is unknown.  But what is known is that each goblin clan was stripped of any knowledge and was neither informed of the other clans nor of their origins.  Each clan was then transported to a separate environment to help preserve the gods' will.  However, the gods were not without mercy and each clan was granted a section of the staff.  Upon each staff, a crystal was adorned.  These staves served to aid the goblin clans in understanding their environment.  These remnants of the Staff of Ankexfen combine to create the fabled and powerful Staff of Ankexfen. 
</p><p><b>Goblins of Fire Peak</b>:the clan of Goblins in Solsek Ro
</p><p><b>Goblins of the Pickclaw Tribe</b>: Goblins that live in the mines below Highkeep.
</p><p><i>Discovery of the Blue Stone of Power [used in the Bloody War of Kithicor]</i><br />
The goblins of the Pickclaw tribe were not known for their wit. In fact, because of their extreme lack of intelligence, they have been abused in trades by just about every merchant in Norrath. If one were to wonder why the citizens of Highkeep permit the clan to live in the mines beneath their homes, the answer  is quite simple, they are good miners and they trade the ores cheaply. 
The goblins would slave day in and out looking for the "shiny rocks" for which the stupid humans gave them coin. The fact that these same rocks actually made the coin they received was a feature that escaped them. 
In addition to the humans of Highkeep, the goblins also made secret trades with both the Teir`Dal of Neriak and the Fier`Dal of Faydwer. The Teir`Dal would reward the goblins with decent arms and generally paid the best. They were dangerous to deal with as they were just as likely to kill you as pay you. Trading with the Fier`Dal was rather uncommon. The Fier`Dal only came seeking the few rare stones they used to create their arcane runes, which was fine for the pickclaws as no one else wanted those dull looking rocks.
</p><p>The Pickclaw miner Nurgal was on par intellectually with of the rest his clan. Nurgal was quite happy this day as he had found a new vein in his section of the mines. In fact, he'd already pulled three shiny yellow bricks today and was sure to get at least a fistful of copper for them! After chipping a few more layers he hit something very hard with his pick, so hard that his pick bent. "Whaza!" he exclaimed.  In the crevice he revealed was a slightly glowing blue rock. "Hmm," he thought, "me never seen a blue rock a'fore." He tried chipping at it a little bit more but could not even put a scratch into it. Finally in a display of rare brilliance, and after ruining several more tools, he decided to carve around the rock and yank it out. 
The rock was spherical in shape, about 8 inches in diameter. Nurgal's eyes gleamed as he guessed how many allies he could buy with this rare find. He quickly concealed it in his belt pouch, wary as always that some of the larger goblins might see it and take it from him. He scrambled out of the hole he was working in and started off to the city to find the dark elf ambassador. The dark elves had always given Nurgal the best prices for rare finds, and this would be no exception he decided.
</p><p>Tyrana Slil was quite pleased with Nurgal, especially since he swore that he brought this new find straight to her without telling anyone else. As one of the Teir`Dal ambassadors in Highkeep, it was Tyrana's job to be both spy and broker for materials gained in the keep. Although Tyrana enjoyed the shady nature of her work, she really wanted to be back in Neriak. Working with these lesser races day in and out was beneath her standards. "Thanks to this stupid creature," she thought, "I may just have a ticket back there." "So, u pay me big?" he asked with a lustful gaze. "Sweet sweet Nurgal, you've been so kind to me, how can I ever repay you… more wine?" Gods how she hated having to play the role of seductress to this loathsome creature, but nevertheless, her tactics were effective. Nurgal gulped the wine, most of which ended up on his gut, and seemed most pleased with himself. "Now, let us see just what kind of properties this find of yours has."
</p><p>She had the orb centered on the table, although she was not the most practiced geologist, as a necromancer of Innoruuk she did have some powerful identification spells at her disposal. As she finished her minor enchantment there was a bright flash of blue light and a burning sensation that caused her to jump back, shrieking. Nurgal promptly jumped under the table wanting no part of the dark elf's wrath that was sure to follow.  But instead of draining Nurgal's life as she stared at her now burnt fingertips, Tyrana begin to cackle with unabashed glee. "By Innoruuk's hand this is no mere metal! Its magic properties alone are the strongest I've seen!" Realizing that his mistress was happy again Nurgal pulled himself up from the floor and smiled. "Nurgal…. Are there more of these where you found this one, in the mines?" she asked.  "Umm, me not know…but usually when me find one type of shiny rock me find more later," he replied.  "I must get both this rock and this information to Neriak at once," Tyrana thought to herself, "But, before I leave, I must have this wretched creature show me where he found this, so I can be done with him."
</p><p>After Nurgal was appropriately intoxicated, Tyrana tried to convince the goblin to show her where it was he found this vein of strange blue ore. Nurgal was hesitant to reveal the location of his find to the dark elf but after Tyrana offered him a sizeable reward, the goblin finally agreed. Calling for a guard from the keep to escort them, Tyrana followed Nurgal down into the mines where he revealed the location of the strange blue vein of ore.
</p><p>Tyrana was very pleased with Nurgal's find and complimented the goblin on a job well done. After inspecting the vein of ore, Tyrana turned to the goblin and grinned. Her hands began to glow with a pale green light. Nurgal jumped in fear as the magic began to swirl and build around Tyrana. The coarse hair on the goblin's body began to bristle with the building energy. Ducking his head, Nurgal blathered, "What you doing? You not hurt Nurgal now?" Tyrana continued to smile at the goblin and said in a sweet voice, "Why Nurgal! I'm not going to hurt you, I'm simply creating your reward!" No sooner had the Teir`Dal uttered these words did she draw away the full sum of Nurgal's life-force. With a pitiful squeal, the goblin slumped to the ground, a dry and empty husk. Tyrana laughed.
</p><p>Concealing the large blue sphere in her packs she prepared to journey back to Neriak to report her find. Tyrana sought out Grigog, Bgug, Sagg, and Glunn a trio of orcs of the Shralok clan. Tyrana often used these three as escorts for her journeys between Neriak and Highkeep. Though she always paid the orcs well for their services, they were always willing to help protect to "bootifal" Tyrana Slil and probably would have done the job free of charge. [for more of this story, see the Bloody War of Kithicor Forest]
</p><p><b>Grandmaster Tynn</b><br /> 
The father of Iksar monk disciplines. He came to the empire from an unknown tribe. Some say he was a ronin who wandered the worlds of Norrath where he formed the basis of the city of Sebilis with no rebirth. He entered to form a caste which did not exist. He was quickly challenged by the warlords. He spoke his words and they did not listen. He knew the only way to make them understand was to challenge their finest in The Gauntlet. He called for four of the finest warlords and allowed them arms. The warlords agreed, thinking his challenge as easy task.
</p><p>Grandmaster Tynn quickly dispatched of the warlords with nothing more than fist and tail. He fought in a way never displayed. His victory earned him much respect and Emperor Sathir soon commanded him to form the Court of Pain and raise an army of monks. Tynn formed the Swifttail Caste. 
Soon the way of fist and tail had hundreds in it's ranks, climbing the rungs. Tynn showed them they were not warriors, but monks.
</p><p>They would don shackles as testament to the Age of Snake when the Iksar were a race enslaved. Inner strength and harmony were taught. The Swifttail were born.
</p><p>The Swifttail were disbanded during the End Days. It was not till the rise of the new empire under Emperor Vekin did the caste reform. Grandmaster Glox, a former disciple of Tynn, came to New Sebilis to rebuild the Court of Pain. In honor of Tynn, all masters now drape themselves in a robe like he wore. (History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p>Great Divide
The Great Divide is a heavily mountainous area, cutting the continent of Velious into two halves, east and west. The harsh environment is home to all nature of powerful creatures, including shardwurms, Kodiaks, a race of half- man-half-bull called Tizmaks, Coldain, Frost giants, and more. (Eq Atlas)
</p><p>Greater Faydark
Greater Faydark is the home of the wood elves, in the tree city of Kelethin, and the high elves, in the grand city of Felwithe. It is also very near the homes of both the dwarves and the gnomes, so many members of those races are seen here as well.  The traveler must be wary of the camps of orcs near Kelethin which have spread from Crushbone.  One may also see all manner of creatures including wasps, bats, spiders, skeletons, wolves, willowisps, Fairies, and Pixies, and the occasional Brownie scout. (Eq Atlas)
</p><p>Gretespaign or Great Span Bridge
A gigantic bridge crafted of what seems to be a magical form of ice on the continent of Velious, in the shape of a huge dragon.
</p><p><b>Greenbloods</b><br /> 
The Ogre Shadow Knights are called the Greenblood Knights. They are led by Soonog. The Greeblood Knights hate the Troll Shadow Knights of Nightkeep from Grobb and the Dwarven Warriors of Kaladim called Stormguard.
</p><p>Grobb
Home to the Trolls.  Grobb is a rather fearsome place, guarded by the Bashers.  One can find gruesome scences of torture inside the city, as well as a few prisoners.
</p><p><b>Guardians of the Vale</b><br />
Warrior's Guild
</p><p><b>Heretics</b><br /> 
The Heretics can be found in Paineel. Erudin and Paineel were in a state of war. Erudin is a longstanding city of magic but was opposed to Necromantic magic. At first the Heretics simply fled into the nearby Tox Forest, but they then moved into Paineel on the opposite side of the forest from Erudin. The Tox Forest is now a battleground between the two cities.  In Paineel can be found three Guildmasters. The Clerics are led by Sern Adolia, the Necromancers by Coriante Verisue and the Shadow Knights by Mandaril Dark Knife. The Heretics have no allies but they oppose those in Erudin. They oppose the clerics and paladins of Deepwater Knights, and the three magic user guilds: Gate Callers, Craft Keepers and Crimson Hands. (Allakhazam’s Magical Realm)

The "Flying Monkeys" of the Wakening Land. (Allakhazam’s Magical Realm)
