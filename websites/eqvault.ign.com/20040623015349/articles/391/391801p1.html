<span class=dateline>May       02, 2000</span> - An ebon hand moved, disturbing the sand covering it. Her entire form rose then like a zombie of the desert. Sand ran off her in rivulets, exposing blackened armour. Coughing and sputtering, Envy peered through the predawn darkness for anyone who would notice her. Namely, Wind Riders.
They had treated her relatively well during the time she was captured, considering. The biggest threat came when Sugan herself arrived at the tower. The Teir'Dal had heard the enemy's leader outside, adamantly refusing to enter on the risk that she might run a sword through her rather than look at her. Envy had cackled at that, and was amused at the silence outside afterwards. Other than that, the Lightwalkers were nearly hospitable; allowing Envy visitors even. At dusk, one had brought her a most interesting gift; a plain looking book called the Tome of Shadows. She'd only briefly gotten to read from it at the time.
Night brought their advantage. The moment the Shadow Striders ambushed the base, Envy had stepped casually into the midst of the chaos outside. She&#8217;d heard the hiss of Shannyn's voice, chanting into what was probably certain death for some unfortunate victim. A large dark wolf howled from the dunes above, and Envy had smiled at the bloodthirsty glow in the wolf's eyes... Mayana. Shadows drifted in and out of the black desert, striking and fading away like the waves of some nightmarish ocean. The dark elf stretched lazily, and pulled hidden daggers she carried in places not often searched. She flipped the blades expertly in her grasp, taking in the battle scene one last time. Blending back into the shadows of night, Envy had disappeared.
And here she came out of her hiding, cut off from the rest of the guild. Envy didn&#8217;t dare ask herself why she waited so long; that was dangerous thought. Instead she snuck closer to civilization, cringing at the sand in her armour. While peering around a corner in the dark tunnel to the Commonlands, a soft male voice startled her.
"My Lady Envy," it said. "Finally you've been found."
Envy bristled and flipped around, guarding with the daggers. Relief flooded her as the figure in black robes pulled back his cloak's hood to reveal Tdaael's face. Envy was about to speak but stopped at the necromancer's expression. Tdaael looked around him, as if expecting someone to have followed.
"Lord Faileas has been captured." he said quietly, speaking in the Teir'Dal language.
The shadow knight put her daggers away so Tdaael couldn't see her sudden trembling. Envy's face paled to a cool blue gray, but she tried to draw attention from that by shaking sand out of her hair. 
Envy cursed as she did this, and paced the hall like it was a cage. "And of his amulet? Did the Wind Riders take it?" she growled.
"Sugan did, and she released the soul trapped inside." Tdaael sighed. The shadow knight cursed once more, and lashed out at the air in anger.
Landing in a crouch, she gripped her temple and hissed, "How could she have that knowledge...?" 
The necromancer shook his head. "I don't know, Dark Lady, but when it was taken from him, Lord Faileas started spouting insanity&#8217;s, madness... he went catatonic shortly after.
"His last orders were to find you," Tdaael finished.
Just then several other Shadow Striders appeared. She stood as Ayna the pale darkness, Phyr the fallen goddess, and Laele the vampire approached. Envy winced, seeing the scores of wounds on the vampire's flesh as Laele knelt gingerly. Noticing the other woman's ashen expression, Laele flashed a bloodstained smile; her delicate yet deadly fangs reassuring. Envy nodded at the group of them and turned back to Tdaael.
"So." Envy began, "He's his sister's property now?" She leaned on the wall to cover her shock of the news.
Tdaael nodded. For a moment, Envy's eyes iced over with rage and she gritted her teeth. Then strangely she blinked it off, and offered a disarmingly civil smile.
"Good." she said to their amazement. After briefly judging each of her companions in turn, Envy drew them closer to speak in whispers.
She strode away from the group after they'd nodded uneasy agreeance to her words. Looking back with the dawn's first light glinting off her feral smile, Envy said, "Oh yes... And since Faileas has proven himself unworthy, I am now Mistress of the Shadows. Anyone who wishes to challenge that can speak to me."
The shadow knight laughed and disappeared.
In Neriak, the first thing Envy did was strip off her sand-filled armour and dive into the cool dark waters that flowed silently through the underground city. She glided along the pool's floor, washing away the rest of the uncomfortable grit. Resurfacing, the Teir'Dal once again noticed the Tome of Shadows peeking from her backpack.
She went quickly to her house to dress; and took the infamous scythe, Pestilence, from it's place near her altar. Wrapping the Tome in heavy waxed paper, Envy then tucked it into the pocket of a soft leather cloak that covered her face well. She left for Freeport.
Morning was leaving when she arrived at West Gate. The guards watched her dark figure carefully but made no move to intervene, after being hit with a strong blue-green gaze. Though it wasn't them she was hiding from. The militia patrolling East and West Freeport were loosely controlled by organizations Envy was associated with... it was the Paladins and Mages she had to look out for. North Freeport was the last haven of the city for true and pure hearted Lightwalkers. North Freeport was where Faileas was being held.
Drifting quietly past the arched doorway to the Academy of Arcane Science's courtyard, Envy joined a crowd and entered North Freeport. She inconspicuously slipped past buildings and shops when suddenly a hand shot forth and pulled back her hood. The shadow knight heard a familiar sliding of metal as the guard drew his sword.
"Dark elf!!" he shouted triumphantly, "Your foul deeds have..." He paused and glanced around.
Envy was gone.
Having dashed inside a convenient inn and up the stairs before the owner could protest, she quickly swung herself out a window to the rooftop. Here, Envy watched the streets below and the guards searching through the throngs of people for her in vain. A sudden gust of wind billowed out her black cloak, drawing her eyes skyward. Black clouds of a coming storm mottled the sunshine, coating the city with eerily sharp areas of brilliant light and dark shadow. The Teir'Dal covered her face again and matched the speed of the clouds&#8217; shadows, leaping with feline ease from roof to roof.
She stopped on a white wall overlooking the precinct known as the Temple of Marr. Sensing something from a room close to her, Envy waited for the paladin sentry to move on and then dropped quietly to the balcony. She peeked in and gasped, seeing a dark figure standing inside. Faileas' black armour nearly sucked in the very light around it, the cape wisping slightly in a breeze. But there was no Faileas in it. The T'Druis family sword she had given him hung nearby on a rack, partially wrapped in strange cloth. With a smirk, Envy realized the paladins probably wouldn't deign touching it themselves. 'Innoruuk knows how many of their brethren coat that sword,' she thought, laughing.
A noise startled her from such pleasant thoughts, and she made haste for the wall outside. Frowning, Envy wondered if they were holding him in the Hall of Truth. She turned and crouched to jump, but suddenly a voice came from her left... almost causing her to fall.
"Envy," it whispered.
She sniffed the air and searched warily, but found nothing. Eyes narrowed with suspicion, the Teir'Dal slithered in the direction, ready to attack. She found nothing of the whisperer, but gathered around a building in the alley opposing her was a small group of about six onlookers. They appeared to be spying through a small barred window, belonging to a room that was half underground. The basement cell of some guild house?
The building was at least two stories above ground, so Envy looked for guards before dropping to the street. Joining the group, she listened to their subdued chatter while trying to get a look in the ground-level window. Envy's heartbeat sped up, definitely sensing the presence of Faileas' bloodline nearby.
"... and good riddance, too, I say." a half elf with hair almost as white as Envy's quietly murmured. "About time they did something. Only wish half the militia and those scoundrels sneaking about underground were executed with him..." 
She spoke hastily and looked behind her as she did it; shifting in her dark blue armour. They were all speaking with utmost care, as if something dangerous would catch them.
"Are you sure he's down there? That it's really THE Lord Faileas?" asked a human dressed in plain brown robes.
"Aye," the half elf answered. "Saw him arrested just last night. Wasn't a bit happy about it, either. Threw some sort of fit, and got all quiet. Downright disturbing, it was." 
Another human nodded, his chainmail tinkling slightly. "Course it's him!" he frowned. "Look for yourself! But watch out, I wouldn'a meet 'is eyes if I were you... he knows black magick, an' el prolly take your soul for it."
The bunch of them looked wide-eyed at each other for a silent uneasy moment. The sound of a door opening in the front of the building sent them scuttling to look busy or as if just passing. Envy ducked behind a large barrel and watched. A patch of sunlight played harbinger to a red headed girl in full steel plate. She walked slowly, reading a letter and shaking her head in gentle exasperation. She stretched in the sunlight, accentuated by a light breeze. The Teir'Dal cringed further behind the barrel and hissed at the sight. Sugan. There was no way she'd stand a chance if Sugan spotted her here&#8230;
One member of the group from before passed the paladin and bowed reverently. "Good day, Lady Sugan!" he said brightly. "How are you this fine day?"
Sugan smiled at the man. "I'm doing just fine today, sir. And I appreciate your asking. Busy day in town?"
"Oh, little more than usual..." he prattled on and on, "... and how would your brother be?" the man asked as a seeming afterthought. Envy smiled at his hypocrisy of friendliness.
Sugan wasn't thrown at all by the question. "He'll be fine, I think... still won't speak to me, but listens well enough. If you'll excuse me, sir, I need to make an announcement soon at the Theatre. Join me if you like."
The two of them strolled off. A few people watched and then wandered back to the cell window, chattering gossip still. Envy crept out of her spot warily.
"Such a pity... lovely girl. I'd be ashamed of my family too, if He was in it," said a short woman, obviously a wood elf.
"Shh!" waved the half elf, "Don't let her hear you, that would be so rude!"
"Oh no," said the man in chainmail. "It's not her we have to worry about. There are far worse creatures to deal with when you speak an ill word of the great 'Lord' Faileas." He bowed in mock grandeur at the word Lord, and snorted a laugh.
"That's right," Envy spoke up. They all turned to her as she pulled her hood back. "Creatures like me."
"Gods, a dark elf!" the man spat, "A shadow knight!"
The half elf's violet eyes dilated, finally seeing the size of the scythe. "That's Envy."
"H-have you come to set your Faileas free, dark one?" stuttered the wood elf. "There's no way you'd succeed. The house is filled with Wind Riders."
Envy bared her teeth. "Let me be the one to decide that." she snapped. "Now get out of here."
She swung Pestilence down dangerously close to the wood elf's face, missing only on purpose. The bunch of them disappeared quickly. Envy stood quietly until they had all scuttled away, and knelt down to peer into the darkness behind the barred window. She hesitated before speaking.
"Faileas," Envy said in a polished tone, "Master. I have come, can you hear me?"
From the shadows within, a pair of eyes flashed brilliant blood red to acknowledge her presence.
&#8220;Envy,&#8221; whispered a voice like silk wrapped steel. It was the same voice that had guided her here. The dark elf marveled at this revelation for a moment, but her thoughts were interrupted when Faileas spoke again.
&#8220;You risked much to come here, my apprentice. How&#8230; unbecoming of such an upstanding Teir&#8217;Dal.&#8221; A soft chuckle came from the shadows; a sound that could have passed for a low growl.
Narrowing her eyes a bit, Envy tried to hear the context between his words. &#8216;Hopeless human,&#8217; she thought, and shook her head.
She said, &#8220;No more than what you risked in the attempt to free me. That was foolish, Lord Faileas. I could have taken care of it myself. It is you who are to be protected at all costs, and now look. You&#8217;re in the hands of Lightwalkers-&#8220;
&#8220;I do as I see fit, Envy. You above all know the most powerful path is also the most difficult.&#8221; Faileas snapped, &#8220;Do not attempt to correct me.&#8221;
By instinct, as if he were standing before her instead of locked in a dark cage, Envy bowed her head. &#8220;Yes, Lord Faileas.&#8221;
A long, awkward moment passed before she spoke again. &#8220;I&#8230; can only suppose that you know of my plan so far. The Shadow Striders should give little resistance to my leadership.&#8221;
&#8220;I always know your plans. A multifaceted idea, this. Impressive.&#8221; It sounded as if Faileas was smiling.
Again, Envy felt there was something double edged in his words. She frowned at her inability to catch it. Faileas had the rare talent of being able to infuriate her&#8230; when it suited him.
Biting her lip to subdue the anger, Envy took the book wrapped in waxpaper from her cloak. &#8220;I brought you a gift, Faileas. Something that, I hope, will at least ease your boredom during this. The Tome of Shadows.&#8221;
&#8220;The Tome of Shadows? That&#8217;s not the easiest book to acquire. Thank you, Dark Lady.&#8221; Faileas said. 
Envy preened slightly at the title, and noticed that he&#8217;d moved closer to the barred window. The blood red metal plates covering Faileas&#8217; arms and all but the palms of his hands were the only parts of his shadow knight armour that he still wore. Those pieces couldn&#8217;t be removed, and were known as the Armour of Souls for a reason. She could see the dim outline of his hair and cheekbone, the glint of teeth, and his dark green eyes. 
&#8216;Handsome,&#8217; The dark elf admitted to herself, &#8216;&#8230;for a human.&#8217;
She pushed the wrapped tome through the bars, purposefully brushing the skin of Faileas&#8217; hand as she gave it to him. Somewhere deep inside, Envy reveled in the power of this; flirting with something she&#8217;d never dared to before. It was a sort of subtle victory for the most primitive female part of her. An establishment of dominance.
And as soon as the smile graced her lips, it was wiped off. A steel claw wrapped around her wrist tightly, and she let out a small cry of surprise. Faileas&#8217; eyes flashed red once more.
&#8220;Curiosity,&#8221; he said with a feral smile, &#8220;won&#8217;t kill the cat as surely as Ambition.&#8221;
Envy hissed as the points of his sharp gloved fingertips dug into her skin. Faileas gave her hand a gentle and polite kiss.
&#8220;Thank you again, Dark Lady.&#8221; He laughed, &#8220;Now begone. The guards are coming.&#8221;
She glanced up at the empty alley and back again at Faileas, tugging free of his grasp. Five beads of violet blood welled up and rolled across her dark indigo skin. The Teir&#8217;Dal cursed in her native tongue as she shimmied up the barrel and onto the roof of the adjacent building. Just then an afternoon shadow rounded the corner of the alley, and as Faileas predicted, a Paladin guard appeared with sword drawn. Shaking her head incredulously, Envy snuck back to West Freeport.
As she strolled leisurely down the dirty street, Envy mentally debated with herself about the next course of action. The night&#8217;s events were already planned, as she intended to return for the dark armour and sword that the Wind Riders had confiscated. Further than that however&#8230; well, her brief experience with Faileas had given her ideas.
Suddenly, a familiar voice drifted close and Envy hugged the wall, perking her ears. Sugan was at the Theatre of the Tranquil with a good number of people listening to her. The shadow knight peered into the area cautiously. Sure enough, Faileas&#8217; twin sister was taking center stage in her usual obliviously arrogant way. Envy spit at the way the gods of light seemed to bless her; kept her stupidly untouchable. The human&#8217;s red hair glowed with blinding sunlight, and along with the shining armour Sugan truly played a holy knight for the people. Disgusting.
Her normal seething at the Wind Riders&#8217; leader satiated, Envy focused on what was being said.
&#8220;&#8230;a deviously intelligent man, my friends, so don't be fooled by his ploys.&#8221; Sugan preached. &#8220;And do not be fooled into showing sympathy for his minions, either. Many of them are pleading &#8216;innocent&#8217; as it were, claiming it's our arrogance that has decided Faileas can not go free.&#8221;
&#8216;Innoruuk spare me,&#8217; Envy thought bitterly, &#8216;Whoever told you that was brilliant. Now if you were only capable of learning&#8230;&#8217;
Just as if she&#8217;d said it out loud, Sugan paused and looked directly at the dark elf. Envy could see the angry flash of lightning in her eyes even with the distance. Unflinching, the shadow knight channeled pure Hatred right back. A reflexive dare.
Sugan opted to continue her speech but kept her gaze on Envy for a long time, as if she was speaking to only her. &#8220;I will tell you why Faileas can not go free. He is inflicted with a curse of madness, one that allows him to order the deaths of innocents with a wave of the hand. One that tells him he is to murder, manipulate, and enslave the world in the name of the Plaguebringer.&#8221;
The charismatic paladin shifted back to attending her audience, &#8220;If he ever had a conscience about this, it was defied. Not only has he done these things himself, but he leads others to follow in his footsteps. He is corruption and defilement, and cannot be tolerated.
&#8220;Faileas can not go free because he murdered countless Knights of Thunder, and Clerics of Life in Qeynos, only a few of which could be resurrected. He orchestrated the deaths of many, many others, including the paladin Koramur. He organized and assisted in attacking Silveril, which resulted in the magical conception of her children, Silverann, Stormangell, and Annaconda; against her will. He assisted in the death and resurrection of Laraden, who was then enslaved as an unholy creature. He kidnapped and tortured Jamier D'Phoenix. He stalked and attempted to kidnap Lillaie, and encouraged her harassment by his minions. He kidnapped Avari, exchanging him for a blood sacrifice by my officer, Sirynn... and even now is condoning Avari's enslavement to his apprentice, Envy&#8230;&#8221;
The dark elf rolled her eyes and muttered, &#8220;If only she knew the half of it.&#8221;
Sugan was still yet counting off her brother&#8217;s sins. Her fervor was affecting the people exactly the way it was meant to. &#8220;He purposefully passed on the curse of our family to Sirynn, while resurrecting him here in Freeport. He held Wind Riders Daks and Thryn hostage, forcing them to battle each other to the death for his amusement.&#8221;
&#8216;Now that&#8217;s not true,&#8217; thought Envy gleefully, &#8216;It amused everyone there.&#8217;
&#8220;He then resurrected Thryn in much the same manner as Sirynn... again, infecting Thryn with the Imshee'Cro curse. He lead the Shadow Striders in the Dark Alliance's attack on Ak'Anon, resulting in mass death of countless Gnomes, and quite a few High elves. He assisted the daughter of Innoruuk, Lanys T'Vyl, and her followers in murdering innocent Halflings&#8230;&#8221;
The shadow knight sighed. &#8216;No, Faileas assisted ME in assisting the Lady T&#8217;Vyl,&#8217; she thought.
Sugan continued, &#8220;He manipulated the servitude of my officer, Sorcere Trueheart, which resulted in the death of our beloved Ralnia. 
&#8220;Faileas murdered Stormangel. He murdered Canelon. He murdered the brother of my officer, Laneni Taciturn. Not only were they killed, but their souls taken for his own gain of power. He kidnapped me, subjected me to the whims of Bertoxxulous in the realm of Disease, and had me betray my own. I was forced to reveal the secrets of the Temple of Thunder and Temple of Marr to the miscreants of the Dismal Rage, and forced to wage battles against my own people. And, he knowingly released the demon Malgorm Azzothoth into our lands.&#8221;
&#8216;Amen,&#8217; Envy thought, feeling the overwhelming urge to applaud. Sugan took a short step back to contemplate the crowd's stunned silence, and let her eyes rest on many of them to relay her pain.
Manipulation at it&#8217;s finest, the Teir&#8217;Dal observed.
The redhead took a slow breath, and continued with gentle insistence. &#8221;Faileas is not only guilty of these crimes, but he's proud of them. Following in the footsteps of our father, he continues to strike our name down with evil. It was my vow long ago, to stop him and restore honour to our name, and now I am closer to that than ever before&#8230;&#8221;
&#8220;Impetuous Lightwalker,&#8221; growled Envy quietly, &#8220;you have no idea what you are close to.&#8221;
&#8220;&#8230;Karana have mercy on his soul,&#8221; Sugan said, &#8220;Those of you who think I am being harsh, remember. The People of Ak'Anon, and of Rivervale... even my own Temple of Thunder would not even have spared him this long. I do so out of love, faith, and respect. Condemn me if you will, but I follow my heart.
&#8220;May the Rainkeeper bless your lives with prosperity. Good day.&#8221; The paladin stepped down and parted the crowd in her exit. Envy took this as her cue to leave too. Despite her earlier animosity, she knew it was stupid to risk facing Sugan in the human town. 
Outside of West Gate the dark elf was relieved to discover that Sugan wasn&#8217;t pursuing her. She removed her hood again and laughed at the confused sky. As if trying to prove themselves worthy to either paladin or shadow knight, the black clouds finally overtook the sun and low thunder rolled on the horizon.
&#8216;Ambition indeed, my malevolent Lord Faileas.&#8217; Envy thought. Her plans were decided at that moment. Envy was sick of humans, and she departed to scheme on long overdue vengeance.<div class=byline>-- <a href="mailto:envy@drow.net">Envy T'Druis</A></div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
