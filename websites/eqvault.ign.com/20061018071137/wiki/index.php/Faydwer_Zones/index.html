						<p>The continent of Faydwer is the home of the Dwarves, Wood Elves, High Elves and Gnomes. The High Elf civilization from Antonica relocated to Faydwer after the death of the Elddar Forest. Faydwer is the home of two of the oldest creatures on all of Norrath, Mayong Mistmoore, the Elf-Vampire and Phinigel Autropos, the last living Kedge. The name Faydwer was given to this continent by the High Elves of Antonica when they landed on its shores. 
</p><p><b>Ak'Anon</b> is the gnome city, located in the Steamfont Mountains on the continent of Faydwer. Known in ancient times as the Fortress Mechanicus, it is both fortress and laboratory. The gnomes are known for their tinkering skills in making mechanical machines. Gnomes have been developing their clockwork machines and defenses here for generations. The machines now do much of the work in the city, and serve as merchants. 
</p><p>The guards in the city are called “watchmen.” The rumor is that in ages past, the gnomes were so powerful they defied the gods and built their own clockwork dragon to protect the city, but it went rogue. No one knows the fate of this dragon. 
</p><p>Ever the since the first days of the elven rebellion, it had been decided by the emperor of Felwithe that the gnomes would be a free race allied with the elven empire and able to live on elven lands, much unlike the almost slave-like persecution the little tinkers suffered under the rule of the dark elves. The gnomes had been granted lands surrounding the fertile Elizerain Lake and there existed for a century or more in peace with their elven neighbors. However, being on elven lands also meant the gnomes would have to follow elvish customs, and increasingly the gnomes began to feel out of place. The gnomes were builders, not artists, and they could not sing or dance or play musical instruments. Elves prided themselves on their use of the bow and their long, graceful blades but gnomish arms couldn't support the lengthy elven weaponry. And while the elven language was meant to be spoken in long, descriptive, and fluid verse, the gnomes were always prone to speak in jittery and incredibly fast sentences. Slowly, a general concensus began to form among the gnomes that someday a separate gnomish kingdom would have to be formed. The gnome most responsible to bring about this change was named <b>Biddyn</b>. 
</p><p>Biddyn was born the fourth son to a poor farmer on the east of the Elizerain Lake, the gnomish territories closest to the heart of the empire. Almost immediately he recognized how much he, and even his brothers and father, hated farm work. The most joyous times in his life, as he later wrote, were the monthly festivals the gnomes held where they would gather and build all manner of fascinating machines. This, he thought, is what gnomes should be doing and he bestowed upon himself the responsibility to make sure this came to pass. Studying elven mannerisms and rhetoric on his market voyages to Felwithe with his father, Biddyn soon became a speaker the likes of which no gnome has ever equaled. His very charisma charmed everyone around him into the idea of a separate gnomish kingdom, and he soon was ready to bring his demands before the emperor. The emperor at this time was none other then Carandril, past lord of Kelethin, who had appointed the warrior Edril as his first soldier long ago and also as the head of the imperial army. Edril had served loyally and skillfully as Carandril's guard for more then a hundred years, the warrior elf being only a little more then middle-aged for his race. 
</p><p>Charmed by his determination and skillful speaking, Edril supported Biddyn for a separate gnomish kingdom. Even the emperor was attracted to the proposition, as a new allied kingdom would open new opportunities for trade while the gnomish loss would not be a big drain on the imperial economy. After only six days of deliberation, Carandril granted Biddyn's request and plans were immediately formed for the creation of a new gnomish homeland. The emperor severed the southern part of his empire, mostly unused and barren fields beyond the steamfont mountains, and gave it to the gnomes. 
</p><p>The land was renamed "Akanon" which is elven for "Gift" and ten gnomish settlers as well as five elven guards were prepared to make a journey into Akanon and chart the lands. 
</p><p>Of the plague dragon and the formation of Akanon:
The fifteen settlers rode out surrounded by the cheers of elves and gnomes alike, but were not heard from for many months. Finally after the fifth month of their disappearance, only one elven soldier, his clothes torn to pieces and his weapons shattered, rode solemnly through the gates of the empire. He was the last of the settlers who remained alive, and recounted his tale before an astonished imperial council. A plague dragon, with scales of an oozing black, had attacked the party soon after they had crossed into the southern lands and had claimed that the lands of Akanon were his own. For months the plague dragon chased them and hunted the gnomes and elves down. The soldier had watched each man die a slow and horrible death, and believed the dragon only let him go to give this message to the elves. 
</p><p>The gnomes were instantly furious that Carandril had given them cursed lands to settle, and the emperor immediately ordered the death of the dragon. Frightened by the terrible story of the soldier, most of his warriors were reluctant to volunteer, as Carandril would not force anyone to fight such a terrible beast. Edril, however, immediately offered his services as a personal favor to the gnomes. When Biddyn himself volunteered five more gnomes joined the hunt, and together with his gnomish friends, Edril rode to the Steamfont Mountains to meet the terrible beast. 
</p><p>What happened next is best summed up by Biddyn's own "The History of the Gnomes": "I admit as much, that even my legs were shaking when we approached the mouth of the demon's great cave. From our previous encounters, and from the memories of our lost friend Dolyn, we were all terrified of the beast. All of us, that is, except for Edril, but I don't think Innoruk himself could scare that elf. He thrives from fear as much as I do the tobacco in my pipe, it is to him as some sweet nectar that clears his thoughts and hones his blade. So while we trembled before the plague dragon's domain, Edril simply lifted his sword to his shoulder, looked back at me, and said "wait here." With a proud determination he marched toward the black cave entrance, a portal to the lower planes if ever there was one. He marched to his death, or so we thought. But when we saw him next in two days time he pulled behind him the head of the evil beast, which left thick trails of a green poison behind it. He breathed heavily, and painful scars covered his body. I laughed, thinking that while Edril was obviously hurt, the dragon must have felt much worse before his death. Anything that inflicts that much pain to the elf must be prepared to receive the same thrashing tenfold." 
</p><p>The skull of the dragon sits still on the entrance to the gnome's own Fortress Mechanus. Edril and his band of gnomes would be written into gnomish lore forever as for the next weeks they rode tirelessly through the lands of Akanon, fighting back fierce creatures and charting the perfect hillside location for the first ever kingdom of gnomes. Edril spent much more time in Akanon then originially expected, personally overseeing the kingdom's construction. 
</p><p>When the first houses were made and the first gnomish settlers came pouring in, Biddyn was selected as the first king of the gnomes and he in turn erected a statue in honor of Edril. The statue depicts Edril's battle with the great plague dragon, and gnomish craftsmanship made it enormous and actually useful: it sits in the heart of Akanon even today, acting as the central part to Akanon's extensive irrigation system. When Edril returned home to Felwithe he was greeted by hundreds of proud soldiers and again proclaimed a hero. (History of Norrath, SOE) 
</p><p><b>Butcherblock Mountains</b> is a large newbie/teen zone for the dwarves of Kaladim and the elves of Greater Faydark. The docks, once frequented by (slow and very unreliable) boats, now contain gnomish translocators who port players to destinations in the Ocean of Tears, Freeport and the Timorous Deep. In the Butcherblock Mountains one can find undead, Krags, a strange haunted chessboard where the pieces come to life, skunks, goblins both of the land of the sea, huge insects, bats, snakes, basilisks, and even the occasional orc. As one of the crossroads of the world, many creatures can be found in the peaks and valleys of these moutains. 
</p><p><b>Castle Mistmoore</b> is the stronghold of the ancient dark elf vampire, Mayong Mistmoore, and his throngs of followers, including gypsies, gargoyles, and the most evil of undead. 
</p><p><b>Crushbone</b> is the home of the Crushbone clan of orcs. It is located directly to the north of the wood elf city of Kelethin, and is the major thorn in the sides of all the inhabitants of the island of Faydwer. The city is accessible from only one entrance, and is set up in the shape of a ring. To the west side of Crushbone lies a small building where elves and dwarves actually live, as well as the entrance to the slave pits. To the northeast lies the home of Emporer Crush. In the center is a large hill where the orc trainer trains his troops. A river flows around and through the area. One can find orcs, dwarven slaves and priests, and even the dark elf Ambassador Dvinn in the confines of Crushbone. 
</p><p><i>The Founding of Crushbone</i><br />
Little more then three months after their betrayal of Dagnor and their march to the east, the newly freed orcan slaves were left stranded with no place to call home. None of the orcs had ever lived without the watchful eye of an ogre master looking over their shoulder, so now they were like children: wandering without knowing exactly what they were to do. 
</p><p>The dwarves had made it clear in their pact that, while the kingdom of Kaladim was responsible for freeing the orcs, they were still very much enemies. It was not an option for any of the orcs to return west, so they eached began plotting for a new place to live. 
</p><p>The decision was split three ways and the orcs began to revert back to the methods of their ancestors: splitting into three differing clans. 
</p><p>One clan marched north, taking residence in the familiar northern peaks of Rakthok's ridge and away from the careful eyes of the dwarves. 
</p><p>The second clan decided to make the grassy fields of the loping plains their home. Even today this clan remains there, looting and plundering any caravans who happen to pass by. 
</p><p>The third, and the largest clan, was lead by a young orc named Gharol. He convinced the majority of the orcs that true riches lied to the fertile lands of the east. There, he said, the orcs would find their new home and the crushbone clan, as he called his followers, would grow strong. 
</p><p>It was at this time, as the crushbone clan started making their way further east around the Wayunder Lake and straight for the Greater Faydark, that the elven lord of Kelethin began to take notice of their advancement. 
</p><p><i>Of the Warrior Edril and the Legion of Wind:</i><br />
The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request was a young soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life in Felwithe, schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy family. Around his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, he admitted himself into the imperial school of soldiery where he impressed his teachers with both his knowledge of military science and his deadly accurate fighting skills. After graduating and performing many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the elves, he was chosen as a personal guard of the emperor at the unprecedented age of 50. What brought him everlasting fame among the elves, however, was not how he excelled in schooling but what he chose to do for Kelethin. Going straight to the emperor himself, Edril asked that he be allowed to lead the attack against the orcs. When the emperor granted his wish, Edril hand picked 100 of the best elven warriors and the best horses, and rode quickly to the woodland kingdom of Kelethin. 
</p><p>He was met at Kelethin with a large reception, but decided to ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two days after arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside the greater Faydark and headed directly for the first orcan encampment. 
</p><p>It was the middle of the night when Edril made his first strike, and the orcs were completely caught off guard. Edril's men rode straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw with little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like a madman, tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping to catch their breath, Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp so as to keep the element of surprise. 
</p><p>One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were destroyed quickly and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second assault on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men moved from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called them the Legion of Wind. 
</p><p>The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol was never able to get word of the new attackers in time to plan a defense and so most of the orcs were slaughtered. 
</p><p>The final battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against Gharol's own camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all of the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth of the wild Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift kingdom. 
</p><p>When Edril returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed high protector of Kelethin with over 150 kills to his name alone. This would not be the last time Edril's name was written into elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers. 
</p><p>Crushbone is the local newbie dungeon for the various races of elves from Greater Faydark. The boss mobs, Emperor Crush and Ambassador Dvinn, were once (and still are to an extent) a staple of in-game discussion and badinage. It is in Crushbone, referred to colloquially as "CB", that many players learn how to code their first hot-key, usually containing the message "Train to Zone!" 
</p><p><b>Dagnor's Cauldron</b> is found off the Butcherblock Mountains in the continent of Faydwer, a blasted lake area that leads to the haunted Estate of Unrest and is the home of Kedge Keep in the lake water, the underwater realm of the last of the Kedge. The lake water has some monsters in it. Above the lake on the barren cliffs, the traveler will find a camp of aqua goblins, snakes, rats, undead, as well as a camp of a hardy band of heroes known as the "Fab Four" that will assist adventurers in need. 
</p><p>A story tells that Grimmly the dwarven king and Dagnor the ogre warlord met each other face to face on the shores of a lake to the south of Lesser Faydark during one of the battles of the orge-dwarven war, and that Grimmly stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity and ferociousness that the weapon shattered into thousands of pieces even as it cut straight through the ogre lord's chest. The story goes on to say that the warlord fell to his death immediately in that same lake and that the evil in his blood made the water boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed the lake Dagnor's Cauldron and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven war was called "the battle of the shattered spear." (History of Norrath, Verant International) 
</p><p>The zone is essentially a large donut-shaped lake with a jagged spire in the center. Dagnor's Cauldron is a teen zone for the various races on Faydwar. An underwater dragon patrols the southern waters, and the entrance to the Estate of Unrest can be found here. The bleak and jagged landscape is unfriendly to visitors, often hiding goblins around the next cliff. 
</p><p><b>Felwithe</b> is the city of the High Elves and is home to the elegant High Elf castle. Here the elven king Tearis Thex holds court. 
</p><p><b>Greater Faydark</b> is the lower end forest zone in Faydwer, and is adjacent to Lesser Faydark, Felwithe, Crushbone, and Butcherblock Mountains. Greater Faydark houses the Wood Elf city of Kelethin, made up of numerous platforms on trees to hold the buildings. Greater Faydark is a zone which allows for levels 1-12 or so to level up off by killing the orcs, bats, rats, spiders and skeletons which roam the zone. After level 12, Crushbone is the logical progression for players seeking to slay higher level orcs. 
</p><p><b>Kaladim</b> is the city of the Dwarves. Kaladim North Kaladim South 
</p><p><b>Kedge Keep</b> is located off of Dagnor's Cauldron where its entrance is underwater. It is wholly an underwater dungeon, the character entering must be able to ensure that he or she can continue to breathe, either by use of a spell, or by an item which allows the player to breathe. Kedge Keep existed in the game for several months before being itemized (ie, no loot on successful battles), so it developed an early stigma of being both a difficult and rewardless zone. 
</p><p><b>Lesser Faydark</b> connects Castle Mistmoore, Steamfront, and Greater Faydark. Lesser Faydark is a mystical forest, home to outlaws, evil, and magical creatures. The forest is home to pixies, faeries, orcs, and evil brownies, as well as the beautiful fae drakes.  The dark elves have managed to establish an outpost here as well, close to their enemies the wood elves and high elves.  The beautiful unicorn Equestrielle makes her home here. There are bandits and a trio of Nybrite sisters gone outlaw, hunted by their irate father.  The vampire Mayong Mistmoore has his castle in this area.  
</p><p>Thistle Underbrush, a wandering brownie patrols the forest to give low-level people trouble. There is also a static brownie location good for soloing along the north-center area. Also the home of various wildlife, pixies, fay drakes, scattered orc outposts and a dark-elf outpost along the south-center section of the map.
</p><p><b>Mistmoore Castle</b> is the castle of the vampire Mayong Mistmoore. At one point revamped into a zone for characters of level 65+ although sunsequently rolled back. At the time of the Depths of Darkhollow Expansion release, this zone was returned to its original state being 30's - 40's. 
</p><p><b>Steamfont</b> is a series of mountain ranges near Ak'Anon, is the newbie/teen zone for the gnomes who are born there.
</p><p>The gnomes have long made their dwellings in the Steamfont Mountains and, although they have not tamed that wild region, have established themselves as a strong force there. They run several large windmills in the mountains, generating power for some as-yet-unrevealed project, and the Observers have set up their observatories in the far reaches of the mountains. 
</p><p>Further afield lies the vast untamed expanse of Lesser Faydark and, hidden within, the lair of the evil vampire Mistmoore. The gnomes have a small presence in this forest, more to protect their communications with the elves and dwarves beyond than to stake a claim within the forest itself.
</p><p>An even more dangerous area exists by the minotaur caves, which you can reach by following a straight line formed by the windmills away from Ak'Anon. There is a rough dead-end valley that the minotaurs have their caves in, between two old furnaces. The ruins of some giant clockwork device have settled deeply into the ground at the end of this valley over the ages since it last functioned. The minotaurs tend to come out of the cave one at a time and stand outside. Once they reach about three outside the cave, they go on patrol. Also, the Minotaur Hero occasionally makes a run towards Ak'Anon, leaving death in his wake.  (EQ Atlas)
</p><p><b>Unrest (The Estate of Unrest)</b> is a haunted mansion and grounds, suitable for teen to midlevel characters. Garanel Rucksif was once the home of a dwarven noble, in ages past who went insane and his ghost still roams the premisis. Following the unholy destruction that created Dagnor's Cauldron and the following takeover of that region by evil creatures, his estate was overrun by the undead, and is now one of the great havens of the unliving in all of Norrath. Some time after the DoN expansion, Unrest became available as an instanced quest zone of variable level.
