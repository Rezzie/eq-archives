"To guild or not to Guild, that is the question?"<br>
</div>
<br>
<i>"Welcome weary traveler, pull up a stool and rest ye a while in the black
Storm tavern. I"ll be your host for the evening. My Karana seems mighty mad
this night by the looks of that raging storm outside, but don"t worry the
roof is strong and so is the ale. Wench! Be sure to stoke that log fire for
our guests. Sorry about that, now then as you are here let me entertain you
with a few words from a well traveled adventurer."</i><br>
<br></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
Before we start let me give you a little insight into who I am. My name is
Blacky. I have been an avid player of MMORPG"s and in particular EverQuest
since its release in February 1999.I remember the ultimate buzz the first
time I logged on and the first time I engaged in Player Versus Player combat.
I have witnessed and been a part of the games evolution, and have actively
researched and studied many issues and changes within the game and the gaming
world.<br>
<br>
One of the big decisions facing many players is should I join a guild and
if so when and which one? <br>
I have had characters in many different guilds, been officers of several
and have created and run two. All of these experiences taught me a lot about
guilds, their benefits and their potential floors.<br>
A fairly recent case study showed that 81.1 percent of Everquest players
do have their characters in a guild.<br>
Also it shows that 7 percent of players are leaders of a guild, and approximately
36 percent or one third of players are officers of a guild. The same study
shows that a higher percentage of female players tend towards leadership
roles within a guild, than male players.<br>
<br>
Before we can answer the question of should I join a guild, we need to look
at several different aspects of the game, and how a guild fits into the world
of Norrath.<br>
A guild typically is a group of like minded or similar goal orientated players
that decide to form an alliance to help farther their Everquest career.<br>
In the very early days, when Role playing was much more an active part of
the game, many guilds were formed out of racial or ethical bonds. I remember
when dark race guilds would actively guild war with light race guilds, and
all was done in the name of role playing and gaming flavor. Things have changed
a great deal since then, and now the creation of guilds seems to be inspired
by very different desires.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Guild Classifications</b><br>
<br>
There are really three categories a guild can fall under. A role playing
guild (which as mentioned is a dying breed), a family guild or a raiding
guild.<br>
With this being said, it is also important to look at the different role
a guild can play on differing server types. Player Verses Player or PVP servers
offer additional reasons why one would want to join a guild. The number one
differing factor is safety from hostile PVP players. Larger groups offer
more security than small groups or solitary characters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>ROLE PLAYING GUILDS</b><br>
<br>
As previously stated, a role playing guild will rise in the world of Norrath
out of several players deciding to align themselves together with a role
playing theme.<br>
For example, a group of human and high elf characters create a guild and
name it "The order of light". The guild forms an ethos of being brave and
true and honorable, and dedicated to the defense of the land and the destruction
of evil. They will role play their characters when they interact with other
players, and attempt to seek out similar guilds to interact with. For many
this can be a very enjoyable way to play Everquest.<br>
This type of guild will suite the die hard role players and social addicts
that play for the interaction not to beat the game.<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Will role play, after all Everquest is a mass multiplayer ROLE PLAYING
game.</li>
  <li>Will be very friendly and closed nit, with good character interaction.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Cons:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Will most likely be a small guild.</li>
  <li>Less likely to be able to tackle much of the high end game.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><br>
FAMILY GUILDS</b><br>
The next classification is the family guild. This guild is born when a group
of friendly players who love to group and play together form a guild with
the interest of having other players to group and interact with. Through
the guild, players get to know other players more in-depth and form a bond
of trust with these players. When they log in, it is easier to find people
to group with, and it also makes going to the higher level and more challenging
zones far more possible. Typically these guilds hold together well and the
Everquest experience is enhanced through greater degrees of player interaction
and friendship, while providing outlets for opening your character up to
more exploration and greater achievement.<br>
This type of guild will suit the average Everquest player, and is a good
social outlet, while having the ability open to you to progress your character
fairly well.<br>
<br>
Pros: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Will most likely have a fairly large member base.</li>
  <li>Will be a good social guild.</li>
  <li>Will be strong enough to tackle much of the high end game and help
you progress.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Cons:<br>
<ul>
  <li>May not be able to tackle the top tier of the game well.</li>
  <li>Will most likely not role play.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>RAIDING GUILDS</b><br>
<br>
Finally we have the raiding guild. These guilds are usually formed after
players have experience a higher level end of the game and are made to ensure
grouping in large enough numbers to take on the higher end game, and achieve
some of the more demanding goals or to acquiring some of the better items
available within the game.<br>
This type of guild is often referred to as an "uber guild" and will suit
hardcore players who want to tackle the top end game and gain top tier loot
and items.<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Will most likely be able to tackle almost every mob or zone in the
game.</li>
  <li>Will offer the best chance of gaining top tier items and equipment.</li>
  <li>Will do a large number of raids.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Cons:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Will most likely not be so socially active.</li>
  <li>Will almost certainly not role play.</li>
  <li>Will have a rigid recruiting and playing policy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Of course some guilds can be an amalgamation of the three, and change and
evolve as the players within the guild become enthused with different goals
or wish to explore a different path or style of play.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>How should I select a guild that is right for me?</b><br>
<br>
When you are looking to join a guild there are certain things to consider.
First and foremost what kind of guild do you want to be in, and what do you
hope to gain or contribute to a guild?<br>
Most role playing guilds will be smaller, and will spend a lot of their time
just enjoying the flavor of the game, so if you want to be able to go on
lots of exciting raids this is probably not the best fit for you. On the
other hand, many raiding guilds can also be time demanding, so do you have
long enough play periods to seriously contribute to an active raiding guild?<br>
Next I would try to find out what the guilds reputation is. Ask players if
they know about the guild, and try to find out how long it has been active.
A long standing guild that has stood the test of time, most likely has good
leadership and a strong member base.<br>
Next try to group with some members of the guild in a casual environment,
and ask a few questions. What do you like about your guild? How long have
you been a member? What are its rules or guidelines? And finally what are
its new member requirements?<br>
&nbsp;Next try to speak to a guild officer or the leader, and find out how
to go about joining. Also see if you feel you can fit into their guild ethos
and structure.<br>
Another good point to mention is what time zone is the core of their members
in.<br>
For example, if you are in England and under Greenwich Mean Time, you may
not find many players online if (for the most) part the guilds players are
in the United States and on Eastern Standard Time. A seven hour time difference
can cause problems.<br>
One very important factor to remember is not what can my guild do for me,
but what can I do for my guild. <br>
Although the main reason for most players to join a guild is to benefit their
character, and enhance their enjoyment of the game, a good guild will soon
lose interest in helping you if all you seem to do is leach from the guild.
Remember to participate for the growth of other players too. As characters
within the guild become better equipped and more powerful, the guild will
be able to move on to bigger and better things, and tackle tougher mobs and
zones.<br>
With all three guild types there are some things to be aware of. Many guilds
are ruined by cumbersome or unnecessary politics and lose sight of why we
play. After all Everquest is a game, and most players play for fun. Some
players seem to lose sight of that, and it"s not uncommon to come across
a guild that demands time commitments from its members.<br>
It may have level restrictions, probationary periods and rules to govern
how you play your game.<br>
Many of these guide lines need to exist for them to have the guild operate
the way they want it to, but be aware of it and if you can not live up to
the guilds stringent rules set save your time and theirs by not joining.<br>
Make sure you put into a guild what you expect to get out of it, and above
all enjoy the benefits of belonging to a good guild.<br>
<br>
<b>What if I want to solo?</b><br>
<br>
As you can see, there are many advantages to joining a guild, however many
players (especially at lower levels) feel like they want to solo more or
try to carve their own unique niche into Norrathian society.<br>
If you are thinking of going this route, at least in the beginning there
are a few factors to consider when creating your character. Firstly not all
race and class combinations are created equal, and some favor solo play more
than others.<br>
Anyone reading this that has played a warrior and a druid will most certainly
agree that you can solo far better as the druid.<br>
In general the best classes for soloing are going to be Necromancers, Druids
or Bards.<br>
That"s not to say other classes can not solo, but the aforementioned classes
are better equipped to do it without long periods of downtime, due to manna
burn out or hit point loss.<br>
As you gain in levels, soloing becomes more difficult and at the higher end
of the game, it is almost impossible to progress well if at all trying to
solo with certain classes such as a warrior.<br>
This is no way an attempt at discrediting the less solo equipped classes,
as in a group strong tanks and clerics are a must. It just merely points
out that if you are looking to go the solo route then maybe a Cleric or warrior
too name but two classes, is not the way to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Finishing statement</b><br>
<br>
To finalize this topic I would just like to recommend that at the very least
a player should join a guild at some point in his life. Everquest has evolved
to a state that without a good guild you will miss out on much of the high
end game, and some of its more rewarding aspects.<br>
Everquest was designed to be a group promoting game and is engineered towards
that end. Grouping is more lucrative than solo play, and therefore as guilds
offer better grouping potential to a player it makes perfect cense that it
is to your benefit to join one.<br>
Of course there is also the exciting avenue of starting your own guild, but
I think we will leave that for another time.<br>
