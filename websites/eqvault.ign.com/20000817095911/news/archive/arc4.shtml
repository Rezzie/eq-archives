However we were able to impress upon the programmer that it didn't make much sense with poison, so he wrote the code. Once the code was there, we figured, "what the heck", and applied it to HT and LoH at the same time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065093.html"><b>Hacked Accounts</b></a><br>Hacked account issues are virtually impossible to handle through email, but you can give it a shot via our customer-service email at <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>. <br><br>You could also choose to make a toll call to 858-537-0898. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065086.html"><b>Pumice Stone Compromise</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As I understand it, Verant had always intended pumice to be used as a defensive item. The flawed attempt at returning the item to this purpose (adding a casting time) has made the new stones all but useless. <br><br>To make the new stones useful for defensive means but keep them from becoming offensive items again (stripping buffs on the target), I propose creating a new spell based on the nullify magic spell, but with an instantaneous casting time and the valid target being set to self only (or possibly party only). Change the new pumice stones to use this spell via an item patch, as was done with the Shrink potion. <br><br>Would this be considered as an option?]</i></font><br><br>Funny that you should mention this.

However we'd have to be espicially careful that enchanters were supplied with similar abilities. While enchantments of a permanent nature, applied via jewelry or through tradeskills with the use of the "thicken mana" series, I think that "blessing" would have to be more of a temporary thing. <br><br>We *could* do blessings of a more permanent nature, less powerful than through enchantments, if we limited the product to someone of the same deity as the cleric. <br><br>This is all "wishlist" stuff right now, but we appreciate the ideas.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064914.html"><b>Problem With Warrior Disciplins</b></a><br>Disciplins are controlled server-side, so even in a situation where latency exists, the discipline runs for the full duration on the server. The only situation where a problem would occur is if there was a server-side problem not linked to network latency, such as where everything stops attacking for a period of time.

Ok, so it may have been inspired by<br>another store, Brimstone's Guildware, but I think that the more stores<br>selling merchandise like this, the better.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I received the following from Ignitz:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings fellow Norrathians of the Tribunal Server. My name is Ignitz <br>Gemcaller, and I am the guildmaster of the Heroes of Valor. It is my distinct <br>pleasure to announce to you today the start of a month long events sweep. <br>That's right, once a week for the entire month of August the HoV will be <br>holding an event, and there promises to be something for all walks of the <br>Norrathian Life to enjoy.<br><br>  The first event, I am proud to say, is the first of it's kind (as far as I <br>know). Once I read of an event where a guild held a gnome race across the <br>world. Well, today I announce a dwarf race of the same nature, except that it <br>is across all the known zones of Faydwer with the notable exception of Kedge <br>Keep. That's right, all participants will create newbie dwarves and traverse <br>Faydwer, to include Unrest, Butcherblock, and Mistmoore Castle. As well, we <br>are raffling off a full set of Crafted Armor for some lucky adventurer to <br>win. This is just the beginning, and it promises to be a fun filled month. So <br>without further ado, I will proceed to lay out the details of our first event.<br> <br>What:  Crafted Raffle<br>Where: Greater Faydark at the Wizard Spires<br>When:  After the Naked Newbie Dwarf Race (see below)<br>Rules: As of now you may log on to the Tribunal Server and begin purchasing <br>raffle tickets for a full set of Crafted Armor for warriors. The price is 5pp <br>a ticket and you may purchase as many as you want. Any HoV member will take <br>your order so long as you go to them and pay for the tickets. They will take <br>your name down and list how many tickets you bought, then relay that <br>information back to me. The next day you may ask me (Ignitz) what numbers you <br>have if you wish to know. The winner will be chosen at random using the <br>ingame random number generator. In the event that the winner is not present <br>to receive his/her prize then the set will be held until the winner can come <br>collect. Proceeds from the raffle will go to support more raffles like this. <br>Good luck to all who wish to participate.<br><br>What:  Naked Newbie Dwarf Race across Faydwer<br>Where: Kaladim near the Paladin's guild<br>When:  Friday, August 4th at 7pm CST sharp!<br>Rules: Registration will begin at 5pm CST near the entrace to Butcherblock <br>Mtns in Kaladim. All participants must register as the character they wish to <br>receive the prizes should they win. When creating the newbie dwarf you must <br>use Hov as the first three letters and the name of the character who <br>registered as the rest. (IE. Ignitz = Hovignitz).<br> To make things more interesting and to add an element of strategy to he race <br>the following rules are made:<br>  1. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins will start at 7pm on the dot with no <br>penalty to their start time.<br>  2. Clerics will start at 7:01. This is to illustrate that they have a <br>little bit better chance of surviving the race without much difficulty due to <br>the spells that they start with.<br>  3. Clerics may choose to accept the spell Divine Aura in order to give them <br>an even better chance of survival, but doing so will cause you to start at <br>7:02.<br>  4. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race with the <br>spell Skin Like Diamond cast upon them. Doing so however means they will <br>begin the race at 7:04.<br>  5. Clerics may also begin with Skin Like Diamond with a start time of 7:05.<br>  6. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race with Spirit <br>of Wolf cast upon them with a start time of 7:09.<br>  7. Clerics can start with Spirit of Wolf at a start time of 7:10.<br> <br>The race course is laid out as follow:<br>  1. Kaladim near the Paladin's Guild to Butcherblock Mtns.<br>  2. BB Mtns to Dagnor's Cauldren.<br>  3. Dagnor's Cauldren to Unrest.<br>  4. Once in Unrest you must make your way to the back of the zone, near the <br>backdoor of the mansion, and /poke the HoV member that will be stationed <br>there. Once that is done you may make your way back out.<br>  5. Unrest to Greater Faydark.<br>  6. Greater Faydark to Crushbone.<br>  7. Once in Crushbone you must make your way to the area behind the castle <br>and find the HoV member that is there and /poke them. You may then make your <br>way back out.<br>  8. Crushbone to Felwithe.<br>  9. Once in Felwithe, you must find the HoV member hidden within the city. <br>Once you have found them, /poke them then you may make your way back out.<br> 10. Felwithe to Lesser Faydark.<br> 11. Lesser Faydark to Mistmoore Castle.<br> 12. Once you are in Mistmoore, make your way to the other side of the lake <br>at the bottom of the entrance ramp and /poke the HoV members that will be <br>waiting there. You know the drill :)<br> 13. Mistmoore Castle to Steamfont Mtns.<br> 14. Steamfont Mtns to Ak'Anon.<br> 15. Once in Ak'Anon you must find me (Ignitz). The first four people to <br>/poke me are the winners of the race.<br> There will be HoV members in all the zones mentioned and upon entering each <br>zone for the first time you must /shout "Naked Newbie Dwarf Race!". This is <br>to prevent people from shortcutting. The winners will be not only the first <br>four people to /poke me but will also be the first four people to have <br>/shout'ed in all the zones and /poke me. If you forget to /shout the phrase <br>but manage to be one of first four participants to /poke me, I am afraid that <br>I will not be able to reward you on the grounds of not knowing if you <br>actually went through all the zones (non-negotionable).<br><br>Prizes: 1st place: 500pp and 10 tickets to the Crafted Raffle<br>        2nd place: 250pp and 5 tickets <br>        3rd place: 150pp and 3 tickets<br>        4th place: 100pp and 1 ticket<br><br>The prizes will be given to the character who registered the winning dwarf at <br>the Wizard Spires in Greater Faydark, where we will also be holding the <br>Crafted Raffle to take place immediately after the last participant finishes <br>the race.<br><br>Good luck to all participants in both events. Questions, Comments, and <br>Concerns can be addresses by emailing me at <a href="mailto:moontayle@hotmail.com">moontayle@hotmail.com</a><br>'May Valor be your Virtue'</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Here's part one of today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064692-2.html"><b>Fixing the Shaman Pet</b></a><br>Guys, the wolf is meant to be more of a companion than a pet. It's certainly not meant to be a major factor of how the class stacks up from a balance perspective. Shaman pets will never be near mage or necro pets in power. <br><br>I'll look into the mana requirement, but pet strength sounds proper.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064707-3.html"><b>"The Trend"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What's the deal? I grew up in a household where "No" from an authority figure was pretty much the end of the discussion. Am I the only one left who comprehends the meaning of "No"? Why are you guys wasting your energy on these dead issues? Wouldn't you be better off focusing your efforts on things that haven't already been shot down by Verant?]</i></font><br> <br>Part of the problem might be that we don't actually say "No." as it's construed to be impolite. We'd much rather say that "we have no plans at present..." or that "we'd like to do it at some point but..." The fact is, the answer itself is very *rarely* a solid "No." It's more often a soft-maybe with strong tendencies towards No. Perhaps we should use "No" more often :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064837.html"><b>Moving Characters to Morell-Thule?</b></a><br>Well we had moved all of those Test people there before someone realized that MT was still in the "race" (the period before the server matures where being 'first' at various things is enjoyed by the players). We moved them off, so my first indication would be that the guy came from Test and we missed him when moving them back out. <br><br>So no, to answer your question, Morrell is not a split server and we aren't performing character-moves as a matter of course. I'll be happy to look into the issue; Do you have the character's name?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064084.html"><b>Miller's Spawn Rate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said the militia guards were changed from 6 minute spawns to 15 minute spawns in order to allow dungeon grouping to be a viable alternative, so shouldn't the same apply to the Millers?]</i></font> <br><br>They were originally set this low since they are quest NPCs. Of course, since I'm in a "replying to nerf requests" mood today, I'll talk to the guys about either making the Millers a lot tougher, or increasing their spawn time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059903.html"><b>Alchemy</b></a><br>Alchemy is a skill that we want to see financed by dealing with players, not NPCs, which is why NPCs have little use for the fruits of the effort. It's kind of the same situation as with fine-steel, which no one buys off of merchants since they charge so much for it. <br><br>It's one of those things in game to encourage people to deal with each other.</UL>

One of wich was a pet rampage that completely <br>cleared the PvP Area during the dueling competition.  This resulted in most <br>rogues 25-32 leaving before competiting.  The event was set back, the gm <br>arrived, and LoS was asked to leave the PvP area before it went on.  <br>Afterwards it was discussed but the overall reaction of the guild can be <br>summed up by with a total lack of respect for the event in general.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon made a lengthy post on PvP rules on the Gameplay Board a short time ago.  He also asks for thoughts and comments so don't hesitate to speak.  Here's the complete post<UL><i>Before I get into the subject of this post, let me define the rulesets in play on each of the PvP servers:<br><br>Rallos: Complete PvP. Players can attack any other player within a 4 level limit. Looting is coin plus one item, providing that the item isn't bagged, NODROP, or carried in a melee slot. There are no faction penalties for engaging in PvP combat.<br><br>Tallon/Vallon: PvP Teams. Players can attack any other player within an 8 level limit, assuming that the target is on one of the 3 opposing teams. Looting is coin-only. There *are* faction penalties for engaging in PvP combat.<br><br>As many here have noticed, there have been drives for each of the PvP servers, most recently Rallos, to get the server switched to coin-only loot. However, though the same drive once existed for Vallon, after the change was made, there was likewise a drive to switch it back to item-loot. This suggests that while there are people who enjoy coin-only loot, there are also people who enjoy item-loot. The difficulty that we are faced with is trying to make everyone happy. Simply implementing majority will on each server doesn't accomplish that objective, as it addresses the needs of the pro-coin crowd without taking care of the pro-loot crowd. As much as both groups come here insisting that "everyone" wants what they want, I don't think that anyone can truly deny that both groups exist.<br><br>Right now, we have two servers where coin-loot is in operation, and one where item-loot is the rule. That layout is roughly equivalent to the percentages that enjoy coin-loot versus item loot. The third who enjoy item loot, though technically the minority, are still a significant portion of the gaming populace, and as such should have their concerns addressed as well. Rather than just changing Rallos to coin-loot, it's been suggested that we allow people a one-time chance to move between the PvP servers. Though we are not yet prepared to commit to a plan of that nature, I do want to get everyone's opinion as to whether or not they would find such a plan acceptable. <br><br>If we were to allow moves, a two-step process would be used. First, Rallos people would be given the option to move to Vallon or Tallon (by choice), then Vallon and Tallon people would be given the opportunity to move to Rallos. If moved, players would suddenly find themselves in a new ruleset, subject to every facet of that ruleset. <br><br>Former Rallos players would find themselves on teams, in an environment that discourages socialization outside of your team. They would suddenly be subject to attack in an 8 level limit, and would take race-based faction hits for any PvP kills made. Players with strange deity selections (e.g. Half elf worshipping Innoruuk) would suddenly find themselves homeless for all intents and purposes. <br><br>Former team-server players moving to Rallos would have their ability to engage in combat restricted to a 4 level limit, and be subject to attack and able to attack anyone in that range. Any race-based faction penalties assigned while on the Team servers would follow to Rallos, and would not be reset.<br><br>Players on all PvP servers would encounter an influx of characters of all levels, who wouldn't be completely familiar with any server-specific player-originated rules of etiquette that may be in place. It is possible that aspects once understood as a "given" within the server community might break down and be no more. <br><br>It may sound like I'm trying to discourage acquiescence to this change, however I just want to be sure that all aspects of the proposal are understood prior to anyone giving an opinion on the matter. If done, the change would likely be the biggest to be made to any server community in EverQuest, and we want to be sure that everyone is well-informed.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064872.html">posted the following on the Gameplay Board</a> about the new item reimbursement policy:<UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>I'm sure that most everyone is aware of the new item-reimbursement policy for loss due to bugs. For those that aren't, here's a quick recap:<br><br>Our intention is to handle all claims in a timely manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation. Our customers diserve courteous and prompt service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.<br><br>One thing that we should have made clear in the announcement is that unfortunately, this policy is not retroactive, meaning that those who experienced loss prior to the time that the policy was announced (7/18/2000) would not be covered by the new policy. <br><br>As mentioned above, we do need to perform due diligence when investigating the claims, and though we will make reimbursements any time that we lack proof of any misconduct, we still need to have that information (backups, logs, etc.) present to perform the search. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

A new event announcement was sent my way by Dahija:<BLOCKQUOTE>Attention all Luclin citizens: <br><br>On this past Sunday night, a trade fair was held in NK at the wooden bridge, hosted by the Order of the Midnight Sun guild members. Many attended, and due to the encouragement of the people of Luclin, Order of the Midnight Sun presents, KaranaFest: A Gathering at the Bridge. It is to be at the Wooden Bridge in NK rain or shine, 10pm EST to Midnight EST, to trade, drink, and to bring together the people who cannot attend the already established trade in the Tunnel on Saturday afternoons. <br><br>Please feel free to raid your bank(s), and bring all items, no matter how low level they are, for there were many newbies present on Sunday and many more are expected. Since it is difficult for all to bind in NK, dueling will be conducted at the Arena, a pleasant walk from the bridge, after most of the trading has been completed. <br><br>Thank you, and hope to see you all there, <br><br>Dahija<br>Order of the Midnight Sun<br>Warrior, Luclin</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Morgian sends the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings again my friends!<br><br>As some of you may remember a couple weeks ago a group of us participated in<br>a thread on the EQ Gameplay forum that discussed Verant putting up a<br>Role-play server.  The thread is locked now, but if you would like to engage<br>in reading a long but well done thread here's the link:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html</a><br><br>Abashi was kind enough to respond to the thread and shot the idea down, but<br>what he responded to was not what we were asking for so that generated<br>another thread where we posted exactly what we wanted.  Our thoughts are to<br>only ask for a server designated as being role-playing (much the same way as<br>they have done for the PvP servers except they would be no code additions or<br>deletions).  The players would do the rest.  We really don't think this is a<br>lot to ask for and we feel it can only have a positive affect of EQ.  I<br>won't go into the entire thread here, but if you wish to read the thread and<br>show your support then take the link below:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html</a><br><br>We're not asking for more skills, items, spells, or anything else that would<br>affect the game balance. Time and time again we've jumped from server to<br>server claiming it for role-playing but we've become to spread out and more<br>of the minority on all the servers then we ever were before.  All we want is<br>a clear cut home for role-players.  We really don't think that's a lot to<br>ask.<br><br>An in game poll is a suggestion we have also that would let Verant get an<br>idea of how many players would be interested.<br><br>Thanks again for your time and safe travels my friends.<br><br>Morgian Cessair</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon made quite a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the full scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064461.html"><b>More Rallos Zek Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is NO WAY AT ALL that this can be implemented! The gankers just die, then come back again and again. They get an item then either bag or bank it. There's no way at all to "outlaw" the practice.]</i></font> <br><br>You can start. Refuse to take them on plane runs. Spread their name across the server. Don't socialize with them. Refuse to trade with them. Turn them into social Pariahs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Secondly, you mention that the POD can only control one flag and that flag is already set for all Rallos players. Then PLEASE tell me why the POD is even there? He serves no purpose whatsoever.]</i></font> <br><br>You are correct, he serves no purpose on Rallos Zek. NPC spawns are not configured on a per-server basis. It wouldn't make much sense for us to maintain 34 different sets of spawn data to cover each server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You yourself know that programmers can do anything and everything with the code. So, the POD can be changed to control other flags.It's that simple.]</i></font> <br><br>It's not that simple. Sure, a programmer can do anything. However doing it in a reasonable amount of time without affecting anything else isn't always possible, nor in the best interest of the game. In this case, there is no "other flags". Creating "other flags" would require a pwipe. Creating "other flags" without a pwipe would require more time than is feasible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064451.html"><b>How much do un-nerfed Pumice Stones go for?</b></a><br>I doubt that the change has been in long enough for a stable market to form. It's pretty likely that when we missed a few vendors the first time that we were trying to implement the change that people rushed out and bought tons of the things. In any case, I'm pretty sure that the value will be severely limited due to the fact that it is still a 5 charge item. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064452.html"><b>What's the scoop on today's Tuning Meeting?</b></a><br>Hasn't happened yet :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064446.html"><b>Karana Still Overpopulated</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any chance of getting another split to TT off Karana?]</i></font> <br><br>At this point that wouldn't be fruitful. We've already split them off a second time, leaving /movelog registration open for 24 hours, and only 169 accounts chose to move. It appears that everyone, or most everyone, on Karana at this point wants to be there. <br><br>If we were going to take another group, it would probably be from one of the other servers, but nothing along those lines is planned at present. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064423.html"><b>Monk Posts on Gameplay Board</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Good lord 17 monk posts on page 1?]</i></font> <br><br>That's interesting. For the past several months, monk posts haven't been out of the ordinary in number. It sounds as if this "drive" is being organized from an external source. I guess I'll take this opportunity to mention again that attempting to monopolize the front page with a specific issue will just lead to the posts being closed. <br><br>I haven't read any of the posts yet, but my guess is that they make note of specific issues relative to monks. Things such as "Thunderous Kick is too weak", "Flying kick should have some minimum damage", "Shiverback armor is low in AC", "Our Kunark armor isn't very good", etc. <br><br>While those might be good and accurate observations about some specific issues, stepping back and taking the entire class, even with its faults (which every class must have), leads to the inevitable conclusion that monks still rock despite their faults. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064442.html"><b>Monks Lose Power Post 50</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The gap, apparently, closes GREATLY.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, the gap closes. Monks go up. Warriors and Rogues go up faster. No one "loses" relative power. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How can you keep calling monks the best toe to toe fighters? Perhaps pre 51 this was true, as we had a huge bonus in skill over other classes. But now that you've made Warriors and Rogues *nearly* equal in skill to Monks AND given them triple attack and double backstab ... there is NO way monks are still the best toe to toe melee damage.]</i></font> <br><br>Backstab is not a "toe-to-toe" situation. Yes, monks still do more damage in a toe-to-toe situation over a given timeframe than the other melee classes. Not as much as they used to, but they still do more than the others given appropriate equipment. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064416.html"><b>Invis Bug?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was invis in CB throne room looking to see how full room was so that I would not start train. Since when can Orc Lego's see invis? I was standing there looking at them when one somehow saw me and attacked. I still had the "invis" icon on my screen and had just casted at steps to castle.

Catalyst sends word that <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo has been updated</a> over on EverLore.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Ok I have been playing EQ for about a year now and I love the game, but I have noticed something that i find very mundain and that is the attacking of the characters, have you every seen a karate chop Batman .. add a sword and **POFF** you have an EQ character (exculding the Monk class).<br><br>So my question is is there any plans to introduce new weapon attacks for the characters, there is nothing I would rather do than as a vile creature is running from me than to hit a hot key and trust my sword into the creatures back or slash at him or any thing besides CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP "yawn" . Just an idea or thought I had while watching my character CHOP at his target... ( excluding some small special attacks from the rouge "backstab" monk "kick" "tiger punch" ect.. ) I hope you can understand what I am asking, it does not have to be more damage just differnt motion of the characters. Thanks for you time :) <br><br> Milo Says: <b><i><br>I sympathize with you, but I'm not aware that there are any plans to make character animation more diverse. I don't think that we have the manpower for that, any more than we have the manpower to create more character models of unique build than I am able to construct. Rick Schmitz is our only animator, and unfortunately, his plate is full of more crucial work.</b></i></UL>Thanks!

I was sent the following report by Aaeandar:<BLOCKQUOTE>The masses gathered in the confines of the Wizard Portal in the Greater Faydark, the Land of Tunare's beloved.  They gathered together to unify and take our the minions of Innoruuk, and if possible, Innoruuk himself.  Members from Hamunaptra, Pax Tharax, In Virtue, Sixteenth Notes, Iron Legions, Coveit Emptor, and Circle of the Unseen, and set out as the sunset in greater faydark.<br> <br>The masses stealthfully moved into position and prepared for the long insuing battle.  For what seemed like days the warriors slowly but surely began to eliminate Innoruuk's minions, building by dreaded building.  Only suffering minor casualties in the process.  Then it came time to pull the dark lord's Maestro of Rancor from his dark pulpit at the heart of his pipe organ.  <br> <br>The Evil best tried its hardest, but even it knew that it had met its match.  The victory was ours, and again, we had only suffered minor casualties in the process.  We cleared the path to the Rancor's chamber and set up the last camp until we would attempt the Dark Lord Innoruuk himself.  But, would he even show his face after the beating we had issued to his lower minors, and beloved Maestro?  Only time would tell.<br> <br>As the lower extremities of Innoruuk's plane of hate were gutted and destroyed, we began to to destroy the Ashenbone Drakes.  The Drakes would fall in quick order, and then it came time to see if the Dark Lord was there to face the onslaught of warrior bent on his very destruction.<br> <br>As we moved our way up to his chamber we destroyed the last of his minions only to find that the coward of a god did not even both to defend himself and his own home.  We rejoiced at the victory, all had been slain at our feet.  Rare items distributed, and crusted blood on our weapons.  Soon, we will return for the Dark Lord himself, and then it will be his day of reckoning.... soon.<br> <br>OOC - <br> <br>Once again I'd like to thank the following people for organizing this raid, Oppression did a fine job in keeping things organized.  Diggle and his brave band of monks did more than sacrifice themselves to pull the mobs safely and with excellent precision.  Although we did suffer some casualties and 2 near full group deaths, we pulled of the corpse recoveries without a hitch and didnt lose even a step in getting back on track.  We destroyed the entire static spawn with 2 hours to spare until the respawn, and (to say it quite appropriately) we OWNED the Maestro.  The raid itself took roughly 10 and a half hours to complete, and for a Plane Raid was an outstanding success considering it was the server's first raid on the Plane of Hate.  Admittedly we were a bit disappointed that Innoruuk wasnt up, but nonetheless it was a very enjoyable experience.<br>I would also like to ammend my previous post about the Nagafen Raid we had a few weeks back, and add that Iron Legions was also present for the raid.  My apologies to Ekelhaft who also did a fine job as the main and secondary assist in this raid.<br>All and all, I'd like to thank those that came, and I'd like to thank those who invited me to come along.  This was incredibly fun, and very well organized.<br> <br>- Aaeandar "Bard of Doom" Vie (Pax Tharax) 46th Level Bard<br> <br>ATTACHED -  Screenshots of the Maestro and the Ashenbone Drake<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/rancor.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/rancor2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for the report!

Here's the latest quotes from Gordon Wrinn that he posted on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063887.html"><b>Rallos Zek</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why wont you answer rallos?]</i></font> <br><br>I have, many times. It's just not the answer that people want to hear. We've no plans to change loot rules on Rallos at this time, nor do we plan on allowing any moves in regards to Rallos. I'm sorry, but there's really only so many ways that I can address this, and each time has lead to a flame-o-thon on the boards. I'd prefer to stay away from the threads for the time being. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You all put up alternate servers and are doing splits like crazy.]</i></font> <br><br>I've seen people recommend that we should put up another server with Rallos rules, sans item loot, and do a split, however the number of people playing on Rallos wouldn't make that an economically feasible course of action. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It was supposed to be the most real roleplay server. Now it has turned into an ebay-athon, and you allow the two new pvp servers to go coin only and stop the insane lack of roleplay which comes from a broken pvp system where a melee class is outclassed by ANY caster at ANY level over 12.]</i></font> <br><br>If it has turned into "naked item gank" server as so many say, does that mean that a majority of people are engaging in that behavior? If not, why is it that people who are against this don't socially isolate the people who are acting like this? I see posts here every day from people who want it one way or the other. I saw people on Vallon complaining as loudly for coin-only loot as people on Rallos. We made the change, and then people from Vallon complained just as loudly for item-loot. <br><br>As of now, we've switched two servers to coin-only loot, which is the majority of the PvP servers out there. While we do want to please the majority and believe that they should have some say, we need to keep in mind the wishes of the minority. The minority here is significant. <br><br>The 4 level limit on Rallos makes item-loot much more viable on that server than it was on the team servers with their 8 level limit. I recommend that if the majority on Rallos truly detests "naked ganking", that you come together as a community and outlaw the practice through social action.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063886.html"><b>More on Bows</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is a problem, but what about the rest of the post, and the blocking of arrows by PC's? This I believe is the largest concern, as I said the other was but a minor suggestion. Are there any reforms to deal with this problem being discussed? Or is this not an option / concern at this point? Any clairification is appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>Projectiles are designed to be blocked by obstacles. The same issue occurs with "bolt" type spells. So to answer your question, it is not something that we consider a problem, but rather the way it was designed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063884.html"><b>Question about the Item Dropbox</b></a><br>While the commands that we finally implement won't be as verbose as you request, we have looked at the requests of people and will probably make them more verbose than was originally announced. I'll refrain from commenting further on it until we've nailed down the technical issues and are ready to implement it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063880.html"><b>Why aren't there custom text colors?</b></a><br>It's a suggestion that's been made frequently, and is something that we'd love to do at some point, however the "problem" at hand keeps getting more and more complex. When EQ was first launched there were only a few different types of "messages" that were displayed in the Chat window. Since then we've added a lot of different things due to player request, such as loot messages, taunt messages, we're about to add item drop messages, NPCs are now doing different things, and the list keeps growing. <br><br>Our ability to implement color selections for all of those different types of messages in the client is wanning. It is however something that we will definitely keep in mind.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063878.html"><b>Melee Classes Getting Pets?!</b></a><br>As the melee classes as a whole are balanced, certainly in terms of damage output, a pet wouldn't be appropriate in this case.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063883.html"><b>/Consent Changes</b></a><br>As I mentioned in a few other messages, there were technical and other considerations involved in the decision to get rid of looting. Truth be told, given the short term indications following the change, the immense load off of the GMs due to corpse scaming, we probably don't want to go down the road again. <br><br>Even with seperate commands, many of the corpse scamming issues surrounded people being scamed in to giving consent in the first place. Those issues would still remain if we opened back up corpse looting. Though I do understand that it might be a difficult change for some to accept so soon after it's been made, experience has shown that the number of times players want others to loot their corpse rather than drag it is *very* small. So small in fact that it's not worth the risk to reenable it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063879.html"><b>"Play a Bard and see how bad they are!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am sick and tired of seeing that every gm in a zone is a DE necro, or a SK or somesort. Obviously they know that bards have a disadvantage and are not "good enough" to play]</i></font> <br><br>There are quite a few GMs who have bards as their GM character, but it really doesn't matter since the GMs don't play their characters. <br><br>That said, bards certainly aren't "bad". They are loved by groups which is right where their area of expertise is supposed to be. I have received word of a few songs that might be having problems right now, not working as intended, but those shortcomings are only ancillary to the entire scope of the bard.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050749-3.html"><b>PVP Thread</b></a><br>With the proliferation of posts like this, I thought I'd stop by and recommend that you rephrase your post in a new thread, sans insults, and I might take a stab at it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063568.html"><b>The VAK'ers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi only answers VAKs]</i></font> <br><br>Hmmm, several months ago the posts read, "Abashi only answers flames." I must be making progress. <br><br>It does disturb me to see that anyone who posts something positive here is labled a VAK, or even worse, accused of being "planted". Seriously, it doesn't even have to be a "positive" post, just one that's written in a courteous manner and they get flamed. It's so bad that I've received hundreds of emails that say something along the lines of, "I don't want to post this on gameplay and get flamed....but..." <br><br>But back to the subject, if you want to know what type of posts I look for, it's the courteous, well-written ones on subjects that I haven't addressed in a while. I also gravitate towards those *posters* who have always written in a courteous and respectful manner, even if they've been in disagreement. And of course, by the same token, I typically avoid posts by people who generally flame and only get courteous when they have an issue that is important to *them* that they need addressed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063808.html"><b>Mage Utility Improvement Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Proposal: summoned bags turn into permanent, non-weight reducing, NODROP bags upon camp/LD.]</i></font> <br><br>That's an interesting suggestion. I know that we'd have some technical issues with it, but they might not be insurmountable. I think that we'd just have to be certain that there is nothing to gain by going linkdead. <br><br>I really don't like the idea of injecting risk via out-of-game random chance either. I'll talk to the team about it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063872.html"><b>Problem with Bows</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: One minor problem, and it is minor, but a slight decrease in delay times for bows globally would help to increase the use of bows as well, and add a whole new facet to gameplay without, in my opinion, unbalancing it.]</i></font> <br><br>We wouldn't be able to do an across-the-board lowering of bow delays due to the amount that it would increase damage output over a large time model. However, we are looking into negating the delay in the event that you are too close or too far away when you activate the bow. This would allow you to correct the situation and fire again immediatly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063875.html"><b>Belt of River Nerfed?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was just finishing off a Spectre in Feerott and out of nowhere Roror started attacking me. I'm a Halfling cleric who has never hunted in Cazic Thule so I couldn't have messed up any factions. This Lizard can kill a well armored and fully buffed lvl 42 cleric in about 5 seconds. I thought about this and am wondering if he hates everyone after the patch how in the world are you supposed to do the quest? He should at least not be Kos to Haflings!]</i></font><br><br> The lizardmen outside Cazic Thule were all attached to the wrong faction (Faction "LizardMan"). They were supposed to be aligned with the "good" (relatively) lizards inside the temple. Due to the potential for unexpected death on the part of the players, warnings of this change was put in the patch message. Word has it that there's a way to get in the good graces of those who now attack.</UL>
