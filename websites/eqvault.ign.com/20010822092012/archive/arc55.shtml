We ended up deciding to make this change due to the difficulty of getting the dead back into VP to collect their loot in light of it all going NODROP.

Here's a compiled list of the many board posts Gordon Wrinn has made this evening on th e Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013405.html"><b>New Server Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: PS Probably a little out of the subject, but do you still know if there is going to be any newbie servers?]</i></font> <br><br>Of the two servers on order, we're not sure yet whether only one or both of those will be a split server.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013257.html"><b>Board Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When you decided to make the boards avaliable to subscribers only I knew what you were trying to do. You actually believed that the "whining" would go away because you created a great game and only those people who quit the game were disgruntled and kept posting here to stir up the "silent minority".]</i></font> <br><br>No, we never believed complaints would go away. We did however believe the constant baseless flames would go away, because that's what we were going to commit to make happen. We also hoped to see more people who formerly only lurked for fear of being flamed come onto the boards and let everyone know their thoughts as well. We've made great strides towards both of those goals. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The reason that it did not go away is because, although you created a very immersive game, you have made some bad decisions in the design, testing, alteration, and expansion phases of the game.]</i></font> <br><br>The concept of "bad decisions" is entirely subjective. What one person thinks is a bad decision, another person thinks is a great idea. In any case, we'll be the first to admit that the game isn't perfect, but it is inline with most of our goals and as such is responsible for the number of people that choose to play it. <br><br>No game can be perfect, and at some point continuing to tweak it to get it closer to "perfection" in *our* eyes will sooner or later take it further away from that goal. Perfection is subjective as well. I've yet to see any subject that 280K could agree upon. Even the latest UI changes which hurt NO ONE still had poeple who disagreed with the changes because they felt we should be working on something else that was important to them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It is not our fault that this is so. How could it be the players fault that we are losing interest in a game that we love and feel so passionately about.]</i></font> <br><br>Who says that it has to be anyone's "fault"? Growing disinterested in a game over time is part of the natural course. I just wish that instead of people saying, "I've played a year and a half, wasted 150 days played 4 level 50 characters, and you've finally upset me enough that I'm quiting", they'd say "OMG! I've played for a year and a half and put 150 days played into my 4 characters! I've never had something keep me this interested for this long. It's time to move on, but I just wanted to extend my thanks for the entertainment. It was well worth the money." <br><br>Frankly, if someone plays for a year or a year and a half before quitting, we feel that we've done our job well, regardless the reason stated for quitting. A computer game keeping someone interested for that long is truly amazing, and we're happy that our game was one that could do it. Over 70% of everyone who has ever purchased EverQuest is still subscribing today, and that is a fantasitc testement to what we're doing. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Dont talk to me about burn-out either. There is a difference between baing burnt-out on a game and getting tired of the negative changes imposed on that game.]</i></font> <br><br>Oops, too late, I spoke about burnout already. Anyway, I've found that people who are ready to quit are looking for a *reason* to do so, rather than quitting just because they've had enough. These changes are excellent fuel for that. I sincerly doubt that anyone goes from completely happy to "quitting" over one minor change such as the stats on one item or the location of a drop changing. <br><br>You talk about "negative changes" like "negative" is a factual statement when in fact it is an opinion. Take this Veeshan loot issue as an example. People want risk and reward to make sense. We're going to make it make sense. That is a positive change if we are implementing what people want, right? A great many people have posted how some loot in other areas belongs on dragons. This was truly a case where it wasn't a case of items in VP being underpowered as much as it was a case of items elsewhere being overpowered. We can't keep raising the power of items found at the higher levels every time an item shows up in the mid levels a little more powerful than expected. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013372.html"><b>Necro and AoE Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: All other classes get them. Clerics get group heals, shamans get group buffs, druids get group wolf form ETC. Shouldn't we get group DMF or a AoE fear, lifetap or something??? As well as we dont get lev till 44. Why can't we get dead man bobbing at a lower level? The only AoE spells we get are the ones for close combat and do no real damage so are of NO use. Any input would be nice..]</i></font> <br><br>Necros pay the price for their superior single-target offensive power by getting little in the way of group-benefit spells, and all of them are single-target in nature. You do get a line of point-blank AOEs however.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013391.html"><b>/Con Biased?</b></a><br>Some classes excell at soloing, others at grouping, some can do either just as well. Strangely enough, the two top soloing casters and the top soloing meleer (for the most part) aren't on the top of everyone's "must have for the group" list. <br><br>It's worked out quite well in that regard. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is the main prob I have with this, as I understand it the higher the mob cons to you the more xp you get if you kill it putting classes such as warriors who have to group at a xp disadvantage.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree. I've illustrated before on the boards how a group can get more experience than a soloer in most cases. Though members split the experience, they are killing things so much faster and with less downtime that it's more efficient for most applications. <br><br>Of course, if all the group is going to do is sit in one place camping a single spawn killing no faster than a solo caster of the same range could, the group will of course advance slower.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013187.html"><b>Clerics</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Proposed Solution would be a group variant (and lvl 58 is way to late in the class life to get this ability, how many cleric do yuo think will ever be 58?). I suggest at 52 a group version of Pinzarn be available ]</i></font><br><br>How many clerics will ever be 52? More than reach 58, sure, but that's not really an argument for changing it. The 58th level spell is certainly a nice benefit for reaching that level. Until you do, perhaps those you are buffing could share in the cost of the components. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Invisibility - We get group and single invis undead, no invis live. I think we are now the last class with no ability or item (without charges) that can't invis.]</i></font> <br><br>There are other classes that can't do something that other classes can. Class interdependancy is based on this. For instance, it could be aruged that necros should be able to case their invis upon others since every other class that can cast invis can do this. This isn't, however, how it was intended. Clerics can do so much for a group in other areas, it makes sense that they would have to rely on the group for some things as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: AC Lines.. SoW cost so mouch to cast.. Why should we burn 300+ mana for an AC buff, this seems like a awfully large jump in mana cost from AoF. We should see this buff reduced to the 175 mana range.]</i></font>  <br><br>It's a tradeoff. If the spell costs too much to cast, and is not worth that cost to you in that case, it's your option to choose not to cast it. If the group on the other hand wants every single stackable buff possible, it's going to cost more in the way of mana, components, and time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013243.html"><b>Non Agressive Dragons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I haven't seen the one in Emrald Jungle, but I have seen the one in Dreadlands a few times. The thought occured to me that wouldn't it be great if these beasts would give a quest of some kind?]</i></font> <br><br>At some point there probably will be, but not just yet. Those dragons operate on a timer while the dragon is idle until it depops. Any time they respond to quest text, that timer is suspended. We had NPCs in the game like this at one point, but found that people were able to get them to stay around indefinitely by constanly /hailing them. <br><br>At some point we might change the way those timers work, so ruin your faction with those dragons at your own risk :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013177.html"><b>Kunark Upgrades Postponed?</b></a><br>I believe that Brad said we were running a couple of weeks behind. I certainly do expect to see the Kunark upgrade available once again prior to the release of Velious. We just want to be absolutely sure that there are no repeats of the fulfillment problems with Kunark.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013151.html"><b>Displeased with Kunark</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: From reading this board, I used to think Kunark sucked...I rarely went. Receintly, my guildmate told me to go to FM. I am hooked now. The exp is great. I belive that since the MOBs are harder, the experience for them is also boosted. I suggest killing lower things than you are used to, or play a class more known for it's solo ability.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for the note, and you are indeed correct that with the harder NPCs comes more experience. That's how it should be :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013172.html"><b>VP Loot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Can't you add a few high-powered items to the dragon drops instead of completely nerfing Sebilis?]</i></font> <br><br>We're not going to "completely nerf" Sebilis or any other zone, just balance item allocation out in a manner consistant with risk. There are some items from Sebilis that will certainly move to Veeshan's peak as common loot on the dragons there. Yes, the dragons in VP have common, rare, and ultrarare drops.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013120.html"><b>Bothersome Buffs</b></a><br>I know that this issue was brought up back in beta, and it was determined at that time that it shouldn't be too much of an issue. That said, anyone using the spell in an offensive manner would be in violation of the rules of conduct. <br><br>If players do find this to be a big issue, I could look into seeing if these types of spells could be limited to group only.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013123.html"><b>Magical Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: do got a question: its 35 right? not 32 as ya thought (med without a book)]</i></font><br><br>It's been a while since I was looking forward to the magic level. I'll go whip up a character tomorrow and get it straight in my head.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012579.html"><b>Morell-Thule Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Our server will have to ignore both Nagafen and Vox and favor a large amount of time sitting on our collective duffs, praying to whatever EQ god that the boats mess up and Faydedar is forced to repop.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't understand your complaint. Are you saying that you won't be able to kill Vox and Nagafen but will be able to kill Faydedar? <br><br>Or are you saying that people powerleveled past 52 before there were enough people capable of taking on Vox or Nagafen?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013084.html"><b>10 Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) With the update of parry and dodge for rangers being in 'fine tuning' when can we reasonably expect for it to go live?]</i></font> <br><br>Friday. We postponed the patch for this and a couple of the other issues that we wanted to get in. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) With the lowering of cast time on jolt to go down, when can we reasonably expect it to go live? Also will it still maintain its high resist rate?]</i></font> <br><br>Should be this Friday as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) How will the implementation of the upgrade to parry and dodge be introduced? I.E. will it just be allowed to progress from its current level or will it be maxed out to your current level? i.e. im level 55 and say dodge is increased to 225 would i expect it to be maxed at 220 for my level or would it begin to work up from its current level. ]</i></font><br><br>The increase in the cap will give you the opportunity to build it naturally. No skills will be auto-accelerated to the cap. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) The UI tweaks. Will we have to wait till velious to see them go live?]</i></font> <br><br>Some yes, others no.

We are designed to operate most effectively in the company of others. We are often called a Jack of All Trades, but a master of none. We have so many abilities that are spread among several other classes. Need someone to buff your attack speed? A Bard can do that and more at higher levels. Need to slowdown a mobs attack speed? A Bard can do that and more at higher levels. Need a boost to your resistances? A Bard is one of the best at boosting resistances. Need to regenerate health or mana faster? Again, a bard can do this. Need to charm a creature for a short while and make him your ally? Bards. Need someone who can wear armor and take a FEW hits ok? Bards. Need to get from one location to another fast and teleports or gates are not feasible? Bards.]</i></font> <br><br>While I'll leave in-depth determination of "role" to those playing it, I think that you've answered your own question here. Bards are good at so many things, you're surely here to do some of those things. I feel that Bards excell at making a good group better. That's my opinion. What's more important though is, what is a bard's role to you? If you look at it as a walking-talking mana battery, there's not really much I can do to make you feel better about it. It's the same issues with the clerics who often complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. You are a support class. You support the group, and you do it very well. Whether or not you are happy with that role is up to you.</UL>

Brad wrote a follow-up to his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013030.html">Veeshan's Peak loot post</a>.  Here's the entire message:<UL><i>The following was my third post regarding the subject prior to the thread corrupting (*sigh*):<br><br>I don't mean this in a condescending way at all, but I honestly wish some of you would at least try to put yourselves in our shoes.<br><br>What options do we have in these situations?<br><br>First, let's establish a few facts: <br><br>1. This is a dynamic game. It may not be as dynamic as some would like with massive invasions and huge volcanic eruptions and entire NPC governments taking action that affect players' lives, but it DOES change. We add to the game, we change the game, and some times we take away. (Actually, it makes me worry for when the technology is such that we can do all of that stuff -- how will people respond... 'That volcano created a mountain where my favorite hunting grounds were and blocked the entrance to my favorite dungeon and now I have to walk farther to the new entrance at the top of the crater! You nerfed me!'). <br><br>We cannot have stagnant games, yet when the status quo changes, SOMEBODY always get's upset, especially if the change is not universally positive (and what change is?).<br><br>2. We're not perfect! We will make mistakes. We will continue to make mistakes as long as we continue to add content, and things will be out of balance in the future.<br><br>3. We learn and get better. For example, lots of universal class non-specific loot like Rubicite is bad. <br><br>So, what options do we have:<br><br>1. We could just leave mistakes and aspects of the game that didn't turn out as planned. I think that leads to stagnation. I also think it leaves areas of the game untouched... empty zones, ignored quests, etc.<br><br>2. We could upgrade the VP items that are weaker to what they should be. This doesn't address the other items that are too powerful relative to their difficulty to obtain, but it would address one side of the problem. The problem is that they'd be comparable then most likely to the other broken items. Many players would then simply try to obtain the broken items since they are as good as the upgraded VP items but easier to get. And we'd still have broken items.<br><br>3. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken items (and not adjust encounter difficulty). Here's where the MUDflation comes in. Now, what have we done to all the other items in the game... they're all indirectly weaker now. And, we've set a new (lower) standard of risk vs. reward. The game becomes less challenging, etc. <br><br>4. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken items (and then re-adjust NPC encounter difficulty throughout the game as well as other treasure tables everywhere, raising the entire risk/reward ratio but keeping it balanced). This, by the way, is what the infamous mud wimping article would have us do -- either that, or nothing. Basically, it's a ton of work and would probably introduce a whole slew of new problems and potential for mistakes. Bluntly, we'd rather allocate those resources elsewhere.<br><br>So, our solution is to identify the non-VP items that are out there that are too powerful and probably move them to VP. And then take some underpowered VP items and move them elsewhere AND/OR make some new items to replace the over-powered ones.<br><br>I also want to emphasize that there really aren't that many items. Also, just to let you know, MORE of this is going to occur when EQ Live starts revamping old world zones (Permafrost, Najena, etc.) We will be adding new content AND moving existing content around.<br><br>I know this isn't compatible with some players' feelings that how and where things are in the game the day they started playing MUST also be the same 3, 6 or 12 months later. But, with all due respect, that's simply NOT how MMORPGs work. As mentioned earlier, if anything, MMORPGs will become MORE dynamic and less predictable/dependable in the future.<br><br>In closing, I'll quote from one of the EQ Live game designers emails to me regarding some of the items that very well might change -- I want to emphasize again that there aren't that many we're talking about:<br><br>"Broken Weapons include: Blade of the Black Dragon Eye, Warding Star, Runed Fighters Staff (Somewhat easy to acquire, godly proc ratio), Moss Covered Twig (we all know this one), etc.<br><br>Those are a few examples of broken items which have been acquired by players and severely hamper our attempts to create new and interesting loot. The players should be made happy soon however. We just went through and nerfed the drops of those broken weapons and "added new content" -- replacement new items. Near copies of some of the broken weapons are being placed into VP." -EQ Live Game Designer<br><br>-Brad<br><br>p.s. I know this might encourage people to camp more short-term, but I wanted to be up front and detailed with all of you nonetheless. Heh, everything's a trade-off.</I></UL>

I just received the following announcement from Verant's Cindy Archuleta:<UL><I>Greetings!<br><br>You might want to note that there have been two important announcements<br>added to the Sony EQ Board. Both are Real Life Events that are designed for<br>the players. <br><br>First, on November 4-5, players are invited to attend the Velious Launch<br>Party in Las Vegas! They can meet other players, the Velious Development<br>Team and have a chance to play on the new Velious continent before it is<br>released! They can also win great prizes, including signed copies of the<br>expansion pack (to be shipped when it is shipped to the retailers).<br><br>Also announced is the next Real Life event I will be coordinating. The EQ<br>Fan Faire will be held in February in a yet to be determined East Coast<br>city. Check out the site to cast your vote for our destination! <br><br>Visit <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/</a> for more information on both of<br>these exciting events!<br><br>Cindy Archuleta<br>Community Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive</I></UL>Thank you!

Gordon's made quite a few posts on the boards this afternoon.  Here's the latest from the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013109.html"><b>Twinked Corpses</b></a><br>Interestingly enough, the GMs get /petitions every night from people who lost a twinked up corpse like this. Needless to say that it isn't something that we can intervene in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013119.html"><b>Resist Bug</b></a><br>I'm aware of this happening at resists over 255, however this is the first I've heard of it being over 200. Are you certain that this is the case?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013106.html"><b>Abusive Users</b></a><br>If she's being threatened in that manner, she'll want to /report the text then /petition to let the GMs know that a /report has been filed. Providing that the /report shows the threats, he'll certainly be removed from game. I'm not really sure why she got the response that you've indicated, so if more information can be provided I'll be happy to look into it. <br><br>Secondly, if she has a restraining order against him, chances are that it prohibits any contact between them. The courts would probably not be too happy about learning that he's contacted her on the internet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012952.html"><b>Putting Stuff in the Bank</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Would it not be easier to be able to put thing in a bag that is already in the bank?]</i></font> <br><br>This is indeed one of the UI enhancements on Rowyl's list. I'm not sure yet if it's one that will make the final cut due to the number of good suggestions, however we'll give it a shot.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012966.html"><b>Dupe Bug Question</b></a><br>Good suggestion Wyld, and to answer Sabaack's question, we'd certainly take intent into account. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013068.html"><b>Class Changes</b></a><br>We have nothing in particular planned right now. We do plan on retesting all of the classes to ensure that they fall where we feel that they should prior to freezing the classes. Most of these tests have already been completed for most of the melee classes, with only a few more steps necessary to finalize those.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012942.html"><b>More on the Story Elements in EQ</b></a><br>On one hand we have players asking for more of a story line to be overtly implemented into the game. On the other, there's also those who prefer an open "floorplan" if you will. In either case, we want to provide for both players. <br><br>"Story" requires that some limits be placed on the breadth of things that players can do. There's really no way around that. Whether the story is done in short bursts, such as quests, or in large multi-zone epics, there is some limit on what you can do to take part in the story.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012754.html"><b>Determining Balance of the Classes</b></a><br>As the game is and always will be primarily PvE (Player versus Environment), balance in this area has always been the chief concern. Even on the PvP servers, PvE is still the main focus there and affects everyone whether or not they engage in PvP regularly. <br><br>That said we also try to keep things in mind for PvP. For instance, the damage reduction for spells cast by players upon other players is one of the PvP balance mechanisms.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009851-2.html"><b>EQ's Plot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I believe Abashi or Aradune said that there would be a way for verant to relay storied to the players in the future well it must be the DISTANT future because it hasn't happened yet.]</i></font> <br><br>I wanted to wait until I had a time nailed down for this: We'll be debuting a section of our website dedicated to stories in a couple of days. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009837.html"><b>Abolish Disease</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The biggest question here is why aren't the priest classes equal in their ability to deal with diseases and poisons in the end?]</i></font><br><br>Because the classes aren't designed to be equal, but to be balanced. If they were equal they would be interchangable in many cases. As it is designed, you must often make a choice with what class you want to be near. If you are going up against something with really strong poison, you certainly want clerics around. For disease, you'll probably want to add a shaman. If you are looking for something a little more general purpose, there's the druid, with respectable DD, DOTs, healing, buffs, and ports.</UL>

Gordon started this week's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013130.html">Discussion of the Week</a> on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the complete post:<UL><I>I think that there&#8217;s a common misconception going around that, &#8220;All dynamic events consist of GMs going on a killing spree.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t the case, as there are many different types of dynamic events, ranging from the typical raid, to story-telling events, to epic quests with a vast story-line behind them.<br><br>Raids are typically short on story and last anywhere from a half an hour to an hour or two. They usually consist of trio of actor NPCs or so entering an area and running amok until they are killed by a sufficient force of players.<br><br>Story-telling events typically have little-to-no fighting of any kind, and are usually used to tell a story leading up to or concluding an epic quest.<br><br>Epic quests often run several hours and boast a slew of actor NPCs that both tell a story and engage in combat at some point during the quest.<br><br>In addition to these, there are also &#8220;Invasions&#8221; which are more static in nature and deal with a temporary data reset of the zone. Examples of this have been the period undead invasions of Qeynos Hills, or the recent one in Najena that was launched with a small epic quest.<br><br>We realize and agree that there have been problems publicizing the story behind dynamic events, and will be launching a new section of our website in the next couple of days to deal with that issue. However, the question I would like to pose is, what do you want to see in the way that dynamic events are handled? It seems that no matter the event, or the story behind it, there are always some people who felt that the event was nothing but a &#8220;killing spree&#8221;.<br><br>What can we do to make these events more enjoyable for the players?<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

An <a href="http://www.gameloft.co.uk/adventure/index.php?file=eq_interview_110900">interview with Verant's Jeff Buttler</a> now appears on the pages of Gameloft.  This interview was done at ECTS and focuses exclusively on the second upcoming expansion.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>GL : What new items are going to be available in the new expansion?</b><br>JB : There will be 6 new sets of armour graphics for each sex/class combination (2 x leather, 2 x chain, 2 x plate). Plus there will be all new weapon and helmet textures along with lots of new items of all types.<br><br><b>GL : What engine does the new expansion use? </b><br>JB : It uses a slightly tweaked version of the graphical engine used in the Kunark Expansion. We did not want to enhance the engine too much, as this would increase the minimum machine specs.</UL>Thanks Mike!

Trakanon has had a rough few days on several servers.  The following news post contains two reports of the slayings:<BLOCKQUOTE>Dragon Force pushes onward, through foggy dark tunnels of stale dank air<br>and into an expansive cavern.

Mages of various religions follow closely<br>behind their larger kin, frequently turning around nervously to see if<br>any devilish beings have taken notice of their presence.  The ogres and<br>troll's quiet their subtle grunts, the  paladins strap their armor tight<br>to avoid making a sound.  A silent army crests a ledge and set their<br>eyes on the mighty dragon Trakanon.<br><br>Warriors raise their swords still dripping with red blood above their<br>heads, grunting and shouting words of rage and courage.  Paladin's<br>kneel, head pressed against the hilt of their mighty swords blessing<br>their surrounding adventurers.  Powerful priests with glowing eyes of<br>fluorescent blue call upon their gods for support.  Mages with glints of<br>color around the hands and head chant harmoniously in a foreign arcane<br>language.  The sky sizzles with energy and the air is filled with<br>absolute power!<br><br>A battle cry is sound, a massive rush of valorous tanks strewn with<br>armor of unknown lands charge towards the almighty dragon.  The mages<br>chants blend together as one in rhythmic unison, rising to a deafening<br>roar.

The following is this evening's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013015.html"><b>Greed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So let me get this strait, if the item that dropped did not have Necro in it and another class could use it you would not roll?]</i></font> <br><br>I'd only roll for it if: <br><br>-There was no one in the group who could use it, or<br>-The person in the group who could use it already had it or something better. <br><br>-Gordon <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So you have never camped the FBSS or any Item a necro could not use?]</i></font> <br><br>No. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You don't think the Cleric or the Enchanter you just met worked as hard as the warrior in the group when a rare sword drops?]</i></font> <br><br>Sure they worked just as hard, however I imagine that they were doing so to help out their warrior. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do you not believe you can trade a Item you don't need for one you do?]</i></font> <br><br>I had friends to help get those other items, or obtained a tradable item when there was no class in the group that could use it. <br><br>Of course that's just me. It's up to each player to decide what way they wish to play.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012998.html"><b>Verant's Attitude Toward Solo'ers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What he means is that if you have solo'd your entire career, you will not be making all of the connections with other characters. If I don't know you from Adam and no one else I know does, the odds are we're not going to be to thrilled with the idea of letting you into our group where you may kill us.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd say that's an accurate description of the issues. Grouping is a skill that needs to be developed early on. Certainly, some classes support soloing, but we've always said that soloers not be able to go everywhere and do everything. If going everywhere and doing everything is important to the person who plays a soloable class, I'd certainly recommend that they work on forming relationships early on and throughout the leveling process.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012993.html"><b>How do you pronounce Kunark?</b></a><br>Koo-nark :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012784-2.html"><b>European Players & Overcrowding on Karana</b></a><br>European players do not measurably contribute to server crowding at peak times due to the fact that their prime-time is different from that in the states. I'd attribute crowding on Karana to be more due to the fact that most really don't want to leave. The last split offered to Karana was prepared to move 1200 people, yet only 139 actually requested a move. <br><br>I'm not really sure how to go about splitting up the server further when the community has become so strong that no one wants to leave. We're willing to discuss suggestions of course.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012846.html"><b>Age Discrimination?</b></a><br>First, CS Reps do not have access to account passwords. <br><br>Second, I'm not sure why you see this as an age discrimination issue. In situation number 1, if the person proved that he bought the accounts, they would then be banned. He would not be given access back to them, and it would be up to him to pursue action against the person that sold the account. In situation number 2, we get people calling us all of the time telling us that their account was stolen. They are required to prove ownership to get the account back. If it turns out that they did sell it, and the buyer calls us up, it becomes issue #1, and the account would be banned. In neither case does age come into the equation. <br><br>Original owners are always required to prove ownership, and are given the account back if they can (via a password reset). Buyers are also required to prove that they bought it, however once they do the account it banned. <br><br>We do not allow transfers of accounts, and will not support it nor open ourselves to getting involved with the fraud associated with them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012653.html"><b>Poor Customer Service</b></a><br>I do agree that the way the CSRep phrased his response was poor, and I'd like to extend you our apologies. <br><br>In regards to your query as to whether the decision to change the item to offhand only is final, it indeed is. Though I understand your feelings regarding this issue, the encounter from which this item was obtainable and the quantities that it dropped are not sufficient for the power of the item.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012618.html"><b>Problems With EQ: Crashing</b></a><br>I've heard of heat-crashes before, and it sounds like this is what you may have been experiencing. Kunark is more processer-intensive than the mainland, so would cause more heat to build up. I can see an overclocking your CPU causing a problem like this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012522-4.html"><b>Don't Roll For Loot!</b></a><br>I'd have to agree with the original posters feelings, though somewhat more politely :)  I'd never consider rolling for something that my character could not use if there was someone in the group who could . <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011959.html"><b>Reducing Player Burnout</b></a><br>I believe that the requirement to look at the spellbook goes away at 32 rather than 35. That said, arguments could always be made to have it go away sooner. It's a matter of providing rewards for continuing to gain levels. People gain levels for those rewards, and this is yet another goal that people can reach. We could lower it to 30, but I imagine that we'd see the same requests to lower it to 28, 25, or get rid of it altogether. In this case we've decided that 32 is a good level for that requirment to be overcome.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012461.html"><b>Enchanters Without Breeze</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When you added the Breeze spell to the Enchanter series, I don't understand why you made this spell only purchasable in Kunarak. Since this spell is such a well known Enchanter spell shouldn't all Enchanter guilds sell it?]</i></font> <br><br>The spell was added as part of the Kunark expansion. Kunark expansion spells are available only in Kunark. We did, however, decide that the spell would not be NODROP, thus allowing someone to carry them back to the mainland and sell them there for a profit. In my opinion, it has worked out pretty well in implementation.</UL>

The Ranger class will be upgraded says EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013021.html">formal announcement from the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>After a LOT of internal testing, interacting with the community, and major debate, we've decided to upgrade Rangers as follows:<br><br>We will be upping their dodge and parry to near Warrior levels. I don't want to get into specifics yet because we are still fine tuning, but the end result is that a Ranger should be significantly more survivable. <br><br>I'm personally happy with the solution because, rather than just increasing defense and making them more Warrior-like, we've upped skills that are more traditionally associated with Rangers (the view that they are nimble, chain-wearing fighters who often avoid attacks).<br><br>I'd also like to pre-announce a future goal and policy change:<br><br>Soon (we'll announce a date in the future), we're going to completely stop adjusting game balance as it relates to tweaking classes. Recently, we've made more changes than usual due to the level limits being raised from 50 to 60. Soon, however, we're going to come to a point where it stops. <br><br>We'll continue to add content (i.e. items, spells, etc.) and game balance will still be tweaked (and will continue to be tweaked as long as we do add content). But class balance changes as a whole will cease.<br><br>The Ranger upgrade is part of this. I'd say that hopefullly by early 2001 we'll be done.<br><br>Abashi or I will post more on this as we work out the plan in detail internally.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

The jolt spell is immensly useful, as tested by several high-level rangers in house, as well as a rogue who found it comparable to Evade.

CGO has a <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/029/130/velious_preview.html">new preview of the Scars of Velious</a> posted at their site.  Again, this article uses mostly the info released by Verant at ECTS but it's a good read none the less.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>After the Coldain Dwarves, you will eventually work your way into the zones that contain the Frost and Storm Giants. These Giants are the enemies of the Dwarves, so may be able to raise your faction with the Giants (i.e. make them like you better) by killing Dwarves (or Dragons). Ultimately, you may be able to bind yourself to the city of the Storm Giants so that you'll be able to return from death to this point. From the Giants you will continue on to face the Dragons. These are likely to be the mightiest creatures in Velious, but again you have the opportunity to raise faction with the Dragons by killing Giants, so the potential to walk unscathed among the mighty serpents does exist. There are of course many other zones on Velious populated with other creatures dire and dangerous, but the Dwarves, Giants, and Dragons are the main players in the power struggle for Velious.</UL>

A new article has been published to <a href="/lore/shadoe">Shadoe's Corner</a> titled <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid968638912,25951,">What Do You Want from Norrath?</a>  If you've ever mumbled, ranted, flamed or complained about design aspects of EverQuest this article is something you might find interesting.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>I have to wonder at some of the things I see posted on the message boards sometimes. Those of you who frequent the boards know what I'm talking about. "The loot in Veeshan's Peak sucks!" "The loot in the planes suck!" "Item stats are too low for my Black Featherduster of Doom!" "Give monks better class weapons!" "Why is the necromancer able to give himself mana, and not wizards who need it most?" "The game is unplayable for me after 35 because you don't care about my class!" "I'm tired of taking so long to get anywhere in Norrath! Make NPCs able to teleport!"<br><br>I find myself questioning how people became so egocentric about their characters. Is it so hard to take a step back from your own selfish desires and take a look at the big picture of what Verant is trying to deliver with EverQuest? Is it so hard to see that if Verant bowed and scraped to each and every player demand presented on the message boards, that the game itself would quickly become the very icon of boredom and drudgery?</UL>Thanks Shadoe!

A few Sunday posts were made today by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012300.html"><b>Aradune's Ranger Comments</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Aradune says "I have not played a high level ranger" Testing doesn't Exist]</i></font> <br><br>Personally, I don't think the fact that the Vice President of premuim games doesn't play a high level character of every class to be indicative of "Testing doesn't exist". <br><br>We have a team of designers and developers, and I can't think of a class that isn't played, to a high level by someone on that team. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1- 2 months ago Bards got a higher level charm, the first couple days bards were charming Innoruuk and Cazic thule. The charm was horribly bugged. Did these glorious testers ever test this? No]</i></font> <br><br>Some things get by in the testing process. With litterally tens of thousands of actions that can be completed by any character class, unforeseen things are bound to occur. In this case, code was put in to avoid what you mentioned, and just didn't work as intended. So a few bards had some unforeseen benefits for a little while. No harm was really done. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2- "I have not played a high level Ranger" Aradune, quite frankly I question whether you, or anyone at Verant has ever played a high level character. I've seen numerous claims by Abashi and yourself that there are high level players that work for VI. Then why wouldn't they pick up on the Ranger deficiancies? Where was the testing in beta of Kunark?]</i></font> <br><br>See my first paragraph. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3- Plane of Sky. Who can ever forget Abashi's famous quote. "Plane of Sky items make other planar items look like rusty weapons". Frankly, this zone has a couple good items in it and the rest of the items are pitiful. Where was the testing, why didn't anyone ever take a DEEP look at these items and announce their weakness? It's been MONTHS, nothing has been done yet.]</i></font> <br><br>The quote was "SOME Plane of Sky weapons...", and this is true. That said there still are some modifications necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1- Chardok- What an absolute waste of time for such a beautiful zone. Who was the guy/girl that itemized this zone? It's pathetic! For such a neat looking layout where was the imagination in the actual items? Why wasn't someone there testing these dungeons for the treasures and the Risk/Reward? ]</i></font><br><br>One of the problems with the way the game works is that it appears that players will always go to the place with the best loot, even if it causes that zone to be horrendously overcrowded. Unfortunately, not every zone can be stocked with the "best loot". <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2- Sebilis- Oppsss I'm sorry, I meant to say Extended Lower Guk. Aradune, what are you going to do in two months when there are 200+ people in Lower Sebilis fighting for camping spots? Ever wonder why sebilis is getting so crowded?]</i></font> <br><br>See my last paragraph. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3- Veeshans Peek- What's so different about Veeshan's peek and Sebilis? You spend a weekend in Sebilis, get a 31/37 staff, very nice one handers, plenty of spells, and other odds and ends that are VERY good for LITTLE risk with a comptent group. Yes, that's right little risk. The risk in Veeshan's peek? It's tremendous, you have to fight TOUGH dragons, very tough fast spawning Guardian Wurms, and risk hard earned hours of experience in hopes of something better than Sebilis. Where is the sense in this? Why wasn't this even tested? Does anyone at Verant play Everquest?]</i></font> <br><br>I really don't see the complaint here. Yes, you can get good items from Sebilis. It's only "little risk", because it's crowded, because people crowd the places with the best loot. At some point perhaps Veeshan's peak will get crowded. Of course due to the way the zone is set up, I doubt that it will ever get so crowded that it's considered "little risk".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012397.html"><b>Upcoming MMORPGs</b></a><br>Hey, don't forget that RPGs aren't the only thing you can tack an MMO on to.

Here's the latest quotes and excerpts generated by Verant's Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012275.html"><b>What happened to Discussion of the Week?</b></a><br>Yeah, the sort week messed up my plans this week. I've an idea for another one Monday based upon some of the ideas in the thread. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012260.html"><b>"Will warriors in the Best of the Best be buffed to 60 on test?"</b></a><br>No, they have to work with whatever level and equipment that they come in with when their characters are transferred over. Those of lesser level, or a race with lesser hitpoints will have to be that much more skillful.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012208.html"><b>Mana Bar for Melee Classes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why not take away the mana bar for pure-melee classes? I just don't see the purpose in having an empty bar (save for that one blue pixel at the front ) sitting there. Anyway, just a suggestion]</i></font> <br><br>I look at it as a placeholder. There are many people who play both casters and melee classes, and I'd guess that it would take a short while to adjust to even a slightly different UI. <br><br>In any case, it's one bar and really doesn't hurt anything. I'll mention it to Rowyl, but I doubt it would be changed since it's such a minor issue that really doesn't affect anything.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012172.html"><b>Of Rangers and Lies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, did Verant lie to rangers?]</i></font><br><br>My first instict was to delete the thread consdiering the "Lies... damned lies" comment. Calling me or us collectively liars will cause a warning to be placed on your account, espicially when you misquote something to establish that fact. <br><br>Then it occurred to me that it should be refuted rather than just deleted, for the sake of others reading the posts here. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said no class would ever be fixed or enhanced ever again. (6)]</i></font> <br><br>#6 (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011782.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011782.html</a>) did not say anything of the sort. If you were going to summarize the post, I would say that #6 said that we are at the point that any enhancement made to one class will upset another. It's happened with every class-enhancement we've made for some time, and should be agreeable as a fact. If we started making every change that could get a couple hundred people in support of it, we'd 1) never be done making changes as each change would raise issues for another class, and 2) actively kill the game since it would no longer be a challenge after a while. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said monks were getting a carrying weight enhancement. (7)]</i></font><br><br>#7 incidently occurred in the same post as #6. <br><br>Anyway, your accusation of lying is dependant upon your paraphrase of #6 being true, which it wasn't.</UL>

Spotted on <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com">Voodoo Extreme</a> that Games Domain has scored a <a href="http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep00/everquest.html">new interview with Scott McDaniel</a>, Executive Director of marketing and PR for Sony Online Entertainment.  The subjects in the interview focuses on Velious and the upcoming Sovereign.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>GD: What kinds of characters can we expect to bump into?</b><br><br><i>SM: We have all new characters, such as Walrus Men and an array of Dragons and Giants. Character design on the players' part can be as much or as little as they want. You can basically create a character from the tone of their skin right through to what special skills or mental agility they have. Upper level characters will be able to interact with the new environment and new races of monsters with their own political system will inhabit the areas that players will have to explore.</i></UL>
