Gordon, in response to a post on the Gameplay Board, gave us a status on where they are at with a number of Rogue issues.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057394.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Poison - This needs a major overhaul. Please look into this as soon as possible.<br><br><b><i>Poison is nearly done. We're looking to have around 50 poisons, including DOTs, DDs, Debuffs, and others. </b></i><br><br>Pickable Locks - Add a ton of these, to all kinds of dungeons, so everyone will WANT to group with Rogues on dangerous adventures.<br><br><b><i>We're taking care to add pickable locks to new dungeons that we create. We probably won't, however, add them to existing ones, except perhaps as part of a complete dungeon revamp.</b></i><br><br>Better Weapons - There ARE some good Rogue weapons out there, but most work in the primary hand only. There needs to be more offhanded quality rogue weapons with nice procs.<br><br><b><i>There are plenty of good rogue weapons out there. Like anything else, you can never have too many though :) </b></i><br><br>Feign Death - Why isn't this an ingrained rogue ability? Rogues are the masters of Stealth, Evasion and Trickery. Perhaps a scaled down version of Feign Death could be offered to Rogues.<br><br><b><i>Rogues won't get Feign Death. We elected to give Evade instead. Feigning death does not fit into our idea of what a rogue should be able to do. Monks get it on the basis of real-life where some have shown the ability to slow their heart-rate and respiration to a level near death. Necros/SKs get it due to their "kinship" with death. <br><br>Anyway, as I've said before, rogues are extremely powerful melee characters, and a benefit to any group.</b></i><br><br>Ah yes, the evade skill. It was wonderful when they first put it in. Over time, strangely enough usually after a patch has gone in, it has become less effective. Much less effective. <br><br><b><i>We haven't changed Evade's effectiveness since we put it in. It's just a matter of perception. When someone first gets a new ability, they notice the extreme difference between the way things used to be and the way they are now. As time goes on, the novelty wears off and they perceive that it's less and less of a big deal.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Here's the latest posts from off the Gameplay Board that Verant/Sony's Gordon Wrinn made:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057029.html"><b>Spell Scroll Idea</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you play a druid, you are constantly asked to sow people. If you are an enchanter, legions of players ask to be breezed/claritied. If you play a wizard, armies flock to you for taxi services and binding.]</i></font> <br><br>We don't view these things as bad. Quite to the contrary, players relying on other players is a big part of the game by design. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This causes a lot of wasted time for those that can provide these types of services. For example, if a wizard is asked to teleport, the wizard has to meet the person somewhere, he has to memorize the spell, he has to cast it, he then needs to get back to where he wants to be and finally, at some point, he has to meditate to regain the mana lost by teleporting someone]</i></font> <br><br>Very true, but there must be some cost to the dependence otherwise it is trivial. For instance, if there was an item in game that created unlimited money, the value of money would drop significantly as these items showed up in game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: When it comes to SOW, breeze/clarity, teleport, and binding, I think other solutions should be available.]</i></font> <br><br>Some other solutions for some of these are available in the form of Alchemy. Not for everything of course as we wouldn't want to destroy class interdependance, or turn one class (shamans) into the class that replaces all others. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How about giving casters a new skill called &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; or something to that affect. The &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; skill could then be learned like any other skill. Using the &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; skill, casters could create single-use spell scrolls ]</i></font><br><br>Any further expansions in the area of providing a craftable item that invokes a spell will be made via alchemy. Though I appreciate your opinion, we don't want to see classes excluded from a group on the basis of the people in the group being able to cast a bunch of those spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057072.html"><b>Where has Abashi gone?</b></a><br>We had a company thing going on this morning. I didn't get into the office until shorly after 1pm my time, which would be after 4 yours. Then I found over 150 emails, most of which were about the PvP thread posted yesterday. People are quite passionate about the issue :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057093.html"><b>Server Moves for Bertoxxulous & Karana</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: for what it's worth... I have two friends who successfully executed the "/movelog yes" command on Saturday. Even though there has been nothing official put forward, we were speculating that the fact that movelog is working (on Bertoxxulous) that a split is coming soon.]</i></font> <br><br>The /movelog command can always be executed. We just clear the file that is generated at the time that registration for a move is officially opened. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon: Any ETA on the New Server for Karana & Bertox?]</i></font> <br><br>It's in our network room now undergoing setup and configuration. It looks like we'll probably be taking registration either later this week or early next week.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057140.html"><b>Half Elves & Rods</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant half elves equip mod rods ? it seems that they should be all all . Half elves are the only race that cannot equip.]</i></font> <br><br>I don't have the stats on the item handy, but if it is available to all classes, there's no reason to exclude half-elves from the list of races. I'll check into this tomorrow and see if we can get it in for the next item update after this Thursday's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057142.html"><b>Does Abashi defend and protect EQ or listen to the customers? </b></a><br>I don't think that the two concepts are mutually exclusive. We want EQ to remain successful and to do that we need to keep our players happy. Of course keeping players happy isn't as simple as granting "wants". It's not about "defending and protecting" EQ, it's about keeping the game fun and exciting. <br><br>Sometimes that requires doing things that might not seem to make a whole lot of sense until I have a chance to explain it. Even then, I'll surely be unable to explain it, or "convince" everyone that the chosen course is the best course of action. Heck, sometimes the chosen course *isn't* the best course of action. In these cases we've consistantly shown that we listen to the players concerns and act upon them. </UL>

Once <br>there you post a topic saying so and so for city name leader.  You then need <br>to have three people backing that person up and they have to accept it.  Once <br>that happens they will be entered in the final election.  We will take <br>nominations for the next three weeks or until we feel we have enough <br>nominations for each city.

Gordon made a few more posts this evening on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop on all of them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057053.html"><b>Negative Posts</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Have you ever noticed that almost all the topics in this forum are negative! Nothing seems to be done. Its always complaints, or people saying they're quitting because of poor customer services... What do you think about US? I just dont get it...]</i></font> <br><br>People stop complaining when their issues are addressed. Often this is preceded by a few posts of praise, but those are quickly drowned out by the next group of people with issues that they feel need to be resolved. No one feels any reason to keep responding to praise threads because they feel that nothing good will come of them, afterall, their issue is resolved. <br><br>This is just the way human psychology works. We do address a great number of issues from week to week. It's just hard to get people as worked up about being happy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056995.html"><b>"What does it mean to play EQ?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: First, what is VI's "vision" for EQ? Personally, I have no idea what it is. Evidently it is important to VI, so why are they so shy about fully and completely saying what it is? Shouldn't it be in the manual? What about on this site?]</i></font> <br><br>Well other people actually mention the "vision" more often than what we do. It's not exactly something that can easily be quantified and placed on a web-site for open viewing. It's the culmination of everything that we've planned, expected, and learned about EQ throughout development and later into production. It's how we want EQ to be. <br><br>People often say that ClassX should be able to do "X, Y, and Z" (what X, Y, and Z are varies from class to class and person to person). In some cases, these ideas are contrary to what we had planned for the class (e.g. our vision for the class). There's no document that we can open up that tells us what we can or cannot do in all cases. Sure, we have the several hundred page EQ design doc (which will never be public), but it of course doesn't cover anything. <br><br>When an issue comes up that hadn't been previously considered, we (the design team) sit down and decide whether that issue merits some kind of action, based upon whether there is a problem to be solved, whether a solution is viable, and whether that solution fits into what we had in mind for the game. If we can come to some sort of agreement, we modify the "vision" (e.g. In this case, our thoughts and feelings about the way things should be). <br><br>A lot of people who read the board and the news sites on the Net probably can give you a pretty good idea as to what our response will be to any particular issue. Overall, we want to provide people with a challenging and fun game, to the extent that it encourages them to play the game for a long time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second, what does EQ want to be when it grows up, besides being EQ2? The issue here is it a FPS with some community interaction or is it a CRPG?]</i></font> <br><br>We're obviously going for RPG :) But being an RPG doesn't mean that we can force people to "roleplay", as people have differing ideas as to what "roleplay" is. Furthermore, there are players that no matter what environment they are in, will never "roleplay" as a matter of choice. What we can do is provide everyone with options. Whether or not they pursue those options are up to them. I would love to see a world where everyone acts "in character", I just don't think that there's any way that this could be enforced. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Roleplaying requires a certain amount of interaction beyond "Where do you want to camp? ]</i></font><br><br>I would certainly agree with that. Of course, people have to make the decision engage in things other than camping. If everyone chooses to play the game in the fashion of choosing the quickest path to advancement regardless of the amount of fun that they have *during* that process, then that is their choice to make. You, as a roleplayer, can choose not to camp. You can choose to take actions other than that being taken by the people who are only interested in advancement. Sure, both options are valid gameplay styles, and we support it for that reason, but at some point people have to be responsible for thier own choices. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is no real growth in a character that I can associate with camping on trainer hill in CB waiting for the SBS to drop ]</i></font><br><br>The easy solution here is: Just don't do it. Choose to take actions that support "real growth in a character" in your opinion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well, you say, what about the powergamers? What about them? The game as it currently is is geared towards them. To them, EQ is an FPS. More involved than most, but still just a hack-n-slash for exp and loot. ]</i></font><br><br>Only if people *choose* to play it that way. Again, it's in your hands. Choose to play it in a different manner. MMORPGs are not single-player games that can provide a single plot with some minor subplots, and expect everyone to follow them. MMORPGs have to provide all possible content up front and allow people make their own decisions in regard to how they are going to choose to play the game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If they want to develop a true roleplaying community, they desperately need to add some human intervention on the back side. What this means is that GMs and/or guides establish quests and storylines and get people involved in them. ]</i></font><br><br>These can and do occur, quite regularly. Of course, unlike pen and paper games where four or five people are sitting around a table with one guy directing the dynamic content, EQ has 265K+ subscribers in nearly every country in the world. Though we'd like to be able to provide a "DM" to every group of people for the purpose of generating dynamic content directly for them, finances don't allow it, at least not for $10 per month. The Holy Grail for every MMORPG, both present and future, is to give people the feeling of a dedicated DM. Small MUDs can sometimes do it, but no game of this scale really can. This is one of the reasons that player-run events are so popular. The player can create their own dynamic content for themselves and their fellow players. Check out some of the news sites. There are usually a dozen or so player-groups doing this every week. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Next, hybrids. Why is this concept so difficult in EQ? When I first signed up, it never even occurred to me to be anything but a ranger. Ever since I started reading the boards, I have seen very little to show me that this was a smart choice. ]</i></font><br><br>I'd recommend against letting others on the internet decide for you how you feel about things. I read a post from a guy here a couple of weeks ago. He'd played the game for three months, had a wonderful time the entire time he was playing. Someone referred him to the boards, and a couple of weeks later he quit. He got the impression that somehow something must have been wrong with him judging by the amount of negativity on these boards. He was having the time of his life, until he let someone else tell him how he should feel. Decide for yourself. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Nerfing - Why does this even occur? If there is a problem with a certain class/object/spell/race, fix it. Lessening a skill/ability/person because there is a problem does not address the problem.]</i></font> <br><br>Sometimes nerfing is the *result* of fixing the problem. Nerfing is simply making something less powerful or useful than it was in the past. Though painful, it is sometimes necessary. As game designers, though it would be more popular, we cannot allow ourselves to get into a situation where we exclusively *UP* the power of things in the game in order to make up for an imbalance. If one item is too powerful, we often won&#8217;t get into a situation where we have to A) provide weapons of higher power to everyone else in the game B) then up the power of the NPCs in the game to make up for the fact that everyone is now more powerful. Nerfing is sometimes the best choice for the health of the game. At other times, the best choice is enhancement. <br><br>We will do whatever we feel is the best choice for the issue at hand, and it will usually be the choice that affects the least number of people. <br><br>As an example of how perceived &#8220;mudflation&#8221; occurs, take a look at the &#8220;rangers plight&#8221;. Six months ago, everyone (meaning, other melee characters) were all complaining about how powerful the ranger was, and how it was our &#8220;pet class&#8221; since it&#8217;s fairly well known that Brad plays one. Six months later, rangers are now complaining about how bad they are. No negative change has been made to the core ranger class. What happened? Some other classes received enhancements whereas the rangers didn&#8217;t. This &#8220;imbalanced&#8221; the ranger class in the eyes of many who play them. They feel that they&#8217;ve been nerfed even though no negative change has been made to the class. They now want to be enhanced based upon the perception that they are no longer as powerful in relation to other classes as they once were. This is the danger of mudflation. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Customer service - It seems to border somewhere between being a sick joke and an active campaign by VI to tick as many people off as possible. I got stuck in a doorway in Felwithe because of some glitch. I could not do anything. I petitioned and it took almost 1/2 hour before a GM showed up. They did nothing. ]</i></font><br><br>If a GM showed up and &#8220;did nothing&#8221;, there&#8217;s a good chance that it was an apprentice guide, since they do not have the powers that a full Guide or GM does (e.g. the power to unstick you). I do apologize for it taking a half an hour to &#8220;show up&#8221;. Keep in mind that there are a bunch of people on the server, all of them expecting the same level of service as the next guy. Though you&#8217;ve only petitioned two times in your EQ career, there are many that petition hourly for one issue or another. <br><br>We do the best that we can to provide you with the best customer service we can for a $10 per month fee, and we continue to improve the service regularly. Though I wish we could change this, there will always, however, be people who feel that they have received poor service, and will take their issue to the public. Many of these situations arise out of unrealistic expectations about what GMs and Guides can or should do. I think that perhaps one of the more pressing issues to be addressed by customer-service at this time is to help the players understand the situations in which they can expect customer-service help. Hopefully if we can do this, we can cut down the number of requests that we have to deny, giving more time to address the issues that we have some control over. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: is not meant to be flamer, just honest criticism and a search for answers. ]</i></font><br><br>And I do indeed thank you for posting your thoughts. I hope that my responses have been helpful.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057054.html"><b>Unforseen Consequences</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Unforseen consequence of high lvl spell restrictions?  Question: Does the Divine Aura effect of a Shiny Brass Idol have a lvl restriction?]</i></font> <br><br>We have the ability to attach level restrictions to effects on items, whether those items proc (fire randomly, like when a weapon strikes the target), or the item is activatable (like jboots). The "effect limit" on items is seperate from the level requirements (and race/class restrictions) on the underlying spell. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/055984.html"><b>Pain & Suffering Messages</b></a><br>The "pain and suffering" messages indicate that you are dying from an indirect source, such as by bleeding to death or by a DOT spell. For instance, if a necro loads up Call of Bones, and lets it kill him, the "Pain and Suffering" messages will precede the death. <br><br>It's not a bug, just how we portray indirect deaths.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057049.html"><b>Lycanthropy </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Remember the old RPG "Daggerfall?" If you were attacked by a werewolf and survived, you were infected with the disease of lycanthropy, and every full moon, changed into a werewolf.   That would be pretty nifty.]</i></font><br><br>We played with the idea of Lycanthropy in early beta, but decided not to implement it in game at that time. It would be neat though :)</UL>

I received the following from Mordeki:<BLOCKQUOTE>torms billowed beneath a malevolent sky. Mordeki's steed could barely<br>be seen within the fold of night, black upon black. His long ebon cloak<br>shielded his obsidian armor, and a cowl tapered his sinisterly chiseled<br>features. He spurred his steed forward as he descended the valley in the<br>Rathe mountains to where he saw the encampment's glowing embers that<br>burned into the midnight sky.<br><br>Sometime later the proud shadow knight of the House of Dra'Vedd stood<br>before the old crone, Madame Eva. "tell me what you see..." he inquired<br>as he sat across the table from the gypsy. Odd trinkets hung throughout<br>the wagon. Skulls, swirling beakers that overflowed with mists, charms,<br>sigils, and other strange things that laid trapped in the confines of<br>jars and other containers.<br><br>Upon a velvet cushion the crytal ball filled with a smokey hue. "I see<br>the son of hate will rise up. He is strong and his hands run red with<br>blood. His one is touched with a particular venom", she spoke with her<br>eyes focused still upon the smokey sphere. She stammered a bit,<br>"Vengefull spirits from the beyond..."<br><br>The cowl concealed the features of the Teir Dal whose hate began to<br>boil, "Bah I do not have time for spirits...tell m of the book...I must<br>have it...". The dark elves lips turned upwards in a snarl beneath the<br>hood of his cloak as his hatred mounted. It was then a cold wind blew<br>through the wagon. An inky cloud of blackness filled the wagon and their<br>was silence.<br><br>Mordeki sat atop a hill overlooking the encampment, a black bound tome<br>folded under one arm covered with the face of what seemed a groaning<br>spirit carved out of its "hide" cover. The flash of crimson orbs and<br>haunting laughter filled the air as the child of Dar'Vedd crossed<br>spurred his steed into the night and vanished into its embrace.<br><br>In the wagon the sage gypsy muttered her last breath of life. "I curse<br>you son of Dra'Vedd...may the eye of Mal'Arigar swollow you whole with<br>the unborn son of the futures wrath...", she gurgled past dying<br>lips...and faded into the void of death.<br><br>Off on the horizon were two brothers, both the heads of armies. One who<br>embraced Hate and the other Valor. Now would be the dark lord to come,<br>and his army would bring damnation in its wake. The cursed son of a<br>misbegotten house...and now the servant of armageddon itself. This was<br>the future...and written upon it were not just the dogs of war, but the<br>demons who preyed upon them.<br><br>Mordeki Dra'Vedd<br>Fist of Hate<br>"may his hate make you strong"</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Here's some late night posts Gordon Wrinn made a few minutes ago on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056230-2.html"><b>Archery</b></a><br>Archery was designed as a secondary form of combat. It was not meant to be more important or useful than melee combat or spell-casting. I understand that there are a lot of people out there that want to see it as a primary form of combat, seeing themselves as "archers", but that is not how we intended archery to be used in Norrath. <br><br>That said, there are some bows in game that do quite a fair amount of damage allowing someone to step back and take a few pot shots from time to time, but it won't replace melee.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056669.html"><b>Quest Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: - The balance of the human monk sash/headband quests]</i></font> <br><br>There is no "balance" of sash/headband quests to implement. The ones that people were getting by killing off the guildmaster were artifacts from some old quests. <br><br>As for the other two issues you've brought up, I'll refer them to the test team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056706.html"><b>Dragon Poll Complaint</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I really Don't understand why you designed the poll the way you did... You basically force people to vote, even though they might no have issue with the current topic or understand it.]</i></font> <br><br>That's why a "I don't know/no opinion" option was presented. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Only the people that it effects should be able to vote on it. How is a level 5 newbie supposed to know about a dragon raid? do you think he cares? It is most likely he doesn't and he will just by pass it.]</i></font> <br><br>That level 5 "newbie" might be affected by it someday so has as much of a right to have his opinion heard as the people who are directly and immediately affected.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056671.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The Hole opens, and the players respond with "yeaah! Another place to kill!". Is it just me, or should the opening of the hole be a big event in the world of norrath?]</i></font> <br><br>It was a "big event" as you suggest. Several things happened all over Norrath across all the servers in the days leading up to the opening of the Hole. I am sorry that you missed them.</UL>

Gordon started an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056704.html">interesting new thread</a> on PvP.  Here's the complete post from the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>I often get email from a few folks who make some very good arguments concerning risk in PvP. Basically, the standpoint is that if the environment does not contain risk, there is no sense in engaging in it. "Item loot" itself does not handle this risk, as players of casting classes are not affected to the same extreme as melee characters. <br>One argument is that we should implement experience-loss in PvP. I like this idea, unfortunately some core issues with the way life in EQ works makes implementing this unreasonable. For anything that couldn't be handled in code, an additional load would be placed on the CS staff. Believe it or not, even though people playing on PvP servers should be more tolerant of interaction with other players, 90% of the petitions there are for some kind of perceived harassment. <br><br>The core EQ system, meaning, the things that define EQ as EQ, do not allow some of these issues to be resolved without drastically changing the PvE portion of the game which we want to remain intact.<br><br>That said, I still firmly believe that some form of risk associated with PvP needs to be in game. Since that risk cannot be experience-based, and item-based risk doesn't hurt people who can bag their items or fight without them, I'm considering the following option: Making it so that everyone, regardless of class, can only bind in cities on the PvP Servers only.<br><br>City-only binding (again, on PvP servers only) would allow people to, for instance, eject an opposing force from a zone, and provide the additional risk of making all of them run back to recover their corpse and engage again. <br><br>What are your thoughts on this? Do you feel that PvP needs more real and equal risk associated with it regardless of class? <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056704.html">Click here</a> to go to this thread.

Gordon was back in full swing on the Gameplay Board today.  Here's the lowdown on all his latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056573.html"><b>"My Sky Quest items are gone!"</b></a><br>Though I'm not aware of any specific quests that have been changed up there, there is an ongoing plan to revisit the stats on the quest items, which may very well lead to the quests themselves being revamped. If a quest has been changed, it's very likely that items that were components for those quests might be removed or replaced with new items. In these cases, the items removed are probably ancillary in nature.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056585.html"><b>Keep Ralloz Zek Item Lootable</b></a><br>We indeed plan to keep Rallos Zek as it is for the foreseeable future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056637.html"><b>Verant's Customers</b></a><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I have read interviews where Verant thinks its customers are satisfied with the level of service they receive along with the quality of product they purchase on a monthy basis. ]</i></font><br><br>Generally, yes, I would agree that most people are satisfied by virtue of the fact that they continue to be customers and continue to recommend EQ to their friends. In addition, the last poll we conducted on the subject actually surprised us with how many individual people expressed satisfaction when given a specific intent to express otherwise. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: My question to you Verant is this, Why then do some many people flame Verant on this board?]</i></font> <br><br>Human psychology. People are more likely to get worked up and post about something that upsets them than they are about something that pleases them. People who are happy with the game are often too busy playing it to come here to the boards. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I can hardly find a nice thing being said about EQ or Verant. ]</i></font><br><br>Those posts are here, but the way the thread system works has the most controversial issues constantly being moved to the front page. Go back about 50 pages and see how many positive posts you see. <br><br>Also, check out other sites that we (Brad and I) do not post to regularly. You actually get some good discussions going on about various issues with very few of the flames that are popular here. I frequently go out and read these other boards to "get my bearings" when I get the feeling that what is so often portrayed here is the norm. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Here is my take on the problem. First off, you are using the stick to motivate players. Nerfs, EXP. losses post 50, slow EXP climbs and lack of bug fixes, customer support, etc.]</i></font> <br><br>Given the choice of only the "stick" or the "carrot", as your title mentions, I would say that we actually provide more carrot than stick. There is always more to do in EverQuest. More items to get, new spells to learn, new quests to complete, and other classes that haven't been played. We provide so much stuff to do that no one will ever experience all of the diversity that EverQuest has to offer. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: At level 50+ you camp EXP. Thats right, sit down and kill/kill/kill just to see your exp bar move a pixel]</i></font> <br><br>I'm a little dismayed that people continue to do this. Prior to levels above 50 being attainable, people did not "camp EXP" at level 50. They were happy to have fun and play the game at level 50 with the general understanding that they would never advance. All of a sudden we open up levels above 50, and everyone goes in XP camp mode. Why? There's no point to it. If they just played the game the same way that they were playing it once they reached 50, they would find themselves advancing. <br><br>I guess that it's the mindset that the "carrot" in this case encourages. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Nerfs. Why so many for all the wrong reasons? Instead of coding something properly we get unannounced nerfs. Then Verant wonders why people flame them? I don't understand. Throw a cold bucket of water on me while I am sleeping and I can guarantee I will not be a happy person.]</i></font> <br><br>We don't enjoy nerfing anything. Players will always figure out things that we didn't intend. Let's face it, players have far more people "on the job" than we do. We don't enjoy nerfing, and we do enjoy enhancing. However, enhancing or nerfing exclusivly will break the game quickly. Many are fond of quoting this article titled "Mudwimping", which advocates exclusive enhancements. There's a term for that as well that the author doesn't mention: Mudflation. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Verant, I truly think you have a great game. I think it needs alot of work to be one of the all time great games. Remeber to use the carrot and not the stick and I bet your reputation will come back full swing. I also would be willing to bet that me/us will once again truly enjoy a great game. ]</i></font><br><br>Though I didn't agree with some of your assertions, I would like to thank you for taking the time to express your opinions. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056642.html"><b>Login Poll Question</b></a><br>Currently we get just raw results from the polls. We don't store the answers or attach them to user accounts for later reference. I'd personally like to see some more robust demographic info, providing that reasonable guidelines can be established for determining a demographic. I'd really love to be able to cross-reference poll data against things such as /played time, servers played on, etc. <br><br>The downsides to this however might be that doing this would actually skew the results of a poll, as some people might be hesitant to answer in a certain way if they thought we were storing or analyzing responses. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056370.html"><b>Poison Revamp Status</b></a><br>Hopefully this next patch assuming the test department signs off on it. There's still one coding bug that we need to solve before that will happen, but hopefully we can take care of it quicky. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056421.html"><b>Crocodiles & Caimians </b></a><br>People in the high-teens to low 20s go to oasis to clean up on some relatively easy experience that the crocodilians there provide. To contrast the easy singular combat provided by those creatures, there exists the danger of being engaged and killed by some agressive creatures that run through the zone now and again. People fighting there learn that this is part of the risk, and likewise learn to keep an eye out for such things. <br><br>It seems to be working out well overall. Perhaps I'm missing your point.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056492.html"><b>PoH Nerfed?</b></a><br>Sounds like you are just having some bad luck. We haven't touched the Plane of Hate in a couple of months, since the last time that we announced a change with it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056308-2.html"><b>SWO & Zones</b></a><br>Though I really can't comment on any specifics regarding SWO at this time, I would like to clarify that "Zones" does not mean "zones" in the EQ sense from the perspective of "zoning". You can count on SWO embracing the newest technology available in regards to world layout.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056291.html"><b>"Why won't enduring breathe protect me from suffucating spehere?"</b></a><br>Hehe, you have a point. I do wish that we had some more complex spell interactions than what we do in a few instances. I would personally like to see most magic have both positive and negative effects in various proportions. <br><br>That's the nice thing about magic systems, you no longer have to be constrained by the inflexible boundaries of reality.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056336.html"><b>Results of Dragon Poll</b></a><br>I'm not prepared to release the specific informaiton just yet. As our Monday meetings have been postponeed, we need to discuss the data and decide how to proceed, which won't happen until Wednesday of this week. <br><br>I will say that the numbers were in favor of the current arrangement, but not to the extent that we thought they would be. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056341.html"><b>Invalid Account Key Problem</b></a><br>Your account is still valid, you just need to resubscribe via the accounts section of the game login. You don't have to create a "new" account.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056197.html"><b>"PAW Loot Stinks!"</b></a><br>Ok, so you did a dungeon once and didn't get any "phat lewt". The question is, did you have more fun than you do when killing the same critter for hour upon hour?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056212.html"><b>Corpse Decay & the EQ Community</b></a><br>I don't agree with your assertion that you received bad customer support since corpses decay, that's how it works, and it's necessary in order to keep corpses from clogging up every area of the land. <br><br>That said, you've posted a wonderful example of how the player community often chips in to help out someone who's fallen on bad times. Your character must be rather well-known for being the upstanding sort considering all of the support you received from your fellow players. Kudos to you for showing how kindness will be repaid.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056219.html"><b>"A Game is Supposed to be Fun"</b></a><br>Though I realize that this post is rhetorical in nature, I would be intrigued if you could post a definition of "fun" that everyone playing the game can agree upon. The perception of "fun" is entirely subjective, meaning that it is different from each persons point of view. Some things that one person finds "fun" might be seen as "boring" or "frustrating" to another. Some people's idea of "fun" is directly in conflict with other people's ideas. <br><br>It's our job as game designers to try and provide an environment where the greatest number of people possible can have fun. <br><br>We certainly won't be able to please everyone in these regards, nor would we want to. For instance, there are some people in the online world who can only have "fun" if they are allowed to ruin the "fun" of others. We don't aim to cater to that player-type. <br><br>There are many types of "fun" that we provide and allow players the opportunity to take part in, and our subscription numbers show that we must be doing something right.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056196.html"><b>Highest 2Hand Slashing in Game</b></a><br>This is along the same lines as some of the cursed weapons that will be coming in game shortly. Though I can see a bunch of people complaining that the weapons are "useless", I think they will end up a lot of fun :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054790.html"><b>Increased Spell Fizzles?</b></a><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I have noticed lately that the number of spell fizzles that I have been having have increased]</i></font> <br><br>This has been a standard concern posted here to the boards every few weeks since I started at Verant 7 months ago. Just to clarify, we have not made any changes to the way fizzles work in at least that long. <br><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I have also noticed that my skills do not go up as frequently as before.

This is a normal part of leveling up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056041.html"><b>Fleshy Orb</b></a><br>Our test department checks these boards and have apparently identified the issue. Basically one of the zones that needed to be updated to get this quest working completely didn't get updated in the patch before last. Last week's patch didn't update any zone-data, so we should catch this in the next patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056097.html"><b>Paragraphs, Please</b></a><br>Please, by all means, use paragraphs to seperate differing ideas and thoughts. It makes reading through and addressing your concerns far easier. It's often very difficult to discern the points that are truly important to the author when reading through a BBOT (Big Block of Text). <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056183.html"><b>Test of Flight Logistics Concerns </b></a><br><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Having a fee of 10 plat for each level of your character may be fine for higher level characters, but it basically excludes any untwinked players below level 30 ish.]</i></font> <br><br>While I understand your concerns, we do need to have some method to limit the number of people entering the contests. By lowering the price and making it more affordable for everyone, the number of people wishing to participate will skyrocket. We then might have to look into limiting the number of people who can particpate, which then will open up an entirely new set of difficulties, such as us having to track who participates from week to week to insure that everyone gets their chance.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056187.html"><b>Race Balance</b></a><br>I've always found these numbers pretty interesting and encouraging. It shows that there is some hope for roleplaying out there after all. It's nice to see that everyone didn't flock to the race perceived to be the most powerful as a rule. </UL>

The <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid962063667,24120,">Reader Responses for <i>The Bottom Line</i></a> article published last week have been posted at <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/lore/shadoe/">Shadoe's Corner</a>.  As you may recall, <i>The Bottom Line</i> dealt with many issues concerning customer support, the Test Server incident and more.  Here's a blurb:<UL><b>Oh yeah, re: "capitalism at iits finest." Capitalism is competition in a free market <br>place. Verant "not caring" is not "capitalism at its finest." Capitalism at its finest <br>would be several companies like Verant competing for the same consumer dollar. <br>The only other kid on the block right now is Ultima Online, which isn't really <br>competiton in the sense that it's not as active a member in the "MMRPG" <br>community anymore. You're talking about a "monopoly." </b><br><br>One... I never said Verant didn't care. On the contrary, I said they do care about their players as a community, <i>questioning</i> whether they cared for them as individuals, or even if they should.<br><br>Two... When did I say Verant not caring would be capitalism at its finest? For those like you who missed it, I'll summarize: It's the freedom of the consumer to cancel his (or her) account that is capitalism at its finest. It's increased competition that will make the bottom line serve the online gamer. I suggest reading that part again, sir, because I simply can't fathom how any other message could come out of those two paragraphs.<br><br>And, no, Verant does not hold a monopoly. The market is just very narrow at the moment. Besides, this is <i>entertainment</i>. People will pay for it so long as it serves their purposes to do so. This being the case, a monopoly in this regard would really be bordering on futility.</UL>  Check it out!

From Catalyst:<BLOCKQUOTE>We've just put up a new issue of <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> here at Everlore. This weeks responses deal with the lack of clothing on some of EQ's female models, bad english skills, suggestions for new models, and many other things discussed. Interesting and entertaining read as always, here's a snip.     <Blockquote><i>    I found it rather interesting that you didn't even bother to comment on the lack of clothing on EverQuest characters. You did             mention that it was in fact a female who pushed for characters to have tight, hard bodies and healthy endowments, but failed to     notice and or comment that it is possible for beautiful people to wear clothing and still be beautiful. I am just a little tired of all the     male teenagers, who obviously have never gotten within ten feet of a real woman, constantly making comments about my             barbarian's *healthy endowment*.<P>     A female barbarian wishing for a really large cloak to hide in.     </blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE></i>

Saroeb Na'Myraen sent me a detailed report of his company's adventures in the latest lands to be discovered in Norrath called <i>The Hole</i>.  To read this report please <b>highlight</b> the following area with your mouse cursor, it has been blanked out due to possible spoiler content:<BLOCKQUOTE><font color=white>11 bold adventurers consisting of<br><br>Growls, Druid (54)<br>Kenzan, Druid (53)<br>Dykitana, Druid (52) I think<br>Polynices, Enchanter (53)<br>Easier , Rogue (51)<br>Stannis, Paladin (49)<br>Morganfox, Bard (40)<br>Lilyana, Cleric (50)<br>Luvin, Druid (53)<br>and me Saroeb , Wizard (47)<br><br>Ventured into the Hole the day after Patch day. The door is pickable by a rogue<br>and you zone into a small pool of water.<br><br>Upon swimming up you will encounter a corridor which is guarded by 2 elemental<br>warriors. Taking these down was not to tough and there are a few more elementals<br>along the way, occasionally a Rock Golem (which looks like a giant Muddite).<br>Going through a rocky corridor you come to a small courtyard type<br>place which leads up to a small Guardhouse. In the distance you can just see<br>some parapets of a castle.<br><br>Inside the guardhouse was a mob called Gabantik, had a few chuckles about that,<br>and several friends. Rock Golem, Elementals etc.<br><br>We cleared the guardhouse with suprising ease considering the Rock Golems summon<br>you  and have a whole pile of Hitpoints. The elementals we encountered<br>were only of the warrior type. The guardhouse has a door at the back of it which<br>leads out onto a bridge which connects to the top floor of the castle, this was<br>not<br>pickable and said you needed a key. More on this later.<br><br>We decided to venture on. Hugging the left wall we discovered a ramp which led<br>down and down and down and ended in a small drop. This is the point of no return<br>and so we all jumped taking minimal damage. We then proceeded to pull from the<br>side of this huge castle. Looking up we saw the bridge spanning the courtyard<br>area.<br><br>We pulled the first room clear, elementals mainly and a Flighty Fiend or two,<br>which looks like a big Fire Imp.<br><br>The elementals came in many different classes, Elemental Wizard, Bejewelled<br>Elemental (which dropped Loam Sleeves +5 int very nice), Elemental Vizier,<br>and others I cannot remember the names of.<br><br>Proceeding into the castle we made our way onwards and upwards encountering more<br>and more , rock golems, elementals and even some very amusing but<br>painful Rat Warriors hehe.<br><br>We kept on up the castle, even had a GM visit us to congratulate us on getting<br>so high up the castle. We got right to the top of the castle to the<br>aforementioned bridge. This was something of a major achievement in itself as we<br>weren't exactly the most balanced of groups but we were rocking and having a<br>real good time.<br><br>So we get to the bridge, clearing a throne room type area beforehand, thinking<br>we could go across the bridge and out through the Guardhouse again. We cleared<br>the guard house. Incidentally you can't fall off the bridge nor the castle<br>walls, nor can you cast levitate in this dungeon. Tried to open the door from<br>inside the guardhouse that would lead us back to where we started and it<br>wouldn't open. Couldn't be picked either and asked for a key.<br><br>So we figured we'd journey back down the castle again as the way up had been<br>relatively easy.<br><br>We made it down as far as the second floor and then the Castle must of decided<br>it had had enough of us as things came from all over. Basically my group of 6<br>was wiped out before we even had a chance to hit evac, the other 4 managed to<br>evac.<br><br>Figuring we weren't that far in we thought the Corpse Recovery would be<br>relatively easy, and there was another group there with 3 tanks enchanter,<br>healer and druid hunting at the zone so we called on them for some help and<br>assistance. So we started to fight our way in again same as before, and the<br>castle just didn't<br>seem to behave as well as it had on the way up. Things spawned from all over and<br>mauled all the parties.<br><br>In the end it took over 5 hours corpse recovery many high level people lost<br>their lives to rescue our fallen adventurers, and even then we had to get a<br>necromancer,  Tinnel *hugs*, to summon the last 4 corpses.<br><br>In summary, it was a great zone to hunt in, I don't know whether its been<br>programmed that way to lure you in then totally wipe you out. But I have never<br>seen<br>a dungeon change its spawning patterns so quickly and where all the mobs came<br>from god only knows.<br><br>As far as loot was concerned we got some nice items but to be honest it was the<br>thrill of adventure that made it and we all had a blast despite the 5hr CR.<br><br>I think we may possibly be the first to clear the castle and get all the way to<br>the top on our server at least.<br><br>Thanks to all involved in CR.<br><br>And I'll send you some piccies too to show you our ascent all the way later<br>this week when we've sorted through the several hundred we took! :)<br><br>Saroeb Na'Myraen<br>Naked Wizard<br>Quellious Server<br><br>Too many guilds involved to list em all as we're one big happy family  on<br>Quellious *grin*</font></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Saroeb!

Lirolio sends the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>    Greetings citizens of Norrath.<br><br>As The Norrathian Senate of the <br>Cazic-Thule server nears its completion and will soon become fully <br>operational it is now time to begin our nominations for the rulers of cities. <br> To make your nominations go to our message board located <A HREF="http://www.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=norrathiansenate">here</A>.  <br><br>Once there you post a topic saying so and so for city name leader.  You then need <br>to have three people backing that person up and they have to accept it.  Once <br>that happens they will be entered in the final election.  We will take <br>nominations for the next three weeks or until we feel we have enough <br>nominations for each city.  We encourage all citizens of The Senate to vote <br>when the time comes.  <br><br>    Lirolio Silverwood<br>    Officer of The Alliance of Druids<br>    Norrathian Senate Press Secretary</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Ariel sent us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>This last weekend, Legacy of Steel traveled to the Plane of Air. We fought from island to island, overcoming each obstacle in our path. On Island 4, we defeated the undefeated Overseer of Air. After this, we carefully set foot on Sprioc Island. After one of the most epic battles these eyes have ever seen, LoS was able to clear the Sprioc Guardian and the Spiroc Lord. Island 6 was next. There we encountered the Bzzzzats (huge flying wasps). This was our biggest challenge to date in the guild. The dangerous wasps overcame us several times as we attempted to defeat the boss of the island Bazzzt Zzzt. Bazzzt can hit a person for over 800 points of damage in a single attack and can coat the island entirely in a cloud of disease. After 2 attempts, we were able to overcome her. Battle-worn and weary, we used our keys and stepped upon the Seventh Island&#8230; LoS has now gone where no one has ever gone before. We were amazed by flying drakes and the majestic Sphinx which guards a foreboding temple at the center of the island. With our collective energies sorely depleted, we decided to save the island for the next day&#8230; Now we are one island away from the Hand of Veeshan himself&#8230;<br><br>Ariel<br>55th Level Warrior and<br>GM of Legacy of Steel<br>The Nameless<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa5.jpg">Screenshot #5</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa6.jpg">Screenshot #6</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/poa7.jpg">Screenshot #7</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is with a heavy heart that I report that my beloved, The Lady of the<br>AnDarim, has been ruthlessly kidnapped! I awoke three mornings ago, in the<br>beautiful city of Qeynos, to find the bed empty next to me, she was gone<br>without a trace. No tracks, no clues, nothing, it is as if she had vanished<br>into thin air.  I immediately shouted for my loyal guards outside my<br>chambers, and to my horror I found them laying unconscious outside my<br>bedroom door.  I rang the alarm bell throughout the keep, and called a<br>council with my most trusted advisors.  It is here that I assembled six of<br>the finest members of The AnDarim to venture forth into Norrath and find<br>Lady Tornyth.<br><br>It has now been 3 days, and I have heard nothing from my search party, it<br>seems they too have disappeared.  It is now that I call upon the noble<br>travellers and mercernaries of Qeynos and it's surroundings to come to me<br>and aid me in my search. Those that find her shall be rewarded personally<br>from me, Lord Caleryn.  It is with great hope that i recieve as much help as<br>possible, for I believe that there isn't much time before something horrible<br>happens to my lady, if indeed that hasn't happened already. I hope that my<br>plea for help shall be answered and Lady Torynth returned safely to my side.<br><br>[OOC: This roleplaying, story driven event shall commence on Tuesday, June<br>27th at 9:00pm Eastern Standard Time congregating at the Main Gate in<br>Qeynos. It is optimized (Due to locations)for levels 8-13 characters (and<br>corpse retrieval service will be provided for that level range only), but<br>anyone lower than 8 is welcome to try (though those higher than 13 are<br>excluded), you also must understand the danger of such a mission.<br><br>There will be prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place as follows:<br>1st: A Full Suit of Banded AND a Full Suit of Raw Silk armor AND one pair<br>of + 2 int rings or +2 wis rings (winners choice)<br>2nd: A Combine Scimitar AND a Runed Totem Staff AND the remaining pair of +<br>2 int rings or +2 wis rings<br>3rd: 20pp AND a Minotaur Ax<br>Once 9:00pm hits, I shall give further instructions on the quest.
