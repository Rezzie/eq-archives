Gordon stopped by the boards twice this afternoon and posted the following:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022338.html"><b>Abashi's Friends Get "Special" Favors?</b></a><br>While I do have about 7 former co-workers playing EverQuest, none of them play on Terris, nor have any of them gotten any "special favors". <br><br>My friends have never and would never ask for anything special, as real friends know better than to do anything of that nature.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022428.html"><b>Tuning Meeting Update & Spear of Fate</b></a><br>Our offices are closed today for the Holiday. That said, I did speak with some guys concerning the proc, which as it turns out was intentional. Regarding the stat makeup, it's far more correct to say that the stats on the cleric item are too good, rather than the shaman one not being good enough. We'll speak more about possibly adjusting the stats of the shaman weapon, but if we decide to do it, stats will be moved around rather than increased. In other words, if wis and mana go up, something else has to go down.</UL>

In what could probably be called one the closing act of this drama, Mystere <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=7192109&replies=8">posted to our Brell Serilis Board</a> to let the community know about the phone chat he/she had with Verant CEO John Smedley:<UL><i>Greetings- <br><br>I have just gotten off the phone with John Smedley of Verant Interactive. He and I have spoken at length regarding the issues at hand here. I would like to add that there are many issues here that Verant is dealing with that even I was not aware of in the past. <br><br>While I will not go into the details of our discussion, I will say that we have come to an agreement regarding what has occurred in the past week. <br><br>To any who are getting their hopes up, I sadly will not be returning to EverQuest. While I harbor no ill will to any involved, I feel it is past time that I move on. I wish to thank everybody I have been associated with for their help, and their friendship (to those whose friendship I may have garnered). <br><br>To those who have been defending me so staunchly thus far: <br><br>Thank you, I can never express the amount of appreciation to each of you. You all fought the fight I could not, and for that I salute you all. I now ask that we take a deep breath, step back, and get back to that which we have enjoyed thus far. <br><br>Thank you. <br><br>P.S. Feel free to forward this to as many people as you can. <br><br>P.P.S. Also consider this a formal request by the author to stop posting the story without my permission. Thank you. <br><br>editor's note: I would like to add that Mr. Smedley personally apologized for the way this was handled. He also went so far as to tell me that Verant is currently developing policies to detail exactly what is and is not acceptable for fan fiction, and the acceptable consequences of breaking those policies. </i></UL><b>Quick Update:</b> As I was reading through the thread, I found one last post Mystere made in this thread that I think some of you may be interested in:<UL><i>To clarify: I was NOT paid off, I was NOT threatened in any way. We had an excellent conversation in which I basically got what I was looking for: a sincere apology and the promise that any future issues of this sort would not be handled in such a drastic manner. </I></UL>

John Smedley and Brad McQuaid made a few more comments <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021999.html">on the thread they started on the Gameplay Board</a>.  Here's the first bit from Smed:<UL><i>Next, yes.. we admit there was a quest in EQ that went a little far and we're taking out that part. It was a mistake and it's being fixed. <br><br>John Smedley</i></UL>Followed by Brad:<UL><i>I just wanted to quickly address the 14 seasons issue... I'm definitely not trying to stir up a new argument, or validate a tangent, but I did want people to understand how many people, even EQ players, could come to the conclusion that this person being raped was a child. <br><br>The following are the two sentences using this wording: <br><br>"The pitiful Teir&#8217;Dal girl, barely into her 14th season didn&#8217;t even try to resist. Xyth had bought her flesh 13 seasons ago, and long ago she had <br>learned the pain associated with even the appearance of resistance." <br><br>You do see her also refered to as a girl (also, later, a slave-girl). Now, whether the seasons are literal seasons, years, or EQ levels, I don't know for certain -- the evidence isn't conclusive, and you'd have to ask the author. But I do submit many people could and would interpret the subject as being a child. <br><br>-Aradune </i></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Verant CEO John Smedley sent me a letter regarding the banning of Mystere at 12:04 AM this morning:<UL><i>I've seen the outcry regarding the banning of Mystere. While we typically do<br>not discuss this, I would like to elaborate on several things surrounding<br>this in order to address legitimate concerns raised by our playerbase.<br>It is very important for everyone concerned to understand that EverQuest's<br>reputation is a very important thing. In this day and age, video games are<br>subjected to an ENORMOUS amount of scrutiny by watchdog groups and the<br>federal and state governments.<br><br>In this case, a parent complained to a lot of anti-child porn watchdog sites<br>and several mainstream media outlets regarding the extremely graphic detail<br>of the story and the fact that it apparently contained violence directed at<br>a child. <br><br>For us, this poses an extremely serious problem. EverQuest has a reputation<br>as being a family oriented game. Yes it has a mature rating, and yes it does<br>contain violence. That in and of itself gives pause to many people out there<br>(especially parents). But, you would be amazed at how many parents play this<br>game with their kids mostly because we do control the language and they feel<br>like EQ is a family friendly environment despite the dark overtones of some<br>of the stories and quests.<br><br>You may say "a person has the right to say whatever they want"... and of<br>course that's true. But, when that action is linked to a company's<br>Intellectual Property (which is just a fancy way of saying people associate<br>it with EQ) it becomes our business because it threatens our business by<br>making us a huge target for all the folks out there that think we all are<br>all a bunch of violent video game players. This just gives them fuel for the<br>fire.<br><br>For us, this story represented a serious problem because it used EverQuest<br>as a backdrop. It's already been pointed out by our General Counsel in more<br>legal terms, but the simple fact is that it's easy for folks to point at<br>that story, point at EQ and link the two. <br><br>Whether or not any of us likes that or not isn't really the question. The<br>fact is that EverQuest is the very heart of our business and we have to take<br>that very seriously.<br><br>Now - Will we be policing the Internet looking for these kinds of stories? <br><br>No. We won't. In fact, none of us was even aware of this until it was<br>brought to our attention. That doesn't mean if someone crosses the line<br>again and it's pointed out we won't do the same thing.<br><br>The big question is - where's the line? And what right do we have to draw it<br>outside the game?<br><br>The answer is complicated and extremely subjective, so I'll just have to be<br>honest and say we'll know it when it's over the line. We're going to discuss<br>it in the upcoming few weeks and see if we can make it more clear, but I<br>can't honestly say if we'll get anywhere because none of us wants to stop<br>people from writing awesome fan-fiction about EQ.<br><br>But we aren't going to be looking at every fan site and becoming the Thought<br>Police. We have neither the time, nor the inclination to do that. However we<br>need to protect EverQuest's good image as best we can.<br><br>Did we handle this as well as we could have?<br><br>No - We didn't. And for that, I apologize.<br><br>In the future, we're going to handle this in a different way.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>Thank you for the letter, John!

Here's the Saturday edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href=""><b>Issues Addressed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: With this upping the ante on machine requirements, how do you get away with something like this by changing the minimum specifications listed on the box when one purchased this game?]</i></font> <br><br>It's not a change from the minimum system requirements. The original box required a D3D compliant video card. The definition of D3D compliant is what is changing per new drivers released by Microsoft. <br><br>These changes are necessary to remain competitive and provide EQ gamers what they expect: a game that is constantly being updated. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Verant refund people who bought the game based on what the box said only to find their game inoperable a year later? ]</i></font><br><br>I doubt that there will be many, if any people who are incapable of running EverQuest once the changes are made. Regarding what will be done in those cases should they exist, our legal department is still working out what our policy will be. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: These kinds of changes are done in releases of new products, I've never heard of a title in the past with this situation ]</i></font><br><br>EverQuest is in a unique situation as a constantly updated product that bridges technology generations. I think that its reasonable that gamers would expect that the product would keep pace with current technology. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) In game chat channels, kind of like shouts, but with a channel like a CB channel ]</i></font><br><br>We've addressed your suggestion here before, when it was made by others. The technology requirements to support an infinite number of separate chat channels would be quite extensive. It's not likely a change that will be implemented. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Why has Povar never been split? Is there a technical reason behind this? It is one of the older servers, it is always very crowded and not once has it had a split. There are not many of the older servers that can claim this now, and I'm very curious why the Povar server appears to have been continually overlooked. ]</i></font><br><br>There are other servers as old (and older I believe) than Povar. Simply, it's not been one of the most populated servers at the time we were sampling server populations when making the decision as to which servers will be split. I understand that everyone wants to see their server get split, and every time we do one we see posts from people on the servers that weren't chosen wanting to know why we didn't choose to split theirs. It's simply a matter of numbers. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Why can't players heal people who are linkdead yet people who are linkdead can still be harmed by npcs? You are concerned about people pulling the plug, but why not consider the zone they're in? ]</i></font><br><br>It's part technology and part philosophy. The technology side is that players who are linkdead are essentially NPCs, with a lot of case-specific coding to handle things such as offensive spells and other things. Beneficial spells do not directly translate through that process. The philosophy side of it is that we never want going linkdead to be a preferable situation. NPCs already react differently to linkdead PCs than they do played ones, reducing the danger somewhat. Reducing the danger further would upset that balance and create an undesirable situation.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021745.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Will the mobs in the game be adjusted now that haste has been 'fixed' and players now deal out less damage that what the mobs were designed to take? ]</i></font><br><br>No, they continue to be appropriate. I guess you are probably wondering how that can be the case :)  You see, mid level encounters were not typically tested with a haste item and a haste spell, but one or the other, since mid-level groups are more free-form in their makeup than the high level ones. <br><br>The high level groups were typically tested with max-haste, in the form of an item plus a spell. Now we didn't know at the time that any item plus any spell yielded max, but testing with max was still our intent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) While we're on haste, can you please try to look into, and explain why the Swirle Spine Belt, which is considerable harder to get than the FBSS, has less haste than the FBSS?(and you wounder why kedge is always so empty...) ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not sure that it is less haste. The players determined all of the haste numbers by analyzing data in the log. That process has more than a few problem, as I've yet to see a list of haste items and percentages posted by a player that was correct. Not even the lineup of the items has been correct. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:3) Was the "toning down" of high speed 2 hander weapons intended to also hurt the Swiftblade, or mainly the moss covered branch? maybe drop the delay at which the damage bonus was weakened to under the swiftblade dly if this wasn't the intent? (no, I don't have a ranger, but do have some ranger friends ]</i></font><br><br>It was intended to catch any weapon below a specific speed (28), so if the Swiftblade is in that range, then yes. Keep in mind however that the adjustment was rather small, yielding only a couple points of damage per hit. We probably could have gotten away without annoucning it, but it was on the list of types of changes that I've told everyone that I would announce. I do fear that the announcement of it however has made it a bigger issue than it needed to be. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5) Are mobs that attack people who AREN'T kos to Venril Sathir, yet are obvously his minions considered bugged.. or ever planned to be 'fixed'.. ? ]</i></font><br><br>They aren't 'broken'. The dungeons are designed so that they won't be completely safe, even for people who are in his good graces. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Will the reasoning behind the Venril Sathir story line ever be totally explained? ]</i></font><br><br>There is a pretty good amount of the story revealed in game for those willing to search for it. As for the unrevealed portions, I'd say that this is a good possibility. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Is\Will\Do you feel there should be alternate ways for non Kunark owners to obtain their particle weapon?]</i></font> <br><br>The Epic quest weapons are designed to be Level 60 weapons. They would often not be appropriate in the hands of someone who cannot exceed 50. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8) Any plans on putting the god Karana in the game soon...? revenge will be mine.. *grins* ]</i></font><br><br>Aradune is his Avatar. Feel free to challenge him to a duel should you see him online :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9) I believe there's an issue with factions.. when you hit the bottom of the main faction on a mob, you no longer get the other hits that are linked with it, example, kill dead frogs in lower guk for.. a long time, and you no longer get +livefrogs is this known and being looked into? or "working as intended" ]</i></font><br><br>I've heard this several times, I'll take this issue up next week. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: there have also been quite a few good changes made recently, things are going in the right direction for the most part I feel, keep up the good work ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for noticing, and we will :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021369.html"><b>Fan Faire Location</b></a><br>We plan to make the decision on the location within the next couple of weeks. Once we do we'll be sure to publicize it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021864.html"><b>"Verant Fixed Something"</b></a><br>/blush <br><br>I'm just happy that Hobart was able to find a problem. People have been saying that the spell was uncommonly rare for a while.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021898.html"><b>Name Changes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Clearly Dahlillama is a violation of this policy and the GM was no more rude or curt then was necessary to deal with me. In the end i'm just to unhappy to continue spending my free time playing this game. I played UO for 2 years so i know all about sinking free time into online games. Anyway this was my first character on my first server and i was always nice to everyone i met, including the GM who took away my name. ]</i></font><br><br>I am indeed sorry to lose you as a customer, but I do appreciate the fact that you understand our position. Bringing real-world figures or issues into the game often hampers immersiveness and does have the capacity to offend other players. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In the end i'm sure i was just looking for an excuse to stop playing this game and get back to taking care of my 200g saltwater reef tank (sorry fish! i'm coming home!) Just understand that i had no intention to quit until i was forced to change my name. ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, nice tank! My wife is a complete fish nut, and would be quite jealous. She spends most of her time online checking out tank-related sites. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021929.html"><b>Shaman Epic Quest Weapon</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 12 damage? 12 damage?]</i></font> <br><br>How many shaman melee for damage in the 50+ level range? Does the damage on it *really* matter? Sure, I'm sure that some jump in and take a few pokes, but they are certainly not doing an appreciable amount of damage through melee. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Only 30 mana/hp? clerics get 100 mana]</i></font> <br><br>I'll conceed that the stats are possibly a little out of whack, I'll check into it. It looks like this weapon may have gotten created and gone through the approval process prior to the time that we upped the power template for the items of this caliber. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The *proc* is a joke and doesnt help worth crap ]</i></font><br><br>The "proc" is not a joke, because it isn't a proc, but rather an activatable effect. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021872.html"><b>UI Suggestion</b></a><br>This probably isn't something that we would consider putting in. Coordinating to take down NPCs in a multiple NPC encounter requires certain talent and strategy, meaning that players have to learn how to work together to accomplish their goals. I doubt that this is something that we'd want to reduce the importance of. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021923.html"><b>Cheating</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If people want to cheat that is thier business.]</i></font> <br><br>No, it's the business of everyone playing the game. One of the reasons some people play MMOGs is for the competitive aspect. That aspect means nothing if people are able to gain a competitive advantage through means not available to other players. <br><br>Single player games contain cheats because it is truly only the players business in that case. Massively multiplayer games have to get everyone playing by the same set of rules for them to be successful. <br><br>If cheating were truly only the business of the person cheating, people wouldn't get worried about things such as dupe bugs, ebayers, showeq users, or perceived favoritism from the GM staff. It's obviously something that everyone is concerned about.</UL>

It was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2637913,00.html">reported last night that GameSpot</a> will be interviewing Verant Interactive regarding the "Mystere" banning incident.  Look for this upcoming interview Monday on their site.  Here's a clip from the report:<UL>n an official statement, a legal counsel to Sony Online stated that the issue is "about infringement of our intellectual property rights in a patently offensive manner that tarnishes the Sony, Verant, and EverQuest brands." The fan fiction is said to violate copyrights for the game, and Verant acted on this to initiate its banning procedure, which is used in cases of in-game cheating and misconduct. This is the first case where a fan-written story has drawn such a response from Verant, which reacted to the mature content of the story, describing the rape and subsequent escape of a young dark elf. Verant's actions have drawn an outcry from the EverQuest community, who charge that this is an excessive form of censorship, although Verant says this is not a First Amendment issue. <br><br>We have discussed the controversy with Verant and Sony Online, and Monday we will post an interview with the EverQuest team on the subject. </UL>

I want to have a extra day for EQ so I thought I would ask]</i></font> <br><br>There's a good chance that we won't be patching next week, but don't hold me to it yet :)  The client won't be patched for some time due to the DirectX changes, leaving only data on the server for the most part. If we do patch, it will probably be pretty quick.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021479.html"><b>Do you med faster at level 35?</b></a><br>Hehe, this is the first time I've seen the placebo effect work out in a positive way. Usually people are claiming that we make things slower causing others to observe the same thing. It's nice to see it go the other way once in a while :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021443.html"><b>More on "Waiting"</b></a><br>I guess it comes down to the question, why do people play EverQuest? Surely its not to kill things nonstop, as one can only keep that up for so long in EQ. There must be other facets, as a matter of individual opinion, that people enjoy. <br><br>The things that are viewed by some as restrictions are often the things that make the other aspects of the game possible. Were people able to kill nonstop with maximum efficiency, I would imagine that EQ would not have the following that it does today. <br><br>Socialization, making friends, and working together towards a common goal are very important to EverQuest. It however only occurs because we "force" it to occur via game design. I make that statement based upon the fact that there are other multiplayer (not necessarily massively multiplayer ones) that do support non-stop killing, and they don't have the following that EQ does.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017852.html"><b>Brownies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How can a sweet little brownie kill anyone?]</i></font> <br><br>You know what they say, big things come in small packages :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021375.html"><b>Died Due to Lag Last Night</b></a><br>The GMs were working late into the night to help with the cleanup following the router problem.

EverQuest appears to be headed to the Playstation 2.  <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/news/game_news_5221.html">Daily Radar is reporting</a> that Brad McQuaid, in a recent interview to PC Gamer, has publicly admitted this.  Here's a clip:<UL>"We're working on a massively multiplayer PlayStation 2 game [EverQuest]," admitted McQuaid, "and there are definitely a lot of questions: how do you patch, how do you communicate with others without a keyboard? I think it will end up being a very different game. Our first idea was to just port EverQuest to a console. It's like, no, we can take the same world and the same name, but it's not going to be the same game."</UL>The Playstation 2 made waves late last month when it was announced that initial shipment of PSX2s would be cut in half to 500,000.

Here's the latest quotes and excerpts that Gordon Wrinn has posted to the EQ Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021177.html"><b>Corrupted Threads</b></a><br>It starts getting really dangerous when it gets over 250, so Chris (Akriss) has been closing them down between when he sees them get over 200. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021180.html"><b>Highpass Crashing Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I do that, I managed to enter In High Hold Pass and I was at my bind point.( I checked my equipement(to know if I died)but I didnt, so the question is: Why I was at my bind point ]</i></font><br><br>In order to keep a zone problem from permanently locking players out (until the problem is fixed), the game will attempt to move you to your bind point after a given amount of time trying to enter a downed zone. <br><br>In the event that the zone your bindpoint is in is also down, it tries to move you to Qeynos (outside the gates).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021181.html"><b>Magicians and Fun</b></a><br>I'd like to see more "fun" spells for every class, but as I've mentioned before, we have to establish priorities for that sort of thing. At this point we're concentrating on content development that benefit a large number of people rather than neutral content like that mentioned here. <br><br>There's also the reaction that we frequently see when working on things that aren't considered "important" by some people here on th board. I'm sure that you've seen here on the boards complaints regarding things put in game where the author felt that we should be working on something more important.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021224.html"><b>Another GM Incident</b></a><br>These things take a judgement call. In the judgement of one GM further action was called for, whereas in the judgement of the other it wasn't. These issues are very rarely so black and white. Perhaps in one case it was a clear case of ninja-looting, and in the other it was one's word against the other. All sides of an issue are rarely brought to the public light as the one who is happy with the decision doesn't feel the need to come voice his opinion. <br><br>Getting a GM involved in your situation can result in one of two things: Either it goes your way or it doesn't. If it's the former, be happy that it wasn't the latter. In either case, we've got to move on. These issues are *always* going to be present.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021232.html"><b>Waiting...</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for my health bar to creep back. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider grouping with someone who can heal you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for my mana bar to refill. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider grouping with someone who can make that go faster. Also consider getting in a group that doesn't require you to expend that much mana. Often, a good group has virtually zero downtime. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for the boats. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider getting a group with teleportation capabilities. Failing that, try socializing with the other people waiting for the boat. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for that spawn to pop. ]</i></font><br><br>Consider moving around to find a spawn that's already popped. If they are all dead, consider going someplace that doesn't have as many people in it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING to zone. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, what can I say, we have to load data. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: WAITING for a bind because there's no caster in the zone. ]</i></font><br><br>Try forming a network of friends. If you are a sufficiently fun person to be around, you might find that people will go out of their way to help you. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't play games to WAIT. ]</i></font><br><br>Then consider playing the game in a fashion that reduces the amount of time that you have to wait. The things you are citing are largely due to decisions that you are making in your gameplay. There are facets of the game which you may not be exploring which could help reduce your perceived wait time. Consider taking up a tradeskill that you can practice while medding, or talking with people. Those are both aspects of the game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021487.html"><b>Invisbility and the Undead</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I thought I once read a post by you stating that no class had both forms of invisibility becuase that would be too powerfull and would make travel anywhere too easy. ]</i></font><br><br>The rogue is the only class that has the ability to be invisible to both the undead and living at the same time. The other classes that have both spells cannot have them both up at the same time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020569.html"><b>EQLog.txt Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rowyl, PLEASE split eqlog.txt by character!]</i></font> <br><br>We have suggestions along these lines on the list, along with things such as separate friends lists. We also have a command (/note) that will go in the next client patch to allow people to take notes while they play. <br><br>I really look forward to the continuing enhancements to the UI, as I think most of the players do as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021044.html"><b>Ctrl + # Casting Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyways... any chance that the slide key and the casting+# key can be changed so they are not the same?]</i></font> <br><br>Actually the next client will include key-binding options well beyond what you have available now. In fact, I believe only 3 functions will not be bindable after the change is implemented. So yes, you will be able to set it to another key :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021238.html"><b>Topics on "Mystere's Banning"</b></a><br>We don't need 20 posts on the front page for you to voice your concerns. There is one that's a continuation of Brad's original post, and that is sufficient. <br><br>You might also consider sending your thoughts via email, as it's not something that we're going to comment further on at this time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021167.html"><b>Pointy Hats for Wizards!</b></a><br>We've had to backburner the "pointy hat" idea for a while. It turns out that they didn't go in because we weren't pleased with the way that the model worked. They either looked like dunce caps or the ceremonial headgear of one of the more morally repugnant organizations in the country. <br><br>Suffice it to say that they didn't look very good.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021486.html"><b>GM Incident</b></a><br>I'm not seeing anything wrong with what happened. While I agree that the person who summoned the GM should have stuck to the rules that were agreed upon by the group before hand, once a GM is involved they have to make a decision with the information at hand. <br><br>This decision was not to give the loot to one person or another, but to require the roll in this case. I really don't see much of a problem with him doing that. <br><br>In regards to "threads of banishment or suspension", "threats" is not a good word to describe the situation. The GM was attempting to let the person know what could happen should he continue to refuse to comply with the directions of the GM. </UL>

GameSpy has taken <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/interviews/october00/scars/">a look Behind the Scenes of the making of the Scars of Velious</a>, the next EQ expansion.  Here's a clip:<UL>Scars of Velious expands the online world of Norrath by adding a whole new continent which in turn will be made up of 16 new zones, two of which are to be new Planes of Existence, and we were informed that the Velious zones would be the biggest ever seen in the game so far. The storyline can be found here in our preview, but the main plot revolves around a race of Dragons and a race of Storm Giants.</UL>Thanks Warrior!

From Lowtax:<BLOCKQUOTE>After reading the news post regarding the person getting banned for "offensive" Everquest fan fiction, I realized something terrible - I have an Everquest account and haven't logged onto the game in months!  Verant has been sapping $10 a month from my bank account for no reason whatsoever!<br> <br>As a result, I tried to cancel my account online.  No luck, as I can't remember my station name or password.  Since my back was against the wall and I had no other intelligent alternatives, I did the only thing I could - create some offensive Everquest fan fiction (<a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/features/eqfanfiction/">http://www.somethingawful.com/features/eqfanfiction/</a>).  With your help and news post, we can spread the word so Verant has no choice but to shut down my EQ account and cease charging me $10 a month.  Hopefully this work of "fan fiction" is offensive enough to cause Verant / Sony to immediately nuke my account forever.<br> <br>I would appreciate any news post, as it would really mean alot to me.  Like $10 a month.<br><br>-Rich "Lowtax" Kyanka<br> <br>Very Internet Person<br>www.somethingawful.com</BLOCKQUOTE>Quick to the punch as always, Lowtax. :)

Many of you are aware of the recent banning Mystere for the publication of an EverQuest Fan Fiction containing very <b>descriptive and violent scenes of a child being raped and tortured</b>.  Verant has publicly commented about this banning, something rarely done by them.  It's an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021102.html">important board post</a> that I believe sets the record straight:<UL><i>I'm posting this on behalf of our General Counsel:<br><br>------<br><br>I want to thank everyone for their fervent opinions on this matter.<br><br>We aspire neither to be censors nor the guardians of the Internet; we desire to be the developers of a great game which fosters a vibrant and dynamic community. Fortunately, the body of intellectual property law that has developed over the past 225 years -- the laws governing the use of copyrighted material, derivative works, trademarks and trade dress -- gives us the exclusive right to permit or disallow the outside use of our intellectual property so that we can properly manage our business and nurture the EverQuest brand. <br><br>Among other things, the story author used our intellectual property -- without license -- to create what the law calls a "derivative work." The law gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to create and distribute derivative works, so that the copyright owner can control the manner in which its property is being used. If this story were about Luke Skywalker or Mickey Mouse, you'd certainly expect Lucas or Disney (respectively) to resort to their legal rights to protect their valuable property and good name; this is nothing different.<br><br>This is not about the first amendment -- this is about infringement of our intellectual property rights in a patently offensive manner that tarnishes the Sony, Verant and EverQuest brands. It almost goes without saying that we cannot tolerate our intellectual property being used in a story depicting the violent and explicit rape of a child.<br><br>Andrew S. Zaffron<br>General Counsel, Sony Online Entertainment</i></UL>I'd also like to add my two cents in this matter.  The EQVault Brell Serilis Board was the place where this post originated and I personally apologize for not catching, talking with the author and deleting the story three months ago.  Perhaps if I had this controversy wouldn't have started.<br><br>I have great respect for the Freedom of Speech rights those who live in the USA, and other similar countries, enjoy.  However (and I know many of you will respectfully disagree with me here) the violent descriptions of the rape of a child goes too far in a story posted to a public board meant for all ages.  Although I'm not a lawyer, I believe it may even violate some children's pornography laws.<br><br>If you'll humor me, I'd like to try and picture the mind frame that both parties are in.  Imagining myself in Verant's shoes, I would not want such material with the vivid depictions of the rape and torture of a child associated with a flagship product.  Attempting to put myself in Mystere's shoes, I feel the punishment may be too harsh for a first time offense.  Instant banishment for a rule he/she did not know was in effect was harsh.  Similar material, both violent and gruesome and creative and tasteful, is regularly written and posted about franchises, such as Star Wars, to sites like FanFiction.net.<br><br>I must conclude that diplomacy <i>might</i> have been a better way to avoid this and future incidents.  By talking with the author first, and grabbing an EQV moderator's attention, this incident could have been avoided altogether.

Gordon announced today some news regarding the EQ client and DirectX.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020740.html">the complete announcement</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>As many of you know, over the past couple of months we&#8217;ve made numerous enhancements to the EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and other changes of that nature, we&#8217;ve enhanced the UI itself to allow moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time we&#8217;ve been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the EverQuest client.<br><br>For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 5.2.<br><br>This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest. <br><br>Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:<br><br>- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)<br>- Gamma Correction working in D3D <br>- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D <br>- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and look pretty bad) <br>- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to look better.<br><br>Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of DirectX outweigh the potential problems.<br><br>We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</a> if it is needed.<br><br>Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information regarding the planned implementation of DX7.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's a follow-up note from Brad:<UL><i>We won't make it such that the game won't run on Windows 2000 -- if this menas using 7.0 instead of 7.0a, then so be it :)<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

My Wife and are Both Bards, and well, She's<br>got a lot better armor than me, that Pretty Lambent Blue stuff, while I<br>have some Bronze mostly...Well, Anyway, A Few nights ago, While she was<br>sleeping, I took her Lambent and put it on. It just felt so right! A<br>Bard dressed in great Blue Lambent, Righting Wrongs and Singing Songs.<br>But...Wearing my Wife's clothes...I don't know...That's just...Tell me,<br>Trabby, is there anything wrong with me? <br><br>Be Brutal. <br>Sincerely <br>A Bard. </i></BLOCKQUOTE>
