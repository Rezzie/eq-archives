Through rain, snow, sleet and rain (not to mention server problems) we present to you today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000180.html"><b>Spelling Errors</b></a><br>First, I want to thank all of you that have been sending in spelling errors. I have a few comments to make about some of the types of comments we've been getting. <br><br>A few people have pointed out that when you use the Hail feature, it creates a sentence like: "Hail Bob." Such a sentence should, we admit, have a comma after the word hail. It should read: "Hail, Bob." <br><br>Unfortunately, changing that would be a real problem. NPCs are trained (through expensive drug therapy) to respond to the existing text, without the comma. Retraining them (which would probably mean intensive electric shock therapy) would require that we change every NPC that responds to that hail text. While perhaps a worthwhile endeavor, we have decided that the grammatical headaches that this causes some people doesn't warrant the time needed to make the change, and the likely bugs and broken quests that would occur. Sorry, but it's going to stay as it is. <br><br>Also, we've had a lot of comments about things on the character creation screens. Those have to be changed by programmers, not designers. We've created an extensive list of changes needed, and the programmers will be fixing them when they get the odd spare moment. That's just going to take time to finish, since it seems more worthwhile to have the programmers working on other things most of the time. <br><br>Otherwise, we are tackling the spelling errors as they come in. Many of the ones you've sent in are already fixed. Thanks for the help in this.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000071.html"><b>Quivers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The code that makes different kinds of arrows feed into the ammo slot from a quiver doesn't currently work. At least it didn't the other night when I thought I had run out of arrows but in fact had a full stack of a different sort in my quiver. <br><br>- Vizco ]</i></font><br><br>You're correct, it doesn't. <br><br>That was an intended feature, and we've talked about making it work that way. I'll mention it again to the team. <br><br>Sir_Yakk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "There is a delay reduction on your bow if you have a magical quiver in use (meaning that it's the topmost quiver in your inventory)." <br><br>Does the quiver have to be MAGICAL, or does it just have to have wt reduction? ]</i></font><br><br>Any bow with weight reduction will also have a delay reduction. Sorry about the magic thing.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Team Server Updates</b></a><br>About the new Test Server <br><br>I wanted to copy something that Ester wrote here, since I think it's important information. <br><br>--------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Our newest Test Server! <br><br>I'd like to take a moment to talk about the Testing department's role on this server. <br><br>As Absor stated, there are no play nice policies on this server, in fact there are very few rules at all on Sullon. This is also a test server which means that there is no customer service on this server. This is different than most people are used to. <br><br>What does this mean? It means that /petitions are not going to be answered unless they are about a bug, it means that there is no one to give last names, no one to get involved in player disputes. <br><br>This means if your name if offensive it will be changed without warning and your account may have action taken against it. Please do not make vulgar names. If your name is changed arguing will not help as this is a test server that will be wiped soon. <br><br>We also ask that you not sent tells concerning these things to our testers. They are not allowed to help you with these issues. <br><br>We appreciate all the help we get testing this code, but please remember that we are here to test and that is our primary responsibility. My testers are very limited on what they can do for customers. <br><br>I look forward to seeing you there! <br><br>Ester <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>And also keep in mind that our Development Team is spending a lot of time on this server, both playing and working. And we're just as willing to issue warnings and change names as anyone. Yes, being a jerk on the Test Server can earn you a warning or suspension just like it can on any other server. I've encountered a lot of nice folks (even a few of those that killed me this weekend were very nice about it&#8230;). But I've also run into some folks with some very foul mouths. Keep in mind that I'm very willing to petition people and send their information over to our Customer Service folks&#8230; <br><br>And please, please report any bugs you find using /bug. Be detailed in your description. We're concentrating on bugs regarding the new code on this server. <br><br>I've also encountered a lot of people that didn't know the rules for the new server. I'm not sure what good it will do posting a note here, since those that didn't read the original rules post will probably not see this either, but please read the rules before logging on. <br><br>Alan<br><br>---------<br><br>Sir_Yakk wrote: <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just so people know:<br>If you get 'name rejected', this is either because the name was rejected, or because you are trying to make a 2nd character. <br><br>Heh. <br><br>You might want to change the message you get when you want to make a 2nd character. Something like 'You are attempting to exceed the number of characters allowed on this server.' ]</i></font><br><br>That's something we need to change before the server goes Live. For now, well, it's a Test server. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There will be guides and GMs to help with things like last names, weddings, dynamic events/non dynamic events etc. when it goes live though right? <br><br>-Kallyn [Tempest Fates]]</i></font><br><br>Yup. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This may have been suggest, but I would like to point out I did not see the new rules on the patch message, and would think this would be a great place to inform those of the PvP rules. <br><br>Braxis ]</i></font><br><br>The rules list is just too big. The patch message does tell people where to find them, and that they should read them before playing. That should be enough, you would think&#8230; <br><br>Player27 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: It seems to me that most of these bad apples we've been seeing are only because they know their characters are only temp's. I think after the server goes live people will be more concerned with their reputations. Also, has there been any thought to changing the color of the team names as they do in the PVP Teams servers? I for one would like to see: Evil-Red Neutral-Yellow and Good-Blue. If you decided not to color names... Why? ]</i></font><br><br>I agree, I expect there to be a fewer grief players when the server goes live. The freedom given by knowing that your character will be gone soon anyway makes people less concerned about their reputation. <br><br>No, the names need to be one color. We certainly talked about this, and I know why we can't make them different colors. Did you know that wood elves can be evil? Most people don't. Imagine being a wood elf and trying to visit your trainer with a big red name over your head. <br><br>My neutral dark elf has been attacked no less than fifteen times in Nektulos (oddly, I've been attacked more there than in Freeport&#8230;). Without an obvious name color, it's going to be very, very hard to play a character that isn't of the same religion as the majority of his peers. Giving them obvious team designations would make playing them impossible. <br><br>And we want to encourage people to respond to each other based on the character as much as their team. Having a gank me sign on your head doesn't really make for a better roleplaying environment&#8230; <br><br><br>A_Slayer_Of_Aradune wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First, let me say thanks for Sullon-Zek. So far it has been a blast and hopefully will only continue to improve once it goes live. However, after testing it these past few days I have noticed a quite disturbing trend, evil diety immunity. To put it bluntly, their is just too much evil, and on top of that concern, evil races such as Trolls, Ogres and in particular Iksars that have absolutely no concerns about being accousted for some time. I'm not posting this concerb because I feel good or even neutral aligned dietys should have an edge. However, I am concerned that too many subscribers will start as Troll, Ogre or Iksar because of thier relative immunity to attack or invasion. Think of it, no Troll, ogre or Iksar has to worry when they see a player of thier own race. Is this balance? Also, many of the better dungeons will be evil aligned dominated due to geography and the afformentioned dilemna. Not only is good severly hindered by this, but neutral too. Players will realize the easiest routes and most will head in that direction. And that direction is clearly evil. <br><br>I'm not implying VI should severely gimp evil. However, I am asking that the developers look into this and give serious consideration into introducing a neutral strain of Troll, Ogre and Iksar. Perhaps a neutral Shaman diety for all. Furthermore, moving one more diety to the good end of things may also add to the servers playability and resolve the evil immunity syndrom that may ultimately cripple the server. I only post this because I feel this would be best for the overall playability of Sullen-Zek and give the evil races something to think about. Something every good or neutral race has to deal with. Enemies in their own towns and a potential enemies in the same race. Otherewise, we may ultimately have an evil pvp server where no one actually fights. Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That same immunity also leads to a few disadvantages. For example, if I see an iksar, I know he's evil. If I see a human I'll have to /con him to see what he is. So the same races that might have it easier because they are all on the same team, will find that any sort of stealth stuff isn't going to be useful. <br><br>You might be right, it might end up being that evil rules the server, and that the good folks are forced to work out alliances with the neutral ones to help survive. That's fine. Heck, that sounds very interesting. But it might also be true that a lot of people want to play good characters, and that the ease of finding and distinguishing evil targets is a burden on them. <br><br>The actual politics of the server will have to fall into place as it plays out. That's pretty thrilling, really. You might be right, but whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for the server as a whole, nobody really knows yet. <br><br>Niccy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something slightly odd here... <br><br>Ester- ...What does this mean? It means that /petitions are not going to be answered unless they are about a bug... <br><br>Absor- ...But I've also run into some folks with some very foul mouths. Keep in mind that I'm very willing to petition people ... <br><br>Who's going to read those petitions? And is trash-talking allowed on this server or not? ]</i></font><br><br>I meant to say that I'd /report people. Remember, those reports are filed. So even if there is nobody to petition to, there will be a record. That means that if someone else petitions the same player for foul language, my report is still on file, adding to the evidence. And, well, I work here. So if someone is offensive enough, I can walk over and talk to someone about getting action taken&#8230; <br><br>Sure, trash talk is cool. At least trash talk in the sporting sense. But foul language is never going to be acceptable in EverQuest. If your character hates my character, that's fine. But if your character uses foul language to express that hatred, you can expect to find that the player is the one that gets warned. I've had interactions with people on that server that already that were hostile in character and pleasant out of character. That makes the thing fun. Making it personal ruins the game. <br><br>Enivri wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well Absor/Ester have posted another thing about the new test server, but I have YET to see this issue discussed: Rogue Pickpocketing. Ok, I finally got to the 7th level to be able to try and pickpocket someone, now I just need to wait till tonight when there are enough ppl on to really test it. But from what ppl have been telling me, you cannot pickpocket ppl at all. I would like most to be able to pickpocket anyone 6+ on the server, but I would even settle for the ppl in my 5+- level range. Could you at least bring this up in your team meetings...(this is a TEST server afterall). thanks for your time in reading this <br><br>-Xerrol (aka. Loanr on Sullon) ]</i></font><br><br>No, you can't do it. And we probably won't allow it on Sullon. Though it certainly will get a little discussion, since we could limit it to within the same five levels that looting and experience loss are limited to. But I wouldn't expect it. <br><br>Lisset wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Yes, you can trade across teams. I don't see any real reason to prevent people from trading." <br><br>There are roleplaying reasons and gameplay reasons. The RP reason is the same reason that you can't group with someone on another team and that is that your god would not permit you to render assistance to an enemy. Trading is the exact same thing. Is not selling someone a SoW potion the same thing as paying someone to cast sow on you? Also, I think you underestimate the number of people with multiple accounts. Heck, I know that if *I* built up a character on another team to the 50's and wanted to start a newbie, I'd certainly give it stuff, just because I can. <br><br>From a gameplay standpoint, I think you're missing a wonderful dynamic that preventing inter-team trades would create. If there is a certain item that is considered "great" (such as E-boots), a team can literally prevent other teams from getting them. The dynamic is jealousy. With enough cash, a player could ply an item off of an opponent. But without inter-team trading, that person (and others like him) would be jealous of that race. That creates even more conflict. ]</i></font><br><br>And on the other hand, there are some interesting possibilities that not allowing trading would restrict. In fact, in your example, imagine the wealth that can be gained by a team that is able to corner the market on something and then sell it. It also allows players to set up some of their own events, like convincing the evil guild leader to give up some item to a neutral guild to prevent them from aiding a good guild in some action. <br><br>I can see both sides here, and I can't see one as clearly better, except in one way. Sometimes it's just plain better to be able to help someone out. So if a neutral character sees a good character that has lost all of his stuff, he can help that person out a bit. I think that's the reason that I'm in favor of allowing trades across teams.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000201.html"><b>Slammin'</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: About the large races not having the ability to slam when in skeleton form - that is true of the other forms also. <br><br>As a barbarian warrior - I cannot slam when a group member gives me wolf or werewolf form. <br><br>Fre ]</i></font><br><br>That's true. But that's not an issue. Those spells always did that. The issue here is that we would be changing the functionality of an existing spell (adding a cool look, but adding a restriction). That would be why adding a new spell would be best. The new spell would still prevent slam, because that's what those sorts of spells do. But the old spell wouldn't be changed (ruined, in the minds of some players).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>Pets and Spells</b></a><br>Halbarad wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'd like to point out that this doesn't make any sense within the gameworld mechanics that I am aware of. <br><br>Invisibility has one effect, and one effect only: It prevents you from being added to a creature's hate list by moving close to it. (i.e. makes all creatures that don't see invisible indifferent to you). It does NOT prevent you from being added to the hate list for other reasons, nor does it remove you from the hate list if you are already on it. <br><br>Having your pet attack a creature adds aggro towards the caster; if it didn't, a monster wouldn't come after you if you had your pet attack it and your pet died. Being invisible will in no way protect you from the monster that just killed your pet, because you are on it's hate list, and it will find you and attack you. <br><br>So, insofar as I understand it, the above explanation doesn't hold water. Now, if you don't want someone to be able to travel invisibly with a pet, that's fine - just say so - but let's not have some confused explanation that makes it sound like aggro works differently than has always been demonstrated. <br><br>Oh... and as an aside, if, for some bizarre reason, you do happen to allow invisible casters with pets, could you make it so that /pet get lost breaks charm? Thanks. :)]</i></font><br><br>That is true, now. But back then invisibility, if cast before the pet attacked, would prevent you from getting onto the hate list of the NPC. So with the NPC targeted and the caster sitting out of sight, the caster could send pets in for as long as his or her mana held out. Both invisibility and the way pets work were changed because of exploits like that. It may be true that neither you nor I can think of any specific exploits that would come from reverting this. But I'm pretty convinced that some would crop up. <br><br>It works fine as it is now. The only reason to change it would be to reduce the thought required for pet casters (Should I cast now, or wait until we're further along? Will casting now cause me too much trouble?). The ability to know when to cast a pet is important to the smart pet caster, and can distinguish a well played magician from a poorly played one (though obviously less so that the ability to successfully command you pet). With the ability to summon your pet, I don't really see any need to change the way this works, and certainly not at the risk of a potential exploit. <br><br>Charm is a separate matter. Get lost doesn't break the charm because the pet can't choose to break the charm, you have to do that with the spells provided you.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Class Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: since your on the topic of classes... <br><br>Why cant iksar be rogues? After all, the field of bone is full of them, though I would suppose they are outcasts from iksar society. I see no reason why they cant be rogues; the whole 'too primitive' argument goes out the window, because barbarians can be them and they are much more primitive then iksar, since they cannot harness intelligence(sorry for the bad spelling people) based magics. <br><br>Also, is there any chance, that with upcoming expansions( not luclin per se) that you will be adding new classes to the already existing races that they couldnt have been before?(ie making it so dark elves can be monks, or something along that lines) (well, maybe not darkies becoming monks...but you get my point). Sorry if the post is a little long winded or lacking in proper grammar and spelling and the such, I aint perfect, after all. <br><br>-TheSpineripper ]</i></font><br><br>I think I've said this before, but I'm more than willing to repeat myself. :)<br><br>There is, really, no reason that any race couldn't justify having any class. Dwarven bards, barbarian wizards, troll paladins&#8230; I can come up with a reason for any combination of class and race. <br><br>But we've set it up in such a way that your race and class combinations make a lot of sense in the world. We're not planning on adding or changing these combinations at all in the future. The variety and restrictions to the classes are just fine as they are. <br><br>Bahimiron wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: While we're on the subject: <br><br>Agnostic is defined as being in a state where one does not deny or affirm the existence of the gods. <br><br>Agnostic in Everquest is actually more non-denominational. After all, it's difficult to deny the existence of the gods in a world where their worshippers perform miracles in their names and, at times, the gods themselves walk the land and bring about chaos and destruction. Or the opposite, in the case of some of the wussier gods. <br><br>Perhaps the term should be changed to 'non-denominational'? Or 'undecided'. ]</i></font><br><br>Agnostic, as it's defined on Earth, doesn't fit the way it's used on Norrath very well, that's true. <br><br>But there isn't a term that is used on Earth that really does fit the situation on Norrath. I'm content to say that agnostic means 'choosing not to worship a god' in Norrath and leave it at that. I don't think undecided or non-denominational really fit it any better.</UL><br>

It appears one public statement wasn't enough to clear the waters for Verant regarding a controversial decision to disband and suspend an entire guild.  In public statement #2, EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid talks more on the issue and provides what only can be described as a monstor of an email discussion between him and the Guild's leader.  Here's the first part of the document:<UL>Hello,<br><br>After our first statement regarding the Conquest guild issue, several things happened. First, I began a dialog with two members of Conquest (the leader and an officer). Second, I began a very detailed investigation of what occurred. Third, the public interest in this situation continued with both public posts and well as emails to various Verant employees. <br><br>The following is a lengthy email exchange between me and the two guild members, and I'm releasing it (with their permission) as sort of a 'second, more definitive statement', in that much of the feedback we received and read indicated that many players were not satisfied with the depth (or lack thereof) of our original statement. That and, after further investigation on my part, there were a few errors in the original statement I wanted to clear up.<br><br>I think these various emails explain in detail both Verant's position and Conquest's regarding this issue. They are presented 'as is', except for spelling fixes and the deletion of email addresses and guild member names. Also, the last couple of emails between us are omitted in that they deal with some other issues not really related to what happened.<br><br>In any case, I hope this clears some things up and helps and doesn't merely 'throw more fuel on the fire'. I leave it to all of you to come to your own conclusions, but at least you have details on both sides of the issue as well as a good faith effort from both parties to get to the bottom of this situation. <br><br>--<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>Brad McQuaid<br>Vice President, Premium Games<br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive<br>---------------------------------------------</UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000210.html">Click here</a> to read the very, very long email conversation had between Brad and the guild's leader.

He does his very best to make everyone around him angry and miserable. The Thief wants to take things, the Grief Player doesn't care about things except as they hurt other people. <br><br>One example of a Grief Player was one I met while supervising a group of children playing online. The children were obviously children; they were all playing big hulking warriors with Pokemon names. Some fellow saw them playing in the dungeon then ran off. He came back about 5 minutes later and offered to show them into a secret section of the dungeon. This section was much more difficult than the rest of the dungeon. He led the children down into it and they were lulled by the fact that there were no monsters. He had killed them all before bringing the children down. Then he went to great lengths to lead the children in circles so that they were lost and then quietly left just as the dungeon refilled with monsters. <br><br>----------------<br><br><a href="http://www.fanstory.com/fanmag/">The Online Magazine</a><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Lava</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Today's edition of the Absor Infobits is supercharged with extra bits from Lawrence Poe:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000208.html"><b>Imbue Ivory</b></a><br>Jaeden_Avengarious wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: For the Deity imbue spells, the level for them set is for 29.

It's pretty hard to deny that they should be able to worship them. And I'll certainly forward your comment and mine to the team. But I wouldn't anticipate any changes to the basic deity restrictions for the existing servers.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000209.html"><b>Evacuate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've brought this up as a bug with Esther twice with no response. I'll assume its not and then simply ask you: why? <br><br>When the wizard spell Evacuate is cast every mana user in the party is charged mana for the spell. As a 57th cleric with a 200 wisdom this spell costs me a full bubble of mana when cast by a wizard. As far as I know this is the only spell in the game that subtracts mana from every caster in the group when cast. <br><br>This is not the largest issue in the game certainly, but its, well, annoying. Because this spell is normally cast in an emergency when things are going badly the additional mana drain just adds to whatever frustration you already had over things going badly. <br><br>So is this a bug, or a 'feature'? If it is intended, why? <br><br>Ezrick Blackpriest<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>-------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>This *is* intentional. Evac is a group spell. One of its components is a mana drain. That component, just like the Evac, will hit every member of the group. This was added to stop people from Evacing to a relative safe area then have the MOBs come after them where they are near the zone line and can easily escape should things go bad. <br><br>Recently we have changed the interzone teleports to clear agro, so that feature of the spell is a little less important. We have talked about removing the mana drain but have yet to make a decision. Hopefully I can give you an answer sometime soon. <br><br>Hope that clears things up for ya. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks for the question.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000207.html"><b>Critical Hits With Spells</b></a><br>xole wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Here is a possible way to implement critical hits on evocation spells: <br><br>base number = X*(Evoc skill/Spell Level) + (research skill/10) + (specialization Evocation/10). <br><br>Where spell level is the level of the spell being cast. X is a modifier based on class. 2 for wizards, 1 for other classes (if crit hits are not wizard only). <br><br>When a spell is cast get a random number 1-100. If this number is less than the base number a crit hit occurs. When a crit hit occurs, there is no chance for resist and the spell does (base - rand number) extra damage. <br><br>This will max out at about 50% chance if the caster is using their most recently obtained spells. <br><br>Here are a few comments on the idea:<br>1. Max base number is 50. Therefore max crit hit is 150% of norm and max chance for crit is 50%. <br><br>2. Creatures 10 levels higher than caster can not be crit hit. <br><br>3. Creatures over the 6 lvl limit, but under the 10 lvl crit limit can only be hit if a spell crits. <br><br>4. Agro is counted the same as if spell didn't crit. <br><br>5. Research is included to represent that a good researcher would have superiour knowledge of both the mob and the spell. <br><br>6. Crit hits would show up in battle text, just like warrior crit hits do. <br><br>7. Perhaps, the base should be modified for different zones or continents. This could be a way to help balance the classes in different continents. The 50% damage bonus could vary from zone to zone, but I wouldn't make it too high. <br><br>8. It should be noticibly better for wizards, if not wizard only. <br><br>9. Resistant chance reduction is a critical aspect of this idea. <br><br>10. Items which aid this could be introduced, but be careful. <br><br>Oh, and yes, I'm a wizard. I enjoy my class very much. I also play a variety of alts. ]</i></font><br><br>-------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Thanks for the well written suggestion. Critical hits on spells is something we have discussed in the past. I personally think it's an excellent idea, and that it could be balanced to account for the different power scales over our continents. That being said, we don't have the time to allocate adding this type of functionality right now. Critical spell hits would be a big change requiring a lot of play testing. currently there are no plans to add it, but I won't rule it out as a feature that we may decide to add at some point down the road. <br><br>Thanks for the feedback, and glad you enjoy the game so much <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-------------------------------------<br><br>We get a few suggestions about this every day.

To preface, let me outline what races can be which classes: <br><br>Cleric: Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf, Human<br>Druid: Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, Wood Elf<br>Shaman: Barbarian, Iksar, Ogre, Troll <br><br>So anyway, there are a few things we can infer from this, I think. We can note the following: <br><br>1) All races have at least one sort of Wisdom caster. Some races don't have Int casters (Barbarians, Dwarves, Wood Elves, Halflings, Ogres, Trolls, Half-Elves,) but religion is esential. <br>2) The Shaman class is exclusive of both Clerics and Druids (ie, no race can be both a Shaman and a Cleric or Druid.) <br>3) The Druid class is compatable with the Clerics only in two races: Humans and Halflings. All the other races are one or the other. <br><br>The way I see it, there are three religious approaches, and these approaches are not terribly compatable. We have a sort of a stylized and organized worship of a god, that's the way of the Cleric (note the sophistication of just about all the temples.) On the other side, we have a rough, primal embracing of the god and his beleifs, the Shaman. For a Druid, I think that the god is secondary to the worship of Nature itself, thus being limited to the two gods who typify Nature: the one who gives birth, or the one who nurtures life, Tunare and Karana. <br><br>So clearly, Clerics and Shamans require a wholey different way of thinking, and such a thing will never appear in the same race. The closest we get are Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians, who are all the same species, but are very different "breeds." Should the Iksar race manage to regain its heights, then probably the Shamanistic way of thought would dissappear from them completely. Or perhaps some sect of the Iksar would cling to the old ways, at the cost of not embracing the newer way of living (and hence be a different "race," much like Humans and Barbarians or Wood Elves and High Elves.) <br><br>On a related note, I might add that Druidic and Clerical thought are also radically different, and as such are only accessable by the most open minded and flexable of races (humans and their diminutive mirror.) ]</i></font><br><br>That's a fair analysis. Heck, sounds like you might have pulled that from some old EverQuest design document. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000180.html"><b>Misspellings</b></a><br>SirReal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As I have said before, I am pretty sure the "Skeleton Llrod" in Befallen is a "Skeleton Lord"]</i></font> <br><br>I forgive you for your misconception. :)<br><br>That's the guy's name.

Healing works across all level ranges (within your team), including resurrection.

At that time the only source of shark meat on Norrath was living sharks with sharp teeth. The quest rewards were balanced based on the facts of the day. <br><br>Recently we added a bunch of new recipes for bakers. Shark meat was used in one (or some) of those recipes. So shark meat was added on a vendor or two to facilitate the use of that recipe. <br><br>This made the original quest extremely easy for people that could transport themselves. People used this fact to gain rewards beyond the intended difficulty of the quest. <br><br>Sure, we should have caught it. But with the huge number of quests and the large increase in baking recipes and items, we missed it. To fix this we had, really, two choices. Remove the quest or remove the meat from vendors. <br><br>We chose to remove the meat. Bakers don't suffer in their ability to make skill, there are other recipes that will get them through those skill ranges. All this does is make shark dishes a rarity, and that's actually something that I think is a good thing. If someone gives you food with shark meat in it, you know that they've gone to some trouble to make that food.<br><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>Pet Questions</b></a><br>pyrian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings, <br><br>I wasn't sure if this was ever brought up, but I just wanted to address it anyway in case it wasn't. I've just recently started a necro character a couple of months ago who is already level 32. As of now, my character has reached the level in which a pet is essential for survival. This means that if I wish to survive an encounter, my pet has to be able to survive the fight. Likewise, to have my pet to survive, it must be able to effectively deal with any mob that it encounters. And to do that, the pet usually has to be armed. <br><br>So my question is this, are there any plans to have necro pets return the weapons it was given when you no longer need the pet? Also, are there any plans to let necro retrieve the weapons given to their pets if their pets die? I think that it would be a great addition, espeically since the necro's primary mode of defense and offense are their pets. Please let us know what you think. Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>Arming your pet is part of the bargain for using them. Losing that weapon is part of the cost. In a way, this is another one of the slight and perhaps subtle advantages that magicians have over other pet classes, as they can summon weapons for their pets. <br><br>No, we have no intention of allowing pets to return weapons. <br><br>Silfox wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: JanePetOwner casts Invisibility on herself, and Jobober panics and goes poof. Shouldn't it be possible for the caster to cast See Invisible on the pet, then invis herself without the pet suiciding? ]</i></font><br><br>The pet goes away when the owner disappears for game balance reasons as much as for any roleplaying reason. Unfortunately an invisible pet owner could, basically, send an endless chain of pets at an NPC and never be at risk themselves. I mentioned this to Kendrick and he remembered a time in beta when a 15th level character was able to use this trick to easily take on a 28th level NPC with no risk. <br><br>So, yes, it would make sense that if the pet is freaking out and disappearing when the master disappears, then casting See Invisible on the pet would prevent that. But we can't allow pets to be attached to invisible masters for reasons having nothing to do with 'realism' and everything to do with gameplay.</UL>

Not one. <br><br>At first I thought this new board would be a great way to avoid all the flames and such, but important issues are still being ignored. ]</i></font><br><br>Don't be frustrated. Every post is seen by me or by the team (or both). Responding to comments takes longer than reading them, and making certain that your comments are read is really the value of this new system. <br><br>In fact, let me respond to your question, to give you some sort of idea why I often don't reply to some sorts of comments (not because they are bad questions, mostly because I don't have good answers). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Last night a guild went to Fear Plane, we cleared golems dracoliche no problem, and began preparing for Cazic Thule. <br><br>We had *52* people, level 58+ with about 2 exceptions. With 5 level 60 Warriors and about 5 level 60 Clerics. <br><br>Charge - Die. We forgot to slow him. <br><br>Next attempt, we only sent in one or two groups and TWO level 60 shamans went OOM trying to slow a tashed/malosi'd/bardsonged CT. No longer slowable? No way, Verant wouldn't do that. <br><br>Next attempt, send in one or two groups and hit CT with every MR debuff possible..........both shamans OOM, not slowed. <br><br>Last try we decided he was unslowable and that he had obviously been upped in the patch. We got him to 15% by suiciding level 60 wizards and nothing. <br><br>Okay theres my story, I was just wondering if you could confirm this Absor or Abashi? If he is intentionally unslowable (he was slowable a week ago), this makes this mob 10X harder. ]</i></font><br><br>NPCs change all the time. We don't talk about such changes simply because we want you to expect NPCs to change. We aren't announcing changes that might raise Emperor Crush's hit points, we're not in the habit of announcing changes to Cazic either. Only in the case where the change is rather huge will be make an announcement about it. Revamping the whole zone needs to be announced. Changing some stats doesn't. <br><br>Honestly, we make far too many changes to NPCs to announce them all. Hopefully you understand why this isn't the kind of question I'll answer. <br><br>But the team did see it, I talked to them about it, and if this had been a bug or something, we would have dealt with it. So it is important to us that you send such comments in. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I send comments, idea's, and suggestions all the time but you seem to toss them aside. There a particular reason or are you only posting comments that say how great and wonderful everything is? <br><br>-{Run DMZ}- ]</i></font><br><br>You asked about more 'roleplaying' oriented events. The best response I can give to that is that we are working on more all the time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi Absor, <br><br>In the light of the log-in poll done a while ago, what update is there please on the possibility of a European Fan Faire? <br><br>Regards <br><br>Skruff ]</i></font><br><br>It's still possible. That's all I know&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well since ya asked... I sent you an email a while ago asking about the status of broken quests from Kunark... (i.e. Iksar SK Greenmist) <br><br>Many of us are well past frustruated that expansions keep coming out faster than you can fix old bugs... doesn't seem very fair. <br><br>Could you possibly give a list of quests that are currently being worked on so we could get an idea of when these will be fixed?\ <br><br>Thanks kindly. <br><br>Slimyface Thunderpants<br>51 Iksar Shadowknight<br>Xegony ]</i></font><br><br>We don't list out quests. They're for finding in game. And often the quests that people think are broken aren't broken, the spoiler site they are following lists the wrong information&#8230; <br><br>Broken quests and quests in progress are another category of questions that I'm generally not going to answer. As often as not I would essentially be giving out spoiler information in my response. Heck, just posting most questions would be a bit of a spoiler. <br><br>But I'll tell you that the Greenmist thing is on someone's plate. We'll get to it eventually, but other things are before it on the list. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well, I sent you a comment already, but you want to be flooed. *chuckles* <br><br>My suggestion was to have HP and Mana regen while offline. I'm not talking speedy regen here. I'm thinking along the lines of a full mana or HP bar in 24-48 hours. <br><br>This is not something that would unbalance anything that I can think of. And it wouldn't be a big boon to Hardcore players. But it would be a nice gesture for the people who have less time to play. <br><br>I feel that, assuming it can be coded relatively easily, this would be a great thing for literally thousands of players. <br><br>Eliathen<br>Terris-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. Not something we want to do. People would log out to avoid consequences and still be able to get to full mana and health. Get too far into a dangerous area? Used up all your mana to get there? Just pull the plug and come back a bit later. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: i quote the old fraise: carful you might get what you wish for. you might get flooded with too many comments than you can handle. <br><br>tristone vampiresong ]</i></font><br><br>I'd love that. While I'm certainly busy enough, I would rather be busy answering posts than writing server rules docs and stuff&#8230; <br><br>Buccaneer wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You might want to consider releasing some info on what the current "thinking" or "direction" VI is engaged in. Now that only selected responses are displayed, you don't have to be concerned with providin the fuel for negative posts. <br><br>I think most of us would prefer to be kept informed of the process as well as the resulting decisions. ]</i></font><br><br>We use the In Development and Producer's Letter for that sort of thing. I can certainly try to provide further insight on items brought up in either case, but when we have comments about our intentions and directions that aren't in direct response to a question asked here, that's where we'll put them. <br><br>If people want to ask questions like that I'd certainly try to answer them. But we also have to keep some sort of a lid on what we 'intend' to do. If we say we intend to try something, that sets up expectations that we 'will' do it. Until we're pretty sure we can do it, we'll usually hold off announcing a direction or intent. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I love the newspapers, and I'm betting others do too. You asked us about it, but I haven't seen any responses. What kind of feedback did you get on that? <br><br>Thanks,<br>-- Cragmyre ]</i></font><br><br>Basically we got a bunch of WOOT! <br><br>I'm never sure about posting a lot of positive comments because then I get criticized (as I was a few posts above) for trying to spin stuff. But I'll go post a few of them once I'm done with this bunch. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: OK you asked for more "original" questions, something that hasn't got a thing to do with "when will this happen?" or "what's this gonna be like?" and it just so happens I *have* one that fits your criteria. =) What is up with the mages' Monster Summoning spells? I can't nail down if you guys ever said what exactly kind of stuff it can summon, but I was told (and it can be logically deduced) that you can only summon creatures that spawn in that zone. This makes ottal sense from what we have been told by you guys about the "Global File" thingy that hold all models that can be displayed in a zone. So back o my question, why is it that it doesn't seem to be true? For instance, my wife is a lvl 43 mage so when we hunt together she likes to use the monster pets because they are more fun to look at and illicit some hilarious responses from other PCs. Well since the spell came out I have noticed that occasionally she gets a critter that doesn't even spawn close to that zone. Such as: a jungle spider summoned from EC, a fungus man summoned in Rathe Mountains, a spiderling summoned in Sol A, etc. Why are these critters in the zone file if they don't ever appear? Is it like some "reserved for future use" thing? I don't mind it I am just curious. I mean someone purposely put these things on the list, right? Seems like these critters could be taken out to make room for some of the other in-zone critters. Like why can you never summon a wurm pet in GD? or a Frost Giant? Being as the Moster Summoning spells are purely "fun" spells (ie-they offer no real tactical advantage), there's no harm in letting us know how it works right? Of course I can see some tactical advantage on PvP servers. I notice a lot of people will stop and try to attack the pet because they think it is attacking the mage. On PvP seems this'd be a great bait and switch tactic, let someone think they will get the killing blow and loot you only to find it was a trap... Anyhoo, if you could answer my question I'd be appreciative =0) Oh and can you please tell Dan to put in a recipe for Malted Milk Balls? We already have chocolate and malted milk, and it'd be really cool to be able to munch down on some =) Thanks! <br><br>Newander<br>Carnival of Carnage<br>The Nameless ]</i></font><br><br>Paragraphs! Please! :)<br><br>Some zones have creatures in their files that never were used in the design of he zone itself. So while you might not have seen any Fungus Men in the Rathe Mountains, that doesn't mean that the model doesn't exist in the zone file. <br><br>Some creatures are purposefully excluded from the summoning list. I imagine that wurms and most giants are purposefully excluded. Some coolness has to be exclusive to the desingers&#8230; <br><br>I already sent the Malt Balls suggestion to Dan.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Team Server Feedback</b></a><br>Well, unsurprisingly we've received a ton of messages about the new server and its rules. I'll try to tackle some of them (with some help&#8230;). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If the person you killed has no open inventory slots what happens then?

There is therefore a selection or two which may not make as much sense as we'd like, but we spent a great deal of time on it to see everything would work out more of less fairly. <br><br>- Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Yup.

Do you gain xp for killing a character when within the level limits. <br>2. Will the Newbie area Super-Guards remain as-is? <br>3. Is the 'Insignia' for 20+ level characters an actual inventory item that appears upon death? If so, what if the inventory is full? <br>4. Clarification request: Concerning PnP, if I understood right, training mobs on opponents is a legal tactic on Sullon Zek, so the old practice of training city guards on opponents is legal here? <br><br>That's all I can think of at the moment. Thank you for your attention. ]</i></font><br><br>---------------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>1. No - No XP for PvP ever.<br>2. Yes - The PvE game will change as little as possible.<br>3. It will appear on your cursor - It's up to you to find a place for it in inventory.<br>4. Don't confuse "legal" with "not illegal". Legal means it's an endorsed tactic, whereas "not illegal" just means that we won't get involved in these player matters. I fully expect the player community to develop a set of their own accepted rules on the server. I expect to see all of the things that are currently "illegal" on the other servers become "frowned upon" by the players of Sullon Zek. It will just be up to you to enforce them, rather than our GM staff. <br><br>-Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Gains for PvP activity are too easy to exploit.

No. We considered it but decided we didn't want to do too many things at once. Not to mention, there's a real question among the team as to how this would add to gameplay. We aren't sure it will.

No. There are more reasons than that for their removal. <br><br>-Gordon <br>---------------------------------------<br><br>And as an extension to Gordon's answer for number two, keep in mind that though we are adding experience loss for PvP on this server, we are still restricting that to 5 levels.

There are two forces at work here. The Trolls still don't like the Iksar, even though they worship the same god at times (player characters are, of course, free to feel differently). And in a lot of cities their will be more than enough internal conflict (with some cities being home to people on two or even three teams) that having Trolls or Gnomes or whomever wandering about would be just too much chaos. <br><br>But at the same time, there are still ways for player characters to convince the citizens of a town that they are trustworthy. <br><br>Metzin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This might just make me seriously try out PvP!!!!

XP loss in PVP situations will cause two very big problems the way I see it. <br><br>Firstly it will lead to malicious players, out simply to lessen the fun other players have.<br>Secondly the point to PVP is to encourage a dueling environement, how is this possible if people are hesitant to duel because they do not want the hours of time they have spent being wasted by an XP loss. <br><br>Killing another player can still be satisfying, it can still be strategic and it can still be a dynamic aspect of the server without the incorporation of XP loss on a PVP related death. ]</i></font><br><br>And soon enough we'll know the truth. Up until today all anyone could do was speculate about the value of such a rule. Without experience loss PvP combat doesn't have a lot of consequence (unless you have item loot, and all of its inherent issues). We're gonna try this out and see how it goes.

The Sullon Zek server, the first Deity Team server in EverQuest's history, was officially announced by Alan in a very big update on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL>Hello everyone. I've got some news for you that I'm sure you'll like.<br><br>We plan to have the new PvP Deity Teams server up and running some time tomorrow. I also have the name of the new server and the basic rule set for you below.<br><br>What we'll be doing is putting the new server up as a Test server for a short while, a few weeks or it may only be a few days, depending on how things go. In order to play on the server during the testing period you'll have to log in using testeverquest.exe. At the end of the test period we will be wiping all characters from the new server in order to restart it as a Live server.<br><br>The server will be open to anyone that wants to help us test it. You'll have to understand that the standard Test Server disclaimers will apply (see the note below). And our Development Team and Testing Teams will be running around on the server. Please cooperate with them and don't bother them with requests. <br><br>Please use /bug to tell us about any bugs you find with the new rules and PvP code.<br><br>Remember, this is a Test server, and there is no promise of customer service.<br><br>Don't let any of that intimidate you if you want to test out the new rules once we get the server up. Just run testeverquest.exe and start up a character.<br><br>Anyway, on to the rules. This isn't necessarily a final list, we are still thinking of adding and modifying some rules. But this is a pretty good summary.<br><br>----<br><br>Welcome to Sullon Zek, the first Deity Team PvP server.<br><br><b>Important Notice:</b><i><br><br>This server will only be featured on the Test EQ Patch for some time for testing purposes. You will need to run testeverquest.exe to access this server. While this server is featured on the Test Patch, all the conditions that apply to the Test Server also apply to this server. There may be cases where the server comes down multiple times a day for updates. There is also a small chance of corpse or item loss. There will be very little to no initial customer service support. When testing of this server is complete and the server is ready to be introduced to the Live Servers, all characters will be wiped. Below are the new rules specific to this server. But also be aware that these rules may be changed as we feel the need to adjust them.</I><br><br><br>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character.<br><br>This document includes the PvP rules for Sullon Zek, and a list of the teams for the server. The 'teams' will be referred to as 'alliances' in this document, as they represent an alliance of the gods, rather than some sort of sports team&#8230;<br><br><br><b>Sullon Zek rules:</b><br><br>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.<br><br>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled.<br><br>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.<br><br>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.<br><br>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters.<br><br>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level.<br><br>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters.<br><br>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels.<br><br>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally', members of another team will be shown as 'threateningly'.<br><br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br><br>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on these servers to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning on PvP servers. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on PvP servers.<br><br>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team.<br><br>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones.<br><br>16. Beneficial spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule.<br><br>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward.<br><br><br><b>The 'Teams':</b><br><br>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <br>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek<br>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan.<br><br><br>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods, those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed. Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics.<br><br>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good.<br><br>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some ancient writings that opened up new avenues.<br><br>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon Corpse or something similar.<br><br>----<br><br>Alan</UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html">Click here</A> to journey to the update on the Dev Corner.

Another major incident involving reported GM abuse has rocked the EverQuest community.  Vanamar has a report summing up the guild's version of the story:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Sleeper has been Awakened on Lanys...<br><br>.... and the guild responsible is disbanded, and 30 members suspended.<br> <br>On the evening of Monday, June 4, 2001, Lanys T`Vyl's local "uberguild"<br>invaded sleepers tomb with a force 30 strong.<br> <br>The proceeded down to the Warders area, where four dragons are<br>usually posted to keep watch over the Sleeper, aka Kerafyrm, lest<br>he be unleashed upon the world.<br> <br>Conquest had defeated the first three warders that Saturday,<br>and waited to attempt the fourth warder because their force<br>had grown weary and needed rest.<br> <br>After entering the dungeon and making their way down to<br>the fourth warder, they assaulted him in full force.  They<br>had the dragon beaten down, halfway to his death, but<br>the unexpected suddenly happened...<br> <br>The Sleeper awoke.<br> <br>As the army of Conquest was in the process of slaying the<br>Warder, The Sleeper proceeded to slay him outright, and<br>then began assaulting the members of Conquest.<br> <br>Conquest was eventually defeated, and were recuperating,<br>when the emissaries of the gods arrived, and stated :<br> <br>'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone,<br>or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a<br>warning for Exploitation.'<br> <br>The guild was summarily summoned to the area known as<br>"Arena", and was told that everyone involved was being<br>suspended, and their guild disbanded.<br> <br>Suddenly, they found themselves removed from the world,<br>and could no longer inhabit the bodies they had worked<br>so hard on improving.<br> <br>You can find more news at:<br> <br><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz">http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz</a><br> <br>- Vanamar Dz`Baernon, 51st Circle Elementalist<br>- Officer of Eternal Sinn, Lanys T`Vyl Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Brad McQuaid, on behalf of Sony, fired back with <a href="http://lumthemad.net/forums/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=comments&Number=14692&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part=all&vc=1">an official statement</a> on Lum's forum.  Here's an excerpt from that post:<UL>On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught. <br><br>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back. </UL>As you know, I dislike tackling GM abuse stories on the frontpage because most the time we can never seem to get to the truth.  Keeping this in mind, I will not be covering this event any further <i>unless</I> something extremely important arises from this incident.  For readers who wish to find out more, this report has provided both sides of the story with links to find out more information from each source.

The latest updates from Alan can be read here in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Background</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, the reason I always felt Iksar had shaman instead of clerics was because they were tradtionalists and really do not like change. While they are really no longer a "shamanistic" society, they still cling to their old religion and beliefs. Also, it seems they practice ancestral worship, which would mean communing with the spirits of their ancestors which would again encourage them not to make the change to clerics. <br><br>I have gatherd Iksar society is not chaotic at all, on the contrary it's very, very rigid and organized and fear driven. Do what your told or die sort of thing, and it's a very military like in structure. Your role is determined before you are born, you never question the mystics as they are the mouthpiece of Cazic-Thule and to question Cazic-Thule is to ensure your own death and also bring death to your fellows, as punishment for allowing you to question him. Which encourages them to actively try and destroy those who WOULD question Cazic-Thule, thus preventing any worship besides him. <br><br>Well, I'm really too tired to detail my other speculations about Iksar society and their religion, if you ever want to chat Absor just send me a tell, I greatly enjoy discussing the Iksar and everything about them. <br><br>Zildrax Shathrais<br>High-Mystic of Cazic-Thule<br>Morell Thule Server ]</i></font><br><br>That sounds like a good depiction of the Iksar. <br><br>As for the whole Cleric/Shaman thing, it is probably more accurate to describe their worship of Cazic-Thule as more spiritual, more objectified than, say, the way Dark Elves worship Innoruuk. A Dark Elf (if he was trying to be polite) might describe this kind of worship as unsophisticated. But that's not necessarily the case. It is, however, different and perhaps a little more primal. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hail Absor <br><br>Ripped straight from the everquest.com website, i have a piece of information that may shock and discredit you Absor! <br><br>/quote<br>evil hand of Innoruuk touched this land and spawned the Iksar, a powerful reptilian race<br>/quote <br><br>where did i find the pearl of knowledge? at this address:<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp</a> <br><br>Absor, Cazic-thule is a big jerk! he keeps stealing Innoruuks worshippers.. or perhaps he just intimidates them into worshipping him.

I always look forward to patch messages..go figure. Was the patch delayed or was it just to small to post the changes? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Galadin Trenchant<br>42 Warrior]</i></font> <br><br>Sorry.

Alan gave us some new information concerning the upcoming patch on the Developer's Corner:<UL>When we patch tomorrow (6-5-01), we will be introducing code on Rallos Zek server that will result in faction hits similar to those on the team servers.<br><br>Killing a character in any of their races home town will cause you to take a faction hit. This counts for all home cities. So, if you kill a Human in any of the city zones of Qeynos (or Freeport, or Surefall Glade), you will suffer a faction hit, even if that Human was born in Freeport. All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves. There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves and Half-Elves in Greater Faydark. Killing an Erudite in either Paineel or Erudin will cause a faction hit.<br><br>Also, for those of you trying to start or complete quests for King Tormax, you need to know that we've made a change. You will now need to be in good standing with him in order to do his quests. In game terms, this means you will need to be at least amiable.<br><br>Alan</UL>Visit the update by following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html">this link</a>.

After a restful weekend, Alan returned to the Developers Corner with several new updates:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar and Religion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Okay, here's my question. It seems that the Iksar cannot be agnostic because they have a firm, unbending belief in Cazic-Thule. I can accept that. :-) But, it leaves me wondering why such a devout people have no clerics of their chosen deity. The Iksar society and history seems sophisticated enough to support clerics in their ranks, but yet they cannot follow that path. I was just wondering why that was. :-) <br><br>Kullom Faithforge<br>22nd Level Paladin of Brell<br>High Council of Faydwer<br>Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Perhaps in their past, at the height of their society they could indeed be clerics, I don't know. But now, despite their past, the Iksar are indeed a relatively unsophisticated society currently.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Mcicontrol</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If you want to disable Auto Play (took me about an hour to figure this out.. not to mention a lot of ejecting/reinserting the CD) <br><br>Pasted directly from Windows help: <br><br>Double-click My Computer. <br>On the View menu, click Folder Options, and then click the File Types tab. <br>Click AudioCD, and then click Edit. <br>In Actions, click Play, and then click Set Default. <br>Notes <br>You can temporarily disable AutoPlay by pressing SHIFT while you insert an audio CD. <br>Repeating steps 1 through 4 enables AutoPlay again. <br><br>And there you have it. I hope this helps everyone! <br><br>(who knew windows help was actually *useful*! ) <br><br>Delphi ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tips. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have to retract part of my post. <br><br>The back and forward will not work because extra variables are required, and the current implementaion of /mcicontrol will not allow for variables (or I jsut havn't figured out what the variable is...) <br><br>So... :)<br><br>Sorry! but I did put in disclaimers :)<br><br>Grimone, Tunare ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks again. I thought I had heard that you couldn't do that&#8230; <br><br>And we both put in disclaimers. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just some more info: <br><br>I've found that in game, to play a CD, you must type: <br><br>/mcicontrol open cdaudio<br>/mcicontrol play cdaudio <br><br>But if that CD finishes playing, before I can play another, I have to type: <br><br>/mcicontrol close cdaudio <br><br>And then open it again with a new CD in the drive. <br><br>This may be of some use to people, <br><br>Absydion Darkflame<br>48 Wizard [Silent Ascension]<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>The more tips the merrier, I always say. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If you play an MP3/CDA (CD Audio) track using this new-fangled mcicontrol thing, will it cancel any in-game noise? I'd hate to have to trade music for not hearing hill giant footsteps coming my way... <br><br>Asfaloth ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think it plays along with the game sounds. So you still might not hear that hill giant&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000179.html"><b>PvP Patch Issues</b></a><br>Greyfin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As a melee I'm not thrilled with the pvp debuff rule change, but I'll not comment until I see how that effects gameplay... <br><br>However, I am concerned about "only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights. We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters." <br><br>This means that my guildmates and my party members cannot protect me by looting me... This loss of protection seems to me to be an acceptable result to protect players from "ninja-looting" players. In 90 days played on RZ I've been pk'd at least a dozen times. Only once was I "ninja looted" and that player (ie a stranger) gave me back the item for a reward, but at least 6 or 7 times my party members have been able to "protect" me from my foe by looting me first. And I know that I've "protected" plenty of friends by looting them... <br><br>I look forward to your comments. ]</i></font><br><br>My comment is that looting someone to protect them from being looted by the person that killed them sounds like a way of circumventing the intended cost of PvP combat rather than a feature. <br><br>And with this change there is no such thing as ninja looting against a PC, so there is no need for that protection. <br><br>The current solution might be imperfect, but it is certainly better than the old method. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor writes:<br>We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic ... <br><br>Ok, so would I. The question remains... why don't you? ]</i></font><br><br>Because of limitations to the game engine. I can't really explain it further than that. It's not something that we're completely ruling out, but it isn't something that is easily changed.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Quests</b></a><br>GreyRake wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have another suggestion on how to make the participation in quests more appealing. Currently, a quest begins when you say a certain exact phrase to a NPC. I am sure that there are many interesting quests that are rarely embarked on because no one knows the exact words to trigger a response from the first NPC. <br><br>How about having some quests that find you? You have an NPC looking for a player character with appropriate characteristics that are needed for the quest. These could be based on a combination of class, level, race, faction, religion or location. For example, while running through the Karanas, an NPC farmer hails you and requests aid with a problem that has been vexing him. Another idea would be to have a representative of you deity appear and place a holy quest upon you. Etc... <br><br>By assigning quests this way, you add elements of spontaneity and unpredictability to your travels through Norath. This also makes sure that the player character has appropriate characteristics to make the quest challenging and the rewards worthwhile. <br><br>The caveat for this type of quest assignment is to keep it rare. You don't want NPC's pestering everyone who passes. This could be tied to a certain spawn. An NPC could spawn, look for an appropriate character for a while then de-spawn for another few days if no one matching is around.]</i></font> <br><br>I like this idea, but I see some problems with it. For example, what if the NPC seeks out people that don't want to do quests? What if he's pestering them when they are in the middle of a dangerous combat? <br><br>I do see some very interesting possibilities with this, though. I don't know how possible it is within the game itself, but you've certainly sparked some ideas there&#8230; :)<br><br>Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, I'd like to add support to the cursed item suggestion. In every role plaing system I've encountered and in just about every major fantasy epic, there are items that are cursed ( or are inherently evil or ones that warp the bearer after a while). The classic one being the one ring in Lord of the rings. <br><br>I think it would be great to have the chance of picking up an item only to find that it is cursed and you can't get rid of it (except by a quest) and that it has a detrimental effect on the PC. <br><br>Some ideas - <br><br>1) the item would not be known to be cursed until picked up - until then it would look like any other variant of the item (this stops the cursed item being left lying around). <br><br>2) The cursed item cannot be dropped, traded or destroyed - it affects your mind and you don't want to part with it - or can't take it off. <br><br>3) The knowers of all things arcane (i.e. wizards) could have their identify spell improved to identify the curse on the item - and provide the answer on how to get rid of it via a quest. <br><br>4) cursed items of both good, evil and deity specific origins. <br><br>5) what is a curse for one person might just be an inconvenience for another and the bonus properties of the item might make it worth holding onto. <br><br>Side effects - <br><br>1) people will moan - change something and people will moan, change nothing and other people will moan - facts of life ! <br><br>2) But you've nerfed Item X !!! No, with maybe a 1 in 50 of Item X being cursed - you've got to be really unlucky to get one - you've stopped farming however ! <br><br>3) You provide more hooks into Noraths history <br><br>4) You give wizards another reason for people to search them out <br><br>5) you provide a huge number of potential quests <br><br>6) You give the programmers a headache to implement (but hey, if it was easy they wouldn't be in the job - I know I've been a coder myself :)) <br><br>Just some thoughts <br><br>Malathos<br>Wizard<br>Terris Thule ]</i></font><br><br>I'm certainly in favor of an idea like that. Rather than having such items be cursed versions of existing items, just have them be new items (though it might be more effective if that new item looked like an old on, and very rarely dropped in places where the old one could be found&#8230;). <br><br>Sure, it creates a ton of new quest ideas. But it's not as though there is a lack of such ideas. Though it's always nice to more ideas than you could possibly use.</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There is going to be a completely player run ladder on Tallon Zek.<br> <br>First, Some Background:<br> <br>I used to play Neverwinter Nights on AOL.  My guild, KAAOS, came up with this PVP Ladder idea.  The ladder ran strong with hundreds of participants for over 2 years.   It sprang into a Doubles ladder,  and even a Quad-team ladder. (This is what we are hoping to get to as well)<br> <br>We have set up a forum (which can be found here:  <a href="http://pub72.ezboard.com/btallonzekpvpladder">http://pub72.ezboard.com/btallonzekpvpladder</a>) and a website will be up in a few days at <a href="http://home.mmcable.com/tzladder">http://home.mmcable.com/tzladder</a>   (Will have its own URL when I get the routing finished :)<br> <br>Ladder has no level requirement at the moment..but we have discussed breaking down the levels to make it fair for everyone (21-30lvl, 31-40lvl, etc)<br> <br>If you need any more info please let me know.<br> <br>Sincerely,<br> <br>Croazil Upnya<br>Level 60 Warlord of Pandemonium<br>Tallon Zek</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.
