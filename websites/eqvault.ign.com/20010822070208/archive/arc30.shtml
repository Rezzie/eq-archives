Alan roared back on the Gameplay Board with a vengeance with several posts on a very broad range of topics:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-5.html"><b>The Death of Necros</b></a><br>Demrack wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Ok, so if this is to be our only role in large raids where is the necro mana version of the cleric complete heal?"]</i></font> <br><br>Not at all. There are other things that a necromancer can do. You all eschew the use of pets on raids, but they work just fine against any creature that doesn't use fear. And there is Dead Man Floating, summoning corpses&#8230; <br><br>I'm not going to pretend to know everything about how a necromancer works. My concern here is that some of you are calling necromancers useless in any big raid, when it's not true. You may not be able to do a ton of damage to the boss monster, but that is by no means all there is to doing a raid. If you see massive damage dealing as the only way that your necromancer is useful, then that is where we disagree. <br><br>Musicicus said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "First off clerics are used in Raids more favorably because not only can they heal, but if the raid goes bad, they can return the exp of the bad raid."]</i></font> <br><br>And a necromancer can return the corpses so that the cleric can work&#8230; No, necromancers have as much to do post and pre raid as any other class, and more than some. And I don't hear most of you concerned with that. The major concern here seems to be that at the 'big' fight you are relegated to a support role, and you don't like that (and that you're not exceedingly efficient at it). In other parts of a raid, clearing or recovering, a necromancer is as useful as any other class (yes, even clerics). I hear that druids are in a similar position. On a raid all they do is a bit of healing and other support stuff&#8230; <br><br>Oh, and you mentioned DoTs making corpses poof. <br><br>They don't. As far as we can tell, it hasn't happened in months. We haven't been able to make it happen. At least not on anything like a raid-level mob. If anyone has seen a high level NPC corpse poof from a DoT in the last three months, please let me know and tell me exactly how and where and when and what. High level mobs shouldn't poof anymore. We've coded it so that it just shouldn't happen. It will happen on rare occasions for lower level stuff, and that's probably not going to change (though we are looking at this whole thing again right now). But the high-level-raid-boss-monster-type-NPC corpses shouldn't poof at all due to a fix we made months ago. Don't let that stop you from using DoTs. <br><br>LordZemus said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "But let's face it. Yes there is a drawback to our soloing power, and you can't complain of it. First off, having a necromancer or two on a raid is a good safety net. Do you know anyone else who can fd and res? And yes, your guildmates will be willing to let you sacrifice some secondaries once they notice you're the only one left at wipeouts. Cleric or wizard used too much mana? Pump them. Enchanter getting pummeled by a mob? ST, turn your pet's taunt back on (you do leave it off for raids, don't you?) and send it, or cast anything out of the Heart Flutter line, guaranteed to make the mob want to eat you. Throw a shadowbound out to save that tank, because Bond of Death and Deflux WILL hit every mob except the last one, despite these asinine complaints. Oh, and your DoTs do hit. Try using the right ones."]</i></font> <br><br>Some folks don't agree with the idea that a class that is exceptionally powerful at all other portions of the game might have to take a power-hit in this one part of the game. And it's not such a big hit, as there are still several useful things that make a necromancer useful on a raid. Thanks for pointing some of them out. <br><br>GeistTallon wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "LordZemus: <br><br>I'm suspicious of you even being a necro. Half the stuff you said doesn't work at all, or isn't a viable option 90% of the time."]</i></font> <br><br>I'd love to read your counter arguments to those points of his that you don't agree with. <br><br>Aerik N'Krosis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I wish they'd make out pets immune to fear at least (like a mindless undead should be!). Maybe use the owner's resistances for the pet? Or else lower the ubermob resistances now that they can have more than 32k HPs. This way we necros could at least DoT them and make a contribution to the fight that is in keeping with the original PURPOSE of the necromancer."]</i></font><br><br>It seems pretty unlikely that things that are currently immune to spells will be made less immune. But I kinda like the idea of making powerful undead pets immune to fear&#8230; In any case, rest assured that I'm passing this thread to the team to read, so it's not like I'm final arbiter on anything you all suggest. <br><br>Mongo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1. Ignite/Chill Bones: There is no functional purpose for the skeleton effect. The coolness factor fades very quickly, and the effect has the potential for making an epic encounter harder. <br>Solution - remove the illusion. These spells do land on some epic encounters, but they're forbidden because of the effect. With the illusion gone, Necromancers would have the ability to cast DD spells during these encounters. With no functional purpose to the illusion, is there an actual reason to keep it?"]</i></font><br><br>This is something that I want to look into further. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2. DOT spells: Very simply, corpses still do poof at times when using these spells. This effects not only epic encounters, but really any encounter that may have a desired drop. <br>Solution - With as hard as this has been apparently to recreate on a consistent basis, I don't know what kind of programming solution may be available. If the problem itself cannot be reliably fixed, is there anything that could be established so that (for example) any loot on that monster would remain in play on the ground? That may not be possible, but this needs to be addressed, directly or indirectly."]</i></font> <br><br>They shouldn't be poofing any more. Not on NPCs over 55th level, which would include anything considered a raid-level encounter. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "3. Mana-dumping: Necromancers make very inefficient manastone's on these raids for the simple reason that they cannot draw mana from the mob. If this is what Necromancer's are left with on epic encounters, it should at least be somewhat efficient. <br>Solution - if making Lifetaps usable is not an option, could the mana-transfer spells be looked at so they are viable in these situations? Certainly, most would prefer that taps be usable, but if Verant more or less officially sees this as the role of Necromancers on these type of raids, at least make it a viable, efficient one."]</i></font> <br><br>Changing the resistance to Lifetap is probably not an option. And making mana transfers more efficient would be a balancing nightmare&#8230; <br><br>Let me suggest to all of you that there is no reason that your role in this one part of the game can't be different than it is in all other parts of the game. For example, enchanters don't do 'crowd control' on, say Trakonon. Their role there is different than what they do in, say, Guk or wherever. I, personally, don't see a changed role in one part of the post 50 game as a bad thing, not at all. Whether that role is useful enough, now that might be something worth talking about. But a complaint based solely on the fact that your role may be different at one point of the game than it is in others isn't something that I can fully support. I'm not saying that it's not a valid complaint, I just think that it's more of a personal opinion than a threat to the value of the class. And where one personal opinion varies from another&#8230; there may be as many necromancers that like being able to support their group on big raids as a change from just beating things up. I don't know, and it's hard for me to know. It's important to keep that in mind during this discussion.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044525.html"><b>Necro Thread</b></a><br>It would be more useful to explain all that to me in response to the thread that you are responding to. Making a new thread sort of takes everything out of context...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044203.html"><b>%R Problem</b></a><br>That seems odd to me too. <br><br>I'll ask into it. But I think the person I need to ask is still on vacation...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044204.html"><b>Plane of Mischeif</b></a><br>The Plane of Mischief is indeed in place and accessible. It just seems that nobody has found the entrance yet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044240.html"><b>Bug Fixed: NPCs Hitting Caster Through Pets </b></a><br>A recent patch fixed a bug that was allowing NPCs to hit pet owners no matter how far away they were. The problem occurred when three NPCs were already attacking a pet. Any additional NPCs would swing at and hit the owner of the pet, no matter how far away he was. <br><br>This was fixed, but we forgot to announce it. I thought you'd like to know.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043838.html"><b>Bard Son Bugs?</b></a><br>Fair enough. I'll pass that on to the team. <br><br>SSoT (the 51 song) no message. <br><br>Aria (31 I think) message.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043927.html"><b>"Suspended For Too Long"</b></a><br>I don't know the specifics of your situation. But I want to clear something up about suspensions. <br><br>I have been told that they generally last 7 to 10 business days. This would usually not include weekends and holidays, so it's possible that you may have a few more days to go.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043992.html"><b>Have there been pet level changes?</b></a><br>The only change that we've made to pet levels at all recently was the change that made it so that pets summoned with the 39th level spells would automatically raise themselves to 36th level if they were lower level than that. This only affects that particular spell. It was not any sort of global summoning change, and had no effect on the summoning spell that you are talking about. <br><br>It's possible that you've just been having a run of bad luck.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043031-4.html"><b>Archery Damage Problem</b></a><br>Yes, bow damage was unintentionally capped recently. We'll be changing it back when we patch next. <br><br>The reasoning behind it this mistake is pretty complicated. Basically, there was a damage cap already in place, but it wasn't being used. When we were setting up stuff for the new discipline we activated that cap (that's how it was intended to work when first designed, I guess). <br><br>Basically, we'll be putting it back as it was soon. I'm sorry about the mistake.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043039-2.html"><b>"DOTS  Should Stack"</b></a><br>ShockaZuulu wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "This is no different than 2 wizards landing 2 ice comets. The only difference is your limitations in programming."]</i></font> <br><br>Sure there is. Damage over time spells are more efficient than direct damage spells. Spell effect stacking is the trade off for more damage at a lower mana cost. <br><br>I do agree, though, that the whole thing with corpses disappearing needs to be resolved.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877-2.html"><b>Welcome To Negative Respect (Two Posts From Alan, One From Brad)</b></a><br>I'm going to respond only to the original post. It would take me hours to respond to the whole thing in any detail at all&#8230; :)<br><br>AuntieShaynta: <br><br>Well, I stand by my 'victims' statement. I'm not going to argue it with you, except to suggest that perhaps you didn't read it as I intended to write it. The fault there would lie with me, I understand. I could spend another ten posts discussing it, but that would be redundant. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me. But I see no reason for that to make you respect me less. That's something I'll have to think about. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Instead, what you (Verant) did was to purposefully and knowingly give an ability to other classes and purposefully and knowingly did not give enchanters this ability -- nor any form of compensation." ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, we did. And we didn't give it to the other&#8230; minor pet classes either. We gave it to the classes that we consider primary pet classes. I honestly see nothing wrong with this. And I see no logic behind the idea that one class should be 'compensated' for things done to other classes. Should we, then, reduce the power of your class any time we reduce the power of another? I think you're failing to see the larger picture. We didn't make that choice to spite anyone, be they enchanter or shaman or any other class (in a way, rogues could use your argument and want to know why they were not also compensated for something that the these other classes were given). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1) I was told by Verant that I would be able to enchant weapons, including the ability to enchant weapons to cast spells. I have seen this degraded several times despite a direct promise from Brad that enchanters enchanting weapons WOULD be implemented "in the long run". Now I see several spells that appear to be the "enchant weapon" spells -- being given to other classes. I'm reserving judgement, frankly against my better judgement."]</i></font>  <br><br>I've been following this game as long as anyone, longer than most. I've seen what you saw too, though not in exactly the same way. <br><br>At first the idea of enchanting weapons was just that, an idea. It became a 'something we'd really like to do' thing before beta. During beta it became a 'we really want to do it, but it doesn't look like we can' thing. At release it was the same way, something that they wanted to do. I don't remember any promises, from Brad or anyone else. But I might have missed that. <br><br>I can't say I disagree with you about the apparent ability that another class might or might not be getting to do something that seems very similar to enchanting an item. Personally, I plan to push for that ability, if it exists, to be given to enchanters in some way. But there may be technical issues that neither you nor I are aware of. So let's both wait and see. Though I kinda fail to see how any of this make me less respectable&#8230; Remember, you were talking about Absor, not Verant&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2) I saw the by-any-definition poorly-handled "mage pets aren't dual wielding" fiasco solved in what had to be the second poorest way possible -- requiring giving pets weapons but removing the delay-reducing benefit of doing so. A blatant nerf to the two classes that could already have a dual wielding pet by giving them weapons. One of those classes got an admittedly small compensations. The other was told "You're not a pet class" -- despite the fact we get pets at every spell level pre-50. I took this in stride, but it was noted. <br><br> 3) Now I see what should have been the solution to the mage-pet-dual-wielding fiasco being put in much later -- and once again enchanter pets are purposefully left out. Without compensation. In fact, with a mild attendent nerf (I can't attest to this myself, as I haven't even seen a SoR yet ingame) of our pets not proc'ing as much as they used to." ]</i></font><br><br>And I guess your disagreement is with the idea that enchanters are not a pet class. They are a secondary pet class. There are two primary pet classes, magicians and necromancers. All others are secondary pet classes. *shrug* I can see how you might not like that definition, but that is the definition (we not only 'get' to set those definitions, we 'must' set those definitions or the classes wouldn't be balanced at all). Enchanters are unique in their way, as you say. They get pets at all levels. But you'll note that they also have very weak pets, in comparison. That is by design. <br><br>I think the problem here is perspective. Mine is that enchanters are secondary pet classes, and therefore they shouldn't have pets that get to dual wield without a weapon. Yours is that you are a pet class and therefore your pets deserve that ability. I don't know what I can say to change your perspective. And I don't know what you can do to change mine. I only wish you could understand why we made that choice. It's really not a matter of 'compensation' for anything done in the past. It's a matter of how it should be. We can't sacrifice the balance of the game just to compensate for things we might have done in the past. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  " What's more, I know you (Verant) aren't going to correct any of the "core" problems with EQ. Everything is subject to change, it seems, except the things that most need changing." ]</i></font><br><br>What are the core problems? I'm curious about your take on that. Certainly the fact that enchanters don't make magic items isn't a core problem. It might be the core of your personal dissatisfaction with your favorite class, one that I can't deny. I wish it was in there too. But enchanters work, they work well. They are unique, they fit into the game, they&#8230; they work. Do they work as they were initially intended? Maybe, but not entirely. Do they work the way you want them to? It seems not. That's unfortunate. But enchanters are still a rockin' class, and they have some of the coolest abilities of any class in game (and I'm not talking about Clarity, I'm talking about illusions). <br><br>But, at the end of all of this, I have to ask the personal question, since this is clearly a personal issue between you and me. How have _I_ earned your disrespect?<br>--<br>Alcarion, <br><br>I'll accept that Brad said that. I have no problem believing it. But when did he say it? Before beta? Early in beta? I know that it's something he wanted for enchanters. So did I when I was reading about EverQuest as a young pup (it seems that long ago). Sometimes the things we want just don't happen. I wouldn't count it out completely, even so. I understand your frustration about not getting that, I share it. But is that really a reason to be unhappy with everything else that an enchanter can do? <br><br>And, in a way, they can enchant items through the use of jewelcrafting skill and their enchant metal spells. It's not exactly what we had all hoped for at the beginning, but it don't suck. <br><br>As for the accusation that I'm not the same person that I was when I wrote for EverQuest Express, well that's not true. I do represent Verant now. I have to keep in mind that anything I say will be copied on a dozen news sites. So, yes, I have to be more concise and accurate with what I say. And it's highly unlikely that I'll be calling Brad names any time soon on these boards (really, I've stopped doing that&#8230; and /roleplaying rocks! &#8211; hehe&#8230;). But I'm no different than I was before. And I still have the same goals that I've ever had for EverQuest as a player and a critic. <br><br>For example, I can't rant at you for making a post like that&#8230; :)<br><br>And I am giving you the facts with my own insight tossed in. I'm just not as ranty about it as I used to be. If you think that I'm spouting lies to you in my posts, then I could see how you would think that I'd changed. But that also means that you might not have had all that high of an opinion of me in the first place. And I understand that too.<br>---<br>Brad responds:<Blockquote>I do recall replying to AuntieShaynta publicly quite some time ago, stating that it was still our intent to implement Enchanters enchanting items, but that such plans were still very much in the planning stages and considered long term. <br><br>And I stand by it -- I still think we'll see that one day (and given our desire to pretty much freeze class balancing, it will probably be one of the last significant class enchancements). But hey, never say never :)  Consider traps :)<br><br>Also, if I recall correctly, item enchantment was also talked about in earlier pre-release (probably pre-beta, but I'm not certain) FAQs, but I later had it removed (along with guildhouses, lycanthropy, vampirism, etc.) It simply was one of the few features we'd planned on but didn't have time to deliver on. <br><br>It does trouble me a little that even though I try to be clear about whether something is short term, or long, or something we're only thinking about, etc. that it often turns into a 'promise' over time... but I guess that's unavoidable. It's a form of the 'telephone game' quite often, where one person hears that we said one thing, and then they tell somebody else, and the message sort of evolves from there :)<br><br>Just to let you all know, there are still a TON of things we want to add to EQ, and we feel EQ has a very long life ahead of it. For example, although it's too early to say much, I will say that we've got some VERY big plans post-Velious. <br><br>And Tera, wow... not sure what to say :(  I certainly do my best to live up to my word. Again, though, some times things I talk about as something planned evolve somehow into 'promises'... And then some things I hopefully characterized as 'long term' are still just that: long term plans that haven't happened yet. <br><br>All things considered I'm very proud of our track record and just how much of the game we talked about pre-release game into fruition. And I'm also very proud of where the live and expansion teams have taken the game post-release. IMHO, EQ is almost everything we'd planned it to be and a whole lot more.</blockquote><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041985.html"><b>Velious Pet Code</b></a><br>There are ways to avoid the problem that you describe with your pet.

We always tend to get a good laugh, or roll our eyes at unfortunate individuals who end up spending their lives in EverQuest and then get interviewed in some article or go on some talk show because they goofed up in real-life.  These people give the MMORPG genre a bad name and help popular culture associate the people who these games as stereotypical losers with no lives.  As the webmaster of this site I've come across and met such people who unfortunately have little self-control...<br><br>...and until this day I thought I'd seen it all as far as real-life incidents caused by the result of someone overplaying, causing some sort of disaster, and then subsequently blaming it on EQ. (Remeber, it's always the game's fault.  Never the individual.)<br><br>The following excerpt, from an <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/News/010301/Hillsborough/Father_guilty_in_deat.shtml">article published today</a> on the St. Petersburg Times (a Tampa Bay newspaper), is just <b>sickening</b>:<UL><i><b>TAMPA --</b> As his 9-month-old son cried last July, Tony Lamont Bragg Sr.'s mind was on something else: a computer game called Everquest. <br><br>Authorities believe Bragg squeezed Tony Jr. to keep him quiet, then left him unattended in a utility closet in their Temple Terrace apartment for more than 24 hours. The boy died. <br><br>On Tuesday, Bragg, 24, pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. <br><br>Bragg had been playing the online fantasy role-playing computer game for hours and appeared to get annoyed by his son's crying, said prosecutor Suzanne Rossomondo. </i></UL>*shakes his head and goes back to work*

Spotted on <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com">RPGVault</a> that a couple more reviews of the Scars of Velious have surfaced on the net.  The <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/031/080/everquestsv-01-r.html">first one is found on CGO</a> and it awards SoV 4 and 1/2 stars:<UL>What detracts from this beguiling immersion? Things that the absorbed faithful probably no longer even notice&#8212;the long-standing spelling errors that still permeate the text ("Jobarn's eyes gleam with maddness!"), the glassy stares of the NPCs eternally gazing past you outside their guilds and shops, the crew-less boats, the banal zone-chatter, and the rather incongruous total absence of blood. One need travel no further than the nearest theater playing Dungeons & Dragons: The Movie to feel the outraged shudders of Tolkien and Robert E. Howard from their graves, but EverQuest treats the much-maligned underpinnings of heroic fantasy with such reverence, it's easy to see why the sanest of adult folk get so wrapped up in their character's needs and persona.</UL>The <a href="http://www.gamepower.com/games/html/18891main.html">second review</a> was published on the pages of GamePower.  They awarded the expansion pack a 3/4 star rating:<UL>So those are the three major groups of creatures on Velious -- the Coldain Dwarves, the giants, and the dragons. There's a city for each. The dwarves are in conflict with the giants and the giants are, in turn, in conflict with the dragons and dwarves. The zones are set up in a somewhat linear manner, so you'll have to travel through the dwarven areas before reaching the main giant areas, which come before the dragon areas. This is new for EverQuest, which previously had continents that allowed for more free-form travel. </UL>

As a New Years present I've published a few editorials and fan fiction updates.  This should complete the big update to those sections, if I've missed anyone's submission (or if you have any EQ-related content to submit) please email it to me at <a href="mailto:aurum@vaultnetwork.com">aurum@vaultnetwork.com</a>.  Content updates should occur normally after I finish catching up this week.  Here's today's updates:<UL><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid978386181,77101,"><b>The Simple Art of Online Role Playing: A Practical Guide</b></a><br>That&#8217;s right, the simple &#8220;art&#8221; of role-playing. Maybe some of you reading that headline scoffed, but the fact can&#8217;t be denied: there is no science to role-playing, no method that can be easily applied to ensure success. That said, &#8220;art&#8221; is the only remaining classification broad enough to cover the myriad of elements that can come into play when &#8220;role playing&#8221; a character. It may sound a bit high-minded, but it&#8217;s true all the same, and the sooner all us online RPer&#8217;s accept it, the sooner we&#8217;ll realize that there&#8217;s more involved in successfully role playing a character than simply choosing an unpronounceable moniker and chopping up monsters. Yet, realization and implementation are vastly different things, so, to make the transition easier for you gaming masses, I&#8217;ve decided to write this article and provide some simple guidelines. So read on brave warrior/cleric/thief/druid/paladin/ranger/wizard/magician/enchanter&#8230;sheesh&#8230;<br><br>-By Neverly <br><br><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid978386576,72695,"><b>The Name Police Strike Again</b></a><br>Every time I play EverQuest I'm confronted by characters named after rock <br>stars, real world companies, other famous personages or names that just <br>don't fit into the game. It bugs me and it detracts from the game <br>atmosphere. Fortunately EverQuest has a naming policy that, as vague as it <br>is, does not permit characters to have such names. Unfortunately all of <br>the characters I'm talking about are computer controlled NPCs. Apparently <br>Verant Interactive doesn't see fit to abide by its own policies. No big <br>deal, right? After all, it is their game and they can do with it as they <br>wish. I think the issue goes a bit deeper than that.<br><br>-By Rolli Polli<br><br><LI><a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid978387649,2178,"><b>Ascension & Fortunes of War</b></a><br>There comes a time when a tale of an adventurer&#8217;s life must be told. Perhaps now it&#8217;s time for mine.<br><br>My name is Connavar Demonblade, a Wolf of the North and Guild Officer of the Swords of Rhigante. A burden lies across my soul and only through sharing it with all of you can it be lifted. Have you ever asked yourself the question &#8220;Why am I here?&#8221; or &#8220;What is my purpose?&#8221; Until recently, I did not understand the importance of those questions, meaningless babble from those educated, well-mannered nobles.<br><br><br>It was one of those nobles, that drove me across Norrath on a quest that would change my life and that of those with me. Are you settled? Then let me begin.<br></UL>Featured Artwork will be given a large update on Tuesday/Wednesday, it's been a long time in coming. :)  I'd also like to express my appreciation to all of you for your patience as I adjust to life after a very wacky & unusual month. :)

The Ruins of Kunark, the first EQ expansion, was recently named <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/features/pc/bestof_2000/p2_14.html">GameSpot's Expansion of the Year</a>.  The following is a clip from the awards page:<UL>The original EverQuest was a highly ambitious game that drew its themes and content from traditional Western fantasy lore, legends, and imagery, and it continues to allow thousands of players to enter a virtual 3D online world where they can indulge in adventure by playing as elves, barbarians, trolls, dark elves, gnomes, dwarves, and more in a variety of classes such as necromancer, druid, magician, wizard, shaman, enchanter, and so on. EverQuest was already a very successful game before The Ruins of Kunark appeared in late March this year, and the expansion has definitely played a notable role in increasing the original game's popularity and longevity. </UL>Thanks Pav and Wizaro!

EverQuest and the massively-multiplayer genre continues to receieve attention from the mainstream media as evident in a recent <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-4300652.html">Reuters article found on CNet News.com</a>.  As always, here's a clip from this article:<UL>The Sony division was built mostly around its acquisition of the "EverQuest" creators. About 300,000 people play the game, which has developed a cult following, with thousands of characters and items on sale at Web auction site eBay for as much as $3,500. <br><br>"We think 'EverQuest' has been as close as you can get to having a killer app in such a fragmented market," said Kelly Flock, chief executive of Sony Online Entertainment. "We believe a lot of the hard-core gamers have fallen by the wayside and we're seeing more first timers." <br><br>The game has been making money, but Sony Online Entertainment has been reinvesting most profits. The company has also announced, with LucasArts Entertainment, the formation of a virtual "Star Wars" world. The game should be unveiled in 2002. </UL>Thanks Sharada!

Does re-vamp mean making them harder like has been done before? Taking them away from the low levels?

Yes, it&#8217;s possible that we&#8217;ll make some of those places harder. It&#8217;s also possible that we&#8217;ll go the other way and make them more accessible for the lower level crowd...

Erika Check is the writer behind a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/485115.asp">recent Newsweek article</a> exploring many different aspects of the EverQuest/MMORPG universe.  Overall the piece is an entertaining read.  Here's a clip from this article:<UL>Verant&#8217;s pro-social strategy isn&#8217;t just a touchy-feely novelty. It makes good business sense. &#8220;To prolong the longevity of the game, you don&#8217;t want to promote people playing alone for a few hours and then quitting,&#8221; says Butler. Especially since EverQuest relies on a $10 monthly subscription fee. So far, Verant&#8217;s strategy seems to be working. Butler says more than half the players who buy the game keep playing. That makes 285,000 active subscribers. Fans say the social focus is key to the game&#8217;s success: &#8220;It will be a long time before any other games can offer the challenge I get from playing against real&#8212;and thus unpredictable&#8212;people I meet online,&#8221; says Jennifer Bowen, a 28-year-old mother who&#8217;s been playing EverQuest since its inception.</ul>For the rest of this article please use the link in the above.

Brad posted the current plan that Verant has for EverQuest's ongoing evolution today on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043420.html">his post</a>:<UL><i>Here's the rough plan:<br><br>1. Finish up last minute Velious tuning.<br>2. Massive re-vamp of underused dungeons in the old world, implementing Kunark/Velious style loot/quests/mob spawning/etc. This will include both high level and mid level zones.<br>3. Add at least 2 free zones, probably focussed on Odus.<br>4. Begin work and planning for the next big thing (yes, I'm purposely being vague here, for now).<br><br>Also, you should see more trade skill upgrades, more interface upgrades, general engine upgrades, etc.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

Surely enough, i hadn't dropped, traded, or sold it; it was just gone.<br><br>Has anything like this ever happened to anyone else?
