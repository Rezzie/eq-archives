I spotted the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042635.html">following thread</a> on the Gameplay Board which contains post Gordon Wrinn created:<UL>Who are you to decide whats best for the game? <br><br>I think the people should decide whats best for EQ.<br>If melee want to bind themselves in the city. Let them.<br><br>If people feel that classes are unbalanced ask them why and make those changes.<br><br>It is the people that make the game. Isn't it?<br><br>Or you may not see people sign-up for Star Wars or EQ2 later.<br><br><b><i>Frankly Brian, as the designers of the game, we are the ones with personal and financial stakes in its success. Someone (or some entity) has to be the final arbiter of what is good or not good for the game, and it this case it is those people on the EQ tuning team. The people, those who choose to voice their opinion, whether on the boards, through email or feedback, or with their monthly subscription and the people they refer, do have say in this process, and we have implemented TONS of features and changes based upon opinions coming directly from the players. <br><br>This doesn't mean however that we can implement every suggestion we receive, or even every suggestion that the people at-large feel is a good idea. We are in the business of keeping our customers, all 217K+ of them, happy, given their multinational orgin, separate desires and expectations, even when those desires, expectations, and needs are in direct conflict with those of another customer. This "direct conflict" is best illustrated by the class-envy posts, emails, and feedbacks we regularly receive. <br><br>Keep in mind that for every class that is absolutely sure that they deserve some new upgrade, enhancement, or feature, there is another class that will feel that they are equally deserving of an upgrade, enhancement, or feature if the first class gets their way. People who have been on this board for a while will be able to attest to this, given that "nerfs" have historically caused less problems than enhancements. This is because when we "nerf" something, only the users of the "nerfed" aspect become upset, whereas when we enhance something, we often start receiving complaints from multiple other sources. A good example of this is when the hitpoints were upped on Paladins and SKs. This action spawned complaints from warriors, rogues, monks, rangers, and bards.<br><br>In the end, we provide a service offering, and if people like that offering they choose to buy our product. If they continue to like our offering from month to month, they choose to continue buying our product through the monthly subscription fees. We'll always strive to encourage you to make this choice, and will continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions expressed in this and other forums to do everything we can that is good for the game as a whole. <br><br>By "good for the game as a whole", I speak of customer retention. Since customer retention is directly tied to customer satisfaction, that is the focus of every decision we make. We believe firmly that people want a game that is challenging and provides some sort of reward for playing, which is why we are so firmly against suggestions that make the game too easy, or reduce the rewards such as by making powerful items extremely commonplace. This is a delicate balance, and though I am sure that we could make a number of people happy in the short term if we made the game easier, made advancement quicker, made classes more powerful, or made items more plentiful, the end result would be that people would become bored much quicker, and leave the game at a greater pace. <br><br>As for our customer retention, an excess of 70% after 14 months is unheard of in the industry, and therefore we are very proud of it. Certainly it could be better and we will continue to aim towards doing more things in game that helps keep people interested in the game. Given though that our customer have very different needs and desires as mentioned above, its very possible that some of the things we do along these lines will upset some customers while encouraging others to stay with us longer. For instance, a good number of people wanted zones that were much more difficult, being far more challenging than those in old EQ. A good number of the Kunark dungeons were built with this in mind. Of course, by doing what one group of customer wanted in this case most certainly has made another group unhappy. Only time will tell what the right decision was in this case, but we continue to believe that challenging and intriguing content is the best strategy to follow.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

EverQuest is alive and kicking according to a recent <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042909.html">response posted</a> by none other than Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid.  Here's the original post followed by his response:<UL>Guys, the ranting (while legitimate) is getting nowhere. ROK is out and that was Verant's last major hurrah. They're not going to change any class fundamentally even though rangers suck post 50 (not a knock, rangers; I've read many of your posts).<br><br>I doubt we'll see any new servers (server pop has actually fallen on most servers and the new ones are horribly underpopulated). They might retool some under-utilized zones, but I wouldn't hold my breath even on that one.<br><br>It was a good run, and the game will linger around like that mother-in-law who's only staying for 3 days, but Verant is clearly moving on. <br><br>It's an equation: put a skeleton screw on EQ and let the addicts continue to pay $10 a month (might lose 50,000); meanwhile, focus attention on Star Wars and gain 100,000+ subscribers. <br><br>Maybe Verant will surprise me and make some actual changes. Problem is, if they do make changes it will be of the Newbie-Guard variety. <br>Wow, re-reading this, they've turned me into a real cynic now :(<br><br><b><i>Quite untrue, actually.<br><br>Nobody from EQ is going to the Star Wars team.<br><br>The EQ Live team continues to pour their heart and souls into the game, making it better with each patch. The rest of the EQ team members continue to work on EQ related projects -- in fact, Kunark has sold so well that we're seriously considering a second expansion.<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>

Gordon Wrinn just responded to the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5664567&page=2">Discussion Thread</a> dedicated to the <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> that was posted earlier today.  In the message Gordon clears up some misconceptions about the post he made last night:<UL><I>In regards to the news posting made today on the front page, of course I<br>meant GM and Guide *characters* are the ones that are excluded from being in<br>player guilds, and vice versa, not the person behind the keyboard in<br>general.  Once in a play character (which is on a different server from that<br>which they are a GM or Guide on), the GM or Guide is NO LONGER a GM or<br>Guide, but a player, and subject to all of the same rules and policies that<br>apply to players.<br><br>The authority of a GM or Guide solely follows the character that is flagged<br>as such. When in a play character, GMs and Guides are not permitted to<br>acknowledge that they hold that position on another server, in order to<br>avoid event he appearance of impropriety.<br><br>I do wish that we could get away from the idea that "someone must be abusing<br>their authority", unfortunately the only way to do this would be to bar the<br>GM and Guide staff from playing the game.  Considering that the Guides are<br>volunteer players, and GMs mostly come from the player populace, and<br>considering that everyone generally wants the GMs to play the game so that<br>they can stay in touch with problems that a player faces, this is something<br>that we'll probably always have to deal with.<br><br>I realize that there are some who believe that someone who is a GM or Guide<br>shouldn't be allowed to be in a player guild with their player-character<br>either, but we do have to draw some line as to what is reasonable.  What is<br>a guild really?  It's basically a group of characters who've decided to hang<br>out together in game.  There's nothing really "special" that changes when<br>someone accepts an invite into a guild, so there's no reason to bar GMs or<br>Guides from joining guilds with their play characters. As I mentioned above,<br>the only thing we could do would be to bar them from playing altogether, and<br>that just wouldn't be reasonable.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Thanks Gordon!

Brennos Oakkeep has wrote a little piece regarding a recent post Gordon Wrinn made on the Gameplay Board yesterday.  I have posted the writings he sent to me as a new <a href="/lore/playerviews">Player View</a> and entitled it <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid958660199,57860,">GMs in Player Organizations</a>.  The article begins on this note:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>Gordon says:<UL><b>"...but GMs and Guides are not allowed to belong to<br>player guilds, and player's aren't allowed to belong<br>to GM/Guide guilds. <br><br>If you have any specific information, such as server,<br>names, etc., feel free to email me (gwrinn@verant.com)<br>and I'll be happy to look into it further."</b></UL><br>Ok, I have always been one of those Verant supporters,<br>but this is just flat out wrong or Gordon is out of<br>touch with what's going on and needs to hush up. I<br>don't know about GM/Guide Favoritism but I do know<br>MANY guides that are in guilds and know of GMs that<br>have been in guilds too. Maybe Gordon means with their<br>GM/Guide character, but I know they have secondary<br>characters in guilds.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very interesting topic and issue that hasn't received a lot of attention in the past.  To remedy this I have started a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5664567&replies=0">Special Discussion Thread</A> on our Player View board to create a place where people can share their thoughts, comments and opinions about this issue.<br><br>A quick note, our fearless Boardbarian just implemented some new technology on the boards that should make navigating them even easier!<br><br>Thanks Brennos!

The jumps will go in heats separated by a short period (1st troll in group vs. 1st ogre in group etc) <br><br>Event 2: Look at that blubber fly! <br><br>Again, 6 members of each race, troll and ogre, will be selected to represent their race. Contestants will be given levitate and on command hover out into the gorge, they will then cancel their levitate (via pumice) and plummet to the earth. The fatty remaining with the fewest amount of HP after the fall shall be deemed the winner. If no fatties survive the fall then&#8230;we will all have a good laugh! <br><br>Intermission <br><br>Gnome kabobs and the finest brews of Innoruuk shall be served for all to enjoy. 2 storytellers shall be selected to share some sort of interesting tale. <br><br>Event 3: Free Style <br><br>This event is open to all that come! Buffers will be available at the top of gorge to provide contestants with requested buffs. Contestants are then given a chance to freestyle to the bottom of the gorge. Judges will observe both take off, midair, and landing. Judging is completely subjective and high biased =). <br><br>Event 4: Drunken Stooper Race <br><br>12 contestants will be chosen of any race to park in the binge drinking contest/race. All contestants will be gathered at point A and required to drink X amount of a provided alcoholic beverage. They will then attempt to reach point B and /poke the judge there. They then race to the gorge and the first one to land shall be deemed the &#8220;Drunken Stooper King&#8221;. <br><br>Event 5: Bikini/Swimsuit Contest <br><br>9+ female contestants will be put through a series of trials to choose the &#8220;Queen of Hate&#8221; award winner. The judging panel will be made up of 9 males, 3 from each race. Female contestants my bribe, seduce, or otherwise manipulate the judges anyway they see fit. =) <br><br>Closing <br><br>Prizes will be awarded to the winning contestants and the remaining food and beverages shall be handed out. (need suggestion, possible another story telling). We will then conduct the duel of the millennium. Vllad vs. Tipp. The winner shall take home the title of the &#8220;THE FAT&#8221; and force to plunge to his death and &#8220;leave his mark&#8221; on Norrath, while the loser will retain &#8220;THE OBESE&#8221; title. The only rule is that outside buffing & healing IS NOT allowed, and the 2 contestants must not leave the circle of onlookers. Weapons, armor and items may be thrown or dropped into the ring from supporting factions. <br><br>Lastly there will be an open forum on any subjects to be address by the evil team.

Gordon was back on the boards answering several posts and even creating a thread himself.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040848-2.html"><b>Item Weight</b></a><br>I'm having some of the weights on Monk stuff looked at today. In other news, Darkforge armor (SK) is having its weight lowered, and should go live the next time we patch items.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041816.html"><b>Ranger Issues</b></a><br>The whole ranger-defense thing is coming from the logic that: At 50 they are balanced. At 60 everyone else gets bonuses to defense, and rangers don't, therefore they aren't balanced. <br>The problem with this logic is that we don't balance classes on a skill-by-skill basis. We balance them as a complete offering. Everything that a class has is part of the equation. The fact that skill-point allocations, ratios, and percentage change as you go level to level is not in and of itself indicative of an imbalance. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041625.html"><b>Wind Saber</b></a><br>Bow's themselves cannot proc (randomly cast a spell on a successful hit). This item was probably supposed to be setup as a charged item. I've asked the Live team to check it out.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042708.html"><b>Frontier Mountains Nerfed?</b></a><br>We haven't retuned the zone. One thing to keep in mind is that most spawns have a level range that they can spawn in. For instance, hill giants can be anywhere from level 33 to 37 in most zones that they are found. <br>My advice would be to kill off all the blue ones, which will again give the higher level ones a chance to spawn again.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042549.html"><b>Buying Stackable Items in Bulk</b></a><br>This subject has come up several times in the past few weeks. As I mentioned before, this is something that we would like to do at some point in the future, but it's not something that we can assign a high priority to right now. It's certainly a good idea and a possibility for the future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042725.html"><b>Do enchanters have any hope of getting illusions past level 44?</b></a><br>No new illusions are planned for enchanters at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042731.html"><b>EQ on a 56K Modem</b></a><br>The majority of the data that EQ transmits is well within the capabilities of even a 28.8K modem. The notable exceptions to this are zoning, which will take longer with a slower connection, and very large battles (ones with a bunch of people involved in the same relative area, such as dragon runs), which may at times cause some data queueing. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042734.html"><b>Caster Items in Kunark</b></a><br>More caster items should turn up as people get around to the deeper areas of Kunark. Charasis, Veeshan's Peak, most of Chardok and Sebilis still haven't been explored yet. The other dungeons as well. <br>As people's comfort level grows, I think we'll start seeing the items turn up as peopel head deeper into the dungeons.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042741.html"><b>Items 'Morphing' Into Something Else?</b></a><br>We did have a morph bug about six months ago that would occasionally cause something to change into another item. In all cases I've seen of this, the item would change to something not at all related to the original item, since the process through which it happened was more or less random. For instance, I had a friend who's glowing torch turned into a pair of cloth pants. <br>Though it certainly may have been possible for something to morph from a silver ruby veil to a silver star ruby veil, my first guess would be that it may be possible that you bought the wrong veil and only noticed it now. It's very easy to miss "Star" in the description. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042829.html"><b>Hasten/Zephyl</b></a><br>We've figured out the problem with these two NPCs not popping/depopping. It's being updated on Test now, and will go to production when next we patch zone data, which will probably happen in a day or two, as a complete server outage isn't required.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html"><b>Quest Armor Camp Time Excessive?</b></a><br>A 72 minute spawn seems ok. Quests for items aren't supposed to give instant gratification. I think that one of the problems we are running into is that when people want an item, they want the item NOW, and any time that it takes to get the item is considered a camp. <br>Things need to take time, or the prestige that comes with having is gone.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042832.html"><b>More on Spawning Time</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Now in a recent Post (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040476.html</a>) You claim the spawns are 72 mins? Get real.]</i> <br><br>I said that a 72 minute spawn on a particular NPC that the person talking about didn't seem out of line. In any case, I think a common misconception that people have is that everyone should be able to get every item. This isn't the way it works. There are things that drop in game once every few weeks, and are truly not meant to be common equipment for everyone. Certianly there is an element of luck involved (right place at right time). <br>Does this mean that people who play more have the opportunity to get more things? Yes. Is that something that should be changed? No. Everyone can't get every item. If that were the case, there'd be nothing special about getting a very nice item, and at that point we might as well sell everything on vendors. Players need to decide what items are important to them, and put in the time that they feel that that item is worth. No one forces anyone to spend 8 hours camping an item. People spend 8 hours camping an item because they feel that it is worth it. <br>The addition of some random loot tables in some areas of Kunark helps the "casual" player that you speak of even more. No longer do they have to track down one particular NPC, but only be fighting in that dungeon or area to have as good a chance of getting a particular item as anyone else fighting in the area. <br>Back to my point, there is no magic shot to make everything "fair" for the casual gamer, because you can always find someone who's more "casual" than the last guy. There's no way to make things equal in every respect whether people play an hour per week or 20 hours per week, and we probably wouldn't want to pursue it even if there was, as it would probably make the game boring. <br>The best advice I could offer to people in your prediciment would be to play the game first, and see what items you get, rather than deciding what items you want, and then playing the game to that end. Discover the items through your normal travels rather than scheduling your travels around items you want. You might find this path a bit more rewarding.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000040.html"><b>The Hole</b></a><br>We're probably looking at sometime late June for a release of the Hole. There have been a few setbacks in its development, including the zone designer having a couple weeks of jury duty, followed by some meetings that the people working on it were involved in. <br>The zone geometry is done, and now it is being textured. After that we have objects, lighting, sounds, NPC pathing info, population, and itemization. </UL>

Five stars are awarded to the Ruins of Kunark in a recent <a href="http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/rick/Kunark/kunark.htm">review published by GamesFirst</a>.  Here's clip from this review:<UL>But the most obvious differences in Kunark are the big ones&#8212;like a whole new continent, for instance. With over 20 zones, many of them for higher-level players, Kunark is a sprawling and nasty place. A word of warning: be very careful where you tread in Kunark. Some of the zones are insanely dangerous, and even players in the high 40s have found it impossible to retrieve their corpses from the hairier zones. But there are some very nice hunting areas for mid-levels as well; zones like the Lake of Ill Omen or Warslik&#8217;s Woods are vast and provide good hunting for levels from 15-35 or so. Even better, the zones are so large and the creature spawns so prolific that camping is not a problem&#8212;at least yet. So far, you can always find something to hunt in Kunark. And from what I understand, the exodus of adventurers to Kunark has left many camps in the Old World open as well. </UL>Use the link above to read the article from start to finish.

Hot off the pages of the Gameplay Board, here is today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042515.html"><b>Pet Regen Rates</b></a><br>Pet regen rates haven't changed. I imagine that you might have gotten a new or higher level pet. Though newer and higher level pets do get more hitpoints, their regen rate is always the same number of hitpoints per tick.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042528.html"><b>Hangman's Noose (haste) From Trakanon Seems to be Broken</b></a><br>I've forwarded this to the test team so that they can have a look. I'm not sure off the top of my head what level haste this item is supposed to have, but assuming that your times are correct it does appear to be broken.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042509.html"><b>Clarifying Previous Post</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: A few weeks ago 2HS was fixed by changing the minimum damage that it would do. Was this change for 2HS only, or does it apply to weapons of all types?]</i> <br><br>It applied to all 2-Handed weapon types. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There are many relatively slow 1H weapons (delays of 35-40) that did not perform as well as their lower-delay cousins. Do high delay 1H weapons now perform as well as low delay 1H weapons of the same ratio?]</i> <br><br>Lower delay weapons still have an advantage over their high delay counterparts of the same ratio due to the way the damage bonuses are applied. <br><br>For instance, assume that a 8-point bonus will be applied on a weapon. In 4 seconds, a 20 delay weapon would apply that bonus twice, whereas a 40 delay weapon would apply it only once. However, if the 40 delay weapon were 2-handed, it would apply a larger bonus.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042496.html"><b>More on Corpses Decaying</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Reason Why Corpses Should NOT Disappear.  Though I have not personally ran into the problem of having a corpse disappear, I am sure I will. But is this realistic? No! Though the flesh and bone of a corpse may rt all it wants, the fact is: ARMOR DOES NOT ROT AS QUICKLY AS FLESH!So why not have the corpses turn into skeletons after a while? The armor would still be on it, and we can all live in peace.]</i> <br><br>Corpses decay in EQ due to the need to maintain a playable framerate for people in the game. As many people have mentioned in some other threads, the number of corpses in the vicinity directly impact the framerate that people experience. Each corpse must be drawn on the screen. Packing tons corpses in close proximity basically has the same effect on framerate as packing a ton of live characters in the same area.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042495.html"><b>AE Mez</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: This is one I cannot fathom for the life of me. in another post, it was mentioned that a pet is "part of the person" by a GM when explaining why pets could not be charmed. Ok...doesnt make total sense to me...but ok. <br><br>That being the case, why in blazes are group pets...including my own little sword and shield...effected by a spell that doesnt hit group members? If they are a part of me...or even if not...they sre still a member of the group. <br><br>Abashi, could you either; <br><br>A. Look at this and see if a change is needed or,<br>B. Give me a rational explanation why it is like this?]</i><br><br>Does it actually hit them, meaning that they get mez'd and stop fighting, or are they just counted in the total number of criters that can be affected?<br><br><i>[Quote from original post: To put it another way, if I use color flux and color shift while two pets are after the mob, I now have three hostile mobs (two pets and the origional) on me untill the pet owners can call them off....which is not always that fast.  So in short, yes it hits them and they become the enemy as soon as the mez breaks. And since I cant control my pet, I have to run and or kill it.]</i><br> <br>Well that certainly doesn't sound right. I'll have the test team check it out and see what we can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042486.html"><b>Tranquil Staff Proc is Still Broken</b></a><br>Ack, I knew I forgot to announce something. The staff is fixed, but you'll need to get ahold of a GM to trade it out for a working one. The current one you have thinks that it is out of charges.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042471.html"><b>A Big Problem with Gyrating Goos</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gyrating Goos, a level 28ish mob [in dalnir] now proc a poison which does 800-900 points of damage!]</i><br> <br>Ouch. That certainly doesn't sound correct. I've got the live team checking it out now. We'll do a special zone-patch for that once it is corrected.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042442.html"><b>Rotting Corpses</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Blah, its NOT fun and exiting to have your corpse rot!!! Dont even try to tell me that! You cant say, i know its exciting for you]</i><br> <br>Very true, in the same fashion that getting severely injured or killed in extreme sports isn't fun either. However, the prospect of that, however remote, does lend a good amount of excitement to the endeavor. If we start retrieving corpses in order to eliminate corpse loss, then the challenge and discretion imparted to its prospect is also null and void. <br><br>Given that corpses must disappear for multiple technical reasons including framerate, and the fact that we cannot build a server to track an infinite number of corpses, we've engineered the possibility of a lost corpse and items as part of the game in the same fashion as done by other games in the genre. <br><br>As always, I would recommend that if a specific aspect of the game provides more risk that is palatable for you, you might not want to engage in that aspect. In other words, if a dungeon is basically unexplored and not populated with people that can help you, you might want to visit places that are safer.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042384.html"><b>Login Server Inaccurate</b></a><br>There's really no way for the client to determine whether it is down, or just busy and not responding in a given amount of time. Either case provides the same information back to the client, that being that the login server is unreachable. <br><br>Perhaps we should change the message so that it points people to the network status page in the event that the outage is planned.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/040807.html"><b>Howling Stones</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The reason for this is simple: THE QUEST FOR THE KEY IS TOO DIFFICULT!]</i> <br>I've asked the Live team to take a look at the rate at which Charasis keys are entering the world. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: last i heard if a rogue picks it group is transported in, and i believe it is the same with the key. otherwise as you say it wouldn't be worth it, the jade chokidai prod is generally camped for people who want to use it... its worth a decent ammount, and you have to use one to just get a key?]</i> <br><br>That teleporter being pickable was a mistake which is why we did those corpse recoveries for the few rogues who picked into the zone. <br><br>As for the keys, each key transports one person, so everyone in your group will need one. Also keep in mind the difficulty in doing a corpse recovery in a zone that has a keyed entrance. Make sure that you have some friends with their own keys as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042013.html"><b>Track Corpse Bug?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: While you are taking a look at the: <br><br>1) Spell Drops<br>2) Uber Guards (that see Invis.) <br><br>Please do us a favor and fix Track Corpse as it hasn't worked since the expansion came up! You cast this spell and it does absolutely nothing except put an icon on your screen. <br><br>Since you gave us the spell...please go about the process of testing it out and providing a fix for it.]</i> <br><br>I've forwarded this to the test team to check it out. Thanks for the info.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn again address the subject of melee players paying an NPC in a city for a bind on the Gameplay Board.  Here's part of the original post followed by Gordon's response on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042444.html">the thread</a>:<UL>That's Verat's customer service policy, it seems. You take what they offer, or get out. You do NOT want fries with that, but you DO want a chocolate milkshake. This is NOT Burger King, you have it our way or you don't get the damn thing.<br>This is from EQVault:<br><br>------------------<br><br>Poll Results & New Poll Question <br>[12 Comments] - Aurum @ 4:35 PM PDT <br>The results are in from last week's poll that asked if you thought melee classes should be able to pay an NPC for a bind in a city. The results are:<br><br>Yes: 76.6% - 3264 votes<br>No: 23.3% - 996 votes<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Add to this the vast number of threads posted on this board about melee binding, and if you go through them all, you will find similar percentages. About 70% of the posters are strongly in favor of it, becuase they are damn tired of trying to find a bind at off-peak times. About 10% are againt teh idea. The remaining 20% don't really care, but see nothing wrong with it.<br><br>So, this is an example of an issue that a fairly large percentage of players feel fairly strongly about, in general. There has been NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER of why having an NPC in the city that charges 20pp for a bind, or other similarly limited and expensive solutions to this problem, would be in any way negative. Here, in fact, is the latest response from Verant, and is typical of anything else they've previously said on the issue:<br><br>-----------------<br><br>I'm sorry guys, but the binding issue is absolutely a dead horse, which is why I'm not jumping in the threads to remind everyone about that more than once a month or so. <br><br>The game has been out for over a year. In that time, melee characters have survived and prospered, even though the binding arrangements haven't changed. Melee characters will continue to thrive without implementing something such as this that would drastically change the pace of the game, game balance, class interdependency, and the penalty for death. <br><br>Binding is an advantage of being a pure caster in the same fashion that the ability to dish out melee damage, wear protective armor, etc., is an advantage of being a melee player. My advice to you is to make friends with clerics, wizards, druids, and anyone else who can make your travel go quicker. <br><br>-Gordon<br><br>----------------<br><br>That's their response to the concerns of the players. No real reason is given, except to say that giving the melee classes the ability to bind themselves would change the game balance, with which most people would agree. He conveniently ignores the plethora of suggestions that do not involve giving the ability to melee classes and thus avoiding the balance problem. <br><br>This is a rant about Verant's attitudes towards it's customers. I am SICK and TIRED of being treated like a small retarded child by a company that I am paying for a service. It seems the vast majority of what Verant calls customer service amounts to either patting me on the head and telling me it'll all be okay, or snidely insulting my intelligence.<br><br><b><i>There are times where majority opinion does not necessarily point to something that is good for the game, and it is in these cases where, though the outcome might be a bit painful, we need to decide what is in the best interest of the game as a whole. I would imagine that we could get a similar number of people agreeing if the question was "Is your class underpowered?", or "Should it be easier to level and acquire good equipment?", or "Should new characters start out with some money?"<br><br>In this case, we believe that wide-scale melee binding, whether in the form of allowing an NPC to bind melee characters in city zones, or allowing casters to bind melee characters anywhere, would be bad for the game as a whole. It reduces class interdependency, the penalty for death, the incentive for people to protect the melee characters at all costs, and the incentive to avoid getting in over your head. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

You wouldn't know it in the latest Patch Message, but high level spells are again dropping.  Here's the word from Gordon Wrinn:<ul><i>I've no problem admitting that it was messed up, I just didn't want to announce in the patch message that the spell drops were adjusted until I had a chance to get in and test it out myself. <br><br>The spell drops were addressed in this patch. I still feel a bit uneasy about the frequency of those drops, but we'll wait to see what happens before taking further action. Just a reminder to everyone searching for spells, you'll want to be in dungeons, in Kunark, killing things that are generally over level 45 to get a chance of getting those spells.<br><br>-Gordon</I></ul>This was spotted on the Gameplay Board.

A new message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>May 16th, 10:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- Sounds have been updated for NPCs in Kunark.  Your Iksar should no longer sound like humans.<br>- Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane will no longer be natively KOS to the outpost in the Overthere.  Take care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.<br>- Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear.  Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. <br>- Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have been addressed.  Some guards that should not have been buffed have been fixed.  In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible.  The level of those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them.<br>- Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of completion and reward.<br><br>*Item Updates*<br><br>- Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout.<br>- Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back.  It was showing as a 2H sword when equipped.<br>- The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact.  This has been corrected.<br>- Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor.  It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots.<br>- The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be worn to activate its effect.<br>- Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon. <br>- The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.<br>- The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.<br>- The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small sack, now looks as intended.<br>- Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon.  The "Lull" effect has been replaced with an appropriate effect.<br>- The Pouch of Mistletoe Powder will now impart its effect on the targeted character.<br>- Mosquito Wings are available in game once again.<br>- Many items had incorrect usage restrictions, and have been repaired.<br><br>As always, we strive to avoid making negative changes to items that already exist in game.  However, there are cases where a particularly unbalancing error has been made, such as with the Scourgetail Whip mentioned above, where the item in question must be fixed in interest of maintaining game balance.  <br><br>We will continue to repair problems, add content, and enhance gameplay in both Kunark and EQ proper. We appreciate everyone's support.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>The EverQuest Team</UL>

Jubal sent me the following information:<BLOCKQUOTE>The decision of the next Regent of Neriak has been made at the Collective of Old Fennin. The votes have been tallied and it was a very close vote. I tried to keep the polls open as long as possible just because it could have gone to any candidate. A hearty thanks go to all of the nominees. However, there can only be one. Congratulations go to Prince Regent Darmendrax Thex, the first Regent of Neriak. <br> <br>From Darmendrax-<UL><i><br>I would hope that many people who walk these halls recognises my name, and knows me as a Teir'Dal of character and integrity. Any others might wish to answer to me as to why not. <br>It is my intention to take the helm of our new government, to stand at the head of our proud peoples to repel the tides of the pales of Norrath, and take the fight to their very gates. And I am willing to prove my battling talents against my rival would-be leaders, Zaknifien, Lethoric and Zhantric. <br><br>I would consider myself articulate and intelligent, qualities that one would only expect from a Teir'Dal prince. I know diplomacy when it is necessary, and when the only answer is a bag of platinum in the hands of a trusted assassin. I have allies all over the world, contacts and servants as well. I look at the human, troll and ogre citizens of Neriak, and acknowledge their interests beside that of the Teir'Dal. <br><br>Our Lord Innoruuk watches over me, and as a Knight of his most blessed darkness, I wield his magicks ... deadly as my sword, possessed with his spiteful strength. My black heart pulses with a passion for rage, rancor and revenge. Baptized in his burning gaze at birth, his favour follows me like a dark shroud across the lands I travel. <br><br>Additionally, I have been a long standing officer in my guild, House DeVir, and possess all of the experience and responsibility that entails. I am always prepared to speak to or aid my brothers and sisters, no matter age or station. And my family name, my very blood, was destined to watch over our fair lands from the dawn of time to the grim and bloody sunset of this world. <br><br>The law is known to me, and while I shall always treasure the advice of those behind me, my council of advocates, when an iron fist is called for I shall not be found wanting. We are not a people of charity, pity and mercy. Nor are we given to the pleasantries of the light races. But our politics cannot be insular, lest we turn to in-fighting and chaos to the benefit of our foes. Methinks I shall ensure we do not follow this path. And who would be a finer princess than the lovely, malicious Lady Mordwyn? Neriak needs a ruler not only strong and blessed of the Father, but wise and canny in the ways of Norrath too. <br><br>I am ready for my task. <br><br>Darmendrax Thex</i></UL>Collective of Old Fennin<br><a href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro">http://www.sok.org/fenninro</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Swordsmen charged and feinted, <br>                                           withering away the lines of their opponents. <br><br>                                           The commander could not help smiling. <br><br>                                           A drow scout, badly wounded, climbed up the <br>                                           stairs of the tower, dagger drawn so as to <br>                                           discourage the guards who had other <br>                                           intentions for him. <br><br>                                           Blue fire lept out of the walls of the castle, <br>                                           killing many archers. They had mages on their <br>                                           side! Another ball of the blue death went <br>                                           hurling through the air, crashing into the <br>                                           charging swordsmen. Realizing the new <br>                                           threat, the warriors regrouped and charged at <br>                                           the casters, letting loose primal cries to their <br>                                           gods which turned to screams of agony as <br>                                           they were engulfed in Wizard Fire. <br><br>                                           Suddenly, a new presence appeared on the <br>                                           field of battle. The Iksar had formed an army <br>                                           as well, and were beginning to attack both <br>                                           sides! Shadowy figures leaped up behind the <br>                                           casters, and with punches and kicks as fast <br>                                           as lightning, dispatched them! Having <br>                                           defeated the greatest threat, the lizards <br>                                           turned to their next target; the castle. <br><br>                                           The scout staggered onto the watch tower <br>                                           and rasped, 'Captain... the Iksar... They... <br>                                           surrounded...', and exhaled the breath of life. <br>                                           The captain, with a curse under his breath, <br>                                           picked up his two handed axe and started <br>                                           down the stairs to dance with death. <br><br>                                           ---------------------------- <br><br>                                           What: WAR! <br><br>                                           When: June 3rd, 10:00 AM Mountain Time to <br>                                           6:00 PM Mountain Time <br><br>                                           Who: Kimson, commander of the West <br>                                           Antonican Forces; Commander of the East <br>                                           Antonican forces yet to be named...

Gordon talked a bit about the policy to not recover corpses in certain situations on the Gameplay Board recently.  Here's the thread:<UL>I cant understand this policy at all. Its a freaking game, how is it fun to have your corpse rot and lose tons of effort and time. <br>I realize that there has to be a risk to trying high level zones, but losing everything on a body that is right at a zone line is plain ridiculous. At least no drops item should be able to be retrieved once the 24 hour online/7day offline period has expired. And with some of the new zones which require quest keys to get into, i think the 24 hour online timer needs to be looked at again and maybe extended.<br><br>Verants policy to not recover bodies, even bodies that arnt deep in zones, doesnt make sense when a customer is paying to have a good time. As i said before, yes i know there has to be a risk, but losing every item is a bit extreme and i really believe needs to be rethought due to the difficulty of some of the expansion zones.<br><br>As of tomorrow, 5 fully clothed bodies will begin rotting on my server, and thats after many naked attempts to clear just the zone line without adding more bodies. The quest for the key for this particular zone is so time consuming because of the %spawns on the quest items, that the ppl with bodies dont have time to get more than maybe 2 keys for CR attempts. If having friends get keys for them, they could have more tries, but its a amazingly boring quest killing greens and its hard to get people, even friends, to get the items for you to save your online time. They have talked to the server gm, and basically been told tough luck, your gonna lose your body then. Thats just awesome customer service in my opinion, and the attitudes of many of verants represenatives is sickening.<br><br>I feel sorry for anyone who has put in so much time and effort into there character, not to mention cash, to lose there inventories. This policy needs to be looked at, because in this case, the ppl with rotting bodies have tried like hell to get them back, with the help of many otheres and failed. At least no drop items should be able to be recovered, or the body rot times extended.<br><br>Rokbytr<br>50 Paladin <br><br><b><i>I feel for those who have been unable to retrieve their corpses, however the risk is designed to be part of the game. We want people to have to go back and get their corpses after they die, and if the risk of corpse loss did not exist, a good part of the incentive to not get in over your head would be gone. <br><br>Yes, corpse loss is not fun. But it is a possible outcome of playing that provides risk and excitement to going into a particular area.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>What's your take on this issue?  <br><br>Please feel free to post your comments and opinions about it on a specially created <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5642261">Discussion Board Thread</a> on the General Board, or by leaving a comment.

I spotted the following post on the Gameplay Board that Verant's Gordon Wrinn made:<UL>First of all, Gharn (our GM) will not remove the name off a person who has left our guild and is deliberately giving us a bad name.<br><br><b><i>The naming policy does not provide for forceful removal of a name from a person based upon them no longer being in the guild. If the character requests it, and a GM or Senior Guide has the time available, they'll help out. However, guilds cannot "own" names, and thus the name would not be taken from someone against their will unless it violated the naming policy.</b></i><br><br>Second, he has decided there are 'enough' people with our last name, and will not give it to any more people.<br><br><b><i>I can't comment on this since I don't know the specifics, but all optional changes are at the discretion of the person making the change. Assuming that they have the time, and that they are asked nicely, I imagine they'd be happy to help out.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
