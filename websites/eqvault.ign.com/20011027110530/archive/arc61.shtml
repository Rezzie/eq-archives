A new report was sent in by Slorny:<BLOCKQUOTE>This past Saturday night, Sir Lucan Dlere was slain on Erollisi Marr. Slorny <br>Lightfist gathered a group of Paladins, guildmates and friends at the <br>abandoned tent in the north side of west freeport. Our first attempt was met <br>with failure as a horde of guards came to his aid. However, we regrouped and <br>isolated the evil Lucan and struck him and Brother Jentry down with <br>righetous wrath. After the battle was over, the Paladins of Marr and Tunare <br>stood victorious, with Slorny possesing Sir Lucan's Testament of Truth, <br>proclaiming a holy vicotry over the corrupt freeport militia.<br><br>OOC: Saturday night, Psychic Venom and a group of assorted friends and <br>paladins gathered to take out Sir Lucan Dlere for the Soulfire quest. It was <br>a hell of a fight, and I'd like to thank everyone for helping out with such <br>a great victory!<br><br>Proudly KOS in freeport,<br>Slorny Lightfist, Paladin of Tunare, slayer of evil and drinker of stout.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

There's a few posts to report today that Gordon Wrinn made recently, and for a nice Sunday change all of them are light hearted.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014721.html">post #1</a>:<UL>This taken from MSNBC:<br>"Gordon was moving at 60 mph and was expected to become a hurricane sometime Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said."<br><br>Gordon, are you leaving Verant to create large waves and intense winds in the Gulf of Mexico?<br><br><b><i>Rofl :)<br><br>-Gordon<br>-A mere storm at the moment...</b></i></UL>Here <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014642.html">post #2</a>:<UL>One day little red riding hood was going through the woods and stumbled upon a small bag on the path. Once she picked it up she realized it was really a rat ear. "EWWWWWWW" she said as she threw the disgusting article away and it magically became a small bag again. So she walked a little further along the path and a HUGE!!! guy with blue paint all over his body was on it. So she said "Hi I"m little red riding hood" Well he said "OK OK I'LL GIVE YOU SOW JUST STOP ANNOYING ME!!!" and so he cast SoW on little red riding hood. So along red goes down the path and passes through the agro radius of a Shadow Wolf. Since she is running so fast it doesn't catch up to her until she reaches her grandma's house. She tries opening the door, but can't. Then she taps on the door and it opens for her! So in she goes and she sees three people: Mira Sayer, Nilipus, and her grandmother. <br><br>Mira and Nilipus leave after Red enters. So Red riding hood gives her grandmother the basket, and then her grandmother says "Thank you very much dear, here is a little something for bringing me [dencher cleaner]. <br>You receive 1 silver 4 copper.<br>Your faction with OldPeople has gone up<br>Your faction with Mayong Mystmoore has gone up<br>Your faction with Nagafen has gone down<br>Your faction with Bixies has gone down<br>You gain experience!<br><br>Then out of the wall runs in the shadow wolf and bites red for 5 points of damage. She screams for help but to no avail until a newbie hunter walks by and enters the house. With an agile thrust he slays the shadow wolf. Then he says "d4mn, n0 ph4t l3w7" and then he looks at red and says "give me mny plz". Red give him the silver and copper she got from her grandma and the newbie says "You sux0r, and U r st00p1d."<br><br>Fifteen minutes later red receives a tell from Etermelody saying her name is against the naming policy as it is based on a popular novel so then she receives a name above her head which says "Limmle Reda Ridon Herld".<br><br>The End<br><br><b><i>I'm sorry, but the Crimson Hooded Cloak of the Equestrian is severely overpowered and as such will no longer drop. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014359.html">post #3</a>:<UL>When he plays, I'm sure he doesn't play his character named Abashi.

Gordon was up late again making the following posts to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014636.html"><b>Trade Skill Speciailization</b></a><br>There's been a number of requests along these lines. I'll bring the issue up at the Tuning Meeting Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014638.html"><b>The Delayed Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Im fine with it. But the problem is that i have an error / crashing problem that this patch fixes. why cant i get the appropriate files for that, or why cant the be released befroe the full patch?]</i></font> <br><br>Because other changes to the files for that require underlying changes in other parts of the patch. The client is also tied to the version of code running on the server in most cases. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive spent hours on test server w/ no crashes, but on Torv it crashes in 10 minutes or less every time i log. The solution is out there, and i just need to get my hands on it, how is this usually handled?]</i></font> <br><br>I really apologize for the delay.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014639.html"><b>More Illusions</b></a><br>Unfortunatley "Illusion: Animation" wouldn't work, as the race of an animation is one that we call the "Invisible man". The only reason that the sword and shield show up on the animation is because he's actually got them equipped. <br><br>An enchanter wouldn't have those items equipped, so wouldn't show up. :(<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014614.html"><b>Splits</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is there any way that when you lock a thread due to size you start another on the same subject, have seen it done on a few boards, maybe this one too and Im just blind]</i></font> <br><br>We used to do that, however it seemed to turn the thread into a contest to get it to split. I think we had one thread up to about 12 splits before we decided to stop splitting them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014621.html"><b>Direct3D Mip Mapping</b></a><br>We have a plan for the MipMap issues, as well as others present with some of the more advanced features and performance found in new games. It involves upgrading the level of DirectX that the client uses. This would require that everyone update their DirectX drivers to the most recent version. <br><br>We'll have more information to post about this next week. We plan to give a couple of weeks lead-time before making such a big change, so the updates won't be in Tuesday's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014625.html"><b>Credit Card Safety</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I can't seem to communicate to my mom that giving out one's credit card number to Everquest is a reasonably safe procedure. She believes that under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone give that out. Naturally, this prevents me from trying out my brand spanking new game. Could anybody out there tell me where to go to inform her better about this, or at least give some information coming from an experienced user?]</i></font> <br><br>This is actually one of the things that keeps internet commerce from growing faster than it is, and is mostly due to misconceptions spawned by the entertainment industry (movies, television). Our interface uses a secure encrypted protocol to ensure that the data remains safe. <br><br>In my opinion, purchasing services on the internet from reputable companies is far more secure than handing your card to the waiter at the local restaurant. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014551-3.html"><b>Board Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon or UBBAdmin can something be done about Snoota and his "group"? ]</i></font><br><br>I really don't think that there's anything wrong with a little levity to take the edge off. If it begins to cause problems with communications on the board, we'll ask them to reign it in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014584.html"><b>10 Things I Love & Hate</b></a><br>That's interesting. Personally, as I was reading the "hate" list I was thinking that those are some of the best things in life :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014536.html"><b>Turning EXP Off</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There was some talk in the past about a option to turn of XP gain. Well I was wondering if this ever could happen. I know that one of the best times me and my girlfriend have in the game is when our characters are the same level but sometimes you just have things that happens where you get a level or so ahead of the other. I think this would be a good time to bring it back up with the response to Abshi's poll on how many families play the game together. ]</i></font><br><br>I mentioned this to the team a while back in an email, but we had a few things going on at the time that were monopolizing the time of the developers. I'll bring it up again in the Tuning meeting Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014519.html"><b>No Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Make all the items NO DROP. If you want something then earn it.]</i></font><br><br>This is actually covered in the FAQ: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014508.html"><b>A Complaint</b></a><br>It's possible that they may be using the wrong animation, but that should be controlled by the type of skill that it uses. Perhaps it's a dwarf thing. Do you know if gnomes have a similar problem? I'm just looking for as much information as possible before taking it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014488.html"><b>Abuse and Harassment</b></a><br>The policies regarding name changes, and the fact that they usually aren't done except in cases of a violation of the policy, is to keep people from using namechanges to escape their bad reputation. I realize in this case you want a name change to escape someone ELSES bad reputation, however the GMs have no way to know whether or not that really is the case. As you might imagine, people with bad reputations really aren't all that straightforward about their situations when talking to GMs. That other person with the similar name could very well be asking the GM for a name change because of you. <br><br>If we do this name change we open ourselves to doing all sorts of them on the basis of the name being similar to someone elses. As we cannot maintain our plan of having reputation as a factor if this happens, the current policy is the only fair one. <br><br>My best suggestion is for you to work on building th reputation of your name and explain that you aren't the person with the bad reputation. This should be pretty easy, especially when that person is online. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014498.html"><b>Abashi and Lum</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My personal choice is #2. I've grown tired of seeing the same old retoric in response to issues. I've grown tired of seeing well thought out posts with logical, proven empirical data in them get seemingly blown off.]</i></font> <br><br>Hi Brent, welcome back to the boards. <br><br>I frequently give complete explanations to the issues, for at least the first few times that they come up. The FAQ is a good example of those complete explanations. However, once all of those explanations are stated, and more information is requested over and over, we wind up at a pure and simple "No, it's not up for debate, and we won't do it." Now I don't think that I've ever used those words, and I usually try to add some padding, but I try to be as straight forward as possible in these instances. <br><br>There are other cases where it's impossible to come up with a quantifiable explanation of the way things are. This is espicially true when the reason behind something is that it just wasn't what we had in mind. This lead of course to the "Not in the vision" parodies. I even tried to put something in the FAQ concerning these issues, but they still come up, leading me back to a simple "No." <br><br>The reason why clerics don't get SOW, rangers don't get see-invis, shamans don't get clarity, and magicians don't get summon corpse are basically all the same: It wasn't what we had in mind for those classes. There's no way to quantify this with a formula. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Besides, most of the game is not up for debate. What Verant does is they take user input and feedback, but then use their own judgement. If they think something is underpowered, then they will change it. Likewise if they think something is overpowered. It's a small, but important distinction; and it gets blurred quite frequently.]</i></font> <br><br>Very true and well said. We have to be the ultimate arbitrators of what should, shouldn't, will, and will never be. If we don't take up that role, the game will lose focus and sooner or later become something that people do not want to play. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014506.html"><b>"Please remove warning spam from Song of Travel "</b></a><br>Good point.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
The latest Discussion of the Week has come to an end.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014611.html">the final thoughts from Bill Coyle</a>, one of Verant's Game Designers:<UL><I>First off I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who participated in this discussion. As I read through all the posts I was very pleased to see that most of the ideas, requests, and suggestions you all have here mirror my own ideas as a game designer. I thought I&#8217;d take this opportunity to address some of the key topics and concerns brought up and give you all my perspective on them.<br><br><b>On Announcing Quests to the Public</b><br><br>While we&#8217;d ideally like to have everyone involved in our dynamic quests, the reality of limitations such as internet latency, zone overcrowding, and sheer lack of manpower make this difficult to do. If you announce that a huge quest is going to happen in Qeynos Hills for example, chances are that everyone who can get there will. With a limit on the number of GMs and Guides who can facilitate the quest, this can make it almost impossible to run. And although we&#8217;ve increased our functionality to facilitate these quests by a lot, we&#8217;re still not at the point where we can have a large scale quest involving an entire player base of 2000+ people at once. Until that time dynamic quests are always going to have the luck factor of being in the right place at the right time.<br><br><b>On Rewarding Role-playing</b><br><br>I am a firm believer in the principle that for most dynamic quests the rewards to be reaped should go to those who role-played the quest best and made the biggest mark in the story line of it. The biggest problem with rewarding role-playing is that it is a completely subjective thing. What one person views as good role-playing another sees as acting like a fool. The other inherent problem with this is that we can&#8217;t watch everyone at once. You may be doing the best job in rallying the troops to defend Rivervale against the invading goblin army, but if no one facilitating the quest sees you do it they can&#8217;t reward you for it. We have a limited number of people who run these quests, and while we often do have a bunch of invisible people running around, we don&#8217;t see everything. At the end of such quests all the guides and gm&#8217;s who participated will usually talk about all the people they thought were doing a good job and vote on who to give the treasure to. If you can think of a fairer way to accomplish these I&#8217;d love to hear the suggestions. <br><br><b>On Being the &#8220;Hero&#8221;</b><br><br>Let&#8217;s face it, everyone in any fantasy role-playing game wants to be the hero, central figure in which the world revolves around. This is perhaps the greatest challenge for a massively multiplayer game to meet. Rather than just saying this is impossible I choose to look at it from a different perspective. It is my belief that everyone can be a hero in his or her own mind and in the minds of those around them. The 12th level warrior who makes a stand to hold off the gnolls while his party escapes is indeed a hero to that particular group. The 50th level cleric who travels the world resurrecting and healing those in need could be considered a hero on the server in which he does this. The point I&#8217;m getting at is that you, the player base, decide who your heroes are based on the way they act and the things they do. We provide the content, the background, and the stage. But you all are the real dynamic actors, the heroes of our world.<br><br><b>On GM Slaughter Sprees</b><br><br>We&#8217;ve all heard the tales and some of us have even been a victim. &#8220;I was sitting there camping something when all of the sudden a Red mob came running at me and killed me before I had a chance to think. Then I found out it was part of some GM quest&#8230;I have become a victim of a vicious GM out to get players.&#8221; This is a common tale told on message boards and in taverns and I&#8217;m not going to say it doesn&#8217;t happen that way. What I do want to know is what is the difference between that and a rare spawn popping in the zone and killing you? I remember one of the first times I was hunting in Oasis with my level 15 cleric and got a visit from Lockjaw. He was bigger, meaner, and scarier than anything I expected to run into there&#8230;and I didn&#8217;t stand a chance. There are encounters like this throughout all of Norrath; it&#8217;s that extra rare danger that makes things a little more dynamic and exciting. When a GM or Guide assumes the role of an actor in a quest they have a responsibility to portray that character properly. And if that character happens to be a bloodthirsty monster or a vicious dark elf, then you would expect them to kill people. Most quests have a certain level range in mind that goes along with the back-story of a quest. One of the biggest complaints I&#8217;ve seen is that quests often use npc&#8217;s that are a much higher level range than the players who typically frequent the zone the quest takes place in. The biggest reason that this happens is that it fits in best with the story. Dark Elves wishing to invade Qeynos for example would probably send some pretty tough troops in to throw at the city, and the fact that many newbies hang out around cities is none of their concern, invading Qeynos is. My advice to those of you that suddenly find yourself in a situation like this is to hide behind something and call for reinforcements. Whether you like it or not you are now part of a dynamic quest, you&#8217;re the victim of the story that people need to save =).<br><br><b>On Dynamic Quest Etiquette</b><br><br>Another big concern of most people, myself included, are the antisocial players who just try to ruin a quest for others. These are the people that run up to the dynamic Npc&#8217;s and shout, &#8220;Stop messing around you stupid GM&#8221; or &#8220;Gimme ur Ph@t L3wtz!&#8221; It should be noted that these people would promptly be ignored or worse by most dynamic quest npcs. In the type of quests requiring more interaction and role-playing, these people aren&#8217;t going to get anywhere and if they become too disruptive we are committed to removing them from the quest entirely. Recent additions to our functionality now give us new powers to more strongly control situations like this. One of the best new features we&#8217;ve added recently is the ability to set a maximum player level range that can still hurt the mob. This will allow us to create a lot more lower level quests without the concern of higher level players &#8220;stealing the quest&#8221; from those it was designed for. Just remember, if you want to participate in a dynamic quest portray your character and leave the ooc comments out of it, you&#8217;ll find that the npcs will interact with you a lot more and you&#8217;ll learn more of the story going on. And please, if you don&#8217;t want to participate in a role-playing type of quest, just leave the zone and let those who do have it. But whether you&#8217;re role-playing or not, don&#8217;t be surprised or angry at your swift death if you attack a npc for no reason, they will retaliate just as you would in their position.<br><br>In conclusion I&#8217;m happy to see that many of things I saw suggested in this discussion are actually in the works right now. We have a dedicated team of Quest Masters who are working day and night on just this sort of thing. As our functionality increases, so will the frequency and quality of our quests. There will always be many varying kinds, from pure combat ones like a rabid wolf in Qeynos Hills to pure role-playing ones involving only npc interaction and figuring out some kind of puzzle. We are committed to conveying more of the history and story of Norrath to you all, so you can better understand the world in which you&#8217;re character lives. I think everyone will be pleased with some of the new dynamic content coming out, and even more importantly nearly everyone will get a chance to participate. <br><br><br>Bill Coyle<br>Game Designer, EQLive</I></UL>Here's a follow-up:<UL>I think the biggest complaint I have seen about GM events is that single players, playing in a particular zone getting killed, then the high level players swarming the zone to kill the MOBs(GM controlled) and the high levels getting rezes and rewards and the bystanders that got killed get nothing."<br><br><b><i>This has been a longstanding problem in dynamic quests that we recently got the solution for. Now that level 50 players can no longer do hurt a level 30 npc in a dynamic quest designed for level 30's this shouldn't continue to be a problem. It should also be noted that with the exception of pure combat quests, the reward for the quest is not necessarily given to the people who kill the end monster, but rather the people who were involved in the quest the most. This kind of system should also solve the problem of people stepping in at the end of a quest and getting the reward.<br><br>PS: Thanks for the welcome :)</b></i></UL>Thanks Gordon!

More posts were made this evening by Gordon Wrinn of Verant Interactive:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010896.html"><b>Server Location</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why aren't there east coast/west coast servers?<br><br>I live on the west coast, and on almost every weeknight raids of thigns like the planes begin around 3 or 4 PST, when the east coasters can play and I'm at work.]</i></font> <br><br>Our servers are all in basically the same location geographically (which doesn't necessarily translate to the same location from an internet standpoint). I assume that you are asking that some be labeled as East Coast/West Coast/Overseas etc. While I definitely see your point, people playing at different times will probably always be an issue. Since the servers are in the same place, and there'd be no real advantage to choosing a server based upon the label, I imagine that people would whatever is the least-populated server regardless of location.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014375.html"><b>Kunarkrefund@verant.com Inactive?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Since I didn't get a reply to my emails directed to kunarkrefund@verant.com and accounts@station.sony.com : where should I direct my email if I still got an unresolved issue concerning a double billing for one copy of RoK?]</i></font> <br><br>If your issue is still active, I'd contact gscotto@station.sony.com directly. I sincerely apologize for the problems resolving your issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014395.html"><b>EQ Chat</b></a><br>It depends on what IRC Network you are on. The big international ones are probably listed in your IRC client (such as Efnet). Some of the EQ-related news sites also run their own IRC servers, but you'll have to go to those sites to get their address. <br><br>Also, EQ channels are not necessarily specifically labeled as such. I know of many guilds who operate their own channels who don't throw "EQ" into the description.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014398.html"><b>Warriors in Cloak</b></a><br>Well the issue right now is the number of meshes that we have available. Robes were only allocated to those races who could be casters to limit the number of different graphics that could be displayed at any one time in order to adhere to the system requirements. <br><br>We do have some new ideas going forward and you'll see a lot more interesting things on the characters. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014465.html"><b>Responsibility</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But sometimes they make mistakes. Sometimes thay make big ones. And when big mistakes are made, it is my firm belief that it is a customer's responsibility -- even duty -- to bring it to the attention of someone who may be able to rectify it.]</i></font> <br><br>I definitely agree with this statement. The players are the ones receiving the support, so should be involved in the process. <br><br>However, from your story, I really don't see anything being done wrong. These cases are often subjective and we have to trust the judgement of each GM involved. It sounds like the GMs bent over backwards to spend the hours you mention rectifying the situation. The actions and decision of the first GM were appropriate given the circumstances, and the second was most likely a lead who decided that it was taking too long to render good support in this case and stepped in. </UL>

Brad talked more about the loot issue in a recent response posted to the one and only Gameplay Board.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012977.html">original post followed by Brad's response</a>:<UL>I've posted on this topic several times here - never a response from Verant.<br><br>Why make VP no drop ?<br>What good are trade skills if you take away the ability to buy, trade for things, then trade for better things ? Is pp just for mundane items ?<br><br><b><I>In general, I really don't like no-drop items (unless they're quest components). As most of you know, I'm a huge proponent of player driven economies, player run bazaars and market places, etc. <br><br>No-drop basically removes an item from the economy.<br>All that said, though, there are places and encounters in the game where the rewards are so special that we want only those who participated to wield/wear the rewards.<br><br>I'm not totally happy with that, but at this point it's the lesser of evils. This all, of course, relates to the twinking issue as well, which also has great arguments for and against.<br><br>-Brad</I></b></UL>

Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013808-4.html">posted an in-depth response</a> to the "Lum Vs. Abashi" thread on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Very interesting thread.<br><br>I've debated myself for some time as to what good these boards do... Changing the boards to active accounts only with poster accountability was and is an attempt to make them constructive and both a benefit to Verant and our customers.<br><br>So many positive game changes have occurred because of these boards. Also, because of the official posts here appearing on boards everywhere, I really think it's a fairly efficient way to get the word out on issues.<br><br>But, then, there's the negativity. The posts that we should replace people, or that we never listen, or that our PR and CS is horrible, all on a board that we've put up and maintain. The generalizations are ludicrous (were it all true, of course, then there wouldn't be a board, nor an internet relations manager, and you wouldn't see many, many changes that originated from our customers implemented), but it's there. Does it hurt the game? Does it hurt Verant?<br><br>I don't know. It's hard to measure.<br><br>We do know that the vast majority of players don't read the boards themselves. Significantly more read the headlines summarized elsewhere, but even all the people who read all the fan sites related to EQ don't total to that many relative to our subscription base. But then, most of the people who do post play the game a LOT, know it very well, and have excellent insight.<br><br>We also know that the game continues to sell extremely well, that relatively VERY few people are leaving. The interactions with people in game, the emails and other feedback we get, is generally very positive.<br><br>So, I don't know. I do know that if I felt they were doing more harm then good, I'd shut them down. But it's pretty hard to do an empirical analysis given how many variables are involved as well as many subjective aspects.<br><br>In my opinion, overall, Abashi does a good job. Sometimes he doesn't handle a situation optimally, and well, neither do I. We're human, after all. But his general policy has been to be blunt and to the point and to try NOT to spin things. It's confusing sometimes, reading the criticisms, because I see people claiming he's spinning issues, but then I see other complaints that he's not taking the side of the player and being 'positive'.<br><br>Which is best? Blunt, no B.S., tell it like it is, objective posting? Or I'm your friend, I'll represent your side to those developer guys and seem all disappointed if they don't agree with you?<br><br>If you prefer the latter, then your dissatisfaction is probably my fault, because I prefer the former and I'm the guy who worked with Abashi in terms of how and what we wanted posted early on. I don't care for politicians, and people who pretend, and people who spin things because I guess I generally see through it. <br><br>Anyway, we'll continue to listen. We'll continue to post and to communicate. We'll continue to take good ideas and implement them if possible. And we'll continue to do our best to correct aspects of the game that could be improved.<br><br>I think, overall, that the game is better because of the boards despite the negativity and unrealistic expectations that continue to appear. The genre is relatively new, as are forums where developers are so accessible. And, as I've posted before, there aren't many MMORPGs so there's less choice. While I disagree with the assertions that we have a monopoly, I do think that there will be less complaining in the future due to more choice as well as the fact that the player base as a whole will mature in the sense that they'll understand more what is doable and what makes a great game. <br><br>Until then, though, we have the responsibility to improve EQ while simultaneously keeping it true to what it is at its core. And we'll also keep the boards up and keep listening. But we WILL control the signal to noise ratio. If anything, we'll become more strict. Negative, pointless, flaming drives away players with constructive criticism (negative and positive) - of that I am certain. And yeah, it also makes the game and the game's community look bad.<br><br>So, in closing, I'd really recommend that those of you who are upset with aspects of the game and would like to see change to keep things constructive. If you don't, honestly, you become self-defeating, because were the board to degenerate into purely flames and insults we'd shut it down, eliminating a fantastic avenue for you to affect the very change you want. Really, you risk losing your account AND losing these forums, and, knowing that you're all paying customers who care deeply about the game, I really don't think you want either. <br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon shared some information regarding account warnings and bannings in a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014247.html">recent announcement posted to the Gameplay Board</a>.  Here is post #1 in this thread:<br><UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>There have been a number of requests here on the boards asking what warnings, suspensions, and bannings mean when applied to player accounts based upon actions taken in game or on these boards. <br><br>Warning - A warning is issued when we can give the customer the "benefit of the doubt". It's the assumption that they may not know what they are doing is inappropriate. It's very possible that warnings could be issued for borderline cases, and it really has no affect upon the account by itself. However, a pattern of someone not knowing that what they are doing is inappropriate leads to us no longer being able to give them the benefit of the doubt. This can very well lead to suspension or banning. <br><br>Suspension - Suspensions are temporary in nature. They typically last 7-10 business days, and customers are not allowed to access the EverQuest servers or message boards (for posting) during this time. They are appropriate when there has been a pattern of inappropriate conduct as indicated by warnings, or when there isn't question that conduct was inappropriate. A suspension means that while we still want your business, we want you to know that your conduct isn't appropriate. <br><br>Suspensions are also the first step taken when account-ownership is contested by someone with a bona fide claim. <br><br>Banning - Banishment is permanent removal from the game, and possibly future products as well (to be decided at a future date). It means that though we appreciate your past patronage, it is not in our best interest to continue the business relationship. Bannings are appropriate when the intensity of a willful act causes us to reach this determination. Bannings are also appropriate when there is past problems such as warnings or suspension. <br><br>Bannings are also appropriate for things such as confirmed EULA violations, attempts to defraud a GM/CS Rep, or other such problems. <br><br>Warnings are typically not contestable beyond the person who issued it. At most, the Server GM, at their option, may consider the issue. <br><br>Those who have been suspended or banned can contact <a href="mailto:EQAccountStatus@verant.com">EQAccountStatus@verant.com</a>, which is an email address reserved solely for communication with those customers, and is serviced by dedicated staff. Normal emails from people who have not been suspended or banned will not receive a response from this email address, and should forward their issue to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's post #2:<UL>If you get a certain number of warnings will that then give you a suspension? <br><br><b><i>Yes, based of course on a judgement call of the person making that decision. That judgement call is basically: "Are these issues honest mistakes?" and "Does this customer still deserve the benefit of the doubt?". Someone getting warned repeatedly for the same thing is not likely to get the benefit of the doubt for long. <br><br>It's also important to mention that warnings are not a prerequisite for suspension, nor is suspension a prerequisite for a banning. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's post #3:<UL>you will only loose the account that has the infractions against it.... <br><br><b><i>There are exceptions to this. For instance, a few months ago someone made a bomb threat, causing us to ban two accounts that were at the same address and on the same credit card.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></uL>Here's post #4:<UL>According to Abashi's definition of a warning, logic dictates that players are always made aware of when they are given a warning, since:<br>" It's the assumption that they may not know what they are doing is inappropriate." <br><br><b><I>Yes, but this is another issue that has exceptions. <br><br>If a person flees from the GM/Guide, logs out, goes LD and doesn't come back, in an attempt to avoid the warning (you'd be surprised how often that this happens), it is still applied. However a note is made that for some reason a warning couldn't be issued. <br><br>Regarding these boards, Akriss sends email to the email address on the station account, on the game account, or both (if they are different). If none of those email addresses are valid, the warning is still applied. Everyone needs to keep their email addresses updated in both places. <br><br>You can go into the Account/Change Account section of the login server to change the email address on your game account. You'll need to go to <a href="http://www.station.sony.com">http://www.station.sony.com</a> to change the one on your station account. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Once again, here's the latest quotes and excerpts made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014191.html"><b>Changing the Text Color of AFK Messages</b></a><br>An excellent example of a customer idea found here that's going to be implemented very soon :) <i>(Note from Aurum: The last quote was actually Brad, the following is Gordon's comment in this post)</i><br><br>In all fairness, we already had it coded before this message was posted, but it was suggested a few weeks ago :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014227.html"><b>Emotes Update</b></a><br>We've decided to remove @C from the features list due to the number of problems that go along with it dealing with /anon and roleplaying characters. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014104.html"><b>Make Invisibility Icon Blink</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The only indication that you are about to lose invisibility is a message stating that you feel yourself about to appear. This occurs less than 3 seconds beforehand. Other, less importants spells, have their icons blink for what seems like 15 seconds.]</i></font> <br><br>It will blink if it runs full course. However invisibility is designed to have a random duration, limited of course by a cap on the maximum. It is not supposed to be so reliable that you can avoid situations in which it wears off unexpectedly. The message that comes 5 seconds before it wears off unnaturally was a compromise in this case.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014101.html"><b>Zero Mana Cost Wizard Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I personally think it's a good idea, makes good RP sense in the fact that after casting it soooo many times it shouldn't drain your "magical energy" as much.]</i></font> <br><br>It already works this way on a percentage basis. If you have 2000 mana, a 100 mana spell is a much smaller percentage of your total mana. <br><br>But to address the first posters question, the spell system is build upon spells taking mana. The exception to these are items with activatable effects, and the tradeoff in this case is a long casting time. Were we to implement things as you suggest, the casting time would have to be pretty long. We're left with the fact that you probably wouldn't have that spell memorized at the time you are jumped by a level 15 critter. Even a level 60 wizard can't memorize a spell when being attacked by a level 15 critter.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014054.html"><b>Random Loot</b></a><br>I think that you must have encountered an incredible coincidence. All loot on a creature is determined at the time that the creature spawns. No loot is determined or modified at loot-time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014058.html"><b>Plans for Feign Death</b></a><br>We've no nerf planned for Feign Death tomorrow or in the foreseeable future. If that changes, we'll let you know, but all indications are that we'll let it be.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014038.html"><b>UI Improvement</b></a><br>That's a good thought. I'll forward it to Roy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014049.html"><b>Quick Board Question</b></a><br>To be honest with you Daemonn, this board has about 400-500 new threads daily, without about 10 times that many posts. As such, there are a LOT that I can't read. <br><br>I do however usually begin my day back on page 10 catching some of that was done in the off hours, however at around 11am, page 10 only goes back to about 6 or 7 am. I'm working off of page 7 today, which is where I found this post. By the time I'm done reading and responding to page 7 and hit refresh, several more pages have gone by.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014053.html"><b>Stopping Camping</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Most groups finally leave in frustration to find a more productive hunting spot as their exp bar stagnates.]</i></font><br> <br>That's an idea, of course I'd rather try to encourage people to go elsewhere rather than frustrating them until they do :)  Overall I agree with the intent of your suggestion if not its implementation exactly. <br><br>A common suggestion here on the boards is, "As more people enter a zone, more creatures shoudl spawn and more loot should be dropped". That suggestion is often labeled the "cure for camping". Unfortunately, increasing the supply due to increasing demand only encourages more demand. <br><br>In other words, if Oasis is crowded now with 80 people, imagine how crowded it would be if there was enough creatures to support however many people wanted to pile into the zone. As it is, we hope that someone walks into oasis, sees 80 people, says, "man, this is crowded", and goes someplace else.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014031.html"><b>"@" Bug Repaired Friay?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am wondering why they use the @ symbol at all, kinda annoying because sometimes I need to exchange emails, ohh well. And yes I know I can get around it, but it has caused a couple of miscommunincations, go ahead and flame me, it just kinda bugs me.]</i></font> <br><br>We're putting in an allowance for emails. @-codes should only expand when preceded by a space. So yes, you should be able to type your email address without a problem once we get that code patched.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014032.html"><b>Trade Skills Past 200</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My question is then are you changing any other trade skills other than blacksmithing? If not blacksmithing is the way to go, and I can't make any jewelry until I hit 201 in smithing. you see my point?]</i></font> <br><br>We're adding craftable items to most tradeskills tomorrow, with more updates to follow over the next few weeks. And yes, if you want to specialize in blacksmithing, you'll want to avoid making non-trivial jewelry until get Smithing to 201.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012715.html"><b>Mages and Root</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why Dont MAGES have ROOT?]</i></font> <br><br>Class-based systems rely on there being advantages and disadvantages for each class, meaning that some can do things that other classes can't, and vice versa. This is one of those things. <br><br><LI><a href=""><b></b></a>Why don't SK's have Ice Comet? <br>Why can't clerics cast sow?<br>The answer is, the same in all cases: "Because they don't". ]</i></font><br><br>Hehe, you kill me sometimes Brega :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014003.html"><b>Taunt</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are there any plans to raise the taunt skill of warriors, or any taunters for that matter?]</i></font> <br><br>Not plans to increase the skill, but possibly to increase its effectiveness at higher levels. Taunt purposely reduces in effectiveness on high level MOBs. At that time, all MOBs of that level were special encounters. Now that there is yard trash above 50th level, we've recognized the need to reevaluate this skill.</UL>

From Richardo:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night I released a new EQ song called "EQ Obsessed."  <br><br>It's a song about the harsh reality of being addicted to Everquest.  It will hit home with many people and hopefully give a few laughs.  In addition, I am planning to make a sequel to "When Beggars Attack" and to finish up the Evercrack song.  I'm also toying around with the idea of possibly starting a tradition of short voice acted EQ skits that portray humorous events that have happened in game.  <br><br>All the songs are still found at my site at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/richlove">http://www.mp3.com/richlove</a>  <br><br>Have a good night!<br><br>-Richie Truxillo aka Richardo Xavier<br><a href="http://www.mp3.com/richlove">http://www.mp3.com/richlove</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The posting machine codenamed Abashi was at it again this afternoon.  Here's the latest from the official forums:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014014.html"><b>"Take Away Mend from Monks"</b></a><br>You're asking for changes that would lead to there being no reason to play a warrior. Why would people want warriors if monks can tank just as well? They want monks because they do more damage than warriors even though they cannot fill the primary tank role very well. <br><br>You also have Feign Death, which is an excellent escape ability, and also allows you to lower yourself on the creatures hatelist mid-combat. Warriors do not get anything special to help them escape.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014006.html"><b>Pet Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It also seems like I can summon a pet with the 39 level spell that can be weaker (hits for less damage) than the best pet I could summon at 34 was capable of.]</i></font> <br><br>It is very possible that a pet summoned with a higher level spell can hit for less damage than a pet summoned with a lower level spell. Most often it would be the worst possible pet of the upper level spell compared to the best possible pet of the lower level spell. <br><br>Remember that max damage is not the only attribute that the pet has. Pets have skills just like player characters. Higher level summons will have better skills than lower level ones, regardless of the max damage. As an example, the worst 39th level pet may hit for less than the best 34th level pet, however the 39th level summon will have better skills and do more damage on average. <br><br>There's also the matter of pet hitpoints, which is another factor in the strength of a pet.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014008.html"><b>Useful New Skill Idea</b></a><br>I don't think that the AC and stats for an NPC would be of much use to the player since they mean something very different. Overall I like the idea of the skill, maybe it would apply well to resistances. It would be nice to see where the "weakness" is in those resistances. Of course, if we were to do that, it would only be a little while before all of this was known with certainty and it didn't mean much. <br><br>Hmmm, I'm not sure that it would be something that would work well in EQ, but perhaps might be appropriate for a future product where we could design around it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014005.html"><b>Friends List Cap</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: May I suggest removing the friends lists cap of only 20. The reason is that most people including myself have more then 20 friends to add. Since the friends lists are saved locally to our computers I believe that cause a problem with Verants servers. Please consider this request and if possible post your thoughts.]</i></font> <br><br>We're still considering this. We'll probably end up making the friends list differ on a per character/per server basis, however the 20 person limit is likely to remain. Lookups from the friends list are very processor and bandwidth intensive, leading to some non-negligible technical concerns.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013999.html"><b>Lack of Good Quests</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Come on verant, this is EverQUEST, the only quest i think i have EVER done in 35 levels is the Wurmslayer. Why don't you change the name to EverCAMP because thats all we do its dumb. Give us some more good quests!]</i></font> <br><br>There's currently over 1400 quests in game. Some are better than others, as things of this nature are always subjective based upon the opinions of those completing the quest. Some are simple, some are more difficult, some have a really high "cool factor" (Like the Lanseaux quests). <br><br>We're always looking for ways to implement more cool quests in game and appreciate all of the suggestions that are made here on the boards.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014002.html"><b>Nerf Overused</b></a><br>When the term "nerf" was first coined, it was directed solely at making an existing item, skill, ability, or spell less useful in some fashion or another. Since then it's morphed to mean "anything that we don't like". I personally don't believe changing drops or moving things around constitutes a nerf, it's just a normal part of the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013993.html"><b>Spell Drop-Rates</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I have a question. Are drop-rates of level 55+ spells correct now? I ask this, because there seems to be a serious lack of them around.]</i></font> <br><br>The Live team is going over the spell drops once again to be sure that they are all dropping at appropriate levels. One thing to remember is that not all spells drop randomly on creatures in all areas. Some spells only drop randomly in certain zones, while others only drop off of certain creatures.</UL>

Gordon made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013926.html">post after post in a thread he started</a> early this morning on the Gameplay Board announcing some new changes to the chat and emote system:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>I'm still trying to get together a list of changes for this Friday's patch and will have final data tomorrow, but either that one or the one after will include some new features in the in-game chat channels.<br><br>In the last patch, we implemented the ability to expand the "@" symbol into the targets name when used in an emote. There was a problem with this implementation that will be fixed in the new one. However, the @ symbol has been replaced with a series of @-variables that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in all chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild).<br><br>The new @-variables are:<br><br>@T - Returns the current target<br>@S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It)<br>@O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It)<br>@P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its)<br>@R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>@C - Returns the class of the target (only works on Player characters)<br><br>Furthermore, animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Abashi", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" (getting a bit complicated now, sorry). For instance, if my current target is "a gnoll", and I were to type:<br><br>/point say points at @T, indicating that he is ready to kill @O.<br><br>...my character would execute the /point animation, and the text output would be:<br><br>"Abashi points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>Custom text for canned animations must be directed at a target named "say".<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>Here's follow-up post #1:<UL>Hmm maybe I will get used to it though. But I'd never type @O when i could just type "it".<br><br><b><i>Ahhh, but if your target was one of gender, such as Baobob Miller, your output with my sample emote would be:<br><br>"Abashi points at Baobob Miller, indicating that he is ready to kill him."<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's another follow-up post:<UL>(Pertaining to your example) Wouldn't it be easier to do this?<br><br>/em points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it.<br><br><b><i>Perhaps, but then you'd have to type it out each time, and your character wouldn't actually point. I'd rather assign it to a social :)<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's follow-up #3:<UL>Oh and what do you mean by animations? <br><br><b><i>When you for instance type "/point", your character will outstretch @P arm (hehe) as if to actually point. That is an animation. There are many animations of this type, such as /nod, /tap, /cheer, /salute, /rude, etc. This have canned (predefined) text associated with them. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>The tireless Abashi continued to post in this thread:<UL>Will we get any new text for /rude?<br><br><b><i>Well I suppose you could set up a social as:<br><br>/rude say gives @T the bird.<br><br>...but be nice </b></i><br><br>This is a tad complicated. I take it you are suggesting that we assing 2 or 3 of our favorites to hotkeys for easy use?<br><br><b><i>I expect that will be the simplest use. I really don't expect people to type this out on the commandline each time.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Continuing on:<UL>This is really great, but I'm running out of socials here.. and hot keys...<br><br><b><i>Funny that you should mention that. We plan to include additional socials and hotkeys, either as part of the Velious client-enhancement or as a general issue patch. We're not sure yet.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's yet another follow-up:<UL>Some of them don't have animations.. just wondering if they will be for these or the old ones<br><br><b><i>Yes, it would only really work for canned emotes that already have animations. There are tons of these however.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Believe it or not there's more:<UL>This might be getting esoteric, but what about plurals? How about a plural for the race? You can't just add 's' to the race emote because then you'd get dwarfs instead of dwarves, and iksars instead of iksar.<br><br><b><i>Hehe, this was one of the issues that we spoke about. For right now adding an "s" yourself will have to make due. At some point we might make special arrangements for dwarves, elves, and iksar.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>All of this made sometime around 1:00-3:00am this morning.  Whew. :)

Gordon went on a posting spree on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's the first installment of today's infobit posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013984.html"><b>No DROP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You know I always chuckle when they say something like that.. databases can be converted its done all the time a new field is not out of the scope..I truly believe that is a way to try and end a topic..now with that said a few disclaimers]</i></font> <br><br>You're making some assumptions as to the way character data is stored that isn't exactly correct. Though I can't discuss how we handle data storage in detail, adding fields to existing objects is not something that we can feasibly do without unacceptable risk. It would require conversion of all character objects on a per-character basis, resulting in a LOT of downtime and an unacceptable risk of data-loss (necessitating more downtime for a restoration).<br>--<br>I should also mention that several core facets of EverQuest were designed and implemented several years ago. For those things, we're a bit limited by what could be done easily at the time it was coded, rather than what can be done easily now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013992.html"><b>Complement and Comments</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lets get back to making viable gameplay suggestions without resorting to bashing]</i></font> <br><br>Definitely a good suggestion! <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I do hope that verant dosen't go overboard trying to make everyone happy, IMHO I am happy with the way things are now - Just get tinkering up to par as was promised in Beta and get on with making new zones, quests, etc....]</i></font> <br><br>We certainly have to excercise due diligence when making any change in the game, espicially now when virtually any change will upset someone. There's even people who are upset about the emote enhancements going in on the next patch. <br><br>Very true that we shouldn't go overboard trying to please everyone, but at the same time we need to try and remain responsive to everyone's concerns. <br><br>Thanks for posting everyone!<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013951.html"><b>Problem with Emotes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you did the @R thing and it gives you the target's race, would that also give their race if they were in an illusion? Would it give the illusion's race, or the ACTUAL race? If it gives their base race, that could be disastrous on the PvP teams server...poor enchanters.]</i></font> <br><br>@R will return the current race, so illusioned enchanters would be perceived as whatever race they are illusioning at the time. There is a problem with @C (class) that people brought up regarding anonymous people. We'll probably end up just removing that command, as further case-specific exlclusions would probably reduce it to the point of uselessness.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013929.html"><b>Changes in the Game</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you dont see EQ has a catalyst for creativity then you are in the wrong business. You should be creating a game that makes people be creative. It should challenge us to be creative. Without creativity we will get bored and run to the next game that comes along.]</i></font> <br><br>We certainly agree which is why EQ and other games of this type are so freeform. Some people prefer more guided content, and while we are going to work at providing more in that area as well, it will always be a game where the player makes the decisions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Every nerf is a limit to creativity. You respond to how players use the engine. <br><br>Seek the successful pathway and allow us to create a great game rather than controlling us. ]</i></font><br><br>Most changes, or the refusal to implement various features, are done to preserve or enhance creativity and strategy. For instance, our decision that the number of memorizable spells will remain at 8 is based upon this. <br><br>We do however have to avoid "creativity" that results in a severe reduction of challenge, as we feel that challenge is important for the game. For instance, if someone finds a way to kill something 100% of the time without suitable risk, we need to address that issue to keep the game challenging.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013935.html"><b>Why should we report bugs?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, Why should I report bugs?<br><br>I love this game ]</i></font><br><br>I think that you've answered your own question. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If verant wants to know the other bug I will tell them but I think for major bugs a reward should be more then just a mark..]</i></font> <br><br>We currently have a reward program for reporting dupe bugs.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013941.html"><b>Halflings and Hide</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You personally do not get to know whether the Hide was successful. To the person using Hide, it always appears successful, but if it failed you will be visible to others and to mobs.]</i></font> <br><br>The exception to this is rogues, who get a message telling them whether or not they are successfully hiding or sneaking.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013916.html"><b>Melee Classes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Har Har - My Bad - I meant: Screw the tanks intent.]</i></font> <br><br>Tanks do very well in EverQuest. Despite the soloing issue, which isn't what they were built for anyway, they are very good at what they do. <br><br>Perhaps if you could repost, minus the sarcasm, I might be able to address your concerns in greater detail.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013632.html"><b>Kunark and Conning</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But... if they hit harder, are harder, tougher, more magic resistant, higher hps, etc... shouldn't they CON higher? In other words, aren't Kunark monsters actually underconned and underlevelled?]</i></font> <br><br>No. /con is an indication of level in relation to yours. It doesn't take anything additional, such as spells, skills, abilities, etc., into account. <br><br>From a gameplay perspective, I've frequently said that /con assumes that you are in a sufficiently talented and powerful group, which would typically be true, as the definition of "sufficiently talented and powerful group" changes based upon the group's makeup, and the level at which you are fighting.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013882.html"><b>More Reality</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My only issue with EQ has been a lack of non-bashing, non-camping things to do. Had they added some more depth to the game (real skills that make $ - tho they're working on that some, real guild support, more interaction with the world, etc), I think I would have lost my job, my spouse and my life to this game.]</i></font> <br><br>It is indeed our goal to continually expand the number of options available to the player while maintaining the necessary elements of a game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013538.html"><b>The Online Store: Forced to Buy EQ Again</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Then you took the store away, forcing me to purchase the item at a software store. I not only had to buy a version I already had, I had to pay double what it cost online.]</i></font> <br><br>Well it doesn't really equate to double considering the shipping costs of the upgrade. In any case, we hope to have the online store open again soon, unfortunately there's not much I say to those who went out and purchased another full version at the store other than to apologize for the problems with our fulfillment house.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013866.html"><b>God NPCs and the Planes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Out of curiosity, the original EQ game was sold with the understanding that you could go to the planes and kill gods and stuff. To do this required you to be level 45.. well, there was no level at one point but was increased to a min of 45.]</i></font> <br><br>The planes were not on line when the game was released. They were added in a post-production update. In any case, the fact that the game would change over time was stated in the EULA, and it's not "illegal" for us to make those changes. <br><br>Perhaps after the plane changes you will not be able to kill an NPC named "Cazic-Thule" at the same level you used to, but you will still be able to take on an encounter that difficult and acquire the similar loot to what you get now off of that NPC. Neither of those are, however, required by law. <br><br>From a game design perspective, top level encounters were always meant to be top level encounters, and if the top level changes, those encounters should as well. We made an exception in order to avoid putting them all out of the reach of those who chose not to buy Kunark by placing the level cap on Vox and Nagafen. The other solution would have been to buff them up to a level that is appropriate for level 60 encounters, which we desperately wanted to avoid in the name of servicing our customers.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013868.html"><b>Stealth Nerf?</b></a><br>I suspect that you may have been /coning a creature set to what we call "AggroPC", meaning that it attacks everyone without regard to faction. NPCs will only appear "Indifferent" in a /con if they have a reason that they wouldn't attack a player character. For instance, the guards in Neriak take faction into account when deciding whether or not they are going to attack, and would show "Indifferent" when invisible. NPCs that attack everyone, like hill giants for instance, show as "scowls" whether or not you are invisible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013811.html"><b>Guide Account for Sale on eBay</b></a><br>This issue has been addressed. Thanks for the heads up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013808.html"><b>Lum Vs. Abashi</b></a><br>While I disagree with that piece, I do think that the complaints here are indicative of how responsive we are to player issues. If you go to sites that we do not post on, such as many of the class-specific boards or some of the news sites, you'll see a far greater ratio of positive posts to negative ones.<br> <br>Why is that? Because it's generally understood that posting complaints on those boards doesn't do any "good", where in this case it can do some good. I've lost track of how many positive things that have happened in game due to the number of player concerns that have been posted here. The sheer involvement and passion on this board is a testement to the fact that we do listen to the players. Sometimes we can't always do what a particular group wants, but I think that the majority of what we do is in the interest of the players as a whole. <br><br>I'm not going to argue the personal aspects of that peice beyond asking, does anyone really think that communication and action was better prior to my arrival? I do not believe that is the case. We've made great strides in our ability to act on player issues since that time. Can it be better? Sure, as all things have the potential to improve. </UL>
