<BR>
Obediently, Dreketh raised her face and stared into the intense gaze of her mentor.  It was worse than she had imagined.  With a single glance, she saw within his eyes the conundrum of puzzlement and worry he was experiencing at having his prized pupil show, for all to see, that she wishes to turn her back on him and all he stands for. <BR>
<BR></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
Detecting, too, a hint of hurt in his gaze, Dreketh realized it also went much deeper.  Xon Quexill had gone so far as to personally nurture her development - not just in the art of necromancy, but as a young Teir'Dal woman.  The loss of both her parents in the Battle of Butchers left Dreketh without sponsor at the early age of adolescence.  It was Tolax, in fact, who petitioned Quexill on her behalf to accept her into the necromancer's guild two years prematurely of the requisite age.  As guild master and military commander to her late parents, it was his personal request that provided her sponsorship for survival in Teir'Dal society.<BR>
<BR>
Demanding no added recompense, Master Quexill took it upon himself to single-handedly supplant her absent parents and teach her the ways of Innoruuk.  He taught her how survival meant domination over one's enemies, how the path to domination was victory, how victory was achieved through hatred, and how hatred was the path of Innoruuk - Prince of Hate, wellspawn and creator of the Dark Elves. <BR>
<BR>
He was her mentor, teacher, spiritual guide and friend.  He was her truest father in spirit, if not in fact.<BR>
<BR>
"Why have you asked this of me?" Quexill spoke with an audible whisper, his words rimmed with outrage and disbelief.<BR>
<BR>
Dreketh's already intimidated gaze froze in place, her expression pleading.  The vision of her guild master's striking features blurred, her eyes quickly filling with tears. <BR>
<BR>
Quexill's disapproving face loomed closer as he lowered his imposing form to one knee.  Assertively, he reached out to cup Dreketh's supple jaw in his hand.<BR>
<BR>
"Why?" he whispered again, this time softly enough so only she could hear him.<BR>
<BR>
She winced as though he'd shrieked the word at her in heated rebuke.  Paralyzed in fear of his fury, the tendons in Dreketh's throat constricted as she struggled to bite her tongue.  She wanted desperately to cry out the answer for all to hear, yet was compelled by forces beyond her power to remain silent. <BR>
<BR>
Trembling in her master's caress, Dreketh's brow furrowed as she closed her eyes painfully, unable to look at her master any longer.  Because of her refusal to answer, she knew what was inevitably to come next.  Yet the pain of his gaze hurt more by far.  A tear escaped her control, spilling down her blue cheek and onto her master's unrelenting hand.<BR>
<BR>
Quexill's expression remained stone cold.  Not a twitch betrayed any inner emotion as he let loose his power into his reticent child.<BR>
<BR>
Dreketh's world exploded in an eruption of searing pain coursing through her entire body.  Through it, she felt the strength in her limbs weaken.  Her skin felt as though it crawled over sinew - a sensation much like a water skin whose contents are spilling to the floor.  The normally quiet hallways throughout the Lodge of the Dead reverberated with Dreketh's agonized screams.  The denizens calmly observed, their forms silent and monolithic as Quexill's spell bored into her very soul and sapped her life's energy in a slow and tormenting remise.<BR>
<BR>
It is the art of the necromancer to manipulate pure life energy as an artisan manipulates clay.  The feared and reviled art encompasses many ways of tapping into such energies and controlling them.  Among these techniques is ranked the vilest, yet most widely used spell that every necromancer learns from the earliest stages of their talent: the vampiric draining of another's energies into one's own self.  The process is excruciating as the victim's essence is brutally stripped from their body - their life's force ruthlessly stolen as they remain powerless to retain it.  This tapping into one's soul is a rape the likes of which no other perversity could surmount. For many, it remains the primary source for so much repugnance of its practitioners.<BR>
<BR>
As guild master, Quexill was a proficient at this ability.  Methodically, he stripped Dreketh of her energy.  He could feel her taut jaw muscles in his grasp as she continued her incessant cries.  He could feel her tremble violently as wave after wave of suffering engulfed her.  Through his arm, he could feel the influx of her energy entering his own body, enhancing his already formidable might. <BR>
<BR>
Dreketh's life was held literally in the palm of Quexill's hand.  Had he wished it, he could have ended her existence there and then, and the entire matter would have been considered settled by all.  His contemplation brought him dangerously close to doing just that.  His standing as guild master would remain unaffected.  Teir'Dal law gave him the right to destroy her for such impertinence.  A portion of him would even receive a certain amount of grim satisfaction in delivering her due for so maliciously turning on him, as she had.<BR>
<BR>
Before he was given the liberty of fully deciding her fate, a voice rang clearly over the din throughout the hall - a voice which clearly did not belong to one of the familiar denizens.<BR>
<BR>
"Stop!"<BR>
<BR>
Xon Quexill immediately dropped his attention to his pupil's torment and whirled about to meet the new threat of an intruder within the sanctum.  Dreketh's body fell to the floor in a limp and seemingly lifeless heap, her magenta robes settling about her lithe form.  In one fluid motion, Quexill raised his hand, palm outward, poised to unleash a magical attack.  In a single heartbeat, this newfound threat would be reduced to a quivering mass of flesh.<BR>
<BR>
His enraged vision clearing, a flash of recognition crossed Quexill's face as he caught a glimpse of the trespasser he was about to dispatch.  Immediately, he checked his spell.  Clasping his hand firmly into a tight fist, he drew it to his own chest, clenching it rigidly as if to suppress a tremendous force from being unleashed.<BR>
<BR>
Standing in the archway was an aged man dressed in dull gray robes, his hands hidden within the sleeves.  His blue skin shown ashen, revealing his advanced years.  His hair was a healthy white, cascading to his shoulders in unkempt masses overshadowing his face.  From within the natural cowl shown the cool glimmering of the man's eyes, each framed by an assortment of crags and wrinkles.  More disconcerting was the calm with which he faced Master Quexill, seemingly undaunted about facing any threat this master of the necromantic arts may pose.<BR>
<BR>
Quexill remained on one knee above Dreketh's inert form, his face a display of malevolence.  He scowled darkly at the gray-robed figure as it stepped forward, entering the muted light of the hall.<BR>
