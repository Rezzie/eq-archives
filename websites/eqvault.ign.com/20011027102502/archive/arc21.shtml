Banegrivm brings us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>For those who do not know, it has been seen that a state of war will be <br>coming to pass. It seems the plot thicks a bit as many of the heroes of lore <br>have appeared in a recent raid into Castle Mistmoore. As well there are now <br>implications of Dragons from the Ring of Scale and the Claws of Veeshan being <br>involved, more noteably...Trakanon, Lord Nagafen, and Lady Vox. All of which <br>are outcast from the ring of scale. All of the information of such is posted <br>at <a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net">http://www.1fol.cjb.net</a> upon the war thread. <br><br>With all that said and done from events I have seen, I wholeheartedly believe <br>there will be war soon. As such I would like to begin to prepare setting up <br>active patrols and such. This would mean all the guilds would need to bind <br>together. So I ask all guild leaders that would lend arms, please come to the <br>meeting this saturday the 18th at 4pm est time. We shall meet in West Karanas <br>against the westernmost wall across from the guard tower. <br><br>if we can come to agreement and stand together as one accord I believe <br>strongly nothing can defeat us and a great travesty of dark tidings may <br>indeed fail to come to pass. This should be a great day when an Inner War <br>Council may be forged and as such, when the throes of battle are over and the <br>skies fill with the smoke of the burning pyres of the fallen...it shall be in <br>victory and a day forever where many stood together against a common enemy.

The following excerpt is a clip from the interview portion of the article with Verant's Jeff Butler:<UL><b>GS: In general, what's new in Shadows of Luclin? Verant has stated before that if it were to make another expansion pack after Scars of Velious, it would be more along the lines of the first expansion, Ruins of Kunark, in that it would have an all-new playable race and other low-level features. As such, is Shadows of Luclin designed primarily for new players? </b><br><br>JB: Luclin will include a new player-character race (Kerran), class (Beastlord), and starting city, along with all-new player-character models and textures, DirectX 8 support including hardware T&L, and at least 25 new adventure zones. It is designed for players of all levels. </UL>The Shadows of Luclin is the 3rd EverQuest expansion announced today.

The big part of Alan's visit the the Developer Corner today was the publication of several player's comments on the "What Makes a Zone Interesting?" topic.  Here's the latest:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000103.html"><b>What Makes a Zone Interesting?</b></a><br>We've received so many comments on this topic that I'm not going to even try to respond to all the ones that I'm going to post here. I'll just start it off with a thank you for the responses and end with in a comment. You're all tired of hearing me chatter by now anyway&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well...my favorite zone in the game (so far) is the Crypt of Dalnir. I've only been so far into it, but the theme is coherent. The zone itself tells a story. I love the hyper-intelligent slimes who are controlling the other races in the zone. The mobs are, for the most part, pretty much stuff you can see in a zillion other zones, but they are tied together in a way that is easy to read as you travel and fight in the zone, even if you haven't heard the story from some elf halfway across the world. I really like that. I'm also fascinated by Najena, and would like to know more about her and the fallen temple she inhabits. I'd also like to see more about the Moltor family, whose crypt is Unrest. Paineel is my favorite city. It's beautiful. It has a look that very much matches its inhabitants. It has little things that make it interesting (like the skeletal musicians in the bar). <br><br>Ghuz Spineshank of the Mystic Alliance<br>25 Warrior on Rodcet Nife<br>Rob <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>RaanVenturis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Two of my favorite zones in the game are Lower Guk and Sebilis (even though I have not yet seen all of sebilis as I am not yet high enuf -only 53). So, when thinking about what I like about zones, I have to consider what I like about those zones. <br><br>First, those zones REQUIRE a well organized and varied group in order to survive. You have to have your healer, your buffer, your snarer, your tanks, corwd control, etc. <br><br>Second, there are only two REQUIRED classes for those zones (cle and enc). All other members of a successful can be varied. <br><br>Third, even with a well balanced and organized group, you are not guanteed success. Both zones still requires playing well together and everyone doing their job to succeed. That makes it a continuous challenge. <br><br>Fourth, both zones DON'T require more than a full group to be successful (except the lowest reaches of sebilis). <br><br>Fifth, there are enough "room areas" that multiple people can play successfully in the zone. <br><br>Sixth nice and varied graphics with a common "theme". <br><br>To sum it all up, the thing that makes a zone great is a that it is a challenge for a full group, has decent loot, does not take so many people to be successful that there is more time spent organizing than fighting, and requires a balanced, varied, and organized group to be successful. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>Nimbul wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think my favorite zone so far, Tower of Frozen Shadows. <br><br>Crowding: hardly any. Most of the time it's a group to a floor <br><br>Location: not hard to get to, right near a port. See crowding, zone in, if it's crowded, leave. It's great. <br><br>Keys: well done! Adds just enough risk to keep lazy players out, but they don't become a hassle. We worked to get a complete backup set, and carefully chose who in the group got keys. (though the spawn rate of the angry librarian needs to be looked at in my opinion, that key is WAY too hard to get compared to the others). <br><br>Phat L3wt: not so much as to draw farmers. Enough to make it exciting when you find something. <br><br>Loot: cash is decent as are weapon drops (for cash) <br><br>Difficulty: just right. If you're smart, risk is minimal. Few roamers for adds means you can do this without the "required" enchanter. You can also do it without a full group. <br><br>Trainless: (is that a word?) the keyed levels eliminate trains. You can only zone out, or to the next (harder) level (and supposedly mobs follow), so there's no place to train to and kill others, or worst, have others train onto you. <br><br>Variety: each new level has a new look/feel, yet still stays within the theme. <br><br>I'd love to see more zones like this. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>OccamsRazor wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like the little mini-dungeons in the Kunark zones, such as, the small spider cave in Field of Bone, the goblin tunnels in Lake of Ill Omen, the Burynai mines in Frontier Mountains, the Yeti caves in Dreadlands, etc. These aren't full dungeons, but they're more than just tents with a few monsters standing around a campfire. I was impressed and delighted when I found them, and it made me feel rewarded for exploration for the first time in a long time in EQ. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: For me what makes a zone is the ability to move around as you fight. Most zones are overcrowded all the time so you can't do this but certain zones are empty enough that once in a while you can take a group of six and adventure through a zone, instead of killing the same respawning mobs over and over. Sebilis is a great designed zone because it has several part of it that are like independent dungeons. For example you can go to the grup, pick area and most of the time be by yourself with one full group. That part of the zone is big enough so you can move around a bit rather then just pulling non stop. The crypt, and bar/chef area is the same way. For me sebilis marked the evolution of the games dungeons because of this. <br><br>Nurok <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hrm, the Subject thingie is broken again it seems. <br><br>Well, Hi there. <br><br>I wanna comment on this by an example. My favourite zone when it comes to design is Blackburrow (nope, not because I like trains, not really). I like it because it's completely asymmetric, no straight lines anywhere, the guy who created it really did some great work there. It's all messy, you run down first, then over some bridges, you have to dive somewhere, then you go a bit up again to move further inside, climb some ladders, etc. Just like one would expect a real gnoll-hole. When I went in there for the first time, I was really lost, and thats how it's supposed to be. If I would crawl in some newly discovered cave in real life, I would probably get lost the same way. <br><br>However, it's made in such a way that you can recognize some spots (like the brewing barrels, or the bridges) so you can learn your way around once you've been in there for awhile. Thats the one thing about Crystal Caverns I didn't like, there aren't enough of those memorizable spots in there, so it's hard to remember the way upwards through the orc section. Apart from that it's a beautiful zone too, with lovely textures and the singing velium in every corner. Yes, sound effects add alot to atmosphere in a zone too. Drip. Drip. Drip...<br> <br>Also I enjoyed some of the funny creatures you did, e.g. snow bunnys in a 30+ Zone :)  Or a snow dervish slowing down in its rotation and finally falling apart when slain, or the geonids et al. <br>And I laughed my ass off when I was in that school room in Thurgadin where one kid pinches the other and the teacher tells the one who was pinched to stand in the corner, because he yelled out loud :)  Or the sleepy Guard in Icewell. <br><br>(Bah, Absor never posts my comments anyways.) <br><br>/bonk Absor <br><br>Hmm, too many chars to put them all in a signature. You may refer to me as Menemtahe for the moment :-) <br><br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Wow...I could probably write a book about this topic. Here are some short thoughts : <br><br>Speaking from the graphical design of a dungeon, I especially like dungeons that tell a story. The Hole is a very good example. If you are down there you can imagine how it mustve been when the elementals from the plane of underfoot conquered the city and destroyed everything, forcing the heretics to retreat to Paineel. Its creepy to walkk down streets in a ghost town....you see shops and inns, destroyed and with broken furniture. <br><br>As for the gameplay side of design: I think its vey important to have a safe zone in in a dungeon. Not everyone can assemble a party before going to a dungeon. And its hard to form pickup groups if you cant hang around an entrance of a dungeon because of mobs spawning there (Howling Stones). From the entrance it should be possible to go in several directions..not just one way...that would allow for multiple groups to go down without stepping on other people toes. When you go down a path..make it possible to branch off to set up camps in certain areas..so that folloing groups dont have to go through your camp to reach another spot. As for mobs: I know it is a an old topic. But please make it possible to go down without having to have a chanter in the group. Too many mobs in an area and too many roamers together with bad pathing makes a chanter a MUST in a group. Perhaps make the mobs harder but not that many in one spot. Make rooms with just one or two mobs in it. Make a mob that is very hard (doable by one group of course) and that procs pets to make things interesting for example. <br><br>Well, as I said..I could probably write more about it..but I am sure you have a lot of other emails to read...thanks for listening. <br><br>Thoril Honorblade <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>Lantir_DelArmgo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I, personally, love the feel of Thurgadin. Almost all of the other cities in EverQuest feel barren. Walk into a tavern in Felwithe or Kaladim and what do you see? Not a whole lot. There aren't many npcs in the bar. The pubs in Thurgadin, however, are full of people, and the added sound effects of lots of people talking help bring this area to life. Crowded barrooms are just one of the little touches that make this zone more interesting than others. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>Goladus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Scenery, atmosphere. I love the remote and desolate feeling of Permafrost, the sinister atmosphere in qeynos catacombs, and the big lava pits in Sol B. Dalnir is freakish and unnerving. To me blackburrow feels like an infestation, though I'd not rate blackburrow as one of the more scenic zones in the game. <br><br>I like when a zone has a good story behind it. <br><br>I like a zone that I can explore solo(meaning the creatures are low level or not agro). <br><br>Or I like a dungeon that a significant portion of can be explored by a single group. <br><br>I like when NPC's respond to hails!<br>I like when NPC's respond to hails! <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>We received over 300 comments about what you all like about zones so far. The majority seem to like a theme, a story, a sense of life and mood. Personally, I think that's a key to making the world more enjoyable. Loot is only exciting the first time you see it. A well designed, well plotted, nicely populated zone will be nice every time you see it. <br><br>I just can't post all 300+ messages. But the team has access to all of them. And I'd like to see many more messages for them to read over and use when thinking about zone design. Keep sending in your ideas. I'll post more of your comments later. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000106.html"><b>Shadows of Luclin</b></a><br>No, I really don't have anything more to tell you about this yet, sorry.

Updates were posted on the Patch Server after the servers were brought down again:<UL>April 17th, 5:00 pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Emergency Patch Update **<br><br>We're sorry that we've had to patch again so quickly.  We found a problem with the change we made to the Red Scabbard.  This patch is intended primarily to fix that issue.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- Buying a duplicate lore item will no longer cause you to crash.<br><br><br>** Clarification **<br><br>To clear up some confusion, we wanted to let everyone know that we have changed the timing of the spawn of the Venril Sathir remains.  It no longer appears directly after the death of Venril Sathir.  And we also urge you to read the patch message below about the changes to this creature.<br><br><br>Also since we're patching to fix bugs, we decided to throw in a new feature.<br><br>- %M used in a macro will now place the name of your pet (if you have one) in the text of your macro.<br><br>- Bag Positioning:  Now bags will stay where you put them.  Simply open a bag and move it to where you want it.  The bag will remember it's location and open up there again next time.  This will be persistent and will be remembered when you log out.<br><br>There are two things to know about this new feature.  The first is that the default position of every bag is going to be the same.  So if you open one bag and then another, their windows will stack on top of each other.  Don't let this alarm you, the first bag window didn't close.  Just move the top bag to the desired location and you'll see the bottom one.<br><br>The other thing to know is a bit more complicated.<br><br>The saved locations for opening bags are linked to the bank or inventory slot that the bag is in, not to the bag itself.  So if you open a bag that is sitting in your first inventory slot and move the bag window to a new location, it is the inventory slot that remembers the position and any bag opened from that inventory slot will open in the saved position.  Take that bag from the first slot and move it to the second inventory slot and it will open in the location set for the second inventory slot.  It will not remember where it was opened before.<br><br>Experiment with it, it will make more sense once you try it.<br><br><br><br>April 17th, 1:00 pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Cosmic Rift Enters Beta Testing  **<br> <br>Sony Online Entertainment's latest massively multiplayer game Cosmic Rift enters open beta testing today, April 17. Cosmic rift is a multiplayer space action game where you take command of a star fighter and wage war with hundreds of other players. To take part in the beta testing, visit the Cosmic Rift web page (at <a href="http://cosmicrift.station.sony.com/">http://cosmicrift.station.sony.com/</a>) to get started.<br><br><br><br>*** Patch Message Addendum ***<br><br>Just a few notes to clear up some questions and some errors in the patch message.<br><br>** Food Changes **<br><br>Along with the other changes mentioned in the patch message, some player-made food items will now have an effect on your character beyond just keeping him from being hungry.  We'll leave it up to you to discover the rest.<br><br>We've also added the ability to right-click food to 'force' your character to eat it.  This will cause the food to be eaten immediately (though your character can only eat so much food at one time).  Food eaten this way will only last half as long as food eaten naturally by the character.<br><br>** Run the Velious Patch **<br><br>If you want to see the new Monk textures you will need to make the changes mentioned in the patch message.  But you will also need to run the Velious Patch in order to get those textures to show up.<br><br>** Skewer Change **<br><br>We didn't actually change the weight of Skewers, we changed the weight of Spits.  Sorry for the confusion.</UL>

Patch Day proved, as usual, to be a very active day for Alan on the Dev Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Patch Message</b></a><br>I wanted to post the patch message here and make a few comments about it. <br><br>First of all, this might be the longest patch message I've ever seen. And there's no padding in it. :)<br><br>Mostly I wanted to thank all of you that have sent in suggestions and comments. Many of the things that went into this patch were the direct result of your input. The items that are addressed with this patch encourages me. I'm pretty sure that this new system works well. The team has direct access to your comments and they are able to make changes based on your suggestions without having to weed through a lot of miscellaneous data.<br>--<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000105.html"><b>The Dieties</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I loved seeing this section updated but have one question.Where is Tholuxe Paels.All i know of this one is it is the god of lust (least that was what the message said in the early days of the server)nothing more is known as far as i know of this lesser deity. <br>Teudar 55 enchanter TP<br>Carle 46 warrior BB ]</i></font><br><br>I was going to make mention of the new deities page. I'm glad you brought it up. <br><br>Yes, there are a few gods missing from the list (and Drinal, who isn't a god at all.) We'll update them when we get a more in-depth description from the designers. But for now, the list is a lot more complete. I'll try to let you know when we update it in the future.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000075.html"><b>Forging Issues</b></a><br>Lybernia wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm not convinced that this is working as intended. I was naked after a death and left without food and water of course. I was recieving the message that I was out of food and drink. I foraged and got food, I foraged 3 more times and got food as well. At this point I was only recieving the message about drink. I never sucesfully foraged water before getting back to my corpse and my belongings. ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I'm getting a lot of e-mails like this. I guess I wasn't clear enough when I explained this, so I'll try again. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If, and only if, you are receiving "You are hungry" messages (not if you are out of food, only if you are receiving this message) AND you successfully forage, you will automatically forage food. <br><br>If, and only if, you are receiving "You are thirsty" messages (not if you are out of water, only if you are receiving this message) AND you successfully forage, you will automatically forage water. ]</i></font><br><br>Being out of food or water is not going to guarantee that you will forage food or water. <br><br>And you are not guaranteed to succeed at your foraging if you are receiving the 'hungry' or 'thirsty' messages. Your chance to succeed does not increase at all. <br><br>For most people in most situations, the run to retrieve your corpse will not be long enough for you to start getting the hungry and thirsty messages.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Topic of Religon</b></a><br>Yegolev wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I guess this is a general discussion of religion now, so my comment is this: <br><br>I play on The Nameless server. I'm interested in creating a PC that worships The Nameless. I realize that the modern-day races probably have no inkling of The Nameless as an entity, but I want to run around chanting "Down with Veeshan", "Karana is a Poser" and "Tunare Go Home". <br><br>No chance? ]</i></font><br><br>Yup, no chance. :)<br><br>You're correct in your evaluation (as far as I know) that most residents of Norrath probably wouldn't know who the Nameless was. <br><br>But you could, therefore, play an agnostic character who claims to worship this god that nobody has heard of. You would be considered an agnostic by people simply because they think you worship a figment of your imagination or a myth. <br><br>So there is a chance after all&#8230; <br><br>Muktuk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As for Veeshan-worshipping bards and threatening faction: I've always thought worshipping dragonkind must be something like worshipping Cthulu--you've been devoted and faithful, sure, but you're still getting eaten eventually... ]</i></font><br><br>/em laughs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: (quote)<br>Here's another idea, one that kinda ties in to changing dieties, but dosen't have to. There are imbued items, that are diety specific; why not spells (not just the imbue spells) that are diety specific? Maybe wizards worshipping Solusek Ro would get better fire DD spells, for example. <br><br>Astroshak<br>(/quote) <br><br>I saw the above in the Agnostic Iksar thread, and it sorta jived with something I randomly thought of this morning on the way to work. Instead of new spells, would it be possible to adjust the power of existing spell types based on religion? For example, a wizard who worships Solusek Ro (using the previous example) could have a bonus to fire based spells. Perhaps a wizard who worships Karana could have a bonus to rain spells. Prexus wizards could have bonuses to Ice spells, and I'm certain you could perhaps tie another deity to magic/lightning based spells, and maybe another to AoE spells. Note of course that I'm not certain of what deities Wizards can worship, so the examples might not be entirely valid. <br><br>And you wouldn't necessarily have to make it across all levels, either, you could have the bonus only kick in after a certain level (as a Wizard grows in his/her spirituality or something) and even have a quest that might activate the power. If you can't tie the ability directly to just religion, you could just make deity specific items that boost each element or spell type's power, much like the focus items for necros and magicians, and make them questable, something to prove the wizard's devotion to their god. And by making the quests tough enough, and use combinable containers, you could perhaps prevent the quest from being completed before the wizard hits a certain level (approximately, at least). <br><br>Such a focus type ability and/or item could help wizards' complaints about mana efficiency, and also help bring to the foreground the nature of their deity and the roleplaying aspects of such. It could be a great way to inject more story and more personality to some deities. <br><br>Tenbil En`Haldar ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that's possible. But, actually, something like that would probably be harder to balance, as it affects a large portion of the characters abilities rather than just making new spells that can more easily be balanced. <br><br>And when we're talking about adding spells or abilities for casters that are deity specific (and I noted that you broadened it to int casters, when my first thought was just wis casters), you have to think of Rogues that worship Brell, and Warriors that worship Cazic and any and all other combinations. Sure, after looking at all the combinations you might decide to restrict to just Wis casters at the end, but you have to go through all those other possibilities. <br><br>I rather like the idea, personally. But the amount of work that would have to be done and the potential for making some sort of error would be huge and would certainly make me hesitant to do it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Continued Discussion on Population/Server Issues</b></a><br>Crim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, I've been following your responses on the topic of item decay and want to point out one aspect about it. <br><br>You point out, correctly in my opinion, that item decay in EQ as it currently stands would be a disaster because of the tedium involved. But, the major tedium factor for item decay is due to EQ's overemphasis on making items rare. I have played games where item decay worked and worked quite well. <br><br>Simply put, item decay works in an environment that places less emphasis on the rarity of items. I'm not talking about adjusting the risk/reward of encounters. Instead, I'm talking about increasing the availability of items such that it isn't tedious to obtain new items as your old ones decay. <br><br>Not only would you essentially destroy the vast ebay market for items but you would encourage player transactions because of the increase in items and need for items. You would also discourage the twinking problem because of the need for items at appropriate levels. <br><br>For example, imagine the ghoul lord dropped an SSB and a ykesha every time he spawned (and he spawned every time). But, ykeshas and SSBs decayed after a certain amount of time (or dropped to a lower effectiveness etc.). Basically then not only would the dungeon crawling experience be better (i.e. placeholders are a hack way of limiting item availability and ruin a good dungeon crawl) but there would be an active market for those classes who would use ykeshas. <br><br>Anyway, I've rambles on long enough but I hope I have gotten my point across. If you take away the tedium in replacing decayed/destroyed items, then you can make a workable (and in fact better) system involving items. ]</i></font><br><br>I understand your point. But I think maybe you're missing something. <br><br>If ykeshas, for example, were to decay (becoming less effective) and at the same time more available to compensate, this wouldn't be as good of a thing as it might seem. <br><br>You would spend as much time, if not more, camping to get your ykesha. You would be heading back to the same place to get a new one at levels beyond the point where getting the item is a challenge. Some people do that now, but everyone would have to do it if their ykesha was wearing out and they needed a new one. You'd be seeing more high level people working lower level dungeons. A lot of people don't want to spend their time re-acquiring and item in a place that they've already seen enough of when they were at the right level to be challenged by it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Chadrack's ideas would have profound(not necesarily bad) effects on item-loot pvp. <br><br>-Goladus ]</i></font><br><br>Very good point. I'll have to think about the repercussions on PvP. But it's obvious that the ability to turn things No-Drop would have a tremendous effect on PvP where looting items is possible. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan,<br>Thank you for your concern about this issue.<br>- Doesn't the idea of monsters being "camped" around the clock offend you? This is a game of questing, and I can see making people have to do long, involved quests, involving travel, fighting, and almost anything else. But the idea of just sitting, waiting for a quest monster to appear, bothers me. ]</i></font><br><br>Offend me? No. Bother me? Yes. But, and I know you've heard me say this before, nobody is forced to sit around and wait for an NPC to spawn. You may have to do that if you want the item that everyone tells you is important, but no item is required for any character. If you don't want to sit and wait for an NPC, go do something else. <br><br>Yes, the fact that people sit and wait around for NPCs to spawn does bother me. But it doesn't offend me. I don't do it, so how could it offend me? :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - I think that making all items NODROP is, as you said, not feasable. Making a lot more, not all, items NODROP/LORE may be a good thing. The player I am thinking of here is one like myself, up and coming, untwinked, looking to discover the world you have created. Making that person contend with an upper-level power player or guild who is camping what, to me, is a unique, special quest item, is troublesome.]</i></font> <br><br>Making more items No-Drop would not necessarily reduce the desire for those items. It just means that people that are now 'farming' them for their alternate characters would have to be more creative to get the items. And they are such an artificial thing, so contrary to the reality of Norrath (why is it that I can't give away this Kobold Molar? It's just a tooth.) that I hesitate to ever suggest making more of them. Personally, I'd love to be able to remove them. I'd love to think that everyone would go get their own when the time came, rather than farming items for people that aren't high enough level to earn the item. But that's not a reality. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - I believe your loot rules in the Warrens are trying to address these issues, and thank you for that. Have you considered simply placing level floors and ceilings on items? ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, we've considered it. But that's no more 'realistic' than No-Drop items, and has the same drawbacks. People would still 'farm' the items, they would just hold them until their characters were high enough level to use them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - How about limiting members to one character per server? ]</i></font><br><br>That's something that we've talked about on a server with new rules. We're certainly not going to force people to delete characters off of existing servers. But there are all kinds of arguments for and against this idea. I love to play a lot of characters, and I have one for every mood. I'd be restricted to just one mood on each server. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thank you,<br>Manus<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>Thank you.</UL>

A large new message was added to the Patch Server this morning:<UL>April 17th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Food Changes **<br><br>- Food items now have a 'duration'.  This means that some food items will not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain your character longer than they did before.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat.  This fellow has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to.  We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to work with this patch.<br><br>- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character was healed or damaged by spells.  This could be seen, for example, when a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go back down a bit right afterwards.  There was no error in the assignment of healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed.<br><br>- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different bracer graphic than you would.  Now everyone (including the wearer) will always see the same bracer texture.  If you have two bracers that have a different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).<br><br>- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to accidentally zoning back the way they had come.  You should be facing the right way when you make that zone transition now.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This should make at least one quest more available.<br><br>- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens.  Hopefully this will allow Troll bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items.  Previously, if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy.  Now he will have 4 in either case.<br><br>- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains.  Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests.  Hopefully these changes will dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.<br><br>- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This is the beginning of our overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious.<br><br><br>** Improved and New Features **<br><br>- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of your corpses.<br><br>- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, etc...) from merchants.  It works the same way as sell in that you can hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item.<br><br>- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with /wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is).  You can now use /wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window separately.<br><br>- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them.  This will work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 'auto-equip' area of your character profile.  So if there is already a piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for it.<br><br>- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when the chat bar is up.  When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names.  When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your last target.<br><br>- /assist has an added parameter.  /assist on and /assist off will determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist.  So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage your character's auto-attack.  This change will be persistent, so it will remain as you left it when you log out.  /assist also now has a range of 200 feet.<br><br>- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins.  This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong item.  PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it.<br><br>- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than just 'hail'.<br><br>- Added /charinfo command.  Currently this command only reports the zone where the current character is bound.  We may add further information as things progress.<br><br>- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported).<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two one-handed weapons.  What will happen now is rather simple.  The very next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it.<br><br>THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your inventory.  So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in your inventory.  And don't panic, the items didn't disappear.  :)  But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to fit into your main inventory).  If you end up with a No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a problem...<br><br>Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged.  Right now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is created.  We're working on fixing that bug.  We decided to make this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the old scabbard.<br><br>This new scabbard will have a special ability.  It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them.  Simply place a Sword of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button.  The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the permanent epic sword.<br><br>Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones.  That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and combined the swords for the first time.<br><br>- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it's a big two-handed axe...).  If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out.<br><br>- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character inventory upon disconnection with the server.  If you are disconnected from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to that character within 30 minutes.  After thirty minutes those No Rent items will be deleted.  There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe.  No reimbursement will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner.<br><br>- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the "Pouch of Quellios" as intended.  If you have one of these items and it still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch yours for a new one.<br><br>- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.<br><br>- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly.<br><br>- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced.<br><br>- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3.<br><br>- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed.  If you're wearing these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd announce it anyway.  New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped armors and on the questable armors.  Because the Velious textures can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be loaded by default by the game.  If you want to see the new textures you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE.<br><br><br>** Trade Skill Changes **<br><br>- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry made for their god.  For those that not only sing around the campfire, but sing about the campfire!<br><br>- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed.  Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear.  But if the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it.  Those items should no longer seem to disappear.<br><br>- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel Chestplate has been increased a little.<br> <br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making cultural armor.<br><br>Enchant Velium<br>Enchant Mithril<br>Enchant Adamantite<br>Enchant Steel<br>Enchant Brellium<br><br>- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis Lazuli to Malachite.  They now use the same reagent as every other Magician pet spell.<br><br>Minor Summoning: Earth <br>Minor Summoning: Water <br>Minor Summoning: Fire<br>Minor Summoning: Air<br>Elemental: Earth<br>Elemental: Water<br>Elemental: Fire<br>Elemental: Air<br><br><br>- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets will now appear upon a successful use of the spell):<br><br>Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)<br>Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)<br>Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)<br>Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle)<br><br>- Cannibalize IV now exists.  This spell is now available in Velious.<br><br>- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved.  They now return more mana to the caster than they did before.<br><br><br>** Class Specific Changes **<br><br>- Monk weight allowance has been increased.  Every 15 levels monks will get an extra 1 stone weight allowance.  The post 50 weight allowance has also been increased by 2 stone.<br><br>Level 15, Limit 15<br>Level 30, Limit 16<br>Level 45, Limit 17<br>Level 51, Limit 18<br>Level 55, Limit 20<br>Level 60, Limit 24<br><br><br>- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.</UL>

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Warriors</a>.  What do you know about them?  Warriors are the ultimate tanks and because so many races allow them, they come in a vast array of sizes and colors. Strength is one of their primary stats and because of their bulging muscles and extensive training they can wield most any weapon with the skill and cunning of a seasoned adventurer. But there's so much more to this class .. how much do you really know about these blademasters of Norrath?</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Alan spoke on the subject of /report on the Dev Corner today.  Here is his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000100.html">complete post</a>:<UL>I wanted to give you all a brief explanation about how to use /report.<br><br>When you have a problem in game where there is text describing the problem in your chat window, /report allows you to send that information to us. This information comes directly off the server and is stored to a database here, so there is no concern about anyone using /report to cheat. This is the most reliable way to get your information to us.<br><br>The most common example for using this feature is when someone is harassing you. Use /report to send us the offensive text and then send in a /petition with full details of the incident (include the fact that you've used /report as well, so the GMs know that it's there).<br><br>/report will only send us the text that is currently visible in your chat window. So make certain that the text you want us to see is visible when you use /report. Scroll up until you have what you need in the chat window.<br><br>Also, the syntax for /report is /report <name>. The <name> is the name of the person you are reporting about. If someone is harassing you, use their name. But if you are reporting something that happened to you, such as a bug that made you fall for 10,000 points of damage, then put your character's name after /report.<br><br>Nothing else is needed with /report. Please don't type /report <name> and then a lot of text explaining your concern. Use /petition to explain the concern.<br><br>Correct use of the /report feature can make it much easier for us to get things straightened out when there is a problem. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Check out the latest information from Alan he posted today on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000101.html"><b>/Roll Rigged?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I don't have any idea of the validity of this but since it's a pretty serious allegation I'd appreciate an official word. I was grouped recently in LGuk and group conversation turned to how to random on items. I was surprised to hear someone say that the eqclient.ini file could have a line added in to it to produce a specific random result. (I might have the file name wrong, but I think you get the gist.) It was suggested to random on a different number such as /random 300 or even vary things for each drop through a single /random 100 1000 to set the upper bound of each group /random. All of which seems like a waste of time as it would seem to me that /random should be easily enough safe from external player tampering and we should be able to make due with the usual /random 100 without fear of fraud. <br><br>It seems rediculous, but better to hear direct from the programmers. Is there a backdoor method client side that would allow someone's /random 100 roll to be jiggered? Or is this just cyber-urban myth? <br><br>Inquiringly yours,<br>Aeloryn 51 Illusionist<br>Quellious ]</i></font><br><br>Aeloryn. <br>Thanks for sending this comment in. I spoke with Ryan Elam (one of our programmers) and he stated that there was a time in the past that with a lot of work, someone would be able to predict what their random rolls would be. This has since been changed. The seed generator has been changed and made much more random. So I don't believe you have anything to worry about in terms of random rolls being able to be predicted or players receiving high rolls regularly by changing anything in the eqclient.ini file.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000102.html"><b>Leatherfoot Scandels</b></a><br>Evyndr wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Recently over at the Safe house these were a topic of conversation and being a fellow Halfling I am simply in awe that a nice item like this would hide our wonderful feet this is our defining feature :)  Could you please make them no visible graphic instead of leather I would bet if you asked any Halfling in game they would agree we love our fur a flying :)  Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That make a ton of sense. We'll remove the graphic from this item.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000103.html"><b>What Makes a Zone Great?</b></a><br>Once again I asked my esteemed colleagues what questions they would like to ask of all of you. Now most of us were all questioned out after the Fan Faire, but that didn't stop us. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br><br>I'd like to know this: <br><br>If loot was not a factor, what do the players find interesting about zones? What would they like to see? <br><br>Dave Nevala<br>Artist ]</i></font><br><br>Awesome question. <br><br>So what sort of things do you find interesting about the zones that you like. We're not talking about the Phat Lewtz here, we're talking about other things. For example, I love the neon and sort of smutty feel of Neriak. It conveys a sense of the people that live there very well. And I hear endless raves about the bar fights that them silly dwarves have. <br><br>It could be about the kinds of battles that take place in certain zones. It could be about the geometry of the area&#8230; whatever strikes your fancy. <br><br>Just use the Submit Comments button and let us know what you think. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Changing Religions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>Absor, <br><br>As far as changing religions is concerned; how hard would it be to make it only change your faction with the clerics/druids/whatever of the appropriate factions for thw two dieties involved? Another thing; I can see how a shadowknight shouuld not be permitted to change his or her diety to Tunare, for example, but there are a couple gods that have SK's. Since I cannot really see a character being a Cazic Thule or Innoruuk worshipping SK changing to worshipping Erollisi Marr, and still being a SK, I would not expect that character to be able to make such a change. But, don't both Cazic and Innoruuk have SK's that worship them? Why would an SK not be able to switch, with a long and involved quest? <br><br>Here's another idea, one that kinda ties in to changing dieties, but dosen't have to. There are imbued items, that are diety specific; why not spells (not just the imbue spells) that are diety specific? Maybe wizards worshipping Solusek Ro would get better fire DD spells, for example. <br><br>Astroshak ]</i></font><br><br>I'm certainly not saying that allowing a change of religion isn't possible (though there may very well be issues that I don't know about), I'm just saying that at the very least it's messy. <br><br>And the problem with deity specific spells would be balance. How in the world would we be able to create a new spell for each god that is unique and relatively well balanced with others? While I think we all love the idea, the amount of trouble that balancing just one such spell for each god would be a nightmare. And even if we were to produce a set of perfectly balanced spells, there would be no end to the complaints from worshippers of one god that really would rather have the spell that we assigned to some other god&#8230; <br><br>It's a time consuming nightmare. A great idea, but a total nightmare. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: All right buster.. ;-) Since you brought it up again.. I previously submitted a question about bards, Veeshan, and the Claws of Veeshan faction group over in Velious. I understand if the information you are allowed to give on it is extremely limited, but why is it that bardic worshippers of Veeshan are threatening by default to the residents of Skyshrine.. from a roleplaying perspective this makes no sense. The bard has dedicated his or her life to espousing the virtues of dragonkind through deed and song, yet until they have slain many a giant, they will still be killed on sight by those one would think are allies.. <br><br>Just trying to get some consistency. =) <br><br>Thanks! <br><br>Alustrae ]</i></font><br><br>Well, there is actually a reason for this, but you're not gonna like it&#8230; :)<br><br>The main reason is for gameplay purposes. We wanted all player characters to have to choose one of the 'paths', not be forced into one (no matter how logical it might seem). <br><br>As for the in-game reason, the residents of Skyshrine are very disconnected from the comings and goings of the lesser creatures. And, as with all residents of Velious, they have been cut off from contact with all other continents for long enough not to care much for, or fully understand, the way that politics and religion have developed outside of Velious. Their main concern has been survival and competition with their rivals, nothing much else matters to them. <br><br>There's a ton of consistency there. But you'll still have to convince those big fellows that you're a friend, not a foe.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Populations and Economies</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Everyone talks about inflation, sorry, I do NOT see it. I remember looting my first forrest loop, I kept it, but the price at the time was one K platinum, this week on Fennin ro they are about 500 plat per. THIS is inflation?? And this happens with EVERY item of value I loot, if I don't sell it and FAST, its value will plumet fast. There are a FEW items that maintain their value, mostly quest items that give the SAME xp NOW as six months ago, but these are few and far between, MOST on Fennin ro LOSE value rather quickly.<br>Clearbrook Spelljammer<br>druid 50<br>Fennin ro ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, what tends to happen is a reduction of the value of money and older items. Because these two things are rarely removed from the economy, they lose their value as more and more of them enter the world. New items, therefore, because they are more unique and because cash is more readily available, can sometimes have prices that seem very 'inflated'. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Chadrack's Idea would not require 14, or even 3 new items for each customizable piece of equipment, just one. It can still be ALL/ALL, it is simply now NODROP: it can only be used by the person for whome it is customized. <br><br>However, that still is doubling the number of such items in the game. <br><br>Zambus ]</i></font><br><br>Good thinking, I missed that. The armor would not need to have a size change if it will also become No-Drop. So, while it might make sense to change the tag to represent the new 'fitted' armor, it isn't needed. We could just label the new piece as 'fitted Soandso's Armor of Stuff'. <br><br>Thanks for catching that. <br><br>Hysswar wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Somehow I find I am writing this for the 5th time and I never see anything about it, everyone there must totaly hate this idea, but I am hoping that it is just overlooked everytime I enter it :)<br><br>One simple way to handle this. Double bank capacity (I only put this in for people who will cry about not keping 2 sets of items, I have enough room with it now to do this), make everything not spell related, trade related, food related, or non-magic NO DROP. That's it. Now people have to group to get the uber item since no one will be selling it. People won't be farming items, since they can't sell it (ebay or in game). The only possible way to twink a character is with player made goods. Why isn't this tried on the new PvP server, heck it would take care of the looting of items at the same time, and even leave some items lootable. ]</i></font><br><br>Making everything No-Drop would solve any problems with the economy. Unfortunately, it would do so by eliminating the economy. <br><br>There would be no trade at all between characters, except for the items you mentioned, making the player-based economy disappear. This isn't something that we want to happen. We try to use the No-Drop and Lore tags only to restrict very specific items. Doing so for the every item would probably be far too extreme.</UL>

Kenarden Silknote brings us this report:<BLOCKQUOTE>RIOTS IN QEYNOS AS PLAGUE SPREADS<br>by Kenarden Silknote<br>Tholuxe Paells server<br><br>QEYNOS: The Qeynos Guards were restoring order this morning after a night of<br>rioting that left six dead, including the Priest of Discord. The riots<br>started after rumours reached the city of plague in the Karanas.<br><br>A guard spokesman said: "A large number of heavily armed adventurers<br>assembled in front of the city gates, in the belief that the Blackburrow<br>Gnolls were about to attack the city.<br><br>"Some of them even claimed that a dragon had been sighted in the West<br>Karanas.<br><br>"The gnolls never arrived, and the adventurers rampaged through North<br>Qeynos, killing  indiscriminately."<br><br>A local businessman, Sneed Galliway, said he had feared for his daughter's<br>life.<br><br>"I was ready to die in defence of my overpriced merchandise, but I was<br>terrified that the rioters would harm my daughter, Tanlyn. Those adventurers<br>should be ashamed of themselves. They were so full of talk about how they<br>would work together and defend the city, regardless of guild or race. And<br>then they turned on us, the people they were supposed to protect," he said.<br><br>Meanwhile, the threefold plague continues to spread unchecked in the North<br>and West Karanas. The trees and crops have developed a sickly green hue, and<br>rabid animals howl at the moon in pain and hunger. The road is littered with<br>the bodies of unwary travellers.<br><br>I spoke to one of the farmers, who said his crops were dying as a result of<br>a terrible green mist and swarms of small green beetles that ate everything<br>in their path. I was attacked by several of these 'swarmlings' on the road<br>to Qeynos. They could easily kill an inexperienced traveller.<br><br>The farmer said: "The followers of Bertoxxulous want revenge for the<br>execution of Mordavin Telase, one of their high ranking priests. Mark my<br>words, this plague has been released by the Bloodsabres, allied with the<br>Dark Reflection."<br><br>There could still be hope, however. There is a prophecy in Qeynos. It is<br>said that a small girl will step forward, and tell the beleaguered city how<br>to end the plague. But no-one knows when she will be appear, or if she is<br>just another bard's tale, like the gnoll invasion and the dragon of the<br>Karanas.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Kanae brings us this letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>A great evil has befallen the Plains of Karana (well, at least on<br>Morell-Thule, it has)!<br><br>A friend and I crossed the great wooden bridge into the Northern Plains of<br>Karana to find the sky green with tainted rain! The entire landscape, once<br>so beautiful and peaceful, now held a disgusting green color. And as the<br>rain fell, it infected all it contacted with a vile disease, from<br>adventurers (ourselves included) to gypsies to the poor wandering animals.<br><br>It was quickly obvious to us that such evil could only be the work of The<br>Plaguebringer himself, Bertoxxulous! We've known the Bloodsabers to be very<br>active in the Western part of Antonica, and it seemed clear that this was<br>related to their nefarious doings. Even I, as far as I've traveled in my<br>Bardic wanderings, have yet to hear all there is to be told of the<br>Bloodsabers, but it seems ever more inevitable that they will try to summon<br>their dark deity from the very depths of his Plane of Decay.<br><br>But the more immediate concern is for the animals and residents of the<br>Karanas, who are being subjected to this vile disease whenever it rains. The<br>best we adventurers can do for now is to put the poor animals out of their<br>misery and to continue to spread the word about the doings of The<br>Plaguebringer. And so I offer this notice to all Good people of Norrath to<br>keep their eyes and ears open for any hint about what we can do to end this<br>menace!<br><br>Yours worriedly,<br><br>Kanae, Fier'Dal LoveSinger<br>Legacy of the Nameless<br>Morell-Thule</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the word of warning!

Slarti Tal`Krue has some ambitious plans for the Guk zones:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<br><br>My name is Slarti Tal`Krue, a Leader of Defenders of Justice on<br>the Rodcet Nife Server. There is a call to all Rodcet Nife <br>guilds to do what has never been done before.  This is no simple <br>raid that is planned.  <br><br>Upper and Lower Guk is begging for a cleansing.  The objectives will<br>be listed, the rules I ask all to read and agree to, and rules will<br>be needed as the scope of this will be on a huge scale.  Once the <br>goals are all met, we will have done what no other has to this point.  <br>I mentioned that before, didn't I?  Ok, first the objectives, then the <br>rules. :)<br><br>Objectives:<br><br>1.  Clear out Upper and Lower Guk completely.<br><br>2.  Make Guk safe for once.  For the two hour goal time, I would like <br>    anyone to be able to go anywhere in Guk without fear of dying! <br>    (non raid people)<br><br>3.  Get some excellent loot from the evil ones!<br><br>Proceedure As Planned:<br><br>We will assemble in Inothule Swamp and setup three waves.  Groups <br>will be formed as balanced as possible, and within the lvl requirements <br>for experience if also possible. Experience will not be a prime <br>goal, but will be high on the list. <br> Once groups are formed, the first wave, aimed at Upper<br>Guk, will secure the zone.  (The rules will explain -secured-)  Once<br>done, the Lower Guk group will zone in and secure Lower Guk.  The <br>third wave, known as 'Guk Patrol' will split. Lower levels for <br>Upper Guk and Higher levels for Lower Guk, and police the random <br>spawns between all camps. It is important we all do not zone in at<br>the same time, to prevent zone crashing and lag over and beyond our<br>means. <br><br>Once this is completed, we hold the zone for two solid hours, reaping<br>the rewards.  <br><br>Rules<br><br>*A note...the rules are extensive due to what we are attempting.  I<br>would like to see Guk run by the players and make it as safe as a <br>friendly city!<br><br>The Breaking of Guk!<br><br>1. Existing camps are not to be taken over wrongly. We follow all  <br>    play nice rules.  Your group WILL be assigned a camp, taken<br>    or not. If camp is taken, the group will make sure the campers<br>    or camper, are / is well protected and will announce camp <br>    protected.  Once the camp opens, then the group takes over <br>    and will announce to the zone that camp is secured.  <br><br>2. Need Before Greed!!  Each camp drops an item of value, minor or<br>   large, and this rule is to benefit all.  Need before greed is<br>   based on your character that you play for the raid.  If an item<br>   drops that you can and will use for your class or race, that <br>   item goes to that person.  If no one can use, then the group<br>   lottos that item till everyone has it.  Intial camps will be<br>   setup according to the classes available.  A group that is Druid<br>   heavy would get Mutant Fungus camp and group that is Paladin <br>   heavy would get Ghoulbane camp, etc.  That was an example.  I <br>   will make sure the proper classes get assigned the proper camps<br>   and based on how many people of each class we get, as balanced<br>   as possible.<br><br>3. Camp Swapping.  Once a camp has dropped items that all has had<br>   looted and everyone has gotten, then they will announce they are <br>   available for camp swapping.  When another camp in that zone has<br>   achieved the same status, then they are swapped during the respawn<br>   time.  This will hopefully ensure variety of loot. With the Guk<br>   Patrol in place, this will not be dangerous to do. <br><br>4. -Securing- a zone.  Once camps are protected or taken, and the Guk<br>   Patrol is established and in place, then we hold the zone for two<br>   hours.  I will issue the zone shout -SECURED- for all to start the <br>   two hour minimum timer.  The event does not need to end after the <br>   two hours is up however, if all Guildleaders there agree for another<br>   hour for rare drops, then we do it.  If we lose too many people to<br>   keep a zone safe after the goal, then the event will be finished <br>   for that zone.  <br><br>5. All campers are to take off anon and roleplay for identification<br>   purposes.  This is to keep confusion down as the Guk Patrol wanders<br>   and you are killing a mob for your group an may appear to be alone<br><br>The GOAL is to make Guk as safe as possible while reaping the items<br>for two hours.  This means, BOTH zones will need to be secured.  <br><br>Secured Guk <br><br>  Mostly, when people go to camps, or find groups, they have to invis<br>to living and invis to undead.  When traveling in some places, you have<br>to stay against one wall or the other.  When you do get to a camp, you <br>have to deal with trains at times.  This raid is intended to END that<br>for two hours.  <br><br>1.  All spawns will be exterminated.  No invising past mobs.  Use invis<br>    as a strategy.  Invis to undead, surround the Froglock Ghouls, then<br>    pounce.  Once spawn is destroyed, heal and med up, and move to the <br>    next spawn, destroy them, etc, until you take your camp.  This is<br>    critical for the third wave (Guk Patrol) to move in and keep it <br>    secured and safe.  <br><br>2.  Please plan on 5 hours for this event/raid.  1.5 hours to setup<br>    groups s people arrive and organize. 1.5 hours to secure Guk. <br>    Two hours goal time to keep the zones cleared and safe.  The sooner<br>    we secure it, the better chances for cool loot. <br><br>3.  High level folks (50+) who prefer to solo are encouraged for<br>    the Lower Guk Patrol! Casters with high lvl pets are highly<br>    encouraged!  We can not have too many people here doing patrol!<br><br>4.  Setup yourself as if this was a Vox raid and lag is a critical <br>    factor. Reduce Clip plane. Turn auctions off.  <br>    /showspelleffects off.  Go to your options and turn<br>    off all damage messages. Turn off OOC.  The shout channel will<br>    be used for Event communication.  This is critical to lower the<br>    amount of people going LD and control lag.  <br><br>5.  Group Leaders will assign a Master Looter.  All items that drop<br>    are Need before Greed as stated above.  Lotto is /random 100.  <br>    There is a code bug.  Group Leaders who see a /random 2 101 will<br>    immediately count that person out of that lotto.  The bug will<br>    automatically select the higher range of numbers after a <br>    normal roll 90% of the time.  I have confirmed this.  /random 2 101<br>    is considered cheating and therefore disqualifies you for that<br>    lotto.  Same rules apply to those in Guk Patrol who are grouped.<br><br>Message to Guild Leaders and their Officers<br><br>  This cannot be done with less than 80 people, not counting those<br>inside Guk the day of the Raid / Event.  If we do not get enough<br>people in the alotted time, it will be postponed till the same day and<br>time in one week.  This is to allow people to plan for it.  <br><br>1. I will need each one of you to email me three days of the week <br>   your guild can do this event / raid.  The most guilds that pick<br>   the same day will decide what day of the week we invade Guk.  Send<br>   to Droberts@Austin.rr.com<br><br>2. There is a reason for this multi-guild event.  If we can establish<br>   that we can come together, unite and achieve this goal, I feel that <br>   a Unified Guild Alliance on Rodcet Nife would be possible.  I would <br>   encourage each guild to take turns doing a similar event we all<br>   can attend. <br><br>3. All Guildleaders will use /anon to be easily identified as a GL<br>   in case issues arise that authority needs to be used.  For people<br>   who do not know, /guildstatus Slarti will tell you which guild I am<br>   leading.  You have to be in the zone, but you do not have to target<br>   the person.<br><br>  Guk Patrol!!<br>  There is a place for you in the Guk Patrol!  Your powers, skills, and<br>  if your class has them, Pet Power, are needed.  <br><br>The job and function of Guk Patrol is critical.  This is to <br>eliminate massive trains that have been known to kill campers.<br>Their safety and ability to destroy the camp for items without<br>the worry of adds will challange your skills.  All classes are<br>needed!  A few wandering Clerics doing random heals and buffs<br>and even an experience rez or two will be highly encouraged.  <br>Be proud of this role.  You will be rescuers, protectors and<br>the person the camp closest to you will depend on in a crisis!<br>You know how guards are everywhere in a city and come together<br>when danger hits?  You get the idea!  <br><br>1. Patrol a given area and stick to it if you can keep it cleared <br>    easily.  There are tons of places where spawns are cocky and<br>    do not feel threatened.  Teach them otherwise and keep that<br>    area safe for others to pass through.  <br><br>2. Guk Patrol will have to understand their role completely.  There<br>    is no such thing as KSing another Guk Patrol.  You see another<br>    clearing the spawns that are not camp spawns, assist them <br>    immediately until all are cleared.  It does not matter if they<br>    are winning or not, kill the blasted critter and if you get the<br>    kill, then loot.  If you find your area heavily patrolled and<br>    you cannot get in a kill edgewise, patrol another area or wander<br>    and protect, that area is secured.  Like any city, the Guards <br>    do not care if they KS one another, they just want it dead, and<br>    they like doing it. Next rule will clarify things even<br>    more when it comes to attacking.<br><br>3. You are not to attack spawns that are being fought in a camp <br>    unless you see a /yell from that group.  If you get the /yell <br>    and you take the kill, do not loot it and let the group's ML<br>    sit out the time it takes to ensure the party their share.  Once<br>    they are out of danger, return to your patrol. <br><br>4. You do not have to group to be in Guk Patrol.  However, if an <br>    area is highly dangerous and requires more than one Guk Patrol<br>    Officer, you can selectively choose to group for communications <br>    and health concerns.   <br><br>5. All Guk Patrol will use /roleplay so you can be easily identified<br>    as Patrol.  If you are not in battle and you see a /yell from <br>    another GP, assist immediately.  If a GP dies, do a zone shout <br>    "Guard Down" for a cleric to be dispatched and have the GP <br>    "repopped".  <br><br>As you can see, if all goes well and all people perform their duties as<br>assigned, then we can make Guk as safe as any city, with enough people.  <br>Once we know we can do it with this zone...then who knows...we may be<br>able to own other places as well. I will give to April 20th for all<br>Guildleaders who wish to join this to send me an email with their Three<br>Best Days of the Week for this event.  By the 21st, they will be <br>replied to for the day that best fits everyone.  I hope to see<br>you all there!  <br><br>Slarti Tal`Krue<br>Defenders of Justice</BLOCKQUOTE>Good luck!

Afraid that they'd be too tough? :)<br><br>Kenross Cantoforjado [Silent Justice], 58 songs, Innoruuk <br><br>btw, I tried to respond to the thread but it wouldn't let me. I suspect because there's a grammatically correct apostophe in the word "doesn't".]</i></font> <br><br>It has something to do with the whole fact that bard songs are completely different than spells. I'll poke around and ask some questions on Monday about it. <br><br>And I'll get rid of the apostrophe&#8230; silly thing.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000097.html"><b>Ceremonial Weapons</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I had forgotten to mention this in my original message: Ester stated this would be fixed, that this item was missing database entries for the dly and dmg, but since you're now running on the new format I can't point back to it. <br><br>Then in reference to the fact that "Ceremonial" means it's not meant to be used in melee, you need to make changes to the following items: <br><br>Sarnak Ceremonial Dagger <br>Damage: 6 Delay: 38 <br>Zone: Overthere<br><br><br>Sarnak Ceremonial Sword <br>Damage: 8 Delay: 34 <br>Zone: Overthere <br><br>Garaz <br>50 Warrior VoV Povar]</i></font> <br><br>I don't know what happened with Ester and what was said before. We're not perfect, and sometimes we make errors when communicating sometimes. I might misunderstanding it. I'll pester people on this and see what I see. <br><br>As for the other weapons (and some armor and robes and all that), well, I don't know either. The stats on those weapons aren't the greatest, so perhaps they are just ceremonial&#8230; <br><br>In the long run, the fact that the Ceremonial Wedding Sword has no combat stats isn't a critical matter to the whole of EverQuest. We'll look into it and make what changes seem proper, if any. Whatever those changes (or lack thereof) turn out to be, I'll certainly let you know.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000095.html"><b>More "In Development" Comments</b></a><br>Trillig wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I just finished looking at the list of projects on the development section, and am minorly concerned about one: <br><br>"New NPC Return Policy: Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops." <br><br>If I understand the idea behind this, I can see it hurting one aspect of the game I have come to enjoy now that I am a bit higher in level. <br><br>I regularly take items or cash that aren't much use to me and distribute them to lower level players. I do this by putting the items on low level mobs in newbie areas, like West Freeport. Then I'll shout out something like "Hey a rat just stole my money pouch! I had 10 platinum in there! Oh well, finders keepers." <br><br>Then I sit back and watch them go at it. :)<br><br>What I'm getting at is, when this change is implemented, please try and it so we can still give non-quest goods to mobs if we want to. <br><br>Thanks! ]</i></font><br><br>Absolutely one of the concerns we have with this idea. We'll try to implement it in such a way that it is still possible to hand off items as you described, but it might not be possible. <br><br>I just wanted to let you know that this concern had been raised and is part of the decision making process on this issue. <br><br>Rebu wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really like the In Development page. This is something that should have been available since the beginning. EQ is an ever changing game. Some things are not expected to be known right away (which was the old excuse Verant used for not officially posting what was going on behind the scenes), as well as those changes that effect gameplay and make the game better in general. <br><br>I am really glad to see Verant making some steps to letting the customers know what is going on, moreso than the hindsight of "This is what we did, this is what we meant to do, we are going to fix it somehow" that is/was all too familiar to veteran EQ players. <br><br>Thanks =) ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I guess I should thank you for the praise&#8230; :)<br><br>There are still a lot of problems with keeping an 'In Development' page running. It takes someone a bit of time to compile that data and write it up. The it has to be edited and all that&#8230; So we're taking precious development time up doing it. <br><br>Also, we have to worry about what happens when we 'plan' something that we don't end up putting in. It's not a comfortable thing to have people telling us that we <b>promised</b> something and didn't deliver. <br><br>So as long as we can manage the time, and as long as everyone understands that this is a list of things that we are working on, not a list of promises, then we'll keep doing it. <br><br>Carnifex wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works." <br><br>The above is included at the end of the "3D Engine Enhancements:" section, which is puzzling. It probably should have it's own bullet :)]</i></font><br><br>Yikes. Well, I'll let the web folks know and we'll fix that as soon as we can. Might be too late to get it done before Monday, though. <br><br>Sheesh&#8230; <br><br>ionRain wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A bi-WEEKLY patch schedule? I really hope that is supposed to say bi-MONTHLY, because the servers goin down once a week is not good but twice? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, biweekly can mean either every two weeks or twice each week. <br><br>And bimonthly can mean either every two months or twice each month. <br><br>Confusing, I know. <br><br>We were using it to mean every two weeks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000084.html"><b>Sit On and Off</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A bit of good news from Test may help this thread. <br><br>Last night I was purchasing some spell components, all set for a series of clicks and the spam to go with it when; A quantity to purchase box popped up! It defaulted to 20, so I adjusted it a bit and bought the needed number to fill my stack. It worked well. <br><br>Kudos to the programmers for working on this, and of course this should include the standard disclaimer, "What's on Test may not go Live." <br><br>-Taliskar<br>Bard on Test ]</i></font><br><br>You've discovered our secret! <br><br>I'll pass on your kudos. And I wanted to say thanks for playing on Test and paying attention to these things. It help us a lot when we have attentive players looking over our shoulders on Test. Thanks. <br><br>LordWally wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: hmm, since /sit is a toggle why is /pet sit then not a toggle too?<br>and why are /b linked to /bugreport, which is hardly ever used.<br>/b should be linked to /book, so a caster could write /b to get to a certain page. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, you don't really need a toggle for /pet sit. It's unlikely that you'd want him to /pet sit off, rather than /pet follow me or /pet as you were (which is really to opposite of sit anyway). <br><br>And I dunno what /b goes to /bug. Probably because it was there first (heck, it was probably the first / command put into the game). <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000047.html"><b>Voices</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There actually are other voices in the game. When in Thurgadin the coldain dwarves speak a few phrases I believe. I swear it always sounds like they keep calling me a big baboon :)<br><br>Lybernia Belisama<br>Mithaniel Marr ]</i></font><br><br>I'm sure they mean it in the nicest way, though&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Regarding the "Voices" Thread (which btw didnt enter the subject into this email *sniff*): <br><br>Frogs do make noise. I used to pull in Lower Guk that way, when it had 100+ people in it. "FROAAAK" /em runs off scampering after the frog she heard. <br><br>Of course, my sound is STILL messed up from that Velious addition. Seems like reverb has a problem, and occasionally it's like the sounds just don't want to stop. So I often turn sound down entirely, but I totally miss it. :(<br><br>Those folks that are listening to MP3s are totally missing out. The sound in EQ rocks! <br><br>Wyrd ]</i></font><br><br>Now I'm going to have Frooaaak! nightmares&#8230; <br><br>I am encouraged by everyone's enthusiasm for more voices like this in EverQuest. I think it's a nice feature, and I'll go prod a few people about thinking of adding more. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000089.html"><b>More Inspection Debate</b></a><br>Saeul wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think this is an important discussion and it traces all the way back probably to Isle of Kesmail and certainly to Dragon's Gate and Gemstone. In a PvP environment, inspection often leads to an attack if you can loot what you inspected. <br><br>In a non-PvP environment, the only britches being shown are the knickers of the inspectee getting in a wad if they complain. Probably it is viewed by most people as the only version of 'personal space' and that is why people often demonstrate upsetness at being inspected. (Personal space being [in western societies] approximately an 18 inch radius cylinder around the surface of your body.) <br><br>BUT, an inspection is really what you say it is: just a mechanism for people to actually know what someone is wearing. People really are being silly when they treat it as something else other than that. I would not even make it a matter of politeness AND it wouldn't matter at all if the game did not offer a message when someone else 'inspects' you. <br><br>Perhaps the game designers could elaborate on why that message exists to put the user community at rest? And if the reason isn't a good one, just take the silly feature out of the game so no one ever knows when someone else is looking at them?? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, the idea to remove the message came up. But it has its uses in the PvP environment. And some people like to know when they are being looked at closely by others (in much the same way that I might squint to get a better look at the logo on your shirt). There really is no need to remove it, we just went for the more flexible idea, allow players to choose to turn it off if they wish. <br><br><br>Rokke_MT wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I don't think you have been in a newbie area or city lately. Running my higher level characters, I almost always switch to Anonymous whenever I go into one of these zones to stop the begging. In fact this has become a very common thing for many of the players I know. However, lately the "Beggars" have simply taken to inspecting...and judging who to annoy by equipment. <br><br>This is truly harassment. I will get as many as 10-12 tells when I go into some of the cities like Kelethin and Freeport (not to speak of Riverview). Many of these tells are followed by more of the "Please, please, Please Gimme Gimme Gimme" variety. <br><br>Please change this so we can go to the bank in peace. I hate being rude to people but after a few minutes of this, I am beginning to get a serious attitude - and judging from the common OOC's I see, I am certainly not alone. ]</i></font><br><br>That sort of 'harassment' is unrelated to their ability to inspect you. If you have shiny armor on or if you're carrying a glowing sword, those people will still beg off you. The fact that they are inspecting you first has very little to do with whether or not they beg. <br><br>They best solution if you are really in need of a respite would be to bag up your fancy stuff before you get to town. They can see it visually, the inspection only happens after they see that you have something cool on. <br><br>Noreya wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Although on most of servers I'd agree with you, but I have one question. When was the last time you played on a PvP server? Being inspected is not only evasive, it can be a death sentence! Besides, if I'm wearing a robe or a cloak.. how is anyone supposed to see UNDER IT to know what Im wearing? I understand if the technical aspects of reworking this part of the game prohibit the changes, but please don't belittle this. The vast majority of people I have spoken to feel that being inspected is rude and undesirable... as roleplayer, my primary character certainly would not allow anyone to inspect what items I have without asking. ]</i></font><br><br>I most certainly understand the emotional issues. I understand that there is no way that I can 'convince' you that your emotional reaction is wrong. In fact, I don't believe that your emotional reaction is 'wrong' at all. It's how you feel. But, by the same token, you can't convince me (or the others that agree with me) that my feelings on this matter are wrong either. Hence the impasse. <br><br>Neither viewpoint is right or wrong from an emotional stance. So we can't rely on emotional reactions, we have to use logic. And if you look at the strict game mechanics without allowing emotion to become a factor, I think the answer has to be to allow inspection exactly as it stands now. <br><br>I wanted to also touch on the PvP thing. Again, I see inspection as a good thing in PvP. I picture an old west bar scene, where one fellow eyes the other just the wrong way&#8230; <br><br>"What er you lookin at!" <br><br>That sort of thing. <br><br>As long as you avoid the emotional response that leads you to think of inspection as a violation of personal space, the solution seems clear to me. <br><br>But I've been wrong before&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000099.html"><b>Sneaking, Hiding and You </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: In my time since I started playing EQ, I have played several characters with the sneak and hide ability combination (including a rogue). <br><br>The part I have yet to understand is why only the rogue has a success/failure messsage. Seemings that most classes receive sneak or hide at different levels, it would seem a bit more logical to have a success/fail message, starting at the level you can begin advancement (pay Practice Points into the skill). <br><br>In my opinion, this would not be taking anything away from the rogue class nor making an unbalanced game addition. <br><br>The sneak and hide combination is a very fun and useful part of the EverQuest world and I would like to be able to see more character types be able to take advantage of this ability in a more believable (it is a little hard to believe only a rogue knows whether they have hidden or is truly sneaking) format. Thank you for your time. ]</i></font><br><br>The success message is an advantage for the Rogue. The message is not given to other classes with those skills specifically so that it can be an advantage to the rogue. And, actually, it is fairly reasonable. When you're trying to hide behind something it isn't all that easy to tell if you are properly hidden. You may very well have a toe sticking out that you don't know about, or the top of your head may be sticking up (bad hair day, perhaps). <br><br>So, yes, that message is an advantage for the Rogue, and we don't plan to allow other classes to get it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000098.html"><b>Bind Point Location Displayed?</b></a><br>Traves wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was wondering if there could be a way to find out where your current bind point is (or at least the zone you're bound in). <br><br>I know there is nothing more painful than adventuring in an area thinking you are bound at a certain place only to discover you had forgotten that you were actually bound 10 zones away. This is, perhaps the most frustrating part of EQ for me...especially when playing non-casters who have to beg for binds in the first place. <br><br>I was thinking of either replacing the religion listed onscreen with the bind zone where you are bound or to provide a simple command like /bindzone to give the information. Is this possible?]</i></font> <br><br>It is possible, I'm pretty sure. It's something we're looking into. I've gated to the wrong place more than enough times to understand why this would be a good thing. <br><br>:)</UL>
