A new event announcement was sent my way by Dahija:<BLOCKQUOTE>Attention all Luclin citizens: <br><br>On this past Sunday night, a trade fair was held in NK at the wooden bridge, hosted by the Order of the Midnight Sun guild members. Many attended, and due to the encouragement of the people of Luclin, Order of the Midnight Sun presents, KaranaFest: A Gathering at the Bridge. It is to be at the Wooden Bridge in NK rain or shine, 10pm EST to Midnight EST, to trade, drink, and to bring together the people who cannot attend the already established trade in the Tunnel on Saturday afternoons. <br><br>Please feel free to raid your bank(s), and bring all items, no matter how low level they are, for there were many newbies present on Sunday and many more are expected. Since it is difficult for all to bind in NK, dueling will be conducted at the Arena, a pleasant walk from the bridge, after most of the trading has been completed. <br><br>Thank you, and hope to see you all there, <br><br>Dahija<br>Order of the Midnight Sun<br>Warrior, Luclin</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Morgian sends the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings again my friends!<br><br>As some of you may remember a couple weeks ago a group of us participated in<br>a thread on the EQ Gameplay forum that discussed Verant putting up a<br>Role-play server.  The thread is locked now, but if you would like to engage<br>in reading a long but well done thread here's the link:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html</a><br><br>Abashi was kind enough to respond to the thread and shot the idea down, but<br>what he responded to was not what we were asking for so that generated<br>another thread where we posted exactly what we wanted.  Our thoughts are to<br>only ask for a server designated as being role-playing (much the same way as<br>they have done for the PvP servers except they would be no code additions or<br>deletions).  The players would do the rest.  We really don't think this is a<br>lot to ask for and we feel it can only have a positive affect of EQ.  I<br>won't go into the entire thread here, but if you wish to read the thread and<br>show your support then take the link below:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html</a><br><br>We're not asking for more skills, items, spells, or anything else that would<br>affect the game balance. Time and time again we've jumped from server to<br>server claiming it for role-playing but we've become to spread out and more<br>of the minority on all the servers then we ever were before.  All we want is<br>a clear cut home for role-players.  We really don't think that's a lot to<br>ask.<br><br>An in game poll is a suggestion we have also that would let Verant get an<br>idea of how many players would be interested.<br><br>Thanks again for your time and safe travels my friends.<br><br>Morgian Cessair</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon made quite a few posts this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the full scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064461.html"><b>More Rallos Zek Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is NO WAY AT ALL that this can be implemented! The gankers just die, then come back again and again. They get an item then either bag or bank it. There's no way at all to "outlaw" the practice.]</i></font> <br><br>You can start. Refuse to take them on plane runs. Spread their name across the server. Don't socialize with them. Refuse to trade with them. Turn them into social Pariahs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Secondly, you mention that the POD can only control one flag and that flag is already set for all Rallos players. Then PLEASE tell me why the POD is even there? He serves no purpose whatsoever.]</i></font> <br><br>You are correct, he serves no purpose on Rallos Zek. NPC spawns are not configured on a per-server basis. It wouldn't make much sense for us to maintain 34 different sets of spawn data to cover each server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You yourself know that programmers can do anything and everything with the code. So, the POD can be changed to control other flags.It's that simple.]</i></font> <br><br>It's not that simple. Sure, a programmer can do anything. However doing it in a reasonable amount of time without affecting anything else isn't always possible, nor in the best interest of the game. In this case, there is no "other flags". Creating "other flags" would require a pwipe. Creating "other flags" without a pwipe would require more time than is feasible.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064451.html"><b>How much do un-nerfed Pumice Stones go for?</b></a><br>I doubt that the change has been in long enough for a stable market to form. It's pretty likely that when we missed a few vendors the first time that we were trying to implement the change that people rushed out and bought tons of the things. In any case, I'm pretty sure that the value will be severely limited due to the fact that it is still a 5 charge item. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064452.html"><b>What's the scoop on today's Tuning Meeting?</b></a><br>Hasn't happened yet :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064446.html"><b>Karana Still Overpopulated</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any chance of getting another split to TT off Karana?]</i></font> <br><br>At this point that wouldn't be fruitful. We've already split them off a second time, leaving /movelog registration open for 24 hours, and only 169 accounts chose to move. It appears that everyone, or most everyone, on Karana at this point wants to be there. <br><br>If we were going to take another group, it would probably be from one of the other servers, but nothing along those lines is planned at present. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064423.html"><b>Monk Posts on Gameplay Board</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Good lord 17 monk posts on page 1?]</i></font> <br><br>That's interesting. For the past several months, monk posts haven't been out of the ordinary in number. It sounds as if this "drive" is being organized from an external source. I guess I'll take this opportunity to mention again that attempting to monopolize the front page with a specific issue will just lead to the posts being closed. <br><br>I haven't read any of the posts yet, but my guess is that they make note of specific issues relative to monks. Things such as "Thunderous Kick is too weak", "Flying kick should have some minimum damage", "Shiverback armor is low in AC", "Our Kunark armor isn't very good", etc. <br><br>While those might be good and accurate observations about some specific issues, stepping back and taking the entire class, even with its faults (which every class must have), leads to the inevitable conclusion that monks still rock despite their faults. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064442.html"><b>Monks Lose Power Post 50</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The gap, apparently, closes GREATLY.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, the gap closes. Monks go up. Warriors and Rogues go up faster. No one "loses" relative power. <br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How can you keep calling monks the best toe to toe fighters? Perhaps pre 51 this was true, as we had a huge bonus in skill over other classes. But now that you've made Warriors and Rogues *nearly* equal in skill to Monks AND given them triple attack and double backstab ... there is NO way monks are still the best toe to toe melee damage.]</i></font> <br><br>Backstab is not a "toe-to-toe" situation. Yes, monks still do more damage in a toe-to-toe situation over a given timeframe than the other melee classes. Not as much as they used to, but they still do more than the others given appropriate equipment. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064416.html"><b>Invis Bug?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was invis in CB throne room looking to see how full room was so that I would not start train. Since when can Orc Lego's see invis? I was standing there looking at them when one somehow saw me and attacked. I still had the "invis" icon on my screen and had just casted at steps to castle. Please explain ]</i></font><br><br>There's at least one thing that could have happened making it possible for a creature in there to see invis. Some creatures also have a chance, however miniscule, to see through invis regardless. <br><br>In any case, NPCs gaining or losing abilities that they had or didn't have in previous weeks is one of the things that can change in the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060259.html"><b>Wrongfully Suspended?</b></a><br>Though I can't speak to your specific issue, it's not at all unusual for suspensions or bannings to affect every account registered to a person or on the same credit card. This is particularly true if the suspended person logs on to the other account to contest the action. <br><br>For instance, if I have 4 accounts in my family, get suspended in one, then procede to log on to each of the others and contact a GM, they will all end up suspended. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I just have to laugh. In several years of running BBSes, every time someone tried to hack something or create multiple accounts or some stupid thing they got caught at, it was always "my little brother did it"]</i></font> <br><br>Hehe, you'd be surprised how unruly those "little brothers" are.</UL>

Catalyst sends word that <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo has been updated</a> over on EverLore.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>Ok I have been playing EQ for about a year now and I love the game, but I have noticed something that i find very mundain and that is the attacking of the characters, have you every seen a karate chop Batman .. add a sword and **POFF** you have an EQ character (exculding the Monk class).<br><br>So my question is is there any plans to introduce new weapon attacks for the characters, there is nothing I would rather do than as a vile creature is running from me than to hit a hot key and trust my sword into the creatures back or slash at him or any thing besides CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP "yawn" . Just an idea or thought I had while watching my character CHOP at his target... ( excluding some small special attacks from the rouge "backstab" monk "kick" "tiger punch" ect.. ) I hope you can understand what I am asking, it does not have to be more damage just differnt motion of the characters. Thanks for you time :) <br><br> Milo Says: <b><i><br>I sympathize with you, but I'm not aware that there are any plans to make character animation more diverse. I don't think that we have the manpower for that, any more than we have the manpower to create more character models of unique build than I am able to construct. Rick Schmitz is our only animator, and unfortunately, his plate is full of more crucial work.</b></i></UL>Thanks!

I was sent the following report by Aaeandar:<BLOCKQUOTE>The masses gathered in the confines of the Wizard Portal in the Greater Faydark, the Land of Tunare's beloved.  They gathered together to unify and take our the minions of Innoruuk, and if possible, Innoruuk himself.  Members from Hamunaptra, Pax Tharax, In Virtue, Sixteenth Notes, Iron Legions, Coveit Emptor, and Circle of the Unseen, and set out as the sunset in greater faydark.<br> <br>The masses stealthfully moved into position and prepared for the long insuing battle.  For what seemed like days the warriors slowly but surely began to eliminate Innoruuk's minions, building by dreaded building.  Only suffering minor casualties in the process.  Then it came time to pull the dark lord's Maestro of Rancor from his dark pulpit at the heart of his pipe organ.  <br> <br>The Evil best tried its hardest, but even it knew that it had met its match.  The victory was ours, and again, we had only suffered minor casualties in the process.  We cleared the path to the Rancor's chamber and set up the last camp until we would attempt the Dark Lord Innoruuk himself.  But, would he even show his face after the beating we had issued to his lower minors, and beloved Maestro?  Only time would tell.<br> <br>As the lower extremities of Innoruuk's plane of hate were gutted and destroyed, we began to to destroy the Ashenbone Drakes.  The Drakes would fall in quick order, and then it came time to see if the Dark Lord was there to face the onslaught of warrior bent on his very destruction.<br> <br>As we moved our way up to his chamber we destroyed the last of his minions only to find that the coward of a god did not even both to defend himself and his own home.  We rejoiced at the victory, all had been slain at our feet.  Rare items distributed, and crusted blood on our weapons.  Soon, we will return for the Dark Lord himself, and then it will be his day of reckoning.... soon.<br> <br>OOC - <br> <br>Once again I'd like to thank the following people for organizing this raid, Oppression did a fine job in keeping things organized.  Diggle and his brave band of monks did more than sacrifice themselves to pull the mobs safely and with excellent precision.  Although we did suffer some casualties and 2 near full group deaths, we pulled of the corpse recoveries without a hitch and didnt lose even a step in getting back on track.  We destroyed the entire static spawn with 2 hours to spare until the respawn, and (to say it quite appropriately) we OWNED the Maestro.  The raid itself took roughly 10 and a half hours to complete, and for a Plane Raid was an outstanding success considering it was the server's first raid on the Plane of Hate.  Admittedly we were a bit disappointed that Innoruuk wasnt up, but nonetheless it was a very enjoyable experience.<br>I would also like to ammend my previous post about the Nagafen Raid we had a few weeks back, and add that Iron Legions was also present for the raid.  My apologies to Ekelhaft who also did a fine job as the main and secondary assist in this raid.<br>All and all, I'd like to thank those that came, and I'd like to thank those who invited me to come along.  This was incredibly fun, and very well organized.<br> <br>- Aaeandar "Bard of Doom" Vie (Pax Tharax) 46th Level Bard<br> <br>ATTACHED -  Screenshots of the Maestro and the Ashenbone Drake<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/rancor.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/rancor2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for the report!

Here's the latest quotes from Gordon Wrinn that he posted on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063887.html"><b>Rallos Zek</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why wont you answer rallos?]</i></font> <br><br>I have, many times. It's just not the answer that people want to hear. We've no plans to change loot rules on Rallos at this time, nor do we plan on allowing any moves in regards to Rallos. I'm sorry, but there's really only so many ways that I can address this, and each time has lead to a flame-o-thon on the boards. I'd prefer to stay away from the threads for the time being. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You all put up alternate servers and are doing splits like crazy.]</i></font> <br><br>I've seen people recommend that we should put up another server with Rallos rules, sans item loot, and do a split, however the number of people playing on Rallos wouldn't make that an economically feasible course of action. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It was supposed to be the most real roleplay server. Now it has turned into an ebay-athon, and you allow the two new pvp servers to go coin only and stop the insane lack of roleplay which comes from a broken pvp system where a melee class is outclassed by ANY caster at ANY level over 12.]</i></font> <br><br>If it has turned into "naked item gank" server as so many say, does that mean that a majority of people are engaging in that behavior? If not, why is it that people who are against this don't socially isolate the people who are acting like this? I see posts here every day from people who want it one way or the other. I saw people on Vallon complaining as loudly for coin-only loot as people on Rallos. We made the change, and then people from Vallon complained just as loudly for item-loot. <br><br>As of now, we've switched two servers to coin-only loot, which is the majority of the PvP servers out there. While we do want to please the majority and believe that they should have some say, we need to keep in mind the wishes of the minority. The minority here is significant. <br><br>The 4 level limit on Rallos makes item-loot much more viable on that server than it was on the team servers with their 8 level limit. I recommend that if the majority on Rallos truly detests "naked ganking", that you come together as a community and outlaw the practice through social action.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063886.html"><b>More on Bows</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is a problem, but what about the rest of the post, and the blocking of arrows by PC's? This I believe is the largest concern, as I said the other was but a minor suggestion. Are there any reforms to deal with this problem being discussed? Or is this not an option / concern at this point? Any clairification is appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>Projectiles are designed to be blocked by obstacles. The same issue occurs with "bolt" type spells. So to answer your question, it is not something that we consider a problem, but rather the way it was designed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063884.html"><b>Question about the Item Dropbox</b></a><br>While the commands that we finally implement won't be as verbose as you request, we have looked at the requests of people and will probably make them more verbose than was originally announced. I'll refrain from commenting further on it until we've nailed down the technical issues and are ready to implement it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063880.html"><b>Why aren't there custom text colors?</b></a><br>It's a suggestion that's been made frequently, and is something that we'd love to do at some point, however the "problem" at hand keeps getting more and more complex. When EQ was first launched there were only a few different types of "messages" that were displayed in the Chat window. Since then we've added a lot of different things due to player request, such as loot messages, taunt messages, we're about to add item drop messages, NPCs are now doing different things, and the list keeps growing. <br><br>Our ability to implement color selections for all of those different types of messages in the client is wanning. It is however something that we will definitely keep in mind.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063878.html"><b>Melee Classes Getting Pets?!</b></a><br>As the melee classes as a whole are balanced, certainly in terms of damage output, a pet wouldn't be appropriate in this case.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063883.html"><b>/Consent Changes</b></a><br>As I mentioned in a few other messages, there were technical and other considerations involved in the decision to get rid of looting. Truth be told, given the short term indications following the change, the immense load off of the GMs due to corpse scaming, we probably don't want to go down the road again. <br><br>Even with seperate commands, many of the corpse scamming issues surrounded people being scamed in to giving consent in the first place. Those issues would still remain if we opened back up corpse looting. Though I do understand that it might be a difficult change for some to accept so soon after it's been made, experience has shown that the number of times players want others to loot their corpse rather than drag it is *very* small. So small in fact that it's not worth the risk to reenable it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063879.html"><b>"Play a Bard and see how bad they are!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am sick and tired of seeing that every gm in a zone is a DE necro, or a SK or somesort. Obviously they know that bards have a disadvantage and are not "good enough" to play]</i></font> <br><br>There are quite a few GMs who have bards as their GM character, but it really doesn't matter since the GMs don't play their characters. <br><br>That said, bards certainly aren't "bad". They are loved by groups which is right where their area of expertise is supposed to be. I have received word of a few songs that might be having problems right now, not working as intended, but those shortcomings are only ancillary to the entire scope of the bard.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050749-3.html"><b>PVP Thread</b></a><br>With the proliferation of posts like this, I thought I'd stop by and recommend that you rephrase your post in a new thread, sans insults, and I might take a stab at it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063568.html"><b>The VAK'ers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi only answers VAKs]</i></font> <br><br>Hmmm, several months ago the posts read, "Abashi only answers flames." I must be making progress. <br><br>It does disturb me to see that anyone who posts something positive here is labled a VAK, or even worse, accused of being "planted". Seriously, it doesn't even have to be a "positive" post, just one that's written in a courteous manner and they get flamed. It's so bad that I've received hundreds of emails that say something along the lines of, "I don't want to post this on gameplay and get flamed....but..." <br><br>But back to the subject, if you want to know what type of posts I look for, it's the courteous, well-written ones on subjects that I haven't addressed in a while. I also gravitate towards those *posters* who have always written in a courteous and respectful manner, even if they've been in disagreement. And of course, by the same token, I typically avoid posts by people who generally flame and only get courteous when they have an issue that is important to *them* that they need addressed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063808.html"><b>Mage Utility Improvement Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Proposal: summoned bags turn into permanent, non-weight reducing, NODROP bags upon camp/LD.]</i></font> <br><br>That's an interesting suggestion. I know that we'd have some technical issues with it, but they might not be insurmountable. I think that we'd just have to be certain that there is nothing to gain by going linkdead. <br><br>I really don't like the idea of injecting risk via out-of-game random chance either. I'll talk to the team about it. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063872.html"><b>Problem with Bows</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: One minor problem, and it is minor, but a slight decrease in delay times for bows globally would help to increase the use of bows as well, and add a whole new facet to gameplay without, in my opinion, unbalancing it.]</i></font> <br><br>We wouldn't be able to do an across-the-board lowering of bow delays due to the amount that it would increase damage output over a large time model. However, we are looking into negating the delay in the event that you are too close or too far away when you activate the bow. This would allow you to correct the situation and fire again immediatly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063875.html"><b>Belt of River Nerfed?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I was just finishing off a Spectre in Feerott and out of nowhere Roror started attacking me. I'm a Halfling cleric who has never hunted in Cazic Thule so I couldn't have messed up any factions. This Lizard can kill a well armored and fully buffed lvl 42 cleric in about 5 seconds. I thought about this and am wondering if he hates everyone after the patch how in the world are you supposed to do the quest? He should at least not be Kos to Haflings!]</i></font><br><br> The lizardmen outside Cazic Thule were all attached to the wrong faction (Faction "LizardMan"). They were supposed to be aligned with the "good" (relatively) lizards inside the temple. Due to the potential for unexpected death on the part of the players, warnings of this change was put in the patch message. Word has it that there's a way to get in the good graces of those who now attack.</UL>

I wanted to drop a quick note to let everyone know what's in store for the next week.  <br><br>Along with the two pages of the new comic section, I plan to try and catch up with the Featured Artwork section again by posting new artwork (from a large variety of artists) every day.

I am very proud to announce the unveiling of <a href="/features/comic">EverQuests</a>, a new exciting addition to the EQ community.  EverQuests is the first professionally penned adventure comic that takes place in Norrath and is available to view by the general public.<br><br><b>The Story</b><br>The EverQuest's "Official Player's Guide" contains the gruesome story of Miragul.  This tale relates how he traps himself inside a phylactery before transferring his soul inside his lich.  At the end the lich wanders aimlessly while over the centuries Miragul rages, a captive inside his device.<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/display.cgi?/features/comic/Everquests1.jpg"><img src="/features/comic/Everquests1_thumb.jpg" width=100 height=140  align="right" alt="Promotion Cover #1"></a><i>Our story starts with a small band of dissidents on the Frigid Plain.   They plan to help Miragul by freeing his soul so he can possess the lich and continue with his "endless exploration and discovery".  They achieve this.  <br><br>But, unknown to them, Miragul has gone insane and now wants to only have revenge on all of Norrath... <br><br>The head of the Wizard's Council sends an Erudite apprentice wizard to gather a small group of brave souls and one innocent cleric to undo the damage.  The cleric carries a new phylactery to house the soul of Miragul, should our heros manage to capture him.<br><br>And our story begins...</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The characters in this comic are famous NPCs that players can recognize and see regardless of the server they are playing on. We start out with Jys D'Bious, a Shadow Knight seller of spells, Eonis Mournunder, head Nacro gnome, and a troll basher named Oggrik.  They are the dissidents who let Miragul loose on the world.<br><br>EverQuests was created by <a href="mailto:kanli@aol.com">Barry Blair</a> and is drawn by <A HREF="http://www.barryblair.com/">Blair Grafix</A>.

Gordon addressed a few posts on the Gameplay Board today.  For your convience I have compiled them all in the following text:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410-3.html"><b>Roleplaying Server Thread</b></a><br>My understanding from reading the first post, and please let me know if I'm off base, is that you'd like us to set up a server, designated as "Roleplay", provide guidelines for playing on the server, with more GM/Guide support for dynamic content. Furthermore, though the guidelines would exist, there would be no enforcement of it. <br><br>Assuming that summation is close to what you are proposing, I'm pretty sure that your goals wouldn't be met in the long run. I think immediately people would go to the server with ideas about always staying in character. However, there are also people who play the game that would go there just to annoy the roleplayers. Then there would also be people who would go there due to having more GM/Guide support for dynamic content. In the end, without any enforcement, which most will agree cannot be applied consistantly, I think they would end up less in-character role-playing than other servers in the game. <br><br>Experience has shown that without enforcement in an environment such as this, the desired condition cannot be met. Take this board as an example. Flaming, insulting, swearing, threatening, and being a general anti-social troublemaker is not allowed on these boards per the Station Terms of Service. Attempts to ask those people who post in that fashion to keep it respectful and courteous further drives the overall environment towards the undesirable. Why? Because it's not enforced. We are going to enforce those rules in the near future, and it will either work, or the boards will be shut down. I think that an unenforced roleplay server would have the same problem. <br><br>But we can come up with consistant rules to enforce the boards, where we can't with a subjective concept such as roleplaying. I really like Har's definition of roleplaying, but can we expect any 10 people to enforce that definition in the same way?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063545-2.html"><b>"Reconsider Yellow Spell Damage Text"</b></a><br>There's obviously people here who both like and dislike the yellow color. Given that we introduced the yellow color, I don't think that we'll make everyone happy by changing it back, so we'll probably leave it as is. Perhaps if we had left it white/black it wouldn't be an issue, but the cats out of the bag :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063537.html"><b>"Why was Invisibility Nerfed, again?"</b></a><br>It seems that after nearly every patch someone feels that invisibility has been nerfed in duration. I know that I've had to make posts such as this after well over a dozen patches since I've been at Verant. <br><br>Just to be clear, invisibility was touched in this patch, aside from making it so that pets are no longer a valid target. In order to try to head off future claims of this nature, I *promise* that I will let you know if we ever touch invisibility's duration. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063739.html"><b>"As a Master of Magical Damage, why is a Ranger's channeling skill higher than mine?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rangers cap at 215, Wizards at 200. What is the vision behind this?]</i></font><br><br>As it turns out, we increased the channeling cap for pure casters in the last patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059195.html"><b>The Vision</b></a><br>I've answered dozens of questions entitled "what is the vision". Why is it that these keep coming up with people assuming that it is some tangible thing that can be put up on a website for all to view? Have you ever said to anyone, "That wasn't really what I had in mind..."? What you are saying is that it doesn't agree with your vision. <br><br>There is not some all-encompassing document that I can post somewhere for everyone to read, because it's an ever-growing and ever-changing concept. When something new comes up, we sit down and ask, "Is this what we had in mind?" A discussion follows at which time we decide whether or not it is. The vision is every email exchanged by every member of the dev team. It's the original design document for EverQuest (which will not be posted). It's the understanding that comes out of formal meetings in the conference room and the informal ones around the watercooler. It's every hope that everyone here had and has for EverQuest. <br><br>Do you want to know the vision? Read our web site, read our posts, play the game, and ask yourself honestly what we had in mind, or, ask me. I answer questions every day here that consist basically of, "Why did you do XXX?" The answer to that question is the vision. But please, don't expect me to be able to lay out anything and everything that everyone ever had in mind about everything to do with the game. It's not that simple. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I dislike playing a game where 95% of the important information is hidden from the consumer's eyes. ]</i></font><br><br>That 95% of that information is meant to be discovered by you while you play the game. If you choose to go to spoiler sites to find out as much as you can, that is your choice, but we won't be divulging the mystery of the game. We feel that mystery is important in the game and that no one should know with certainty everything that there is to know. That's our vision. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The only thing I know is what the VISION isn't. It isn't kiting, it isn't FD pulling, it isn't having good stuff, it isn't a lot of things. ]</i></font></UL>

I received the following from Vsove:<BLOCKQUOTE>Subject: Nektulos battle on Tallon Zek!<br><br>As the numbers of dead dark elves and humans increased in the East Commons, we knew something had to break. Something did, and when it did, war was declared.<br> <br>The Nektulos Forest was red and black with blood spilled from both sides. Allying themselves with the humans were the Gnomes, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings. The forces of the dark were pushed back to the bridge crossing the river. Soon, though, they mounted a savage counterattack and began pushing the forces of light back into the East Commons.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the server decided to go down at this point.<br><br>However, another battle will likely occur tonight, so if you want to experience the thrill of group PvP combat, come to Tallon Zek and join one of the sides.

The following message is now up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>July 20th, 3:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br><b>*Emergency Patch*</b><br><br>Due to the problems encountered in yesterday's patch, some additional data has been moved to the live servers today.  As part of this patch, three new changes are included:<br><br>- /Consent no longer gives other players permission to loot your corpse.  Instead, it only gives them the ability to drag your corpse using the /corpse command.  This change is due to player request stemming from number of customer service issues raised by some players who were using /consent as a way to steal the belongings of other players.  The change will eliminate those concerns and make the game more enjoyable for all of those involved.<br>- Yesterday's patch changed the way spell-damage messages are reported to the caster.  The new text was dark blue, making it hard to distinguish from the background when in HUD mode.  The text color has been changed to "yellow" due to player request.<br>- Duel messages will no longer be broadcast to the world unless the winner of the duel is over 10th level.  This should greatly reduce the number of duels with inappropriate names that have been occurring in the game.<br><br>We would like to apologize to everyone for the problems stemming from yesterday's patch, and let you know that we have taken steps to greatly reduce the possibility that something of that nature could happen in the future.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

The second attempt only netted 169 accounts wishing to move.

Intermediate items didn't, since most of those are components for the quests themselves. Most of the quests in the Plane of Sky have yet to be completed, so the number of people who saw increases might be pretty small.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063243.html"><b>Do I need to replace my Branch?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Your branch will remain in game as is  That decision has not been made yet.]</i></font> <br><br>It is true that this decision hasn't been made yet. We stopped the drops of the items pending the decision of what we are going to do with the existing ones, if anything. We'll probably discuss it Monday in the tuning meeting. <br><br>As you know, we seriously dislike making changes to items that already exist in game. However there are exceptions where we must for game balance. We're also considering the twig that everyone likes as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063280.html"><b>Loot Tables/Foraging Bug: Blackout</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Actually i doubt you've missed it as in haven't seen or heard of it, just that it appears you've made afternoon rounds for posting on the boards and I've seen no response to what is obviously a very heated issue. <br><br>Namely, the bug with the loot tables and foraging last night. The worst thing to do is to leave us in the dark about this. It has been okay for us to debate it this morning while I'm sure you had many other things going on but now that you have seen fit to post on other topics some sort of update would be really appreciated. <br><br>What is Verants current stance on what happened? We know there was a loot bug, we know it has happened before, we have heard rumors of the scope of this problem (large and disturbing), and heard rumors that no corrective action is planned by Verant to restore the state of the game prior to the "incident". Does/has Verant taken any action to correct this? What would really help is some solid facts, and those are only going to come from one person. You.]</i></font><br><br>Rolling back the clock is always a very sensitive issue. <br><br>The problem was found very quickly, limiting its impact in game. In addition, the loot that was turning up was loot that was otherwise available within the zone, not just random in nature. It's not like level 60 gear was showing up on large rats or anything, people actually had to be in a zone where the equipment was found normally. <br><br>In this case, after weighing additional downtime necessary to do a rollback, the inconvenience to those who earned items during that time, and the loss of experinece and play time, we've decided not to pursue it further. <br><br>We wish to extend our sincere apologies to everyone over the entire issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063082.html"><b>/Roleplay Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No Aixsponsa.
