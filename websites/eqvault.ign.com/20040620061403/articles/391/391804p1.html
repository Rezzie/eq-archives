<span class=dateline>February  21, 2000</span> - The next morning came and everyone met at the gates of Felwithe.  Alfadar was first to arrive at the pre-designated location, leaving Andriana to sleep last night and camping outside in the wilderness, confident that he would not be seen by anything.  His skills at blending in with his natural surroundings were excellent on their own, not to mention that being a Wood Elf only enhanced this ability.  Waking up at the crack of dawn, or slow creep of it through the veil of trees and fog overhead, came, Alfadar awoke and prepared himself.  Foraging for some food and hunting a few weak creatures, Alfadar got in some practice and woke his whole self up, mind and body, to the task before him.  Soon, Bosk and Cailet arrived with Geraine, still sleepy.
	&#8220;Hello!&#8221; shouted Alfadar as he came over a small hill on his way back to the meeting place.  &#8220;You must be Cailet,&#8221; he said as he came closer, eyeing her.  &#8220;Bosk has mentioned you a few times in our journeys together.&#8221;
	Cailet&#8217;s lips curved into a half grin, asking, &#8220;Only a few times?&#8221;
	Bosk looked to her and replied, &#8220;You try to sing, swing a sword, and avoid being beaten by three different creatures at once and still find time to list all the people you know with details.&#8221;  He grinned as she burst into a small fit of laughter.
	&#8220;Aye&#8230;I suppose you are right.&#8221;
	&#8220;Actually, he has spoken highly of you,&#8221; said a voice behind them.  They all turned to see Andriana heading to them with another High Elf behind her.  &#8220;One might even say he liked you a little more than just friends,&#8221; she smirked.  Cailet arched her eyebrow and looked to Bosk and tried to hide a blush and smile.  The High Elf behind her coughed, indicating his introduction should be made now.  Andriana sighed and grumbled, &#8220;This is Saldyar, nobleman and a Defender.&#8221;
	&#8220;Defender?&#8221; asked Cailet.
	&#8220;Yes, M&#8217;Lady,&#8221; said Saldyar, stepping forward to take Cailet&#8217;s hand and kiss it gently.  &#8220;I am a Defender.  It is a pleasure to meet you&#8230;Miss?&#8221;
	&#8220;Cailet,&#8221; she said, blushing again.  &#8220;Um&#8230;pardon my ignorance, but what is a Defender?  I mean&#8230;&#8221;
	Bosk jumped in before Saldyar could say anything, &#8220;He is a paladin, like Andriana.&#8221;  He turned to Saldyar and gave him a stern look and asked, &#8220;Now what are you doing here?&#8221;
	&#8220;Tynkale, the leader of the Defenders, assigned me to this quest,&#8221; he replied with an air of smugness.  He looked to everyone and added, &#8220;I suppose it is because he felt this adventure needed a leader and naturally thought of me.&#8221;
	&#8220;Ahem,&#8221; coughed Andriana.  &#8220;We don&#8217;t necessarily work with a leadership system.  We more or less confer with each other to decide where to go and what to do.&#8221;
	Saldyar sniffed and said, &#8220;I see.  Call me when you are ready to leave,&#8221; and turned to walk off a ways.
	Andriana was holding her temper in the best she could and looked to Alfadar.  &#8220;Now you see why I didn&#8217;t like him with us?&#8221;
	&#8220;Yes, a very&#8230;closed-minded person,&#8221; replied Alfadar.
	Cailet watched him walk off and said, &#8220;He was sort of charming, though.&#8221;
	Bosk was holding his temper the best he could this time and said, &#8220;Really&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t tell.&#8221;
	Cailet looked back and smiled at him, then whispered, &#8220;Not quite as charming as you though, my dear.&#8221;
	Geraine, who was just getting her bearings, giggled and blurted out, &#8220;Kiss him!&#8221;
	Alfadar and Andriana looked to them, causing Bosk and Cailet to blush a bright crimson.  Bosk turned the Geraine and could not help but grin from ear to ear.  &#8220;You little sneak, listening in on us again.&#8221;  He grabbed and threw her into his arms, swinging her around.  They both laughed together, causing everyone else to laugh with them.
	Geraine giggled and asked, &#8220;Well, you boyfriend girlfriend, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Cailet.  &#8220;Bosk, are we?&#8221;
	Bosk stopped spinning and looked at her a moment before setting Geraine down and giving Cailet a deep, passionate kiss, then said, &#8220;Does that answer your question.&#8221;  Cailet stood there in his arms for a moment, stunned by the display he just put on, then just nodded.  Bosk smiled at her and then looked to Andriana and Alfadar.  &#8220;How about you?  Satisfied with the answer?&#8221;
	&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Andriana, smiling brightly.
	&#8220;I guess I am too,&#8221; added Alfadar.
	&#8220;What is going on here?&#8221; asked Elventear as him and Revea walked up to the group.
	Everyone looked at each other and tried to contain their laughter.  &#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; Bosk finally said.  &#8220;Are we ready to head out?&#8221;
	&#8220;We are,&#8221; replied Revea.
	&#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Andriana.
	&#8220;Always,&#8221; said Alfadar.
	&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; murmured Cailet as she went through her things for the fifth time since they left the inn.
	&#8220;As am I,&#8221; stated Saldyar proudly.  &#8220;Lets head out now.&#8221;  He started to walk off.
	&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; asked Elventear.
	&#8220;We&#8217;ll fill you in en route,&#8221; said Alfadar.  &#8220;Lets go.&#8221;
	Alfadar took the lead, communicating back to the others about direction, his situation, and other pertinent information about traveling through clever markers and indicators that rangers use to mark dangerous territories, types or creatures in the area, etc.  He was strong enough to fight anything that would attack him, and being a ranger he was protected from the animals by Tunare, the Mother of All.
	He approached the Orc camp that was halfway between Kelethin, the city of the Wood Elves, and Crushbone, the land of the Orcs.  &#8220;These other Elves are holding the Orcish forces here at bay so I think we can get through without much trouble.&#8221;  He continued on to the entrance of Crushbone without fear of being ambushed.
	Andriana walked up to Bosk as they received a message from Alfadar and asked, &#8220;I still don&#8217;t see why we are going to Crushbone in the first place.&#8221;
	&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied Bosk, &#8220;the Orcs are known to have slaves digging around, creating more space for those brutes to live in.  We know they have Elves and Dwarves doing the work, but there is the possibility that they have Geraine parents.  They would have to have traveled through Lesser Faydark, Greater Faydark, and Butcher Block before getting to the dock near Kaladim.  In all that traveling there is a possibility, a very strong possibility that they met up with an Orc party and were captured.&#8221;
	&#8220;Even if you are right, they are probably dead by now,&#8221; replied Andriana, remembering the condition of the first slave he saw in Crushbone.
	&#8220;No&#8230;I don&#8217;t think so.  The Orcs are cruel and savage, but they also know that they need a work force to dig their holes, and we have a strong defense against them now so their slave supply is dwindling slightly.&#8221;
	&#8220;All right, all right.  We&#8217;ll do it your way.&#8221;
	Bosk smiled.  &#8220;We did it my way when we were lost in the woods as kids, remember?  We turned out all right then, we will turn out all right now.&#8221;
	&#8220;I hope Alfadar will be ok,&#8221; commented Cailet.  &#8220;That is a dangerous area.&#8221;
	Andriana slowed down a bit so Cailet can catch up and smiled at her, saying, &#8220;My brother is a tough Elf and a skilled fighter.  He will be quite all right with the Orcs that guard the outside of Crushbone.&#8221;
	&#8220;It is inside we have to worry about,&#8221; mentioned Elventear, looking around.
	&#8220;Wh&#8230;why?&#8221; asked Cailet.  &#8220;I have never been to deep inside&#8230;&#8221;
	Saldyar spoke for the first time since they had left.  &#8220;The Orcs use their stronger people guard the slaves and make them work.  Those of the slavers that show some talent in battle are promoted to Legionaries.&#8221;
	Cailet shuddered for a brief moment, thinking of an Orc stronger or better at fighting than a centurion.  &#8220;The legionaries&#8230;they are the best then?&#8221; she asked timidly.
	&#8220;Hardy,&#8221; replied Bosk, keeping his eyes forward.  &#8220;As far as weaponry skills and strength you have the emissaries, and then the royal guard, the select few who defend the Royal Chamber of Crush Castle.&#8221;
	Cailet gasped.  &#8220;My Goddess&#8230;I hope we don&#8217;t face them.&#8221;
	&#8220;If we are lucky,&#8221; said Andriana, &#8220;we won&#8217;t even have to see a legionnaire.  A slaver would be the strongest Orc we might encounter.&#8221;
	&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Cailet, moving a little closer to Bosk.
	At the entrance to the Clan Crushbone&#8217;s territory, Alfadar calmly surveyed the area.  The wind blew a little, causing the giant bond fires and flags to sway.  Alfadar kept a vigil eye out for any Orc centurions, knowing that they are most prominent around this area.
	&#8220;Hello there, friend!&#8221; shouted a person from behind him.
	Alfadar turned quickly, his Minotaur battle-axe in hand, and eyed a younger looking Wood Elf and a High Elf.  The markings on the Wood Elf&#8217;s leather armor denoted a ranger, which displeased him.  &#8220;Why are you shouting here?&#8221; he demanded.  &#8220;Haven&#8217;t the guild masters taught you anything?&#8221;
	&#8220;Sorry, I didn&#8217;t see any Orcs around here so I thought&#8230;&#8221;
	&#8220;You thought it was safe to talk freely,&#8221; interrupted Alfadar.  &#8220;The Orcs just suffered a massive blow here recently.  There is evidence of a battle between several centurions and Elves, mixed with a few Gnomes and Dwarves, but the centurions should be returning shortly, and they may have an oracle with them, so be ready for anything.&#8221;
	&#8220;Ok,&#8221; said the Wood Elf.  &#8220;By the way, my name is Toldan and my companion is called Oscruncher.&#8221;
	The High Elf stepped forward and bowed.  &#8220;Hello.&#8221;
	&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked Toldan.
	&#8220;Alfadar,&#8221; he replied.
	&#8220;Would you like to join our party?&#8221; asked Toldan.  &#8220;Wait&#8230;never mind.  I just noticed your rank insignia on your armor, which is by far greater than myself and Oscruncher&#8217;s, and there is&#8230;an aura about you&#8230;&#8221;
	&#8220;I follow the ways of Discord.&#8221;
	&#8220;Oh&#8230;I see,&#8221; said Toldan.
	&#8220;Come on, leave him,&#8221; said Oscruncher.  &#8220;The Orcs are weakened now so we should attack again.&#8221;
	&#8220;Die High Elf!&#8221; shouted an Orc from the entrance.  They turned to see three centurions, two pawns, and an oracle heading to them.
	&#8220;This is not good,&#8221; said Toldan.
	&#8220;Oscruncher, are you a wizard?&#8221; asked Alfadar as he readied himself for battle.
	&#8220;Yes&#8230;yes I am,&#8221; he replied.
	&#8220;Both of you stay behind me.  I will get their attention and keep it on me while you both hit them from afar.&#8221;  He clinched his hand on his axe and jumped into the middle of the Orcs, making sure to slash and taunt them all to hold and keep their attention.  He saved his spells for later, conserving what little mana he had at his disposal for when he really needed it.
	From where they stood, Toldan and Oscruncher only saw the Orcs and their fists raising and falling, a couple holding weapons.  Toldan looked to Oscruncher, then took his bow from his shoulder and nocked an arrow, aiming for the nearest centurion, saying &#8220;Focus on the closest centurion, Oscruncher,&#8221; before letting it go.
	Oscruncher nodded and focused on the same centurion, summoning a fire within him.  He let the shock of fire spell fly, hitting the Orc in the back, causing severe third degree burns and burning the arrow in his back away.  The Orc turned and started to head for them but Alfadar taunted him and slashed his left calf, slowing the Orc down greatly and angering him enough to turn on Alfadar again.  In this fashion, each Orc was defeated and laid at Alfadar&#8217;s feet, except for the oracle.  Alfadar was now weak, exhausted from the fight and the many wounds that were inflicted upon him, and the oracle still had a vast supply of mana to let loose upon the weakened Wood Elf.
	&#8220;Now I will kill you for what you have done here, Wood Elf,&#8221; growled the oracle as he surrounded himself with a fire, concentrating at his hands.
	Alfadar looked to Toldan and Oscruncher and nodded, motioning to the flames surrounding his own hands.  They both understood, and summoned their magic, Oscruncher a shock of fire spell and Toldan a flame lick spell, one he recently learned.  Toldan was new to magic all together and his body could not handle much mana, so the majority of his fights were with his sword and he saved his mana for healing himself, casting his flame lick spell only when necessary.  On Alfadar&#8217;s signal, all three cast their fiery attacks before the oracle could finish summoning his magic.  The force alone knocked the oracle on his back and the fire consumed his body within moments before dissipating, leaving a charred remains.
	Alfadar looked to Toldan and Oscruncher and smiled.  &#8220;Good&#8230;job,&#8221; he sputtered out.  He hobbled over to a nearby tree and sat down, resting to give him the strength to cast his healing spell.
	&#8220;Thank you for aiding us, Alfadar,&#8221; said Oscruncher.  &#8220;We are in your debt&#8221;
	&#8220;Yes, yes we are,&#8221; added Toldan.  &#8220;What can we do for you?&#8221;
	Alfadar chuckled and said, &#8220;Watch over me until I recover.&#8221;
	&#8220;We shall,&#8221; replied Oscruncher.
	Within a few minutes an Orc centurion flew past them, falling limp to the ground with several broken bones.  It feebly struggled to get up but an earth elementaling flew up to it and gave it one solid punch to the face, caving in the skull of the centurion.  Andriana ran up to the Orc and examined him.  &#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; she pronounced.  &#8220;But he does have a nice cloth veil if anyone wants it.&#8221;
	The others followed, replying they did not want the veil.  Cailet gasped as she saw the numerous bodies of Orcs, including the charred oracle&#8217;s body.  &#8220;Oh my!  What happened here?&#8221;
	&#8220;That would be my&#8230;our doing,&#8221; replied Alfadar, still sitting and leaning next to the tree, motioning to Toldan and Oscruncher.
	&#8220;You ok, brother?&#8221; asked Revea.
	&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; he said, standing up and focusing.  He body was washed in a blue light, closing some of his wounds.  This happened again two more times before he sat down again and rested.
	&#8220;Who are your friends?&#8221; asked Andriana.
	&#8220;Toldan!  Oscruncher!&#8221; shouted Cailet.  &#8220;How are you?&#8221;
	&#8220;You know them?&#8221; asked Bosk.
	&#8220;I have been with them a couple of times in the camps,&#8221; she said before running to meet them.
	&#8220;We are well, Cailet,&#8221; said Oscruncher.  &#8220;And yourself?&#8221;
	&#8220;I am doing good.,&#8221; she replied.  &#8220;We are going into Crushbone.&#8221;
	&#8220;Crushbone?  You might want to be careful, I heard that D&#8217;Vinn was out overseeing some of the Orc&#8217;s digs earlier today.&#8221;
	&#8220;Great, that is all we need,&#8221; mumbled Bosk.
	&#8220;You are not afraid of him, are you?&#8221; asked Saldyar in a superior voice.  &#8220;I, myself, am not afraid of that little&#8230;&#8221;
	&#8220;Saldyar,&#8221; interrupted Andriana, &#8220;are you stupid or just foolish?&#8221;
	Saldyar gave her a haughty look and said, &#8220;That Teir&#8217;Dal is always surrounded by the royal guards or the emissaries.  Without them I suspect he is nothing, just like all Teir&#8217;Dal are.&#8221;
	Cailet stared in disbelief.  &#8220;You mean there is a&#8230;a Dark Elf in there?&#8221;
	Bosk nodded.  &#8220;Ambassidor D&#8217;Vinn.  There is suspicion that he was sent here to try to form an alliance between the Orcs and Dark Elves.  He is very strong, some saying he is even stronger than Crush.&#8221;
	&#8220;And we are actually going to go in?&#8221; asked Cailet.
	&#8220;It is ok,&#8221; said Revea.  &#8220;We will protect you.&#8221;
	Toldan stepped forward and looked to everyone.  &#8220;We, Oscruncher and I that is, were wondering if we might be able to join you inside?  We are willing to help if possible, if only to pay back our debt to Alfadar for saving us.&#8221;
	&#8220;Oh please?&#8221; asked Cailet.
	Alfadar stood up and said, &#8220;They are good warriors.  I think they will do well with us.&#8221;
	&#8220;That is good enough for me,&#8221; said Andriana
	Revea smiled and said, &#8220;Me too.&#8221;
	&#8220;Can&#8217;t go against what the women want,&#8221; Elventear said jokingly.
	Saldyar shrugged and Bosk nodded, saying, &#8220;This might actually be good thing.  Cailet is much less experienced than us, but is almost right for them.  She can fight along side them and learn more than if she is with us.&#8221;
	Cailet looked to Bosk for a moment, a little sad.  &#8220;But&#8230;I wanted to be with you&#8230;&#8221;
	Bosk smiled and took her hands into his.  &#8220;You will be, but you will learn more if you fight with them.&#8221;
	Cailet pouted slightly, but said, &#8220;Ok.&#8221;  She walked over to Toldan and Oscruncher to be ready to aid them with her songs.
	&#8220;Now Alfadar, you can join us instead of having point,&#8221; said Bosk.  Once everyone was ready and able to travel safely, they progressed slowly to the entrance of Crushbone.
	&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; asked Cailet.  &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t they be here?&#8221;
	&#8220;Not necessarily here,&#8221; replied Saldyar, sword in hand and weary of his surroundings.  &#8220;The Orcs tend to keep their defenses in the second half of tunnel.&#8221;
	&#8220;Oh.  You mean like that?&#8221; she asked and pointed ahead to two legionaries, four centurions and two oracles.
	&#8220;INCOMING!&#8221; shouted Bosk.
	Saldyar jumped forward and ran to the lead legionnaire, calling out battle cries.  He was instantly surrounded by the horde of Orcs.
	&#8220;Stupid!&#8221; shouted Andriana and charged in after him, trying to save him.
Bosk looked to Cailet and shouted, &#8220;Sing Chords of Dissonance!&#8221;
	&#8220;But,&#8221; she started to protest.
	&#8220;Do it now!  Toldan, you and Oscruncher make sure they do NOT get to her!  We need her to keep the Orcs in a constant bubble of pain!&#8221;  Cailet hesitated a little, thinking, but looked at Bosk and saw that he knew what he was talking about and obeyed him, starting timidly at first and growing louder slowly.  Bosk turned to the horde of Orcs and cursed this turn of events.
	Alfadar joined the fray along with Revea&#8217;s new fire elementaling, which cast a shield of fire around itself, burning those Orcs near it.  Revea stood a distance back with Cailet and Oscruncher behind Toldan, casting their attack spells one after another as Toldan fired a volley of arrows into the crowd, doing his best to hit the Orcs, while Cailet was just within range of the Orcs so they will hear her song.
	Bosk sheathed his sword and pulled his lute off his shoulder and closed his eyes to calm himself.  &#8220;Uncontrolled anxiety is the root of a failed performance,&#8221; he remembered Sylia telling him once.  He opened his eyes and began to play his Hymn of Restoration, with brief interruptions to let his head fall back to let loose a large bellow.  With his carefully trained voice, he can send a loud sound pulse to hit a specific Orc of his choice, vibrating the Orcs bones to wrenching pain and sending him reeling for a moment.  He stood back and tried to get a handle on the situation from a far.
	Inside the mob, Saldyar fought hard, ignoring the wounds inflicted upon his body.  His style was very good for one of his level and his determination pressed him on beyond when others would back off.  He felt that he had to show his companions that he was the best they have and that they needed him.  
	Suddenly Alfadar was next to him, pushing a few Orcs off him and easing the slack off him, then there was a bright flash of light and one of the Orcs fell back, blinded.  Andriana slashed the Orc&#8217;s leg out from underneath him and shoved her sword into his chest, killing him, then took her place with Alfadar and Saldyar.
	&#8220;That was a very stupid thing you did Saldyar!&#8221; screamed Andriana, trying to hold off one of the oracles.  By this time the legionaries and two of the centurions were dead, leaving the oracles and the remaining centurions.
	&#8220;What do you mean?  We are winning!&#8221; he replied, agitated that his talents are not being appreciated.
	&#8220;We are a group, a team,&#8221; said Alfadar in a condescending tone.  &#8220;We do things together, not haphazardly.&#8221;
	&#8220;I was trying to eliminate a threat to us!&#8221; he replied as he finished off another centurion.  &#8220;If you can not handle that then maybe we should have a designated leader.&#8221;
	Bosk stood back as the Orcs fell and noticed a pawn turn the corner to see what the commotion was.  He saw the battle and turn to run for help, which scared Bosk.  He shouted, &#8220;Revea, send your elementaling after that pawn!&#8221; in a brief lapse in the Hymn.
	Revea looked to the pawn and focused on it then ordered the fire elementaling to attack it through a mental line they share.  The elementaling flew over and grabbed the Orc pawn, burning his flesh, then threw him against the wall.  A couple of snaps indicated that the impact broke a few bones, and the fire elementaling thrust itself upon the Orc, ending what little life the Orc had left and dragging the body out of sight before returning to the main battle.
	Within a few more minutes the battle was over and all eight Orcs lay dead at the feet of the Elves.  Elventear began to use every increment of mana he had to heal everyone that fought while Bosk played his Hymn to supplement everyone&#8217;s healing.
	Andriana glared at Saldyar and began to scold him.  &#8220;You have to wait for us!  Charging into a fight like that was suicide!&#8221;
	&#8220;I could have handled it!&#8221; Saldyar retorted.  &#8220;I could have laid my hands on myself to heal up during the fight.&#8221;
	&#8220;Lay hands?  That ability is for us to help others in need!  Not squander on ourselves!&#8221;
	Alfadar stepped in to try to keep the tempers down.  &#8220;If you had died, the Orcs would have turned on us and called for help.  We are lucky that none of them got away to do so.&#8221;
	&#8220;If Bosk had not seen that pawn, he might have warned the whole clan,&#8221; commented Revea.
	&#8220;The important thing is that everyone is, for the most part, all right,&#8221; said Bosk, pausing from his singing while still playing his lute.  &#8220;In the future, however, we should stick together, form a plan of attack, and execute it.&#8221;
	Saldyar was furious now.  &#8220;I was trying to clear a path so we can go in!  If you can not appreciate my abilities then&#8230;&#8221;
	&#8220;It is not your abilities,&#8221; said Elventear, stepping forward.  &#8220;It is your mind frame.  Your teachings mirror those of a cleric&#8217;s closely and from what I have seen, you have not learned them very well.&#8221;
	Saldyar turned and stalked off, his temper boiling inside him.  &#8220;They are scared.  We need to just raid this forsaken area and be done with these Orcs once and for all,&#8221; he thought to himself.
	Andriana took a deep breath and sighed.  &#8220;Let me go after him.  He is my responsibility.&#8221;
	Revea put her arm on Andriana&#8217;s shoulder and said, &#8220;Becareful in there.  It is dangerous.&#8221;
	Andriana smiled back and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;
	Bosk put his lute away and looked at the corpses on the ground.  &#8220;Free game.  Salvage what you can and get rid of the bodies so we are not discovered.&#8221;  He looked around for a few minutes, looking for something he might be able to use, when he noticed something bad.  &#8220;Um&#8230;guys?&#8221;
	&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked Alfadar.
	&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Toldan.
	&#8220;We have a problem,&#8221; stated Bosk as he looked around.  &#8220;Where is Geraine?&#8221;<div class=byline>-- <a href="mailto:alcasey@delta.is.tcu.edu">Bosk</A></div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
