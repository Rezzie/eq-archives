<span class=dateline>September 04, 1999</span> - &#8220;On many occasions, young thieves and soldiers have approached me, requesting to become a member of the Unseen. Each time, I am forced to turn them away, merely for having asked out in the open.&#8221; 
-From Shades of Gray, the memoirs of Modus Operandi 
A frozen instant, deep below the earth&#8217;s crust. A narrow room. Two occupants. 
The half-elven mercenary stood rigid in the moment of the kill, his rapier lodged firmly in the back of a dark elven head. The Teir&#8217;dal wizard still wore a fixed grin of evil glee, staring at a scorched pane of glass across the table from him. After a moment of utter quiet, the black-clad rogue yanked his glowing weapon free. His victim slumped, ever so slowly, from the small wooden seat. 
Dealing with dark elves was unpredictable, at best. Modus had known that the gnomish glase der&#8217;steel would save him one day, he just hadn&#8217;t expected this particular betrayal. He looked down at the corpse with distaste, watching the warmth fade from it as gouts of blood poured from the cranial puncture. This one had been a fairly reliable contact, and this surprise attack vexed him. As he cleaned Farewell, his razored rapier, he thought back. 
The meeting had begun as usual, with bantering and a sly trade of secrets. Modus was of partial elven blood, but a few key representatives from Neriak put aside their hatred for the pursuit of information. The mercenary often used this low, dark chamber in his hideout to deal with the Teir&#8217;dal and other subterranean denizens. It appeared to be nothing more than a simple room with a large table and a chair on either side. Guests from the Below entered from one side, and Modus entered from the other. The table went wall-to-wall, separating the parties in question. A simple space for covert meetings. 
But the very table itself was a careful illusion. A massive, magically transparent plane of glass separated the surface and skewed perspective from the chair of the guest. To the now-dead Teir&#8217;dal, it had seemed he was meeting with Operandi face-to-face. But inside Smoke and Mirrors, the den of the Unseen, nothing was ever as it seemed. 
In reality, Modus sat a good fifteen feet back behind the protective glass, which was now so charred that one could see it easily. The dark elf had been in smiling mid-sentence when a ball of liquid fire exploded forth from his hands and collided resoundingly with the glass. By that point however, the mercenary was already in motion, bounding through a concealed tunnel into the other half of the room. The wizard&#8217;s face never even got a chance to register his surprise before he was given the grim finale. 
The man who called himself Modus Operandi lived by one principle - never underestimate anything. His thoughts sank into a gray blur as his men swarmed into the small room from both sides of the table, muttering and cursing the Teir&#8217;dal who would betray the Unseen. The mercenary was oblivious, however. Things were changing. His group thrived on acting as the chaos factor in any situation; the hidden bootknife in an honorable duel. Thieves. Soldiers for hire. Informants. But the dark elves were acting&#8230; odd lately. Their open lust for power and hatred of the surface no longer seemed enough, and Modus was sure a scheme was brewing. 
But why would one of his own contacts want him dead? The mercenary was puzzled. If anything, he expected the Council of Houses to proposition a strike on the High Elves by the Unseen. Operandi would have refused, of course. In his youth, he heard that his mother was of high elven blood. His pale skin and clear blue eyes seemed to confirm it, despite his dark human hair. Regardless, none of this made sense. Unless perhaps, this was a single house, acting on its own agenda - which involved the death of the valuable mercenary. That would, in short, be bad. 
But which house? The dead mage now staining the stone floor would have been the best person to explain. Unfortunately, there was no other alternative. One did not give dark elves second chances, or try to hold them for questioning. A Teir&#8217;dal wizard might have a poison dart implanted in his tongue. Modus sat once more in the empty chair while his men cleared away the body, and began to think. 
A close halfling friend recently informed Modus of a young dark elf called &#8220;Catalyst.&#8221; The minor warrior had apparently never been given a name, but his parent House intended him to be central in the fall of the surface world somehow. Rumors from Neriak were like dancing shadows, one watched carefully, but to shine a light upon them would reveal nothing. 
Something had to be done. More information was required. On top of all this, the heroes were preparing for some action against Vashaar the Destroyer, a dark elven necromancer with no equal. If this &#8220;Catalyst&#8221; was linked, Modus had to know how. Even if he were involved in something else entirely, curiosity often saved the mercenary&#8217;s life. He tore his mind from the gray depths and snapped his fingers. In an instant, a young rogue named Dreyu appeared from the corridor. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve an assignment,&#8221; the thief stated, rather than asked. 
&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; Modus spat. &#8220;Gather two of the Ghosts who aren&#8217;t currently on watch or scouting. Take&#8230; Phaeda, she is Teir&#8217;dal. And another as well. Bibo, perhaps. Inform them that they are to descend to Neriak and find out which house lays claim to the one they call &#8216;Catalyst.&#8217; And, if they can, they are to discover the identity of the fool who paid for my death.&#8221; 
&#8220;But sir,&#8221; Dreyu said, &#8220;The Ghosts are our best spies. Should they be chasing a rumor when the Gnolls stir above, and those would-be heroes are up to something?&#8221; 
Modus looked right into Dreyu&#8217;s eyes and hissed, &#8220;The Unseen are just a rumor. Imagine if someone were to underestimate us? What would be their fate? Do you understand? Now go.&#8221; 
Dreyu nodded hastily, and seemed to agree. &#8220;You are talking to a cloud of dust, sir.&#8221; And he left. 
*          *          *
Handsome ebony features, blank and shadowed under a hood of dark silk. Catalyst, the Teir&#8217;dal. He stood on a parapet of his family House, overlooking the deadly purple beauty that is Neriak. He felt nothing. He had no hatred, and no love, for anyone. He cared not for the surface world or the darkness of his own people. His mind was filled with a somber melody, a funeral dirge. Despite perpetual self-questioning, he knew not why. 
&#8220;To me, Manse&#8217;toru,&#8221; a silky voice purred from behind. Manse&#8217;toru. The dark elven word for tool. Catalyst was not a noble, and he was not a commoner. He was a utility. He spun on his heel and faced the creature that was his master. 
She was indeed beautiful, much like a predator in motion is often stunning. Deadly grace. White hair tumbled down her shoulders, framing a smooth black face. And her eyes were twin crimson stars, but they knew no warmth or mercy. Aniyal, she was called. Aniyal, &#8216;pain walking&#8217;. 
&#8220;I have a task for you, my manse&#8217;toru. A very important mission which will ensure that House Zu&#8217;karr secures a dry place to revel in the storm of blood to come. This, my pet, might just convince me to give you &#8230;a name.&#8221; 
Inwardly, Catalyst laughed bitterly. He had been taunted with that very innuendo countless times, by House Nobles high and low. Dark Elves did not reward dutiful servants. The successful slave was allowed to continue living. The priestess in front of him moved closer, smiling like an erotic viper. Catalyst thought she had dark designs upon him that he would not enjoy. Still, her words took hold, in spite of his cynicism. If he could finally be named&#8230; 
&#8220;Have you nothing to say?&#8221; Aniyal queried, baiting him. &#8220;No matter. You need not speak. But forget one word of what I tell you now, and the Kaisa pain pits will seem a relief you would beg for.&#8221; She grabbed him by the neck and shoulder, and began to whisper into his ear. 
Catalyst listened, and his blood went cold. <div class=byline>-- Jordan Thomas </div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
