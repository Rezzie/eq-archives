Gordon created a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006781.html">new thread on the Gameplay Board</a> centering on weaposn with low-delay's.  Here's what he reported:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>About a month ago I mentioned that we were still investigating the issue with some low delay weapons that entered the game recently, among these are the mosscovered twig and the barbed scale whip. <br><br>After analyzing combat data concerning use of these weapons, it is apparent that a change must be made to maintain (or restore in this case) balance. While we have no problem with weapons of this delay, they should not have been placed as loot on anything other than deity or dragon level encounters. As it is, these weapons were dropping off of low to mid level encounters, leading to thousands of them in game. <br><br>The next time we patch items, the extreme low-delay one-handed weapons (a list of specific items to follow in the near future) will be modified so that they can only be equipped in the off-hand. This will address the balance issue present with these items.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Hot off the official boards, here's today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006763.html"><b>EQ Growing?</b></a><br>Of course EQ isn't growing as fast as it once was. It's the normal product life cycle. It is however still growing, adding more subscribers every month than it loses. <br><br>The lack of plans for newer servers for the foreseeable future has more to do with the fact that we've added so many, overcompensating for the crowding in January of this year, that we easily have 7 non-pvp servers that are underutilized at peak. It doesn't make sense to add new servers when the existing platform is underutilized. These things aren't cheap to buy or operate.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006752.html"><b>"Don't Have EQClient.ini!"</b></a><br>Start up EverQuest. EQClient.ini will then be created in your EverQuest directory.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006749.html"><b>Pet Issue</b></a><br>I'm pretty sure that I came back on this already, however, the cost is intentional.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006750.html"><b>A "No Experience" Switch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any chance an option could be put into place to forfeit your experience? You would still consume your share as normal, so you'd not be helping to powerleve groupmates, you just wouldn't advance while it's active.<br><br>Seriously, I'm having a hard time not advancing beyond my regular groupmates. I'm now a level and a half ahead of my wife, and several levels ahead of my brother. I'd like to continue grouping with them, but not advance until they catch up.]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting suggestion. I don't personally see a problem with it as long as the experience that you would have gotten isn't redistributed. Since that's in line with your suggestion, I'll talk to the guys about it. However this might be a situation where we'd have trouble justifying the time it would take to implement something of that nature. I wonder how many people out there would like to turn off experience gain to keep from out-leveling groupmates?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006741.html"><b>Hybrids & Items</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Until then, I will assume it's no harder than going through everyone's inventory and changing the stats on an item.]</i></font> <br><br>Modifying stats on an item does not require going through everyone's inventory. It's a change to one database that every character-file references when determining the contents of that inventory. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: EXPLAIN WHY you cannot modify it. I don't mean the standard "Not subject to post-production change".]</i></font> <br><br>Though the technical issues behind any modification of experience curves are not at all negligible and would require man-weeks, to say that we "cannot" is far less precise than to say that we "will not". We're developers, we can do anything given enough manpower. Whether "anything" is something that is needed for the continued prosperity of the game and in line with our designs for it is another matter. We will not change experience curves because frankly, it's been this way for nearly a year and a half, and people are advancing in spite of it. It *works* as it is. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006694.html"><b>"The End is Near Verant!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Same thing is Happening to Eq now. It only takes a matter of time until someone makes a program that can dupe and copy images. It has been working for i would say atleast a month or 2. It has just now been confirmed due to the numbers of people who aquired this program hack. I dont know what verant is gonna do, or what they can for that matter.   There is a version of ShowEq on linux that Verant cant detect, and now this. ]</i></font><br><br>There isn't any third-party program that allows people to dupe. Character data is stored server-side, so only actions taken within game can affect it. ShowEQ is a packet-sniffer, and entirely passive program that just reads data. Sending modified data back to the server would be detected instantly. <br><br>That said there have been actions that one could take in game to cause a dupe, but all known instances of this problem have been repaired. Furthermore, with the level of logging that we have, and have had for several months now, we can detect both past and new dupes and take action swiftly. We've banned over 50 accounts since Thursday of last week and are still in the process of analyzing the data. For these reasons, these problems really do not represent a threat to the economic health of EverQuest. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006705.html"><b>Using ShowEQ to Target Players in PvP?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Its common knowledge that some of the pks on Gankos are using some sort of 3rd party program to find players. Its quite simple. They use a packet sniffer such as ShowEq to find someone around their level as soon as they zone in then proceed directly to that spot.]</i></font> <br><br>There's not really much that can be done that can't be undone by people who put their mind to it. Even if we further encrypt the data stream, the client still has to know how to decipher that information. Since we don't control the client machine, it's only a matter of time until that information can be deciphered by a third party program.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006659.html"><b>"Drop the experience penalty on Hybrid classes!"</b></a><br>As I've mentioned before, the experience system is not open to post-production modification. I'm sorry but the issue is closed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001188-3.html"><b>Clerics In General</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: At some point in time Gordon informed the Cleric community that if they were to find something that could be done to make Clerics more fun, yet wouldn't upset game balance, that he would love to hear it.]</i></font> <br><br>Clerics fulfill their intended role in game quite well at the moment. Like any other class, I'm sure that things could be done to make them *more* fun, but the vast majority would probably consider something along the lines of what you propose to be "useless" in nature as it really doesn't affect their ability to fulfill their role. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006593.html"><b>Jaded Coffins</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hi, I play on Vallon Zek. Due to obvious reasons, almost all humans and gnomes are our server are KOS in Neriak. Neriak being the only reasonable place you can purchase Jade coffins, this presents a problem. It isn't fair to force one team to use mules while another can easily acquire an item. There is no reason that Jade coffins can't be sold in another city as well as Neriak. Please add them elsewhere unless you intend for us to use mules for RP reasons.]</i></font> <br><br>Spell components are purposely not available everywhere. I realize that this presents some unique challenges on the PvP servers, however EverQuest is an will remain primarily PvE. The addition of PvP will in most cases not lead to changes that affect PvE if it can be avoided. This is such a case where it can be. <br><br>I imagine that a sufficiently talented gnome or human can get in to get the items you require.</UL>

From Catalyst:<BLOCKQUOTE>We've posted a brand <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">new issue of Ask Milo</a> today here at Everlore; your home for all things EverQuest. This week Milo offers up a little rant and a link to a well written editorial on the English language, his remarks also include what tools Verant uses to develop content in EQ, commenting about another personal threat, plus his usual plethora of responses. Here's a snip from the page.     <Blockquote>    I have recently decided that I am a freaking genius. I am at least 1000 times smarter than anyone around me, and consistently     amaze myself with incredible feats of intellectuel prowess.<br> <br>    My question for you is, how do I get the word out? I try telling people that I'm a freaking genius, but they just don't seem to get it.     (no surprise there!)<br> <br>    I'm asking you because you're obviously just like me, in terms of brain power anyway. I'm not black and I don't have a nice             Porsche.

Gordon wandered the boards a bit today and responded to a few topics of interest on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006477.html"><b>Dragons</b></a><br>The dragons aren't KOS to everyone. <br><br>Aside from that, how is having a dragon wandering around an area where level 30 people hang out any different from having Griffins and Hill Giants in areas where low level folk hang out? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006383.html"><b>Officials Forums Not Moderated Enough</b></a><br>With over 400 new threads per day (average), and considering that the number of threads seems to be directly proportional to the number of posts I make, I doubt that it would be possible to add enough people to be sure that *everyone's* posts are addressed. As it is, I'd say that given enough time, everyone's *issues* are addressed sooner or later.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006387.html"><b>Warriors</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors are defined by their equipment. Hybrids have spells to compensate. Religion has nothing to do with it. There are supposed to be new items appearing that are tied to different gods, maybe this will change things slightly. Warriors, however, will always have the best weapons and armor overall.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd say that Sparkius' post (above) best explains the situation. Warriors are balanced by their skills and equipment. Hybrids are balanced by their skills, equipment, and spells. With the addition of spells, the added abilities have to come from somewhere, and leaving the sacrifice to skills and equipment. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006381.html"><b>Responding to Insult Accusation</b></a><br>Bottom-feeding is going into an area that you've out-classed and killing things solely for the loot they drop. A level 40 person in Blackburrow, killing off elite gnolls is bottom-feeding. Level 50+ people going into Najena to try and get Rubicite are bottom-feeding. <br><br>I'm sorry that the term offended you. If you can present a term that confers the same meaning but is not offensive, please present it, and I'll use it if it applies.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005929.html"><b>"Duping Does Exist"</b></a><br>We're aware of your concerns and are investigating the issues you've brought forward. We did have a bug that was present for a few weeks (corrected now), but luckily with the enhanced logging that we implemented several months ago, we have sufficient data to track down the issues and act accordingly. We banned about 40 accounts over Thursday and Friday and are still backtracking the data to its source. I expect that these actions will continue over the next week or so.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005299.html"><b>Class Balance</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I do not see how you can say the balance != equality]</i></font><br> <br>See the FAQ :)  It describes in detail the differneces between equality and balance. <br><br>Balance is not a matter of pure offensive power, nor is it one of soloability, which ties more closely to versatility than power. </UL>

Brad took part in a forum discussion on the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006359.html">thread located on the Gameplay Board</a>.  The topic centers on the upcoming second EQ expansion:<UL>Enough with expansions to this game. If it's not clear already that the limits of this game have already been pushed, then you must be blind. How often has a suggestion been met with "We can't do this because the engine won't allow it". Face it, there is enough "wrong" with EQ that fixing it may well warrant an entire redesign of the game itself. Instead of wasting development time and resources on an expansion that really won't fix much if anything, why not devote yourselves to a sequel that will address issues within the game that cannot be resolved due to limitations in the game engine, or changes to player data (which has been said won't happen since it would possibly cause problems you can't fix). Basiclly we don't need more of the same, we need something entirely new, but with a familiar background.<br><br>Yoshua Gilbert<br><br><b><i>Who said we can't do both?<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>Here's post #2 in this thread:<UL><i>Lana, the expansions aren't meant to be sequels. They aren't meant to radically change the game, or fix any fundamental problems.<br><br>They're supposed to EXPAND upon what EQ is. <br><br>Velious will give the players MORE EverQuest, and that's what a large percentage of them want. Kunark sold EXTREMELY well. And if we do another expansion after Velious, there will be even more EverQuest.<br><br>Sometimes changes, as you said, are just not possible given the engine we have, and sometimes they might be possible but either a. we don't think they should be changed or b. we think there might be better ways to approach it in the future but believe it would be foolish to make major changes with an extremely popular product that, overall, works fine.<br><br>I think future technologies and engines will be more flexible, but they'll still have limitations. And we'll still not want to fundamentally change a popular and successful game.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

You can zone into the "preferred" entrance to the Hole and get a necro to summon your corpse. <br><br>As for why it's like this, that is just how the Hole is designed, and your death is the price of the knowledge that there might be a better way to go about what you are trying. Many things in EverQuest have to be learned, and are likely to cause death until they are. You should enter new areas cautiously until you learn how general rules and physics apply there. <br><br>Falling into an instant death situation is really no different than turning a corner and finding an NPC against which you have no chance given your current group makeup. Things of this nature need to be discovered and learned. <br><br>When the Hole first opened, we did put a short, somewhat vague, message in the patch message, since jumping in the Hole previously teleported people out to Toxxulia. The message was "GMs will not recover corpses for people who jump, fall, or levitate into the Hole". <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006179.html"><b>Bracer of Vajeen: Why can't Halflings wear it?</b></a><br>I'm not sure about this particular item, however if halflings were accidently excluded, we'll see about getting them put back on.

There have been many events that have taken place as stories to be witnessed and participated in. There have also been events where "killing something" has only been a very minor part of the event, rather than the central focus. Of course, we've always had the problem of getting people to refrain from killing the story-tellers, but we've taken steps to prevent that. Read below. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Who are the people in the game who can always kill something regardless of lvl? The lvl 50+s. So when you make a GM event and have most of the Mobs be around lvl 35, the people who are gonna kill them are 50+s.]</i></font> <br><br>The majority of events deal with actor npcs (npcs played by gms) rather than spawned NPCs (npcs that are still under the control of the servers). We've implemented the ability for the GMs to place a maximum level on who may attack them. That solves the majority of the problems that you cite. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As for risk vs. Reward, these lvl 55s have NO risk killing lvl 30 mobs, and are getting all this ph4+ l3w+.]</i></font> <br><br>Finally, I should mention that actor npcs hardly ever carry "phat lewt". We abolished that practice some months ago in order to avoid having the reward go whomever could kill the actor first.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006183.html"><b>"Ack! Too many spell book pages!"</b></a><br>Actually we're implementing a command that will let you flip to a specific page of your spell book.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005599.html"><b>Howling Stones & Dungeons</b></a><br>When dungeons or new areas are designed, they have to be implemented as if they always existed. As such, it's possible that the quest would "require" some bottom feeding by people who have already out-classed the dungeon where the quest components are located. However, someone who is in the process of building their character could very well happen across the components during normal adventuring.</UL>

Gordon kept the posts coming today on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the coverage of today's posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006053.html"><b>"Bring Down the Server and Fix This!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I can't wait a week, as an enchanter I need to see when my Mez line of spells is resisted I got killed by wizards cuz someone in my group rooted some and I thought they were mezed, I can still mez with flux line of spells and remez but then it drains some cleric mana...]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be appropriate of us to bring down the servers for a text-color issue. We'll get it fixed up next week, and I apologize for the difficulty that you'll have until then.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006058.html"><b>Blacksmithing Broken?</b></a><br>Hmmm, interesting. I'll forward this to Testing and the designer who's working on this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006063.html"><b>Risk Vs. Reward</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now, I know Abashi will disagree with my opinion, but this suggests to me that Verant's calculation of risk vs reward is slightly out of whack.]</i></font> <br><br>How so? Some people prefer the game to be the same (cf. predictable) all of the time, others would get excited at the prospect of something different happening. I think that there are more people of the second type. <br><br>If I find a quote saying: <br><br>"Here's a general hint, when some "role-playing" sort of text scrolls across your screen from somewhere, and you're deep in the dungeon recuperating from a bad fight, heal up quick, because something fun, exciting, and different is about to happen." <br><br>...would that suggest that our calculation of risk vs reward was in line? <br><br>People have differing ideas of what constitutes risk, and what a reasonable reward for that risk is. This guy had two deaths, so he's upset. Some other might have two deaths and be happy for the reward of even being able to participate, as most haven't had that opportunity. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006064.html"><b>Inconsistant Logic?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Be consistant in your logic and put paladin and sk AC on Kunark armor where it belongs. Half way inbetween cleric and warrior. As it is on quest armor as it is on Plane armor.]</i></font> <br><br>Our logic is consistant. Warriors have the best armor. Everyone else's armor is lesser. Clerics are a plate wearing class. Their AC cannot be the same as warriors due to the fact that warriors have the best armor, therefore their's is as strong as hybrids. <br><br>I think that your misconception is that "Paly/SK armor is as weak as cleric armor", where in truth, "Cleric armor is as strong as Paly/SK armor". There's a subtle difference in those two statements. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006052.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why must Roleplayers be Anonymous?<br><br>Personally, I think anonymity hinders roleplaying. It forces you to have OOC discussions about your class and level. I (and many others I have met) would use the /roleplay flag to indicate my preference for roleplaying if it did not hide my class and level.

You can see it when you read most of the threads here on the board, and espicially so when reading the discussion threads thrown up over the past day or two. <br><br>It used to be very easy to find posts in need of a reply. It was easy to go through and toss out post after post on the basis of it being flame-ridden, insulting, or generally obnoxious. Now, it's much more difficult. There's too much worthy content here to comment on :)<br><br>I'm glad to see that the board changes are working out so well, and apologize if your post goes unanswered amongst the plethora of good content here these days.

Then later he said "we're working on it" and now months later its still not fixed!]</i></font> <br><br>Darkmatter, <br><br>What Brad promised is that he understood what the claim was and that we'd look into it. At no point have we agreed that there is a problem. The screenshots that were posted only show that the when the rain turns off, the fog moves out past the max clipping plane for an instant, then back in. This isn't indicative of there being any problem with the way that the plane works. Many zones have clips that are determined by the area. For instance, Toxxulia Forrest has a max clipping plane that is pretty close because we wanted the zone to appear eerie. <br><br>We're still looking into the issue, but it's not the highest of priorities at this time. The most likely "fix" will be for us to make it so that the plane doesn't extend beyond max when the rain turns off. The net result of this fix is basically nothing, which is why it's not a high priority at the moment. We have already confirmed that the min/max clipping plane boundaries are indeed set to the appropriate limits.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006034.html"><b>Item Enscriptions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is there a way we can inscribe lore items with sayings? like "Happy Birthday?"

Given that they feel that they *need* a particular item, they feel that they are then *forced* to camp it until they get it. <br><br>Your example in this case would extend "Camp till I get it" times, upsetting those who decide that they *need* the item and are going to do whatever they have to until they get it.

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon started a sub topic for the recent debate he began on the Gameplay Board.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005902.html">the post he made</a>:<UL><I>I've noticed that many of the responses to the thread "why camp" still suggest randomizing loot, beyond that which is present in Kunark. Certainly in Kunark, we've been trying contextual randomness (randomness that makes sense in the environment) on good loot, while leaving the best loot on standard "boss" NPCs. We've been fairly happy with the results, as it allows the casual player a good chance to pick up loot that will work for their class without "requiring" them to camp.<br><br>Still, many continue to suggest that we further randomize loot. I'd like to map out an example that shows why this isn't always the best answer. I think that the biggest misconception that I see here in regards to random loot is that the items will be more available. This isn't the case, as we still need to control the rate at which items enter the world. Randomizing loot isn't going to cause this rate to increase. <br><br>Let's say that CoolItem has a 20% chance to drop off of BossFrog in Lower Guk, who spawns 100% of the time on a 20 minute timer. This means that in two hours (six spawns, assuming he were killed instantly after spawning, which is close enough to the case), the frog would have just under a 74% chance of dropping CoolItem at least once. A group choosing to camp BossFrog would have a pretty good chance of getting 1 item in two hours.<br><br>Now, lets say that it was random. We can't increase the overall rate that CoolItem enters the world. So lets say that we give 20 frogs (still on a 20 minute timer) a 1% chance of dropping the item. Anyone care to guess how many of *these* frogs you have to kill to have the same 74% chance of getting the item? 135. Assuming the dungeon was completely camped, and that you could only kill one frog every 20 minutes, it would take 45 hours to have a 74% chance of getting the item. Suppose the dungeon isn't that crowded and you can take a whole room with 4 frogs in it every 20 minutes, it would still take 135 frogs to get that 74% chance, taking over 11 hours. The single-spawn 20% drop frog would have a 67% chance of dropping at least 6 during that time.<br><br>This same logic follows for suggestions that have the creature spawn in any number of random locations. If we have 20 places that BossFrog spawns, on a 1% spawn, and give him a 100% chance of dropping the item, we're still at 135 Frogs to get that 74% chance of him spawning. <br><br>As you can see, the level of randomness that some people are suggesting would create more frustration than people currently cite. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

I've received many reports that people using the new Detonator drivers are experiencing major problems when playing EQ.  It might be advisable to hold off loading these drivers on your system until the problem is found and fixed.

I just got this in the mail from Michael:<UL>Hello,<br> <br>Apparently there is a problem with the logins.  People who have 14 character passwords cannot log into everquest. The login process now only allows a max of 13 characters for passwords now.  Please post this on your site to help get the word out. I haven't heard any information from verant on this in the patch message, nor do I believe that there was an announcement.</UL><b>Update:</b> Gordon just responded to this problem on the boards:<UL><I>The original EQMain.dll that we patched today limited the max password size.

More posts to report tonight that Gordon made on the Gameplay Board today:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005762.html"><b>Multiple Copies of Zones</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This would be great, end camping, end reserve dates for planes, and the play nice rules would cease cause there would be nothin to complain about.]</i></font> <br><br>It would only really "end camping" to the extent that "giving everyone their own NPC to camp" ends camping. It might end lists, but it wouldn't really end camping. It would have the effect of blowing up the game economy. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why again can't Verant make it so that there are multiple copies of a zone?]</i></font> <br><br>We "can't" due to the server load that maintaining a dynamically generated zones would require. There would also be problems for people who wanted to "meet up" in a dungeon, as they would have a hard time getting in the same copy. <br><br>It is, however, closer to the point that we "won't", due to its overall impact upon the game. Everyone exists in the same world, and it is that world that we have to manage. Multiple copies of zones would cause the world to dynamically fluctuate in size and content making it impossible to manage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005760.html"><b>Particle Graphic Changed?</b></a><br>That's strange. I've also never seen any effects while it [particle effects] was set to off. If you have any further info, I'd be happy to look into it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005739.html"><b>Request From a Charity Buffer</b></a><br>That's a good thought. I'll mention it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005755.html"><b>Two Weapons and a Shield?</b></a><br>You aren't dual-wielding with the weapon in the ranged slot, it just shows up when you put it in. It's the same thing that causes a bow to magically appear when shooting an arrow. The character using the bow won't switch back to melee weapons until he's in melee range and initiates an attack.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005727.html"><b>Character Missing</b></a><br>There was a bug that allowed this to happen at one time under very special circumstances, but that was corrected 6 or 7 months ago. Let me ask, were you moved from one of the other servers to Druzzil?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005452.html"><b>Trolls & Ogres</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what I am proposing is, that Trolls have a larger set of racial abilities and hence Ogres are not in balance. Especially when regen is factored in, which makes soloing more practical.]</i></font> <br><br>As other people have mentioned here, ogres also cannot be stunned from the front. Strength and stamina is also significantly higher than in trolls. Troll stats are more in line with the barbarian in that regard. Finally, it's fairly well known that trolls require more experience to level than ogres. As mentioned in the FAQ, though differing experience requirements can't be traded directly for primary balance components, they do help buffer things such as racial abilities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005479.html"><b>Magicians Pets Too Powerful?</b></a><br>I agree that pets are a bit too powerful at level 50, however since we've reduced their power at least 3 times since release, we're a little apprehensive about doing so further. Instead we reduced the amount of the gain in power from 50 to 60 for those pets, both magician and necro. At 60th level, their power is about right where they should be for that level. <br><br>One thing that I do want to note here is that though the pets are a bit too powerful at 50th, it doesn't create a "balance" issue in the greater sense of the word. The power of those pets does not invalidate the need for other classes in the group. For instance, you never see someone ooc, "group looking for tank or mage/necro with pet for Sebilis run". There's also issues in the game that often make pets more dangerous to have than not. These issues serve to balance the pets, though they are powerful in one-on-one combat. Players on the PvP servers will note that their pets do less damage in PvP combat. This is for the reason just mentioned.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005576-2.html"><b>Monks and Parry Skill</b></a><br>Yes, you are correct, monks don't parry. I was just rattling off defensive skills and slipped that one in accidentally.</UL>
