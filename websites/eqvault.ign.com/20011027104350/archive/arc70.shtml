Gordon cleared up a few rumors about the eqclient.ini file on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004497.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Abashi himself posted instructions on how to edit it the eqclient.ini manually via Notepad when the new colors went into effect with the latest patch. There's something better out there, though.<br>Some nice people have gone out of their way to create a program that makes the .ini file easier to edit. You just click on the different types of text messages to edit their colors in the game, or change the default run/walk mode, HUD view or full screen, even change background colors. (That last one I didn't even know could be done.)<br><br>My question is, does Verant consider this to be a 3rd-party program that can result in banning of players using it? Since all it does is make it easier to make the same changes that Verant has given us instruction on, and does not affect the actual gameplay in any way, I would think there is no problem with it. Just wanna hear it from the horse's mouth, though. :)<br><br><b><I>No, we wouldn't consider use of EQCLIENT.INI editors as cheating. They are just fancy text editors :) I should probably mention that none of them are, however, officially licensed or endorced by Verant/SOE, and that any use of them is at your own risk. Though I'm sure that the vast majority of people would never do this, with the ease of implementing password-stealing code into a 3rd party program, I'd recommend that you be certain of your source. <br><br>-Gordon </b></i></UL>

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004396.html">new thread</a> was started by Verant's Gordon Wrinn this Sunday centering on the issue of PvP Teams.  Here's the entire post from the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Hello,<br><br>I posted this in another thread but it seems to warrant its own.<br><br>The biggest difficulty in regards to PvP in EverQuest is that EverQuest is, and will remain, a primarily PvE (Player versus Environment) game. The addition of PvP to the game should not change the basic fundemental mechanics of EverQuest. PvP in EverQuest has to result in "EverQuest with PvP" rather than "PvP EverQuest", if you get my point. <br><br>One of the largest issues on the PvP Teams servers is the subject of cross-teaming. Players of different teams get together for battles. Due to the PvE focus of the game, this has to be allowed for sake of game balance. Though some have suggested that cross-teaming, either in groups or guilds, not be allowed, it's something that will need to remain for the PvE game.<br><br>The problem comes in when cross-teaming is applied to PvP. Cross-teaming creates a situation that is often referred to as the "invulnarable healer" scenario. Basically, one group of PCs (Team A) attack a group of people on Team B, while supported by a healer from Team B. In this fashion, you have a situation where a member of one team is taking an active role in the deaths of members of their own team.<br><br>There is another "invulnarable healer" scenario that is more common and often just as bad as the cross-teaming scenario. This one revolves around a group of players from Team A attacking a group from Team B, while supported by a healer/buffer who is far superior in level to anyone from Team A or Team B. For example, a group of level ~20 trolls go on a killing spree in Greater Faydark, while supported by a level 50 healer/buffer. The problem in this case is that someone out-of-range is directly contributing to the deaths of players below their range.<br><br>On Friday, I spoke with one of the programmers about possible solutions for the PvP Teams servers, assuming that people in general believe these issues to be a problem. Suffice it to say that there is no easy solution. Each one has its disadvantages and "loopholes". For an example of some of the solutions:<br><br>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<br>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<br>3. Combination of 1 & 2.<br>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1 on that basis, rather than on cross-teaming.<br><br>The problem with all of these solutions is that they have an undeniable impact upon the PvE aspect of the game. <br><br>The final and best idea that we were able to come up with allows things to continue as they are now in regards to PvE, and only places restrictions on the basis of PvP. In this idea, any player who has taken damage from another player would not be able to be healed/buffed/receive any beneficial spells from anyone who wasn't on their own team or in the +/- 8 level range for a given amount of time (a few minutes), or until they zoned. <br><br>In the cross-teaming "invulnarable healer" scenario, the person from Team B would be able to support people from Team A for PvE engagements, however once a member of Team A took damage from another team, they would not be able to receive support from anyone on Team B for a few minutes. In a real game scenario, the maurading band of trolls in Greater Faydark couldn't be healed/buffed by a high-elf assuming that they were taking damage in their attacks. <br><br>In the out-of-level scenario, that same band of level ~20 trolls wouldn't be able to receive support from a 50th level cleric. <br><br>There are some disadvantages to this, such as in the following:<br><br>4 Trolls are grouped with a high-elf fighting PvE encoutners in a dungeon. Humans come in and "slap" the trolls every so often thus keeping the high-elf from assisting them. Perhaps this should just be a disadvantage for cross-teaming in general. Perhaps this is just a risk that people take from grouping with the enemy.<br><br>What are your thoughts on these ideas? What other issues do you see causing problems in regard to this idea? Do the benefits (e.g. reaffirming the servers as PvP Teams) outweigh the potential disadvantages? <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

I believe all 3 are malevolent. Are there any plans in the works for a benevolent plane to be made accessable to players. Just seems like an even trade off. Just thinking maybe some of the characters that are paticpating in the slaying of Innoruck and Cazic would probably feel more comfortable encountering their gods adversaries.<br>Also, I was wondering what kind of faction hits do characters get after slaying someone like Innoruck or Cazic? Its gotta be Incredible]</i></font><br><br>Actually the Plane of Sky really isn't malevolent in nature. It's there to test the resolve of Norrath's citizens.<br>In regards to your question however, though I can't really release any information, we're definitely aware of the players' desire to whup up on the minions of some of Norrath's kinder deities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666.html"><b>Need definite rule re: Invulnerable Healers on PvP team servers </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am running through a zone when I observe a PvP fight. A dwarven palladin is laying the smack down on a poor dark elf. I check the health on the DE and seeing he is about to die, I heal and SoW him. This allows him to run away. Both combatants were in their low teens, whereas I am level 27. Am I going to be warned?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My guild runs to Nek forest and starts laying waste. We have 6 members, 5 of whom are level 20, and the sixth is a level 40 cleric. The cleric is only there to heal the other 5 and no one in the zone on the opposing team is high enough to attack him. Is my guild in trouble?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A group of Evils is attacking a group of Elves. Everyone in the fight is of equal level. However, the darks have brought with them a cross-teaming Elf, who heals the Evils, and can't be attacked by the other Elves since he is on the same team as them. Is the cross teaming Elf going to be banned?]</i></font><br><br>No, there are currently no rules againt the "invulnarable healer", whether its due to an "out of range" healer or a "cross-teaming" healer.<br><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No one should be invulerable in combat and you shouldn't have to call an enemy to kills guys of your own race. A design flaw to be sure and this should at least be commented on or addressed by Verant. ]</i></font><br><br>Brega, you can say that the system is flawed and should be fixed, but none of the solutions that have been presented have been endorsed by plurality, much less a majority of the players. There are certainly some pretty rash and obscure things that we could do to try and "fix" this to your liking, but what of everyone else? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I've never seen this addressed by Abashi either. Most players just want Racewars to be coded as Racewars. Invulerable healing and buffing to help "Racewar enemy teams" defeat your own team should be coded out as impossible.]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that seems simple, but what is the reasoning behind, for instance, a human paladin and a high-elf paladin to "refuse" (cf. be restricted by code) to heal or buff each other? Why *must* there be animosity between them?<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Make the healer attackable by his own team for say the next 2 minutes everytime he heals (this happens in guild wars, so it should be possible); ]</i></font><br><br>Can't do this with the way that attack rights are handle. In EQ, if I can attack you, you can also attack me. There's no way around that mechanism. The exploit that pops out is that all I'd have to do to be able to go kill my own team would be to cast a beneficial spell on someone of another team. EQ also can't handle a persistant agressor flag. We know who is casting the spell and who the recipient is at the time the spell is cast, but not after. The same is true with melee attacks.<br><br>These are the options available to us:<br><br>1. Do nothing.<br>2. Disallow beneficial spells across teams. (handles cross-teaming problem)<br>3. Disallow beneficial spells out-of-level (handles, for the most part, the out-of-level situation)<br>4. A combination of 2&3.<br><br>The difficulty is that while we want to support PvP and the Teams servers, we cannot in that process harm the PvE aspects of the game. It's still going to be EverQuest, but will be EverQuest with PvP, rather than PvP EverQuest. <br><br>There's another possible solution (if indeed people feel that there is a problem) that one of the programmers and I were just brainstorming about. Please let me know if you feel that there are any unacceptable problems with this....<br><br>How about... If a player takes damage from another PC, they can only receive beneficial spells from someone in their own team for X-minutes or until they zone.<br><br>Let's apply this to the 3 scenarios that the original poster mentions:<br><br>Case #1: Dwarf is attacking DE1. DE2 is over 8 levels above DE1. Since DE2 is out-of-level with DE1, DE1 cannot take his beneficial spells since he's being attacked by the dwarf. DE2's only option would be to attack the dwarf if he was in range, but in this case, he's not. <br><br>Case #2: The level 40 DE cleric would not be able to support he level 20 marauders since he is out of range.<br><br>Case #3: Evils are attacking elves. Assuming that the elves have done damage to the evils, evils could not be healed/buffed by the cross-teaming elf.<br><br>Other scenarios:<br><br>Human is grouped with 3 elves, they can buff each other all day long. However, a troll attacks the human. The human can now only be healed by other people on the human team.<br><br>Human is grouped with 3 elves, and can buff, etc... The troll now attacks one of the elves. That elf cannot receive direct support from the human, but can from the other elves.

This weekend will have marked the 25th chapter of their tale at Safka's Lore.<br><blockquote>Safka's Lore proudly presents the 25th chapter of our epic tale this<br>weekend! Since we've now completed our quarter century of episodes we've put<br>together a short update of the events that have been chronicled to date,<br>hopefully this, combined with our character bio's on the site will allow the<br>uninitiated to begin to enjoy our tale.<br><br>"Safka Fairheart was born of Noble blood to the clerical school of Felwithe<br>under the guidance of Tunare. A caring and thoughtful child, her world was<br>shattered by the mysterious assassination of her father. No trace was ever<br>found of the killer and Safka was resigned to never finding the culprit. The<br>teachings of Tunare taught her not to yearn revenge, instead dedicating her<br>skills to saving and helping others.<br><br>As she grew, learnt and travelled out beyond the halls of Felwithe Safka<br>made the acquaintance of a group of adventurers lead by the Dwarf Lord<br>Balar, that were championing the cause of Light against an evil threat to<br>Norrath. Few unfortunately took them seriously, as they had little more than<br>rumour and instinct to guide them.<br><br>After a series of mysterious encounters with an evil necromancer called<br>Bugo, Safka became convinced that there was a plot being hatched against the<br>good races of Norrath and called upon the High table of Felwithe, the cities<br>magical council to help investigate the threat.<br><br>Politics though as usual, came between them and any real aid. The great Seer<br>Denaldar, who had been friend and companion of Safka's father agreed to help<br>them, but the backing of the council was denied them by the Veto of the<br>cunning and ambitious Sovariax, a long time adversary of the ancient Seer.<br><br>As events continued to point towards some great evil presence working<br>against them, Katlinel, enchanter and companion of the forces of Light was<br>possessed by an evil charm, and in the resulting confrontation, Safka was<br>forced to take the life of her closest friend. A plot against the followers<br>of Marr in both Qeynos and Freeport has been uncovered but the friends still<br>need evidence to give credence to their claims . . ."<br><br>Intrigue, battle, love and loyalty bind the characters together in a tale of<br>the eternal battle for Norrath, as the Lady Safka is torn between her<br>loyalty to her betrothed, the wood elf Rhyk and the pressures of unveiling<br>the evil presence that plagues them.<br><br>If you have read the lot or are yet to taste our storytelling, pull up a<br>stool and gather round  . . .the tale continues . .<a href="http://www.eqlore.moonfruit.com" target="_new">www.eqlore.moonfruit.com</a></blockquote>Thanks Safka!

Abashi on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004016.html"><b>Gordon Thank you for doing a test for us. </b></a><br>For the past several weeks, the complaints by monks here on the board (most of the complaints anyway) have been that they no longer outdamage warriors. The tests that I did were only to confirm that that wasn't true. Yes, I conceed that monks cannot takes hits as well as warriors, but that's never been where the disagreement has been. When people said, "Monks no longer outdamage warriors", I had to disagree, which is why I ended up testing it out. However, when people now say, "We can't take hits like a warrior", I agree with that.<br>Dealing out more damage than the warrior doesn't mean that you'll beat the warrior in a duel, nor that the ratio of damage dealing to damage taking capability is constant. The benefit of extra damage has more weight than the disadvantage of being defensively inferior. <br><br>I'm sure that some would say, "If a warrior can solo creature X in two minutes and be almost dead at the end, then a monk should be able to do the same in a minute and end up almost dead". This would be an example of constant ratio between offense and defense and the two classes. This however isn't the case. If the ratio were constant as suggested, there would, again, be no reason to have the warrior, because the monk's other skills would make them preferable in all cases. Not to mention, there's an added benefit any time a creature is killed faster than normal, a benefit that can't be measured directly against the power of the class, but more against its usefulness to the group. Would a group, for instance, like to kill things in 2 minutes and end up OOM and near death at the end? Or would the rather do it in 1 minute and end up the same way? They'd want it done faster in all cases. That's what monks and rogues add as melee classes.<br><br>Concerning everyone saying that the test wasn't "valid", I fully agree with that from a scientific standpoint. Many more combats would have to be carried out than the ones I could do over a couple of hours yesterday. To be honest, its not really my job to test things of this nature, I just do it as needed so I can speak with first-hand experience. Though the specific percentage point differences can't really be considered averages, I do think that the test fairly well answered the question: Do monks outdamage warriors?<br><br>There was one interesting thing in the test that I didn't mention in the post yesterday, concerning the one time that the warrior outdamaged the monk. The warrior was using his best combo out of the 5 weapon combos I tried, the monk his worst (bare knuck). The damage ratios were determined by seeing how long it took for the character to kill the NPC in question. The monk completed the task in under two minutes in every case but one, where it took 2:03. The warrior was over two minutes in every case, with its fastest time at 2:01. The monk's best time, by the way, was 1:30.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003944.html"><b>Would a second arena with pets be possible? </b></a><br>Pets work in the Arena. Initially when the Arena was put together, pathing data wasn't included. That pathing data was put in a few months ago, and since then pets have worked properly.</ul>

This weekend on the Xegony server the First Xegony All-Norrathian Drinking Gathering will be held. It will be on Saturday, the <br>12th of August. <br><blockquote>**************************************************<br>* First Xegony All-Norrathian Drinking Gathering *<br>**************************************************<br><br>Hail citizens of Xegony!<br><br>The time has come to sit back and forget about spawns, loot, experience and <br>money for a while. You are all invited to the first Xegony All-Northian <br>Drinking Gathering.<br><br>*********************<br>* What is the Idea? *<br>*********************<br><br>The idea was conceived by 2 fellow adventurers, Balkin Ironfist and Ellegon <br>Grossfuss. We are both Master Brewers and enjoy having a good time without <br>constant competition. So we wanted to organize a gathering where we can hand <br>out free drinks and have fun with old and new friends.<br><br>*************************************<br>* Where will the Gathering be held? *<br>*************************************<br><br>We decided to take West Freeport, as it is relatively easy to reach with <br>boats and TP's and is a newbie zone, therefore there shouldn't be wandering <br>MoB's killing drunk people. We are aware that certain races or classes are <br>KOS in Freeport, but there is no place where EVERYBODY is safe. Just watch <br>out for the guards if your race/class is disliked! :-)<br><br>******************************<br>* How do I come to Freeport? *<br>******************************<br><br>You can either travel by foot and boat, or you can ask your friendly Druid <br>or Wizard for a Teleport. We are also trying to set up a taxi-service with <br>volunteer Teleporters. More about that in the section "How can I help?"<br><br>*************************<br>* What does it cost me? *<br>*************************<br><br>Besides some time, absolutely nothing. The alcohol will be given away free <br>of charge. You can tip the brewers, breezers, binders or the teleporters if <br>you want, but it's not at all necessary. This will NOT be a gathering for <br>the rich or to make money. It's only purpose is to have fun.<br><br>****************************<br>* When will it take place? *<br>****************************<br><br>The First XANDG will start on Saturday, the 12th of August at 6 pm PST (9pm <br>EST, 2am GMT).<br><br>*******************<br>* How can I help? *<br>*******************<br><br>The easiest way to help is: Spread the word! Tell all your friends, your <br>guild members and the people you meet in the zones. Post it on your guild <br>boards and websites!<br><br>In addition, we still need a lot of help from everyone. We decided to search <br>for some services to offer and therefore look out for:<br><br>- Brewers: Everyone with the brewing skill can attend and distribute his/her <br>drinks to the attending people. We don't care about your skill, as even Bog <br>Juice is alcohol :-) All we ask, is that you accept the fact that we're not <br>SELLING beverages. Again, this should be a free event, just for the fun of <br>it.<br><br>- Foragers/Gatherers: A lot of the higher skill level drinks need <br>ingredients that can't be bought. Good examples are Vegetables (very much <br>needed), Fruits, Berries, Froglok Meat, Snake Scales or Royal Jelly. So <br>everyone who can forage or collect these ingredients is welcomed to donate <br>or sell them to us. Yes, we will buy them. The simple reason is, that when <br>we make high end brews (like Hulgarsh, Ginesh, or Bleeding Brains), we will <br>most likely gain skill levels (we are both around 140 brewing, but not <br>maxed). Since we don't want to take advantage of your generosity, we are <br>willing to pay 1 or 2 plat per stack of Vegetables and also some pay for the <br>other ingredients. Of course we will gladly accept donations :-)<br><br>- Taxis: We want to offer a taxi-service between the various parts of <br>Norrath to Freeport (respectively Commons) and maybe back. Therefore we <br>would need some volunteer Druids and Wizards playing Taxi. We would allow <br>the teleporting personnel to collect tips if offered, but the TP itself <br>should be free of charge.<br><br>- Breezer/Clarity: The taxis will need a lot of mana and would very much <br>like a breeze or even a clarity cast on them. If you would be able to help <br>them a bit, please do so.<br><br>- Binders: Some of those who attend might like a bind in Freeport. We want <br>to offer this to the ones asking for it. If you can cast Bind and will do it <br>FREE of charge, why not join in the fun?<br><br>If you would like to help us in any way, please contact Balkin and Ellegon <br>at xandg@hotmail.com!<br><br>********************************<br>* What will I get for helping? *<br>********************************<br><br>No money, and no exp. If a player tips you, then so be it. But we ask anyone <br>participating, to offer his services for free. I'm sure you see the good <br>will behind this event and the possibility to make some new friends.<br><br>****************************************<br>* You still have additional Questions? *<br>****************************************<br><br>No problem. Contact us at xandg@hotmail.com!</blockquote>Thanks guys!

Jandar Naed'Shoj has announced the Lords of Crom Battle Royale. <br><blockquote>Well hold on to your weapons and dust off your spells because here it is.  On SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY AUG 13TH, there will be the first ever Lords of Crom Battle Royale.  Yes you heard me right.  It will be held in the Arena zone at Lake Rathe.  Some of the things that we will do there is let people duke it out based on LVL range and class type.  LVL ranges will be 1-10, 11-15, and every five after that.  Class range is all melle type(example warrior, rogue, monk), pure casters, and hybrids.  The first round of events will be no armor, or buffs only a rusty weapon.  Casters will be allowed to cast spells only once in the ring.  There will be no prep before the fight, with the exception of pets.  It will be a round robin type of event with single round eliminations.  All players will continue to advance in their LVL/Class range until they are the last ones standing. Then in the second round of events all players will be allowed to prep before entering the ring and use any items th!<br>at they bring with them(armor/weapons).  We will have our buff team along to ensure that buffs are placed fairly among people if they so desire buffs.  Round 2 will go the same as before with single round eliminations. The winner of the first round and second rounds will duke it out to be named Battle Royale Title holder for the class/lvl.  Now for the deatails on the time....SUNDAY AUGUST 13TH AT 12PM(NOON) EST.  There will be no outside help from anyone during the events, and if you enter the ring to fight and leave you forfeit the match.  If anyone tries to mess with our event we will stop and get a GM to come take care of the problem if we can not take care of it ourselves.  If you have any question or comments on the event, please email me at tsionusii@aol.com<br><br>Jandar Naed'Shoj<br>Rouge Master for the Lords of Crom</blockquote>Thanks Jandar!

The sequel to the story of Abashi on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002432.html"><b>Where's my Manastone or Moss Covered Twig </b></a><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant claims that these items where broken or unbalanced,so they removed them from the game.If these items are "Broken" or "Unbalancing",then why was the manastone left in game to current owners?And if the Moss Covered Twig is a mistake by a game designer that didnt know the rules,then why havnt they recieved retro-active changes?]</i></font><br><br>Not everything that is found to be unbalancing is given retroactive changes. This is actually our LAST option when it comes to dealing with these issues as they come up. The manastone was one of the times where we decided to leave the existing item in game, and just barred it from the planes and from Kunark. As for the moss-covered stuff, we're still deciding what, if anything, to do about them.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Then everyone will someday have a chance at it if they want it.]</i></font><br><br>I've mentioned several times in the past that no one is entitled to any item. Items change in game all of the time. New items come in, old items go out. One day the Guk Ghoul Lord might run out of his endless supply of swords and that will be it. That's how it's supposed to work.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So where's my Manastone? Where's my Moss Covered Twig?]</i></font><br><br>If they are floating around on your server, you might be able to acquire them from another player.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The vision only awards those who play 24/7, are in Uberguilds]</i></font><br><br>People who play the game more will get more items. People who have a lot of friends and make allies will have access to more things. There really isn't a problem with either of those. You *should* be able to go more places and do more things if you have friends. You should be able to get more things quicker if you play more. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003665.html"><b>Gordon, come to CT and watch me duel a 60 warrior </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi said that monks do the best toe to toe damage. He did not say they had enough hps to withstand the warriors damage long enough to kill them]</i></font><br><br>Not to mention, even if buffs were added to the monk until they had the same number of hitpoints, they'd be pitted against each others armor in an unequal fashion. The only way to test this is versus the same NPC. I might try that out. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003776.html"><b>Abashi, this is inconsistent... </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Manastone was "overpowering" in only a very certain set of circumstances. The robe also has a casting time on it, where the stone does not.]</i></font><br><br>Not to mention, the Robe is extremely rare on a very difficult encounter. The manastone was neither rare nor difficult to obtain.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003779.html"><b>Cursed Items off the very hardest creatures to defeat... </b></a><br>Those items you mentioned aren't cursed, as Arkanon_Brell said, they just have drawbacks. Many things in game have advantages and disadvantages for their use, they are just more pronounced on some of these items. The pronounced drawbacks allow higher stats to be placed upon the items. Another nice thing about drawbacks is that it creates doubt as to what constitutes the "best" items, leading to diversity in what people wear. <br>Cursed items, on the other hand, have yet to make an appearance in game. The Rod of Anhilation was *supposed* to be cursed, but somehow the curse didn't make it on to the weapon. <br><br><LI><a href="LINK-TO-BOARD-THREAD-HERE"><b>Post-24-Hour Decay: LET ME LOOT IT!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think a good alternative to a body decaying after the time limit is up is to allow ANYBODY to loot the body when the time limit is up. The stuff is going to be lost for good anyway, right? Why not allow by chance some passerby to snag up some items?]</i></font><br><br>Simply, this isn't something that we'd do. Besides creating a new phenomenon of corpse-camping, it would basically result in items being handed out to players who didn't earn them. At least when you trade for or are given an item, you are earning it from the perspective of the trader or giver. Merely being able to loot anyone's corpse after a given amount of time would amount to the items being handed out.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003790.html"><b>Feydedwar drops the FA quest stuff! </b></a><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So we are supposed to camp the dragon?<br>Rare random spawn?]</i></font><br><br>Rare random spawns really can't be camped. The challenge in this case is to happen upon him, and get everyone together to kill him before he depops.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: ABashi would you please tell someone to make this damn dragon permanent when he pops? Like EVERY other dragons?]</i></font><br><br>"Every other dragon" is not "permanent" when they pop. It's in an outdoor zone, and is a chance encounter. It's going to take some work and some haste to take him down. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003815.html"><b>Bottled Mana? Can you give us a hint at least? Please?</b></a><br>Enchanters have a line of spells (e.g. Thicken mana, purify mana, etc) that creates different components that will, as trade skills are adjusted, be usable when crafting items that are magical.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003823.html"><b>VERANT: Unacceptable customer service!!</b></a><br>I'm sorry, but the patch message was very clear, there is no reimbursement for items dropped upon the ground. This is absolutely firm. This policy is necessary in order to follow the item reimbursement policy publicized a few weeks ago. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "In addition to there being no reimbursement for accidentally dropped items, all items dropped will disappear immediately. Dropping an item is now the same as hitting the destroy button with it."]</i></font><br><br>Not everything disappears when it hits the ground. Some things, for instance, fall through objects onto world geometry below. Other things do just disappear, timing out as trash in the world. Yes, dropping an item should be considered basically the same as hitting destroy for all intents and purposes. Don't drop anything that you want to keep. <br><br>Perhaps the patch message should have included reference to items that were purposely dropped. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003838.html"><b>Hey, good news: Combat speed debuffs </b></a><br>One of the programmers thinks that he has the reverse stacking problem with "attack speed debuffs" (Deeds/Insects line) cracked. It should be going on the Test server soon.</ul>

The story of Abashi on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000560.html"><b>Brad or Gordon on trade skills ? </b></a><br>Blacksmithy is being worked on currently, with plans for tailoring and pottery shortly thereafter. Jewelry is probably on the bottom of the list of revamps right now due to the fact that it is already so useful. It's without doubt the most robust trade skill currently in game.<br>We do however have plans for the "Bottled Mana" series of spells in these revamps  <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Also the JC skill is capped at 200. Wasn't Alchemy upped to over 200 ?]</i></font><br><br>I don't believe that alchemy was, but poison was bumped over 200. Increase of the skill caps on the trades might be revisited during the revamp. Poison had components that made skill over 200 necessary. The other skills are currently built already taking into account the 200 cap.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As a Master Smithe, the toolboxes were the best thing that ever happened.]</i></font><br><br>The toolbox recipe was obviously broken, as it allowed instant conversion of money to more money with minimal effort. None of the trade skills in game are designed to function in this way.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002880.html"><b>Gordon: Why don't hotkeys work when meditating? </b></a><br>Originally, the idea was that people wouldn't be able to do anything else while medding. As we loosened up on this gameplay aspect, and started allowing people to do things, we probably just forgot to re-enable those hotkeys. I imagine that if you can click the buttons with a mouse, you should be able to hit the corresponding number on the keyboard and have it work. I'll forward this to Roy. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003041.html"><b>Patch Message here *sigh* </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No mention of the /roleplay fix taking place though. Did VI forget this promised fix yet again?]</i></font><br><br>Even though it worked correctly on the Test server during the last patch, it didn't work on Production because one necessary file didn't get patched. Considering that I'd already announced once that it was fixed, I figured I'd wait until I saw it myself before announcing it again.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended. Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch. Enjoy<br>This actually scares me..]</i></font><br><br>That just means that you can hit and be hit by the dragons from further away than it should be. That will be corrected in a future patch.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does this mean the group switch did not make it in with the trackplayer command?]</i></font><br><br>No, that won't be in until the next patch, but it will go in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003143.html"><b>Emerald Jungle update </b></a><br>The "chr" files contain references to the NPCs that can be *displayed* in a zone, not the placement of NPCs and the loot on them. That happens server-side and does not require a client update.<br><br><LI><a href="LINK-TO-BOARD-THREAD-HERE"><b>Who'll stop the rain? </b></a><br>Zones have chances daily chances to rain based upon the zone and the season on the server. Some zones rain more than others (the Karana's come to mind), whereas others don't get it that much. It is indeed to add atmosphere to the game. <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Who'll stop the rain?]</i></font><br><br>A druid of the appropriate level <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003282.html"><b>Workaround that could allow >20 items in one inventory slot, potion stacking </b></a><br>Well, one note on potions, we've considered a workaround to make them "stackable" in one fashion or another. If we can't directly make them stackable (and the new programmer "Roy" is working on this), we've started talking about allowing shaman to stick 10 potions of one type in a container, combine them, and produce a 10 charge potion. <br>It's a thought, we'll continue working on this issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003300.html"><b>Do some testing for us Abashi </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Here is what I propose Abashi. Do some testing with a lvl 60 monk and a lvl 60 warrior. Equip both with comperable equipment. I suggest using a jade mace and knuckle duster for the monk and a jade mace and crystalline short sword for the warrior as this is relatively balancing in the difficulty of obtaining those items. Then equip them both in their fear/hate planar armor. This should be pretty balancing as these armor sets are basically of equal difficulty to obtain.]</i></font><br><br>If you take two classes with near identical skill, equip them with weapons that do nearly the same damage, and exclude special attacks, disciplins, etc., they are going to do nearly the same damage. That's a given.<br><br>However that's not the appropriate way to test. You need to take into account that monk-specific weapons of a similar *quality* are more powerful than warrior-specific weapons of the same quality. For instance, if you equip one with the best items in the game for their class, you need to do the same for the other.<br><br>I should mention that the top two or 3 non-Veeshan's Peak weapons for monks haven't even been found yet. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003321.html"><b>A request for the /help command. Stop the spam! </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: While I really think this was a great addition I think it really needs to be broken up into two commands. Perhaps it could be split into /help and /emotes. When you get spammed with 153 commands (yes, I counted), you aren't getting much help.]</i></font><br><br>Good idea, I think that it would probably require a bit of hardcoding, but I'll forward it to the client programmer.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003352.html"><b>What Recourse Do I have? </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Two more spawns go by, a total of 9 gobs, and a monk comes in and asks me if his group could have the room. I say, not right now, I'm camping these. He questions if I get XP and I say I do. He leaves. He returns with 5 other group members and they sit down. I remind them that I am camping the room.]</i></font><br><br>Just a minor reminder here that no one can claim the rights to a particular spawn. If people choose to play in areas where other people are also contesting the same spawns, it would be good to work this stuff out without involving the GMs. Once they get there, the decision would be binding and might be one that neither group ends up liking.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My pal arrives and we get some kills. We lose some kills too. Then the personal attacks start coming. Meanwhile, more than an hour has passed and the one GM online has not responded to me. this could have been settled long ago with some mediation by a GM. I'm sure witnesses thought we all nuts.]</i></font><br><br>I'm sorry that someone wasn't available to intervene in the matter. The GMs deal with many of these issues on a daily basis. It sounds like, however, that you all were working together in the end, both getting a few kills now and again. One aspect of massively multiplayer games is that people are exposed to each other and either learn to work together or not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So is this what I pay my money for? Harrasment at every turn, simply because I had found a room that I could solo in and not spend hours trying to get on a list someplace? No GM assistance at all, not even a "Hey, you should really move on...".]</i></font><br><br>You do pay to play a game with other people in the same world, and that has both advantages and disadvantages. Your opponents could have felt the same way that you do about the situation, and you all pay the same money to play. We have to take into account the needs, desires, and rights of all of our players. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please note this is not a flame. This is honest criticism. I am an unhappy customer, complaining about a flawed product.]</i></font><br><br>Your post doesn't denote any flaw in the product. You wanted to kill something, another player wanted to kill the same thing. There are other places in the world where both groups could have gone and never run into a contested situation such as this, but instead the choice was to fight over one spawn.<br><br>Again, I'm very sorry that a GM couldn't be present to resolve the matter for you in a timely manner.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Camping is part of The Vision (tm) and is bound to lead to that kind of situation.]</i></font><br><br>That's not appreciated. We've elaborated many times on what our goals were for the world. The fact that people choose to camp rather than adventure is something that we are trying to change regularly. You might note that every change we make to discourage camping leads to a slew of posts here on the board from people who are angry about the change. If you don't want to camp you can *choose* not to camp and go someplace you can adventure without camping. There are many places in game to do this, you just have to open yourself to a bit more risk.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003356.html"><b>Abashi - Why doesn't O'Kiel's Radiation get any upgrades? </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Basically, it was just a little freebie they threw wizards. ]</i></font><br><br>More accurately, it was a little freebie we decided not to take away from wizards. Back in early beta, when the class roles were still being defined, that was the first damage-shield that was created and it was given to wizards. Shortly after that, it was decided that Wizards wouldn't have buffs to cast upon others. Rather than take that particular spell away, we decided to leave it in to help the wizards get through their first couple of levels.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003358.html"><b>What's the plan Abashi? </b></a><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Since bards did not get the relative increase in effectiveness the other hybrids got, what is the plan to for bards? Is it your intention for bards to be less effective than pallies, rangers, and s/k's?]</i></font><br>Bards aren't really hybrids, and in fact aren't really like any other class in the game. They really can't be compared directly to hybrids. Even if they could, who's to say that this change would make them less effective?<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Fix the broken lullaby & chains songs. This would increase the relative power of bards, because we have learned to get by without these songs for so long. In NO WAY would I expect to be as effective as an enchanter at crowd control, but I DO expect my songs to work as intended.]</i></font><br><br>I'm not sure what is supposed to be wrong with chains. Some changes were put in to put in a maximum amount that a creature could be slowed prior to applying any slowing related to damage. The change was intentional.<br><br>As for lullaby, I just said in another thread that Ester, the one who was going to look at this, is on vacation, and I'll have to check with her when she gets back. Now that I think of it, I think I may remember someone stating that lullaby's current functionality is intended, as it's the only thing to keep them from trivializing encounters. I'll have to check with Ester when she gets back to be sure.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Remove us from the hybrid exp table. You keep referencing how we are not true hybrids, and enhancements for them would do nothing for bards. If we are so different from them, then why do we suffer the same exp penalty?]</i></font><br><br>There will be no changes to the experience system in game. I'm sorry, but this isn't negotiable. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just after a rez I have no mana! It's the ONLY time I am less than 50% mana, and the only time I am careful about charming. What exploit are you trying to stop? Are recently rezzed bards in a position to exploit the charm song in a way that a non-rezzed bard can't? I just don't understand a mana requirement on the song when it only comes into play after a rez?]</i></font><br><br>That's just one of the disadvantages that all classes must have.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003364.html"><b>Normal Mode vs. Full Screen w/ Overlay.

I did mention that that recipe would be fixed in a post either yesterday or the day before however.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As for Why it was done, I do understand that the sell price of the Toolbox was a bit extreme]</i></font><br><br>My understanding is that it wasn't the sale price, but the recipe that was out of whack. I'm making an assumption here as I'm not sure off the top of my head how it was "fixed".<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003392.html"><b>Playing on multiple servers... </b></a><br>Different players require different accounts. The way that we enforce this in game to the greatest extent possible is to only allow one character from the account in game at any time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003408.html"><b>Latest change in the works on Test - Looking for Group flag. </b></a><br>Hello all,<br>I thought I'd drop by and let you know of a new feature that we are trying out on Test. Last week it was suggested here on the boards that we implement a "Looking for Group" flag that players can set and view in order to help people get together quickly, allowing more time for adventuring. We've decided to try it out and it's on Test now.<br><br>The /lfg [on|off] command will set or unset your "LFG" flag. Players can then use all of the "/who" and "/who all" filters to find each others. For instance, "/who all rogue 45 50 lfg" will return all rogues between 45 and 50 who are looking for a group. "/who lfg" will return all players in the current zone who are looking for a group. <br><br>Your LFG flag will automatically unset when you enter a group. One final note, though anonymous and roleplaying characters can set their LFG flag, they will not show up in filtered /who lists. In other words, the first example above wouldn't return any anonymous rogues, however "/who all lfg" would return everyone in the game who is LFG (subject to the 20 person limit).<br><br>Assuming all goes well in testing, this change will most likely be in the next patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003416.html"><b>Abashi or whoever: Please add /log [on/off] to the INI file </b></a><br>It will be in the next version that we patch. I believe that it's on Test already, along with the "GROUP" option for the /trackplayers command.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003420.html"><b>m Abashi, is this supposed to be a feature?

We made groups, buffed up, and engaged the dragon only to have out ENTIRE force feared and sent running. As soon as the fear had gone, our whole caster force(Chanters, clerics, wizards, etc...) simply locked up, unable to cast any spell, and were simply mowed down one by one without a chance even to fight back. Is this what Verant intended?]</i></font><br><br>Hmmm, this patch was supposed to address that issue. The programmer who was doing unit testing on that, along with the rogue/pickpocket lockup along those same lines, wasn't able to reproduce it with this code. <br>I'll kick the issue back to them.

Here is the new patch message:<br><blockquote>***Character Purge***<br> <br>Time has come to do some cleanup on character data across the servers.  On August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of level 1 characters.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within 30 days from the date of the purge will be deleted.  As GMs will not be able to restore any characters that are deleted, please be certain to log in any level 1 characters that you wish to keep prior to the purge.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team<br> <br><br>August 9th, 7:00am<br>------------------<br> <br>*Guide Application*<br> <br>The Guide Application is now back up at <a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com.">http://guideapp.everquest.com.</a>  If you are over 18 years of age, have a good customer-oriented attitude, enjoy helping your fellow player, and are interested in joining the Guide Program, we will be pleased to review your application.<br> <br>*Kunark Users*<br> <br>A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of today's patch.  This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br> <br>*Patch Day*<br> <br>Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes. <br> <br>*General Enhancements*<br> <br>- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br>- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels transposed accidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate.<br>- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br>- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br>- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<br>- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a "NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.<br>- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.<br> <br>*Changes/Fixes*<br> <br>- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br>- Scaler recipe now works<br>- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br>- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br>- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br>- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br>- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br>- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<br>- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br>- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br>- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br>- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br>- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.<br> <br>*Dragons?*<br> <br>Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.  Enjoy :)<br> <br><br>*New Command For Tracking*<br> <br>New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work for all players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<br> <br>- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the tracking window.<br>- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br> <br>*Client Customizations*<br> <br>Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your EverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<br> <br>- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br>- Default screen viewing mode<br>- Default travel speed (run or walk)<br> <br>The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the working document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're in the process of building them.  <br> <br>Modifying this file is optional.<br> <br>*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<br> <br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br> <br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file: <br> <br>1 - Say<br>2 - Tell<br>3 - Group<br>4 - Guild<br>5 - OOC<br>6 - Auction<br>7 - Shout<br>8 - Emote<br>9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br> <br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings: <br> <br>RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>ScreenMode - NORMAL for the default window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team<br></blockquote><br>Thanks Robert!

So you don't have to scour the boards yourself I have compiled Abashi's posts on the Official Boards:<br><ul><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001402-3.html"><b>Abashi - A warm "Thank You" From Hybrids </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Wisdom and Intelligence have no effect on the mana pool of a shadow knight.]</i></font><br><br>Indeed it does (Intelligence anyway), and now it will have the same effect as it does for a pure caster of the same level.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does this also mean that stats will have a greater effect on hybrid mana, just as it does on the parent class?]</i></font><br><br>Buffs that increase the stat used to determine mana (int or wis depending on class) will indeed affect the mana pool.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm a Bard. I'm a Hybrid. I have an experience penalty. This change doesn't do doodly for me.]</i></font><br><br>Only two bard songs use mana currently, and one of them may be moved to a "resing timer" in the future. The change really doesn't affect bards, as they aren't dependant on mana for most of what they do.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This thread is what I hope to be a large "Thank You" card for Abashi. Yesterday he announced that the hybrid mana pool has been increased on the test server, which will possibly lead to the same on the live servers. I consider that a great leap towards our salvation.]</i></font><br><br>Well it's live now, and you're welcome <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002906.html"><b>Verant - The truth comes out. </b></a><br>I really don't think that there's ever been any secret that the rangers strength was offensive rather than defensive. The term "light tank" has been used in the past, but that's when people were using "tank" for both dealers and takers of damage. At the time, there were several rather lengthly threads where everyone here on the board agreed that the term "tank" should only apply to damage takers. <br>Their role hasn't changed mid-stream. What did happen is a further shift towards offensive from defensive between 50 and 60. However this same trend was happening in the prior levels and just continued into the post 50 ones. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002943.html"><b>I Chalange VI to take a poll on the ballance issue </b></a><br>How do you propose to word such a poll? Something as broad as "Do you feel your class is powerful enough?", or "Do you feel that your class fulfills it's place in the game?", or something narrower and class-based? Class-based polls really wouldn't be very useful since we'd have no way to determine whether the person answering the poll is "qualified" (in a general sense) to speak on the issue. For that matter, we'd have a problem determining what "qualified" means. <br><br>Then there's the matter of human nature. Can we agree that it is in the nature of an EverQuest player for them to want their class to be "better" in some fashion, regardless their current status? For instance, taking a common thread here on the boards, if magicians think their direct damage spells should be better than the druids, and druids think their direct damage spells should be better than the magicians, how do we determine who represents whom in such a poll?<br><br>It's not an easy thing to determine all of the player desires and implement them in a way that doesn't conflict with other players desires. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002960.html"><b>If im 52 and want to change my class why not? </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't see why im not allowed to do a quest to change my class/race since in RP terms this would be perfectly acceptable]</i></font><br><br>I really don't think that this would be acceptable in "RP terms". Your character has spent his whole life learning the way of the wizard, there's no reason that he should suddenly forget everything that he knew about being a wizard, and become another class, say a rogue, and be nearly as advanced. In the real world, it would be roughly equivalent to a master electrician suddenly becoming a doctor. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002965.html"><b>Will Anything Convince Verant That Wizards Need More Mana and A Faster Regen???? </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We all know the arguments about why wizards, as the *most* mana dependent class in the game need a bigger mana pool and a faster mana regen. ]</i></font><br><br>Clerics could also say that they are the most mana-dependant class in the game. Neither class is in need of bigger mana pools or faster regen.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Daily, I contact friends who have quit their wizards because the down time for a wizard is longer for any other class, wizards do not fill a needed group role, ]</i></font><br><br>Evacers and nukers are often needed roles. I've seen posts from wizards saying that they can't get groups. I've seen the same from druids. Yet I've also seen posts from everyone else who says that an evacer is a must for a group. Wizards are also the only class that can get people to 2 out of 3 planes. They have a lot going for them.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So, I'm asking abashi and aradune straight up: Will *ANYTHING* convince you that wizards need a revamping which should include a larger mana pool, a faster mana regen rate and more damage output? ]</i></font><br><br>No, not at this time. Wizards already have more efficient direct damage spells than other classes, they get more different types of direct damage spells, their spells have better casting and recast times, and their spells are inherently less resistable. Not to mention that you have concussion which will take care of those aggro problems when used properly, and harvest and manaskin, which when used together can easily eliminate 2 "Meds" per hour.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003195.html"><b>Probably been addressed but here goes... Changing your religion </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok is it possible to change your diety?<br>If it isnt.. WHY NOT?]</i></font><br><br>No.<br><br>Deity selections are designed to have positive and negative effects upon what a character can do in game and how the NPCs react to them. We want that change to be permanent, as we don't want to see a situation where people switch deities based upon what is convenient at the time. For instance, if a really cool deity-specific quest or item comes in game, we don't want to see people flocking to a new religion.<br><br>As it was established that a change in religion would not be allowed, the game architecture was built in a way that now makes such a change impossible. Your faction (which comes from your race, class, and deity) is determined when you first start your character and can't be changed on the fly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003205.html"><b>Question about new text colors </b></a><br>There's some messages that aren't included in the current scheme, spell termination notices are one of them. The color for them is currently specified server-side. They'll be adjustable in the near future, we just had to get the base framework in before those changes could be made.</ul>
