Fresh from the Developer's Corner, here is today's edition of the Abosr Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000135.html"><b>Mana Costs for Hybrids</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Concerning hybrids not being as efficient at using mana, and the spells of parents. The argument was put forth that no one would play the parent if the hybrids could perform as well as the parent class. The problem is that you penalize the hybrids MULTIPLE times. Not only do hybrids get penalized in mana efficiency, they also get penalized in terms of spells available. I guarantee you, no one that wants to play a cleric will play a paladin instead because the mana efficiency changes. Its about the spells that are available. Allowing hybrids to have the same mana pool was a great thing. You should take away the efficiency penalty as well, since the real difference is the spell lists. (I think that hybrids are over-penalized there as well, but I wanted to focus on the efficiency issue.) Just my opinion. <br><br>Larsk Thunderfoot of Prexus ]</i></font><br><br>Well, we disagree. There were three differences between hybrids and their caster parent classes; Mana pool, casting cost, and spell selection. <br><br>Recently we removed the mana pool difference and significantly reduced the casting cost difference. We also gave the hybrid the advantage of unique spells and a significantly reduced penalty for casting while fighting (weapon delays continue to count off while spells are being cast &#8211; only for hybirds). In combination, all of those changes make for a very nice balance of spell casting power and melee power for the hybrids. <br><br>Yes, we'd have to remove the spell availability restriction before there would be any chance that people would prefer the hybrid over the parent caster class. But just that restriction alone isn't quite enough to make the balance that we want. We're very happy with the current balance, and I don't see any need to change it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said "If hybrids could cast spells as well as their parent class, then nobody would really want to play that parent class." <br><br>You can't be serious! If my snare cost as much as a druid snare, you're saying no one would really want to play a druid?! Do you really think that? <br><br>Scout Swiftshot<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>There's no reason to try to make what I wrote sound like some sort of conspiracy or trickery. I wrote that if hybrids could cast as well as their parent class, then nobody would play the parent class. That's certainly true. <br><br>If your ranger had the same spell line up as a druid with no penalties (cast as well as their parent class), then there would be very few druids. <br><br>Yes, I really think that. You do to. I'm not trying to be tricky or cover up the fact that there are indeed two restrictions on hybrids for their spells (see post above). There's no need to read things into my comments. And if I wasn't clear (though I thought I was) then I apologize for the confusion.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000007.html"><b>Necro Epic Quest Update</b></a><br>Just an update. <br><br>You'll see this in the patch message, but I figured you'd want to know now. <br><br>We've increased the drop rate on the cape rather dramatically. I think you'll find the drop rate more than adequate after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000128.html"><b>Wizards and Druids Spells: Transportation</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: My question is, are we going to see something like this for the druid class? I think it's a great idea, and would love to be able to cast these myself. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Aeslyn Stormwolf<br>Druid of the 29th session<br>Terris-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>The short answer is, probably not. <br><br>Regardless of past perceptions or texts or class descriptions, Wizards are becoming masters of teleportation. They will probably never get foot speed enhancement spells, that sort of travel will always be the real of the Druid, Bard and Shaman. <br><br>The reasoning behind this is pretty simple, really. <br><br>Druids have few weaknesses as a class. In fact, with the recent addition to their high level healing abilities, Druids are a very well-rounded and balanced class (though this is not the result of any final balance decision about the class, and things might be changed). Their ability to transport people is pretty darn good as it is. Not only can a Druid pop you across the ocean, he can speed up your running and get you to the final destination pretty quickly. <br><br>Wizards right now have two specialties, damage and teleportation. They should be the masters of arcane magic and ripping holes in the fabric of space. Making them the masters of teleportation not only makes a lot of sense, it also adds a dimension to the class. <br><br>Yes, we are moving toward making Wizards the master of arcane transportation. This seems like the right direction to take the class.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Forging and Eating Food</b></a><br>I submitted this before, but I wasn't absolutely sure at the time, and I have not seen a response. I have now completely confirmed that the emote message that goes with right clicking a food item to eat it is only visible to the player who is eating. <br><br>It is not much use as an emote or roleplaying tool this way. <br><br>--- Geffin Dagrifter [The Keepers]<br>Wealth Redistribution Engineer<br>Level 50, E'ci <br><br>Yup&#8230; it was broke. <br><br>We've got it fixed, and it will go live when we next patch. <br><br>Sorry.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000117.html"><b>Lack of Shadows of Luclin Information</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Ok, now you've gone too far! :)<br><br>Please tell me that you're not going to use an animated model, but that Denise, the original flesh-and-blood model will be brought back! <br><br>I can't imagine going to a Fan Fair and meeting a cartoon, instead of the real thing. <br><br>-Fandarian<br>41st Druid, E'ci<br>Attendee of Baltimore Fan Fair<br>(And yes, I DID meet Denise!!) ]</i></font><br><br>Oh&#8230; what if that cartoon was Jessica Rabbit? Would you be singing the same toon then? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor! It's been more than a week now! We need more character models and screenshots! Please!? <br><br>-Kellis ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry folks. We're going to be slow to put up new information for a while. We want to make sure that we can actually do what we want to do before we mention it. And, well, we like to keep you all drooling&#8230; :)<br><br><br>Veliarx wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: i just read about some new info on the upcoming expansion. there the beastmaster was described as being "the first class that can tank and conjure a pet". as someone who has played a shadowknight past level 40 i feel you should've had that idea a little earlier in everquest's history. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, we didn't actually say that&#8230; that was someone else saying that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Dang, you sure about that Absor? <br><br>The longest time I've been pronouncing it, "Bob." <br><br><shrug> <br><br>Dimento Graven<br>44'th Season Druid<br>'Gankos' Zek ]</i></font><br><br>No, no&#8230; "Bob" is how your pronounce 'Jeff Butler'. <br><br>/em looks over his shoulder in a bit of a panic.<br>/em writes note to NOT post this.<br>/em promptly loses note. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Ok, then how do YOU pronounce the newest split server, Zeboruxok. Bet you can't! :-P <br><br>Binnen ]</i></font><br><br>I don't really have to know how to pronounce is, as long as I know how to spell it I can complete my daily tasks without worry&#8230; <br><br>Kynyne wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As was done with Velious, is there going to be a request for Questions to produce a FAQ sheet for Shadows ? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I've been getting plenty of questions. I've been building a FAQ question list for Gordon to look over. So send in your questions if you'd like. But the list of existing questions is already pretty long. And, yes, most of the questions you'd expect to be asked have already been asked&#8230; several times. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: why is there only gnomes screenshot in new models page ?? and please please don't say gnomes r sexy ! :)(i was one time in a group of 4 male gnomes...) <br><br>Sylviania Delaforet<br>Wood-Elf Ranger<br>49th season ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, that's not fair. You can't ask me a question and then immediately tell me that I can't give you the answer&#8230; <br><br>Gnomes are sexy. If you don't agree, you're in denial and should write to Mennix for help. <br><br>Tamarac wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Yup, she winked at me as well. Flirtatious that one... :)<br><br>The site is just informative enough to keep me hanging, good work. The idea of new advancement paths for 60th level characters sounds intriguing and the Beastlord is mentioned as being available to the Vah Shir and possibly the 'other shamanistic races' which sounds promising, since I was hoping the Kerrans would be Shamen and not some super-civilized space Kerrans. <br><br>Having it based on Al'Kabor might not be the best choice. The man does not exactly have the best reputation in the Wizardly arts, given his dubious contributions in that area... Many Wizards would rightly feel that he is something of a con artist or snake oil salesman for cheating them out of hard won platinum to purchase his namesake spells that end up less effective than the 'generic' versions perfected by long-forgotten Wizards of skill before him. <br><br>Then again, his off-handed note in the introduction of 'quietly' sneaking various tomes off to his library to study without informing his companions reinforces his disreputable nature... <br><br>An brief but vituperative GM event would ensue if he ever dared show his face around a gathering of potent PC Wizards, I am sure. :)]</i></font><br><br>Nobody ever claimed that the famous Al'Kabor was a sweetheart of a guy&#8230; <br><br>And, well, the Spiraliscious-one has been known to take the occasional risk and travel the lands of mere mortal wizards, when the need is great enough. <br><br>And, well, we call it a 'teaser' site, so I guess we did out job there. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000127.html"><b>Translocate Confirmation Box</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: i have to speak against adding a confirmation box to the normal translocate, as it couldnt be used to save someone that is asleep on a raid <br><br>and nothing can really protect you from us, the 'deranged' wizards! flee while you can! <br><br>Feyr Tlincail<br>Deranged wizard of quellious <br><br>*evil laugh* ]</i></font><br><br>Herein lies the problem. <br><br>The reason we added the confirmation box was that we received overwhelming requests for such a thing at the last Fan Faire. <br><br>Now you (and others) want the box removed. <br><br>But, if we remove the box, the folks that asked for it in the first place will be upset, and will begin sending in requests to put it back&#8230; <br><br>I've seen that happen a lot since I started this job. In a case like this, where there is no clearly correct or overwhelmingly preferred option, which ever option is currently in place will be the one that we are told people don't want. <br><br>I would imagine that it is just as unlikely that someone will fall asleep and need to be sent home as it is that someone will take advantage of their ability to send someone home against their will. <br><br>For now, we're going to stick with the box. But I'll bring this up at the next tuning meeting and see if we can use some other method to make this work.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000120.html"><b>Transporters</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, as I recall, in Star Trek, replicators operate on a molecular resolution...much like the cargo transporters. (Personnel transporters work on a quantum resolution.) This prevents, say, replicating living things...or extremely complex materials such as latinum. <br><br>As for the transporters, there is a biofilter which eliminates dangerous microorganisms. I don't know why the transporters don't repair wounds...if I had to guess, though, I'd say it's because the matter-to-energy conversion is far too complex to make such changes while in the pattern buffers...it's easier to prevent a certain organism from being transported than it is to rebuild that organism in transport. ]</i></font><br><br>I distinctly remember an episode (or a film, it's all a blur) where someone was recreated from an old transporter image. He (probably Kirk) had forgotten everything that had transpired since he was killed (some sort of transporter accident&#8230;), or his molecules were scattered about the universe or something&#8230; <br><br>Anyhow&#8230; they can make pork chops with that thing, they could probably recreate me&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>EverQuest: Plot & Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor emitted: "But for the new player, who has never seen the old content, the fact that Qeynos is 'new' won't add much to the value of the game for them. Whereas new content is new for everyone." <br><br>In one sense, you're very right. I was partying with some folks the other day who started playing about a year ago, and I mentioned something about "since Kithicor was changed". They were completely confused, especially when I told them that Kith used to be a n00bie zone. To newer players, it's almost as if Bloody Kithicor never happened. (That's a sad fact, but is beside the point of what I'm getting at here.) <br><br>In another sense, this isn't the whole truth. For example, even after two years of being involved in EverQuest, my highest-level character is at 21. I'm certainly not high enough level to experience a large portion of the game, and that includes much of the content that was released new since EQ's release in 1999: most of the Planes, Velious, and much of Kunark. <br><br>You can go on releasing new high-level content, and you can tweak and change the existing high-level content as much as you like, but it'll be new to me once I finally get there. The question is really whether new players will be more likely to stick with EQ and derive more enjoyment from their low-level play if the low-level content is updated and redesigned as well. <br><br>Another way to look at it is, if you change Qeynos Hills or Misty Thicket or Butcherblock Mountains, you're updating content accessible by nearly the entire player base, and what's more, you're updating around a pre-existing structure, taking care of most of the work of content development. When you do another add-on or change some underused zone in the depths of Velious, you're excluding a lot of casual gamers from experiencing our ever-changing Norrath. <br><br>The plague of Bertoxxulous in the Karanas is a great example of the sorts of things that should be going on all the time in EverQuest. Huge expansions of high-level content may be more exciting from a press-release standpoint, but as game designers, it's just as important that the entire game be kept exciting. To be honest, I'm quite surprised that Freeport has yet to be taken over by Dark Elves (or the same for Neriak).... :)<br><br>Well, I got long winded too (hehehe!), so I'll be done now. :)<br><br>Nizanko Seigikan<br>21st Shaman of The Tribunal<br>Norrathian's Justice, Solusek Ro ]</i></font><br><br>While Misty is certainly accessible to nearly everyone, it's not used by everyone&#8230; <br><br>The Plague is certainly the sort of thing that we'd like to do more of. <br><br>And I'd be pretty shocked if the folks in Freeport could manage the firepower to take Neriak, that place is a fortress. Freeport, on the other hand, is as defensible as Swiss cheese. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First a coment. I agree the adding more content has it's vaule of expanding the world and creating new places to explore. But changing the exiting content makes it feel alive. Ever expanding content adds bredth, altering existing content adds depth. I am a huge fan of the game and salute the abitious expansions to add bredth. However, I and probably a large majority of long time players, would like to see more depth. I would even trade a new zone for a monthly change in content. It doesn't always have to be major, but something should be changing out there. More than it is now. <br><br>Second, our (as players) creating the story. I'll drink to that! I have been runinng and participating in weekly "raids" for more than a year now with a group that started at level 4 "raiding" blackburrow. We crawl dungeons, scour countrysides and generally make the most of the content that is there. We try to follow or create story lines that go with these weekly adventures and have found a wealth of places to do so. But, what we are doing is artificially inserting stories over the existing environment. What we lack are additional tools. <br><br>For instance: We recently had a story of a character dissapearing. After some research she was discovered to have been captured by the Kly and being converted in Delnir. So, we went on a rescue mission to save her. This fit nicely with the content already avaialable. But, what we wanted to do (in the story) was do a sort of "upside down" crawl. We wanted to put the hapless victem in the bottom of Delnir and have the party "ported" to her location with no knowledge of their location. (as the story unfolded the group still did not know where we were going to fight that night) In doing so they would then need to fight their way out of a dungeon with no maps, no idea where they were and a party member that was "off". (Hugging Kly believers and then attacking them) <br><br>For reasons I understand from a "big picture" point of view we couldn't get a GM to port us into the bottom of Delnir. Still, it would have REALLY helped the story line. The GM's wanted to, but it was a violation of policy. <br><br>My VERY long winded point is this. GM's need to be given a little more freedom to help players out that are working to create a story line. We all would have gladly agreed to not petition for help, corpse recovery or anything if the GM had been able to help us out. We were accepting a wild risk for some great fun. We belonged in Delnir. We were of the apropriate level and size, so we were not abusing the powers. It was clear to everyone including the GM's, but their hands were still tied. <br><br>Free the GM's! (hehehehe) <br><br>Ziff Harbinger<br>Dusk Eternal<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately we just don't have one GM for every 6 players, like we usually to playing pen and paper. And we are also constrained but the fact that this game has to be played on the computer, not in our heads. <br><br>So, as players, you have to be more clever (and, sometimes, less creative) with your story lines. You have to try harder to work within the restrictions of the game. <br><br>We'd like nothing more than to have a game flexible enough that your capture scenario would have worked. That would probably be a good goal for any game like ours to try to make possible.</UL>

Perhaps the greatest mystery surrounding the upcoming expansion has finally been answered by Alan.  In his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000117.html">latest update</a> to the Developer's Corner he informs us of the correct way to pronounce Luclin:<UL><b><i>When I first saw reference to the upcoming expansion, I pronounced it with a soft "u" and "c" sounding as "k," in other words Luclin = "Luck*lin." The more I thought on it, the less sure I felt. A friend said she thought it was pronounced with a hard "u" and "c" sounding as "s", or Luclin = "Loose*lin." This sounded better to me, but several coworkers confused the issue by agreeing with the hard "u" but reverting to "k," Luclin = "Luke*lin." As I rule out a soft *u* and *s* (Luss*lin?) combo, which of the other three is correct?<br><br>Thanks =)</b></i><br><br>This I can answer. It's pronounced LuckLynn. You were right the first time.<br><br>Alan</UL>Hey, it's a start. :)

From Merliben Halliwax:<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes. And that is all I know!" Zarn continued. "I was getting to the end when i remembered my errand." <br>"Oh, you blunderhead! You left me thinking there was much more!" Thurbiz scoffed. <br><br>"Bah! Blunderhead, indeed! I have found out some very interesting news and you call me a blunderhead?" Zarn cried. "You are always nosing about, i thought you should like to know about this kind of thing!" <br><br>"Not nosing about! Finding things out! And it is usually dark, nasty business as it has always been, not just finding half dead theives in windmills! But come..." Thurbiz continued before Ialle or Zarn could correct him with a "Scout!", "Let us put our heads together a moment. Obviously if there are Gnomes attacking Gnomes with the Help of gigantic skeletons somewhere, this is not the best situation. Necromancy is a disease, it seems, spreading across the face of Norrath. First the Gnomes in the Mines of Old, or rather, the Mines of Malfunction..." <br><br>Mumbled agreements from Ialle and Zarn followed. It was well known to the Halliwax Family that Zakis Halliwax was slain in the Mines deep in Ak'Anon by Necromancers of Bertoxxulous, but nothing could ever be proved to the King's Court. <br><br>".. and now it has turned up half a world away! I should not be worried if it were not gnomes... we have sharp minds and they could do much damage to the good worshippers of Brell..." Thurbiz continued. <br><br>More muttered agreements. <br><br>"So... in light of the fact that we have become lazy, fat Gnomes.. AND that this is a great threat to Norrath in general, and the Gnomish Good name in particular, I say we find out what we can from this .... Scout. And then we do something about it." Thurbiz insisted. <br><br>"Hear Hear! " Zarn agreed. "I don't know all about the gnomish good name, but I do know that you have become quite fat and lazy indeed and DO need a good adventure!" he chuckled. <br><br>- from the Fourth Book of the Halliwax history dealing with the war against the Children of Isharuuk<br><br>To read all the books of Halliwax history, visit the Thurfiz' Kin library at <a href="http://thurfiz-kin.8m.com">http://thurfiz-kin.8m.com</a><br><br>Also, the Enemy's library at <a href="http://isharuuks-children.4t.com">http://isharuuks-children.4t.com</a> is interesting and they are in need of new members.<br><br>Merliben Halliwax<br>Wizard of Solusek Ro<br>Leader of Thurfiz' Kin - Tallon Zek</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Banegrivm brings us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>It had been thought what would be the coming of the Plaguebringer was just <br>that. As events unfolded about us in Norrath things were discovered. The veil <br>that seals Veeshan off from Norrath finally begind to break way and Now the <br>Bloodsabres and their unholy allies seek to summon the Lord of Decay into <br>Norrath. In Firiona Vie's return to Felwithe it was discovered that Tunare <br>herself now seeks entry into Norrath. This is only the beginning. <br><br>Long ago the ancient wurm Trakanon revealed his prophecy of the end times to <br>Edril the Lancer; the last of his chosen heroes of the days that prepare to <br>unfold before us now. The strange circles that have been sighted throughout <br>the lands also seem to herald this coming war as indicated by what seems to <br>be their marks or holy symbols upon it. As evidence by these circles within <br>the Rathe Mountains and Lake, Oasis of Marr, Castle Mistmoore, and Neriak <br>just to name a few of the locations. <br><br>Further information on the war can be found by way of www.1fol.cjb.net under <br>the war thread. As to where it concerns to the realm of Druzzil Ro I am <br>concerned for I would hate to think of what might happen if we were all <br>caught off guard when the gods may come, and their minions might come as <br>well. Whose to say a god would not show without henchment and or followers. <br>Think the Bloodsabres would stand idly by while Bertoxxulous walked the lands <br>assaulted by adventurers or another god? <br><br>As such I am asking everyone that sees this missive hailing from the lands of <br>Druzzil Ro to bind together. I saw what happened at Bloody Kithicor and we <br>were fortunate to have pulled together that day across the field of battle. I <br>would have hate to imagine the carnage that would have been had we all not <br>chosen to share the field that day. Thus being the case I am asking all <br>guilds to please join us at the Inner Council. <br><br>I realize everyone may not see eye to eye, however I would like to think that <br>we are also adults and could put aside our differences for a time to see this <br>thing through. No faction or group will stand alone, we MUST stand together <br>or all WILL be lost. We are to a time when we have no choice. Again, I am <br>asking that we could all come together. If we can stand together, all of <br>us...we stand a chance, if we become proud then we will fall and the streets <br>shall be paved in our blood. <br><br>I would ask all those that would come to throw their hand to the war front in <br>our realm to please post to the war thread for those guilds that wil join us, <br>and a war council will be conveiened the following week for all of us to <br>gather about and further discuss things. Again, ALL GUILDS are welcome and <br>INVITED to enter into the round table of the Inner Council. <br><br>May the light shine trut, <br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>Inner Council Member </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Tzuten Tsunami informed of of a recent event that involves Firiona Vie:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings fellow adventurers,<br><br>	Last evening I recieved a message from my dear friend Timbre that<br>the Firiona Vie has returned to Greater Faydark. Seeing that I am a curious<br>sort, and my current adventure within Kedge Keep was successful,  I decided<br>to see this for myself. I followed the mass of players as Firiona led them<br>from the gates of the High Elven City to Lesser Faydark. Many feel into<br>blackness (/ooc went LinkDead) when we entered Lesser Faydark. Seeing this<br>has my oppurtunity to speak with the Princess, I offered my humble services<br>as a monk. She smiled and thanked me.<br><br>	It seems that she was searching for an old friend of hers. The<br>Unicorn that wanders about in that forest. In short time the unicorn made an<br>appearance and spoke to the assembled crowd. Some of the followers of Cazic<br>Thule and the darker gods were on hand to "heckle" the Princess and the<br>unicorn (/ooc roleplaying Player Characters). Those were met with stern<br>words from myself and the others who guarded Firiona. At times I found<br>myself quiet vocal in the defense of this Elven Princess.<br><br>	It seems to be that they are trying to summon the "Avatar of Tunare"<br>and they need four magical stones to do it. With the knowledge of the stones<br>existance (but alas, not their location) we headed back to the King. While<br>Firiona told the King what was needed to bring forth the "Avatar of Tunare"<br>more hecklers interrupted the King (/ooc more RolePlaying Player<br>Characters), and more people defended the king (myself included). The King<br>then began to call forth those people that traveled with Firiona to thank<br>them. I was quiet shock when I was summoed before the King and given a token<br>of his thanks. I and the others who recieved a token was told to seek out<br>one called Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato and show him the token we recieved. We<br>thanked the King and Princess and left the hall.<br><br>	We found Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato in a nearby inn and each of us<br>was giving an item suitable to our class for aidding Firiona. I recieved an<br>Earring of AC 5 effect: Haste.<br><br>Here are some Screenshots of the Event:<br><br>Tzuten meeting Firiona Vie and stumbling on his words:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_and_friona_meet.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_and_friona_meet.jpg</a><br>Tzuten is summoned by the King Thex:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/summoned_king.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/summoned_king.jpg</a><br>Tzuten is praised by the King:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_is_praised.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_is_praised.jpg</a><br>The Coin...<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/the_coin.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/the_coin.jpg</a><br>Announcement from Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_name_in_lights.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_name_in_lights.jpg</a><br>The Earring I recieved:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/earring.gif">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/earring.gif</a> <br><br>(/ooc I would like to that those evil roleplayers, for making the event that<br>much more special, that Iksar Monk*forgot your name* and the High Elf in the<br>King's Court.

From PlanetEverQUest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Shadow Knights</a>.  Shadow Knights are the evil counterparts to Paladins. Part warrior and part necromancer, these evil knights use the powers of the undead to aid them in their battle against the forces of good. Shadow Knights work best in group combat but through the use of a pet and their dark magic can solo very effectively. But there's so much more to these dark knights .. how much do you know about them? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the dark warriors of the realms.  Harm touch isn't the only thing that shadow knights can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Shadow Knights of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Here is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000132.html"><b>Annul Magic Update</b></a><br>Just a small update. I have been informed that this scroll has been updated and Enchanters will no longer be listed as able to use the spell after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000139.html"><b>Guardian Robe</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, <br><br>I obtained a Guardian Robe from Skyshrine a while back and I play a Wood Elf Druid. This robe has nice stats and is a fairly rare item for a Wood Elf to have. The problem that I have with it is it displays as a PINK TUNIC!! I am a male Wood Elf and get ridiculed alot by fellow players for wearing pink. Is there any way that this item could have a Robe texture added instead of just being a pink shirt with some trees on it? I would really appreciate this because i really like the magic resistances and mana that this item gives and have no plans of changing it anytime soon. <br><br>Thanks<br>Tomwin - Cazic-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately, some races just don't have robe textures. <br><br>Wood Elves are one of them. The rest are, I think, Dwarves, Half Elves, Halflings, Ogres and Trolls. Any race that doesn't have a native Intelligence caster doesn't have a robe texture. It's one of those things that had to be left out for efficiency when the game was built. <br><br>So if your character is wearing a robe and you don't see a robe, that's why. Or if you see some robes that fit several races and classes and wonder why your race can't wear it, that's probably also why. It's not usually a bug. We just didn't make too many robes that would fit people that have no robe texture in the game to display. <br><br>What you are seeing is a tint to one of the other textures available to your race. Why it's pink&#8230; that may remain a mystery. I'll prod a few people and see what I can find out. I would think that a truly tough guy could get along just fine in pink.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000140.html"><b>Cleric Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A long while ago, when Kunark was released you guys said something to the fact of 'Spells will now be dropping, but the spells that are the 'core' of your character will still be purchaseable at NPC vendors. (That isnt verbose, since it was almost a year ago, but that was the gist of it) When Velious came out, a new healing spell was added to the game for clerics called Celestial Healing, now I dont know about you, but for a level 44 spell this one sure does seem hard to get, I'm level 57 and i've been trying to get it because i'm trying to get ALL of my spells, ya know? =) I'm just wondering if placing this spell on really hard monsters was intentional? <br><br>Also there is sort of a rumor spell floating around called Turning of the unnatural, I'm wondering if this spell exists, that is all. I've never ever seen a single cleric that has it, and i've never seen it drop. <br><br>Oh, and please look at the RageFire spawn! =p hahah =) ( I had to throw that in there ) <br><br>Mishy ]</i></font><br><br>For more on that: <br><br>quote: <br>----<br>With Velious we decided to only sell the level 34 spells, and have the rest be drops on the continent. It was our intent to make these spells fairly common. Unfortunately some of these spells were a little too rare. We have addressed this by upping the 39 and 44 spell drops on the Test Server, this change should go live next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-----<br><br>One of those spells is the Turning of the Unnatural.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>Dynamic Changes/EverQuest Ingame Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I certainly would love to play in a world such as you describe. But many people wouldn't. There are a lot of EverQuest players that do not like the idea of allowing a GM to 'smite down' their characters, from on high or from below, with or without reason. << <br><br>We'll leave the discusion of "Dynamic Changes to the Environment" for another day, as I concede that the task is too large for the current incarnation of EQ...I bring it up mostly as a suggestion for future events. <br><br>The point you make above, however is a very, very valid concern. The same difficulty comes about in every P-N-P (pen and paper :)) RPG that I played. People feel very strongly when they invest time and effort into a character. It's very easy to see any permanent changes to that character as being an attack on the fruits of their labors. <br><br>People generally do not like for situations to get beyond what they consider to be a level of "their control", and some such people refuse to tolerate it. Many people like the security of knowing that the have determined: how they're going to play, that they know the risks, that they accept the risks, and as a result can move forward around the board toward whatever goal they have in mind. <br><br>It is, in fact, one of the things that makes EQ a wonderful game. I know (for example) that there are certain situations where I can advance and be reasonably assured that nothing catastrophic will happen to me. This allows me to spend time doing new, dangerous things, without feeling that I won't ever be able to recover. Dragon raids would be far less common if there was a chance that you could permanently end up in the Dragon's belly. (I believe in this sort of world, too, but it's definitely not EQ's ideology). <br><br>However, when you come to the concept of story, I think it's important to consider the role of a GM as a creator and "prime mover" for his/her world. Whenever someone plays a P-N-P RPG, to a certain extent they are empowering the Game Master to take action against their characters in order to support the storyline and to create a conflict for them to resolve. This can be driven by the GM's ideas for the game, or can come about as a consequence of their own actions. It is that "conflict" (be it a puzzling enigma, a challenging foe, or an adventurous discovery) that drives the story forward. In a sense, they give up some of the security they feel about their characters in exchange for a more dynamic experience, and (hopefully) a free enough hand to spin an entertaining story. If you don't accept the dangers outside of Hobbiton, you'll never experience the wonder of the Lonely Mountain. <br><br>Thus we come to my true point (long winded, aren't I?). I think that the people who would be more interested in a highly "Roleplay" oriented server are also the people who would be very willing to see the Game Masters have such Power. I believe they would (and ultimately MUST) be willing to accept that the GM's have creative control to whatever extents can be given. This allows the GM's the power to not only Roleplay effectively themselves, but to weave a storyline that is unique to their character experiences (with potential permanent consequences). It's accepted that the EQ world can't really be made dynamic, but it seems that many aspects of the Characters themselves COULD be affected (as long as such was within the context of a well-executed storyline). <br><br>Obviously, such a redefinition of "GM Powers" would have to be explained to someone going to such a server right from the start (in much the same way as the PvP servers have explanations associated with them). Each story seed that can be planted is another opportunity to Roleplay, and it seems that more dynamic capabilities (even those capable within the game engine today) would be a natural complement. <br><br>Again, more for you to chew on, as it's a subject that I'm (obviously) keenly interested in. <br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names ]</i></font><br><br>You sure are long winded! :)  But that's a good thing. <br><br>I've had this discussion before, on the old boards, with a player. In the end I think we agreed to disagree (though I also admit that I appear to be in the minority with this issue). I often feel somewhat cheated if I do something while roleplaying (pen and paper) that really deserved to get my character killed, and yet he survives. Happened just last weekend, though it wasn't me that made the mistake. One of us did something that should have gotten us all killed. While I certainly understand that killing the whole party could really crimp the game a bit, letting us live doesn't really make me happy either. It's hard to explain, but when I play, I fully expect the GM to kill my character when it's appropriate, when it would have happened if the characters were real. <br><br>When we don't suffer the 'realistic' penalties for our actions, the game world is a little less convincing. <br><br>Yes, I hate losing a good character. And, yes, I'll admit that most of the time I'd rather that the GM 'cheat' in our favor, especially when playing it out straight would mean starting all over or the end of the campaign. But if you play long enough and characters never suffer the true repercussions of their actions, the world that you're playing in gets less and less believable, and you are less and less likely to be afraid when your character <b>should</b> be afraid. <br><br>I do agree, though, that IF a server were set up wherein the GMs were given and expected to use their powers to enliven the game setting, even at the expense of some well deserved character deaths, that a warning to that effect would be needed. I also agree that I'd want to play on that server, very much. <br><br>The nice thing is that when you're in Norrath, no loss is truly permanent. Lost items and experience can be regained. So while some people are certainly upset at such losses, they are never going to be permanent by force of the game (some people might not bother to recover a lost item, though). Whereas if a pen and paper GM kills a character or destroys an item, such a thing can be permanent. So giving the GMs that added (and I agree necessary) freedom over the world and the player characters shouldn't be too intimidating, even to those that have never played a pen and paper roleplaying game. <br><br>See, I can be long winded too (and I held myself back!) :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, thank you for the reply to my comment. <br><br>I would agree that we (as players) have license to write our own story, create our character, and roleplay to that story, but what is lacking right now from this design is the ability to accurately perceive the story of Norrath, as a Civilization, as a World, and all that entails. <br><br>I would like to be able to respond, and more importantly, tailor the reactions of my character to the events that occur on a "Grand Scale". In order to do that, I would have to know more about the "living history" of Norrath as a civilization on a wordly scale. <br><br>What I mean about a Grand Scale and living history would be those events that have the tendacy to alter the fabric of Norrathian culture, environment, etc either temporararily (IE what's going on now with Good Ole' Bert, assuming it is temporary) or permantantly (I.E. the change in Undead spawning during the evening hours in Kithicor, or the Fabric that was torn to form a gateway to Hate when it first launched). <br><br>If I were able to know the events and storyline of what leads up to those moments, I would feel much more a part of the Norrathian history, and, thus, have more input to developing my character in response to those events. I understand that I may not have the possibility of directly influencing or triggering such events, but I'd very much like to be involved in them more then I am today (IE by actually knowing WHY they occur, when and how without scouring the internet for news, or talking to 500 NPCs). <br><br>I think an appropriate solution would be to record, publish and promote such events in the Roleplay way. For instance, as these events occur (or soon thereafter), record them in an RP manner (a gnome journalist witnessing an event, or a bard spinning a yarn of his experience during such events). Record them and then publish them. Then promote them in the way of News items on the Fan Sites, or at Harpy's Head. <br><br>I think I and many other folk would appreciate the effort of recording the details of the World History of Norrath and communicate them to the players in order to further enable us to develop our characters. <br><br>Sorry for the long post :)<br><br>Aloran Al`Aan<br>Tunare Server ]</i></font><br><br>It seems we're all long winded when we're on an interesting subject. :)<br><br>A lot of the details that people seek are available in game. I recently had a friend ask me what was up with the weird green mist in the Karanas. I asked him if he had asked any of the NPCs what was going on, or if he had even slowed down while running through the zone. He hadn't. <br><br>Now I will be the first to admit that there could be more of this sort of thing available in game. But I always hesitate about putting it up on a web site. How good is it to bypass the need for characters to actually go someplace in the game world to learn about what's going on? Something interesting going on in Halas? Rather than going to Halas and getting involved in it, people would just go to the web site and read about it&#8230; <br><br>I would much rather see something like a herald in most towns reporting local news than a web site doing so. <br><br>But I am also more interested in people knowing what's going on than I am in preserving my own notions of the right way and the wrong way to pass out that knowledge.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Your comments regarding the "story" of Everquest are, to a large extent, true. Each player writes their own stories as they play the game, etching a bit of themselves into Norrath's history. But I, like many other players, with that Verant would take a more active role in making Norrath a more dynamic place. <br><br>Take, for instance, the plague currently rolling through the Karanas. Word of this event got to me offline, and encouraged me to sign back on after I had stopped playing for a short while. The world is changing? That got me excited! The ongoing events leading up to that are a fascinating story and make the world feel all the more real, even if they did take far too long to unfold. It has led me to abandon the never-ending experience quest in lieu of exploring the world and talking to its denizens, something I have not done in some time. <br><br>Bloody Kithicor, an infamous world event if ever there was one, is an example of the kind of events that can make Norrath exciting. I was not around for Bloody Kithicor, having come on board shortly after. Reading about it from one involved player's point of view (read the fascinating tale here <a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net">www.1fol.cjb.net</a>, under "We are at War") made me almost drool with the thought of the green mists leading to an event of this magnitude. <br><br>My point is this: GM Events are wonderful diversions and add a bit of flavor to the world, but they do little to make Norrath an ever-changing, unpredictable place. And Norrath must be ever-changing and unpredictable to sustain long term interest. Expansions fill that role, but there are only so many possible, eh? Not all events need be on the scale of Bloody Kithicor or what is happening in the Karanas, either. Just small things to add to the mystique of the world. <br><br>For instance, what if, for a month or two, the Kerrans decided to fight back against the Erudites? Change some of the Toxx spawns to Kerran warriors and such - a nightmare for those who've gotten bad faction. Add some new comments for NPCs to say regarding the Kerrans' attack, both in Toxx and the two appropriate cities. Maybe add a wandering Erudite guard or two to Toxx, so they can fight with Kerrans. Maybe a few temporary quests surrounding it, but those are 100 percent needed. Shortly thereafter, revert back to situation normal, with some lingering NPC comments about it for a few months afterwards. <br><br>What if the Qeynos guards discovered the activities in Fish's Ale and shut the place down for good? Burned it to rubble, leaving its shell in Qeynos forevermore? The city would never be the same. Some of the NPCs can remain in city in the general area. The city folk can talk about what happened. And maybe, just maybe, the workers at the establishment took up shop in the aqueducts, keeping the quests alive and in place. <br><br>In my opinion, each patch should bring some small but noticeable change to the world, some bigger that all will see, and others that only some. Simple changes in NPC comments alone would be a huge and very welcome addition to the game. Just that would be fantastic. <br><br>I know I've gone on for some time, but I'm sure I am not alone in this. I think the green mist in the Karanas has renewed interest in the actual world of Norrath, as has Luclin. I'd love to see Verant make it a living, breathing place. <br><br>Talmer [Winter Raven]<br>Ranger, Bristlebane Server ]</i></font><br><br>And I think most people would agree. Having the world change like that would be great. <br><br>But it's not as easy to do as you might think. The time it takes to come up with interesting events for the old world could just as easy be applied to new material. New material, such as Luclin, adds to the game world. The value of new content over changing old content is, well, new content adds to the volume of the 'stuff' in the world. For a long time player, that new content might have the same value as revising old content (making it 'dynamic'). But for the new player, who has never seen the old content, the fact that Qeynos is 'new' won't add much to the value of the game for them. Whereas new content is new for everyone. <br><br>And there is a lot more to making seemingly simple changes to zones. For example, burning down a bar in Qeynos would, basically, require rebuilding the zone (though not extensively, for certain). Any NPCs that talk about that bar in any portion of the game world would have to have their text revised. Any quests that too place in that bar would need re-working. And the players would have to download the whole zone. <br><br>Despite all that, I am in agreement with you, in theory at least. And I certainly understand how such things can make the game more exciting.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000119.html"><b>Questions about Cannibalize 2, 3 ,4 </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to every shaman I have talked to, every board I have read, each tiny bit of information I can scrape up, canabalize 4 does not drop anywhere, is not for sale anywhere, does not have a quest anywhere. <br><br>Was this done on purpose to torture the shaman community or is this just another glitch that needs fixed?

It seems to have about 5 or 6 lines of text in it but it vanishes before I can read what the text says.. It is not a Windows-generated error or confirmation box of any kind, and from what I am able to see it seems to have an "EQ style" appearance to it. From reading threads on several EQ boards it appears to be showing up on several other player's PC's as well but since it exists for such a short period most have likely missed it. Could you shed any light on what this box is? <br><br>Purifyre Morticus<br>Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The issue is that someplace in the exit code it's trying to print text to the chat window, but that state of the user interface is not really valid at the time this occurs and it ends up redrawing the chat window area as if it's in the old non-fullscreen mode. So you get a flash of the parchment with some text on it just before the screen is updated with the character select or server select screen. <br><br>- Rowyl ]</i></font><br><br>So, basically, it's not subliminal advertising.

The Test Server is the subject Shadoe explores in his latest article titled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid988510119,92452,"><b>When Proddies Attack</a></b>.  The following is a clip from this editorial:<UL>One thing you have to understand about Test Server players, is that they value their isolation. No, not value&#8230; covet. I can't emphasize enough how compelling this sentiment is to these people, even to the point where they brave the ever-present threat of complete character wipes to obtain it. The Test Server has already weathered one item wipe, triggering an exodus the likes of which Fidel Castro has never seen. What does that tell you about those players who chose to remain? <br><br>I have to admit, I was one of those who chose to stay. Though I left to play elsewhere for a while out of spite, my characters remained on Test, placed in a state of suspended animation with the hopes of being cured by future generations. A cure was never discovered, so I continue to play on both Test and production servers to this day. In my arrogance, I believe this qualifies me to lecture you, the reader, on what happens in the Test Server when proddies attack.

Another round of updates were spotted the Developers Corner today posted by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000136.html"><b>Kodiaks in the Great Divide </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to one of the latest patch messages, Kodiaks in the Great Divide were supposed to be seen as "animals" and be affected be Animal specific spells. My friends and I went hunting there last night (Fri, 3/30/01) and guess what? They arent. We all got messages saying that "this spell may only be cast on animals". As we were set to do a little fear hunting and our spells and attacks were geared for it. Luckily, we could root and move to remem spells and change plans. No one died, but it was close. I did petition a GM and he did tell me that the code did not go into this patch as was announced. <br><br>Please tell others about this, I just dont want anything like this to happen to anyone else because they beleived the mis-information posted on the patch message. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Kirlan Oakthorn (Ranger, level 38th, Druzzil Ro) ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry for the confusion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This change currently exists on Test server, however in the last patch we did not patch Great Divide, this change should go live in the next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe ]</i></font><br><br>So the change should make it in the next patch. Again, I'm sorry for the error in the patch message.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thought</b></a><br>Danyela wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I posted a comment about this yesterday, but I did not get an email response letting me know it had been received, so I am submitting it again. <br><br>Many months ago, when enchanters were getting defensive about the dillution of their defining class abilities, a promise was made rather vehemently that no items would ever be placed in the game that granted the wearer a clarity effect. This was to guarantee that enchanters would always have something unique they could do, especially in light of all the illusions and other versatility given to other classes that used to be the domain of the enchanter. <br><br>Now, with the upgrade of the planes, Cazic Thule himself drops items that grant the effect of Flowing Thought. Ok, that isn't officially clarity, but 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' should come to mind. It may not be clarity, but it sure acts like it. Even better in many respects as it never wears off. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I can only guess that you're not very familiar with the actual effect of Flowing Thought. <br><br>I'm an advocate of the whole idea of not blurring the class lines. But here your are concerned about something that if rubbed vigorously on that line, with much force and perseverance, won't even smudge it. If Flowing Thought acts like clarity, then I act like a Pulitzer Prize winning author&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' <br><br>This is true, however the difference between Flowing Thought I and Clarity II is more like the difference between a rose and a dandelion. <br><br>- L. Poe ]</i></font><br><br>To top all that off, we're talking about the New Cazic here, not the little baby Cazic that you used to know&#8230; <br><br>And I wanted to let you all know that we won't be sending individual e-mail responses to every comment. We don't have the resources for that. There is a confirmation page that you'll see when you successfully send in a comment. If you see that, rest assured that we have received your comment. There's no need to send it in again. I'm sorry that we can't respond to every comment. I'd like to, but it's just not possible.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000010.html"><b>Absor Wrong!</b></a><br>Furgan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You Wrote 'All area of effect spells will damage the caster.' <br><br>Actually, all AOE rain spells will damage the caster, not all AOE spells. Lighting storm is an AoE rain spell and as such it will damage the caster. You may want to go back an post a followup to your comment that it was intentional that an AOE Rain spell was chosen as the proc for this weapon, since I beleive that is more of what the original person was asking. ]</i></font><br><br>And to make it worse&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: He's right. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe ]</i></font><br><br>It seems that I was wrong&#8230; :)<br><br>My point still stands, though. Not all weapons can be the best weapon in the game. This one has uses. The fact that some people won't use a certain items does not mean that we need to change it so that it is a more powerful item.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000137.html"><b>Damage Shields</b></a><br>Cedral wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I always wondered why player-cast damage shields are unresistable. <br><br>It seems strange that a level 50 rock golem would take damage while pounding a level 9 character with a thistle coat. <br><br>Don't you find it odd that a monster that easily resist Draught of Fire (51 wizard) is burned every time by the lowliest magician damage shield?]</i></font> <br><br>The answer to that, really, is: Because they are, that's why. :)<br><br>Thistle coat is easy, it's a physical object. If the golem could resist it, then it would be resisting sword blades and arrows. <br><br>The fire one is different. I could, I suppose, come up with a good enough explanation for it. Like perhaps the fact that the shield resides within the aura of the person being hit, that shield is much stronger than normal fire spells. Or that by actively reaching into the fire the opponent is sacrificing his ability to resist the fire. <br><br>The reality is that those spells just don't give resists, and their power and effectiveness is based on that fact. If they were resistible they might be more powerful. <br><br>Though I like the idea that in order to reach into that fire to attack their enemy, someone has to give up his resistance. They are willingly putting themselves into the fire, and that gives it the power to burn them. I'll stick with that one.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000130.html"><b>Server Split Questions</b></a><br>I'm going to respond within your post. With so many questions, it's easier to read if the answers appear directly after the questions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have been playing EQ for about 6 months now, and I have found out that the server I play on was initially a split server. Recently, a new split server (Zebuxaruk) was opened, splitting off E'Ci and The Rathe, as I recall. <br><br>My questions revolve around split server economics, and are many. Though you might be able to answer several or all of them with a simple publicized policy statement regarding split servers. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, there isn't a lot of mystery about it, but I'll answer your questions as best as I can. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1. What metrics do you use to determine when or if a split server is created, and what servers it draws from? ]</i></font><br><br>We create new servers based on all sorts of factors. Primarily we put one up when their seems to be a need because of overcrowding on existing servers. There's no science to deciding whether a new server will be a 'split' or a new server. We judge that based on the perceived need as much as anything. And when it is a split server, we will split people from servers that are the most crowded. Keep in mind that some servers don't have their busiest times when others do. Recently, for example, we split Karana when it wasn't one of the top two busiest servers during the usual prime time. It was, however, much more crowded during its own prime time than the others were in theirs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Why are all the split servers delineated from exactly two "older" servers? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think one was split from three servers. Splitting from two servers usually gives both the older servers the relief they need, while not flooding the new server with too many people. More than two could easily fill the new server (when you include players that start fresh on that server) so much that the new server would be needing a split&#8230; And that sort of defeats the purpose. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Why are there not more opportunities to "split" from one server to another? ]</i></font><br><br>Undercrowding is just as much of a problem as overcrowding. We won't split a server based only on a slight or possibly a temporary increase in population. Splitting a server and ending up with an underpopulated server is something we need to avoid. We always approach adding servers with caution, nobody really knows how a server will react to a split, how many people will move and how many will stay. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. Once a new server is designated the "split to server", what is the likelihood of it becoming the "split from server" and in what time frame?]</i></font><br> <br>It's really the other way around. We'll usually identify that we need to split a server or two and then gear up to set up a server to split them to. The timeframe varies, as do all things, based on what's going on here or with our Ops department at the time. But we can move pretty fast. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. What happens in the case that you have characters on both of the servers being split from and you /movelog from both servers? ]</i></font><br><br>If you have a total of less than eight characters, then they would all be available to you on the new server. If your total, however, is greater than eight, some of those characters will not be available to you. You'll have to delete the ones that you are willing to lose until you have reduced yourself to just eight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6. What is the procedure when characters from the two different splitting servers have the same name? Who keeps it, who changes? ]</i></font><br><br>When two servers are split to one server, one of the characters with duplicate names will have an 'x' appended to their name at random. The player whose character has had the 'x' appended to its name will be able to have his or her name changed by a GM to a new name. But the character without the 'x' will be the one to keep the original name. If you get the appended 'x' you will have to go by a new name, you won't be getting the old one back.<br><br><br>But, as was the case recently, if characters are moved to a server by a second movelog and there is an existing character with that name on the server, the existing character will keep the name and the new one will have the 'x' appended. The newly moved character can petition to have his name changed to something new. This is one of the risks of moving to a new server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 7. What is the chance of a new server that would allow splits from ANY other server? ]</i></font><br><br>None. For reasons I explained before, the new server would be hopelessly overcrowded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 8. More specifically, what is the chance of Xev and Drinal splitting onto the same server in the future, and if they were to do so, how long into the future do you think that would be? ]</i></font><br><br>I can only guess that you have friends on one of those servers, and you play on another&#8230; :)<br><br>I can't possibly tell you when or if those two servers will be split. The odds of them being split to the same server would seem slim. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 9. Could you explain again publicly why you will not move characters between servers except under the split server scenario? ]</i></font><br><br>There are a few reasons. People would want to switch servers just to avoid their reputations. We don't want people to be able to duck out on their reputations. And server economies vary. Pulling an account with a ton of items that are not as rare on one server to a new server where they are extremely rare provides an advantage to that player. And a lot of moves like that could affect the server as a whole. Moving characters also requires a fair amount of work on our side. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thank you for your response. <br><br>Esqubel Highmind<br>23rd Enchanter of Xev<br>Povar-Tarew Artisans]</i></font><br><br>I hope that clears things up a bit.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000131.html"><b>Divine Glory</b></a><br>Rangerguy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: When 'Divine Glory' wears off it says "Your Divine Strength Glory".

They will not stack. <br><br>It's up to you to decide which effect you prefer. Not all spells will stack with all other spells. Choosing the effect you want on your character is just as important as choosing which spells to memorize.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000132.html"><b>Annul Magic</b></a><br>DarkNature wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: (I couldn't decide if this was for QA or not, but after reading the 'official use' for the QA forum, decided to stick this here.) <br><br>One tiny question: Annul Magic is listed as having a level 61 requirement for Enchanters. Is this "working as intended?" :)]</i></font><br><br>Once again, our spell guy, Mr. Poe, had a comment about this: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: When a spell is listed as being level 61 for a class, it means the spell is not usable by the class. The spell scroll needs to be updated to not have Enchanters listed as one of the classes. ]</i></font><br><br>Listing it as a 61st level spell or having it just not list the class at all really have the same effect. But the cleaner way is to take the class off the list for using the spell. <br><br>You can ask a question like this in either forum. The fact that it seemed like a bug makes it appropriate for the QA forum, but the fact that your question actually covers a game mechanic that some people don't know about makes it something I can answer for you. So either way is fine. :)</UL>
