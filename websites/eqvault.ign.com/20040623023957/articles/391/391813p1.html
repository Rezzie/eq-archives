<span class=dateline>April     01, 2003</span> - &#8220;Control is our praxis; absolute awareness of the chaos that is business and culture. The Unseen live as agents of change, heedless of the particular cause. Upon a few occasions however, I have been forced by circumstance to abandon my own manipulations, and focus on survival.&#8221; <BR>
- From Shades of Gray, the Memoirs of Modus Operandi <BR>
<BR></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
<BR>
Aniyal Zu&#8217;karr stood confidently at the head of a sizable Teir&#8217;dal battalion. House Zu&#8217;karr had been given Llemph&#8217;mal Dai&#8217;tunath, the honored seat, and she was the cause. She was filled with the power of her hatred for the surface folk, and the favor of her god. Her scheming and careful networking had finally come to fruition, and she had been congratulated by Innoruuk himself. Few things could have filled her with more elation at the moment. That is, until she beheld the Prince of Hate approaching through the shadowy Nektulos forest. <BR>
<BR>
He was easily forty feet tall or more, and his eyes burned with the power of divine rage. To Aniyal&#8217;s awestruck eyes, it appeared that he slightly warped reality where he walked. The very air around him seemed to balloon outward as if under extreme heat, totally distorting the background view. Each of his steps thundered as he approached the army of Neriak. Every single Teir&#8217;dal present fell to one knee in the presence of their Father. Some completely prostrated themselves, gibbering prayers and pleading for power. As the great claps of his footsteps came to a stop, the god lowered his gaze to regard the assembled army. Necromancers and warriors, priests and wizards, all had come to his call. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Children of Innoruuk,&#8221; the god boomed, &#8220;The time for vengeance is at hand! Long have you suffered the ignorance of these surface animals. I can feel your hatred of them pulsing through this body, and the time to strike is now!&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
At this, the congregation all rose to their feet and erupted into a horrible cheer, a cry of pervasive wrath and lust. The warriors banged their shields, and the necromancers summoned all manner of decaying creatures from the very ground below them. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;The heathens are aware of my presence,&#8221; the god continued, &#8220;and they will soon march against you. I command you all to join me against their pitiful army, and drive them into the dirt by force of sheer HATE!&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
Once more, the cheer of the dark elves burst to terrifying volume. Innoruuk smiled slow and maliciously, and then turned, squinting as if he heard something. A long moment passed as the Teir&#8217;dal waited for their god to explain. At last, he raised one of his gangly, muscular arms and pointed. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Behold. The ruler of the weak approaches,&#8221; he said. In the distance, the Teir&#8217;dal army could see a massive armored figure striding with resolute composure. It was easily as tall as Innoruuk, and the sound of its steps caused the ground to quake. High above his head, the warrior held a sword of pure fire. And at his feet, an army followed, gleaming just as he did, in righteous fury. <BR>
<BR>
Innoruuk hissed, and then raised both his arms to the sky, laughing with unnatural confidence. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Slay them all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By right of birth, this conquest is yours!&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
The dark elves charged, singing out their god&#8217;s name. Innoruuk himself lumbered after them, still laughing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*           *         *<BR>
&#8220;Aye, but where could he have gone,&#8221; Grimple asked, staring at the ground. The halfling twisted his mace in his hands nervously, and looked up at Modus expectantly. The moon shone serenely down on the both of them, bathing the grove in a pallid embrace. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I do not know for sure, but I have a hunch we&#8217;ll find him in there,&#8221; the mercenary replied, gesturing with his rapier toward the Nektulos forest. They sat where they had been deposited by Catalyst&#8217;s spell, near the secret entrance to Smoke and Mirrors. It had been all but abandoned. Only a few of the Unseen remained, and they were grievously wounded. A quick search had turned up signs of conflict covering the mossy ground. Modus was understandably saddened. <BR>
<BR>
Catalyst had not gated in with them. Whatever he had become, it was obviously more than a mere warrior. They found no trace of the Teir&#8217;dal. Modus silently thought he had likely gone to find Aniyal. The mercenary wanted a chance to socialize with her once more himself - a score remained to be settled. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Dark elf territory,&#8221; Grimple spat. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about you, half-breed, but Nektulos forest is not my idea of a romp in the woods. There is something wrong about that place&#8230;&#8221; Grimple&#8217;s thoughts trailed off as a bedraggled human messenger came charging up. The man stopped, panting. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;What is the news, runner? Tell us how Freeport fares,&#8221; Modus said. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;No time to speak overmuch,&#8221; wheezed the man. His brow was slightly bloodied. &#8220;Mithaniel Marr walks on Norrath! He fights as we speak with the Lord of Hate, there in the forest! I must go now, to conscript reinforcements from Rivervale!&#8221; With that, the man sprinted off, his speed obviously augmented by some form of magic. Dots of blue light trailed behind his steps, and settled on the ground. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;To Nektulos,&#8221; Grimple sighed, and Modus nodded in affirmation. The two approached the entrance to the dark woodland cautiously. Modus scouted silently ahead, while Grimple probed the minds of the various forest creatures for some sort of warning. Before long though, the two lost all cohesion in their movements, for they could feel the battle raging ahead. In moments, they had broken into a dead run for the source of the cacophony they heard ahead. As they approached a break in the solid mesh of trees and brambles, they slowed to a trot, then stopped, staring at the war before them. <BR>
<BR>
Mithaniel Marr was losing, and badly. War is hatred, and it was reflected here most menacingly. The minions of Innoruuk beat back Marr&#8217;s defenders savagely, relishing each cry of pain and summoning more undead with every passing minute. Innoruuk himself held one fist high, and seemed to be draining essence from Marr even as the goodly god hacked at him. Each strike of Mithaniel&#8217;s mighty blade set more and more of Innoruuk afire, but the prince of hate only laughed. He was gaining in size and power, even as his foe lost it. <BR>
<BR>
The human armies were doggedly trying to rally their remaining soldiers, that much was obvious even from where Modus and Grimple stood. Their banners were waved in frantic patterns, trying to pull their people back from death&#8217;s maw, in order to regroup. It was futile. The chaos caused by the vicious Teir&#8217;dal tactics was too consuming, too raw. This was not an honorable skirmish for territory or influence. This was a savage bloodbath, a war with permanent intent. <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, Modus noticed an oddly peaceful little figure approaching Mithaniel Marr, from behind. He was clad in several dirty cloaks, and he seemed to be skipping along at a fair pace. Dumbfounded, the mercenary merely watched as the strange man shed his rags. He appeared to be a Halfling, but he shimmered and changed dynamically. The being began to grow in size, and both sides of the brutal conflict fell to the wayside and watched as the now-massive halfling form winked down at all of them, and then plunged a black dagger into the back of Mithaniel Marr. <BR>
<BR>
And that was the end for the Lord of the Light. With an expression of pain that Modus would never forget, Marr looked back at his killer, and then sank to his knees. Innoruuk, seizing the opportunity, cackled at his good fortune and drew the remaining power from the dying god into himself. He was now absolutely immense, and looked down on the mortals from far above the tallest trees of Nektulos. <BR>
<BR>
Modus knew who the backstabber was, and he shook his head. Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, king of thieves, had betrayed the forces of the light. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I&#8217;m still an atheist, you bastard,&#8221; the mercenary whispered. Even as he spoke, Innoruuk turned to confront this new deity, and began to drain him as well. Bright bursts of yellow light were sucked away from the thief-god&#8217;s chest, and flowed into Innoruuk&#8217;s eager mouth. Bristlebane lashed savagely in defense with his dagger, but it was obvious he would not last long against the might of the hate-king, even after aiding in the destruction of Marr. <BR>
<BR>
Modus looked down at Grimple, his oldest and most trusted friend. The two nodded to each other, thoroughly aware that this might be the last time they saw each other. They clasped arms warmly in goodbye, and then separated. Modus crept away into the dark, and Grimple charged down to aid the goodly defenders with the power of nature. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*         *         *<BR>
Aniyal&#8217;s moment of triumph had come. As her hooded guardsmen scanned the swirl of melee around her carefully, the priestess threw spell after lethal spell into the fray. The sign of Innoruuk was visibly glowing on her back, and she giggled with smug appreciation as Mithaniel Marr&#8217;s body was torn into by the ravenous Trolls and Ogres who had joined the dark Elven cause. They&#8217;ll eat just about anything, she thought, darkly. <BR>
<BR>
Her god was truly colossal now; he rained down magical force which utterly annihilated anyone it touched. Nobody could contest the power of Innoruuk now. As she watched, the Prince of Hate closed his long black fingers around the neck of Bristlebane, and began to squeeze. The thief-god writhed and fought, but it was of no use. As Innoruuk continued to laugh, the huge pseudo-halfling began to turn black. In moments, it struggled no more, and a second god met his death. <BR>
<BR>
The plummeting body crushed several troops from both armies, but it hardly mattered now. All that remained of the surface group were some desperate would-be heroes, and how could they stand against the wrath of Aniyal&#8217;s god? They were doomed, and they knew it. The priestess broke into peals of laughter, and shoved aside one of her guardsmen, in order to crush the skull of a passing dwarf with her wicked mace. She idly licked the blood from one of the spikes, and then stopped as her eyes fell upon someone in the distance. <BR>
<BR>
Limned by a purple halo, a dark silhouette stood on the horizon holding a long, sheathed sword. Aniyal actually laughed out loud, despite the storm of battle around her. <BR>
<BR>
Ahhh, Catalyst has come home, she thought, utterly bemused. This was going to be a great deal of fun. Perhaps he thinks to use his new-found bit of power against me. The fool cannot have forgotten that I still hold his soul. <BR>
<BR>
Aniyal commanded her guards to stand behind her, so that she might receive their wayward son. Several of them snickered at the order. As they stood and watched, the warrior approached, stalking through fire and skirmish without stopping. The purple nimbus around him was growing. At last, he stood in front of them, his expression an unreadable mask. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Hello, my lost manse&#8217;toru,&#8221; Aniyal oozed. &#8220;Have you come home to punish me for your abuse? Or perhaps you wish to re-join your patron house.&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Hello, sister,&#8221; Catalyst said, his voice dangerously calm. &#8220;Or should it be mother? Creator, even?&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You are no blood of mine, marionette,&#8221; Aniyal retorted, enjoying the game. &#8220;You are a tool, though manse&#8217;toru no more. I erred in speaking that just now, for your use has come to pass. And now, I believe it is time for you to act as sacrifice to the one you birthed. Fitting, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;I have come to destroy you all,&#8221; Catalyst stated, without missing a beat. His shining eyes had a frightening aspect of surety. Aniyal was undaunted, however. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;A joke who would slay a god,&#8221; Aniyal laughed. &#8220;You cannot bind the might that is Innoruuk, my fallen plaything. He will tear out your mind and send you reeling into oblivion.&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
Catalyst shook his head. &#8220;You made me, my foolish, ambitious sister. You created me to contain his essence; I am a phylactery unto myself. Innoruuk will fall this day, as the other bastard gods have done. And so will you.&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You cannot act against me, toru. Kneel now, and offer yourself up to the Father.&#8221; Catalyst did not kneel, though he did not advance, either. He seemed to be caught in conflict. His face twitched weirdly, and the tip of his long blade quavered. His spirit was still not present inside him, and he was helpless against her without it. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Kneel! I command it,&#8221; Aniyal intoned, advancing on him and holding her hand high. &#8220;You are compelled! We hold your soul!&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Oh, you mean this,&#8221; came a familiar voice from behind her. One of her elite guard stood forth from the lines, holding the dark bag in which Aniyal held her most vital clerical possessions. From it, the guard&#8217;s gauntleted hand drew forth the shimmering phylactery jar, in which Catalyst&#8217;s soul was held. The bluish fire inside clawed at the glass, licking wildly toward Aniyal. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Who are you,&#8221; Aniyal growled at the guard, catching him in a deadly glare. The guard dropped the bag, and pulled back his hood, still balancing the phylactery on his other hand. His face was none other than the trademark smirk of Modus Operandi. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Just a lowly mercenary,&#8221; Modus said, &#8220;come to get his pay. I think I&#8217;ll take this for my services.&#8221; The smirk transformed into a broad grin as he indicated the jar. As the rest of the elite guards turned on the infiltrator, he tossed the jar perfectly over Aniyal&#8217;s head toward Catalyst. Aniyal watched, and the world seemed to slow as the jar spiraled over her. In the blink of an eye, Catalyst released his sword from its sheath, and swung it in a beautiful diagonal arc. The phylactery exploded into a thousand shards as the blade impacted it. Aniyal shrieked as the blue-white pulse of Catalyst&#8217;s soul rippled down his sword and entered his body. <BR>
<BR>
And then he was upon her. His eyes slid up to meet hers as his sword plunged into her gut. The purple fire which covered his body filled her vision, and he caught her with his free arm, before she fell. He gently lowered Aniyal&#8217;s dying body to the ground, and put his face so close to hers that she could distantly feel his breath. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Puppet no more,&#8221; he said, and then stood and walked away, striding toward the towering form of Innoruuk. Modus, for his part, had his hands full. The daring act of replacing Aniyal&#8217;s guard had left him hard-pressed by the rest of them. He spun brilliantly in the ring of five deadly warriors, fending off attacks from each. Surprise and Farewell, his twin rapiers, danced together in harmony. But Modus was already losing, and he knew it. <BR>
<BR>
In a brilliant flash, one of the guards fell literally in half. The charred pieces of his body crackled with the same purplish energy, and Modus looked up to see Catalyst nodding at him, then resuming his walk back to his Father. It was all the opening the mercenary needed. <BR>
<BR>
Modus quickly smashed an odd capsule on his wide silver belt, and a tremendous gout of smoke poured out, quickly concealing everything in a thirty foot radius. While his Teir&#8217;dal attackers roared in surprise and rage, Modus fled, pattering off into the night. <BR>
<BR>
Deep in the heat of the battle, Grimple Dovetree fought like a wild boar. One of his arms was slashed and useless, but he ignored the blood and leapt wildly back into the fray, calling down bolt after bolt of lightning, and electrocuting several Teir&#8217;dal where they stood. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Taste the wrath of Karana,&#8221; the druid roared, and shattered the kneecap of a passing warrior, but then screamed as a piercing agony in his leg reached his brain. His left leg had been pinned to the ground by a short, sharp spear. The Teir&#8217;dal who wielded it crouched behind him, smiling savagely. Grimple spat at the warrior&#8217;s face, and wrenched the spear free, bellowing with the pain. His attacker just continued to smile, which confused the halfling for a moment. <BR>
<BR>
The Teir&#8217;dal toppled forward a moment later with a large axe embedded in his skull. Some ten feet away, an armored dwarf saluted Grimple hastily, then clambered off to cleave more inkies. Dwarves were so fixated, sometimes. Grimple nodded to him wearily, and then set about using the last of his healing magic on his burning leg. The cool stormwater of Karana poured forth from his fingers and clotted the wound, quickly repairing most of the worst damage. At least he could hobble now. <BR>
<BR>
He struggled to his feet, and suddenly realized the fight would not be won, no matter how much of himself he gave up. A single hopeless tear dripped down his weathered face, as he realized that soon, his beloved Rivervale would face this demon-spawned threat. He loved his home, and he loved Norrath. He didn&#8217;t want to see her burn as the victim of hate. A buzzing in his brain toppled his thoughts all sideways, and he looked around, wondering if he was just going into shock. But no, there was a voice. <BR>
<BR>
Druid, summon the remainder together, and charge them against the god itself, now. <BR>
<BR>
Grimple stared off into the distance, and saw the purple-halo of Catalyst, standing on a cliff alone. We cannot kill a god, he replied in his head, insistently. <BR>
<BR>
Soon all that will be left of Innoruuk is his mortal form. Strike now, and leave the rest to me. If his vessel I be, then contain him I will. <BR>
<BR>
Grimple knew that there really wasn&#8217;t any harm in trying. After all, this crazy inkie was speaking to him inside his head. That had to count for something. He pushed out the last bit of his inner mana to amplify his voice across the battlefield: <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Defenders of Norrath, turn thy weapons on Innoruuk, if ye would save your children, and your homeland! He is vulnerable now, and we can stand against him! Think not of his minions, think of the source, and drive it from our world!&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
Many of the remaining army who were fighting with their last drip of hope heard Grimple&#8217;s call and turned on the feet of the dark god. Innoruuk looked down and scowled at them, not understanding how they could turn their back on so many mortal foes, only to waste their time on him. Human weapons could not touch a god; even the lowliest fool knew that in some fashion. <BR>
<BR>
But high on the cliff above them, Catalyst opened himself to Innoruuk, and used the power intrinsic to his body to begin siphoning the god&#8217;s divine essence, returning it to the prison inside him. He had suspected for a long while that the process of the Vessels worked both ways. But he also knew that no previous chosen such as him would have even tried. <BR>
<BR>
He could feel the rage of Innoruuk as it screamed into him, filling him to the limits of his psyche. The god bellowed into his consciousness, trying to divert his purpose. <BR>
<BR>
You cannot hold the wrath of Innoruuk! You will not be able to contain all of me, it will kill you where you stand! The full blossom of my power will rip your life away! <BR>
<BR>
Catalyst continued to draw in the energy. Mentally, he said only: <BR>
<BR>
What life, &#8217;Father&#8217;? <BR>
<BR>
As the last of the god&#8217;s power swam into his body, Catalyst collapsed, and was consumed by his own purple immolation. The energy of the god crackled and tore the earth underneath him, and spouted upward into the unnatural storm above. <BR>
<BR>
Far below, the heroes of Norrath rallied and surged against the screaming, newly-mortal body of Innoruuk. Their blades tore into him, and they fought with renewed valiance and vigor against both the god and his followers. Many of them fell to his heavy blows, but hope is the ultimate inspiration. Innoruuk&#8217;s quickly-shrinking avatar was cut apart, amidst the horrified cries of his faithful. At last, the lumbering body crashed to the ground, and lay beside the still corpses of Mithaniel Marr and Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane. From the sharp lips of the bleeding god, a few of the warriors could hear his final words, <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;You cannot banish hate forever.&#8221; And the body smiled awfully, as comprehension faded from its eyes. But it was dead, at last. <BR>
<BR>
Nearby, Grimple Dovetree let out a massive whoop of victory, which was quickly drowned out by the cheer of triumph from the hundred-plus defenders of Antonica who remained. The dark elves stared in horror at the body of their slain deity, and those who were not destroyed quickly fled back to Neriak. The dead in the forest of Nektulos nearly choked out the foliage, but the battle was won. <BR>
<BR>
* * * <BR>
<BR>
In the misty Freeport morning, three men sat on the creaky pine docks. The fog concealed even as it refreshed, and one of the figures had his hood pulled up tight, just to be sure no prying eyes would raise an alarm. <BR>
<BR>
Grimple clutched at his still-healing arm, and groused, &#8220;I know that it&#8217;s probably not good form to complain about a wound like this when half of Antonica is still in ruins, but damn me, if my arm doesn&#8217;t ache.&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;That&#8217;d be old age creeping up on you, shorty,&#8221; chuckled Modus, who sat beside him. &#8220;See, your problem is that you&#8217;ve spent one too many nights snoring with your head on a rock or a stump, out there in the wild. Your ancient bones just aren&#8217;t going to take it anymore.&#8221; <BR>
<BR>
Grimple nodded solemnly, then flicked a finger and set Modus&#8217; boots on fire. Words weren&#8217;t really necessary, anyway. The half-elf yelped and stamped about, then finally dove deep into the water below the docks, making a tremendous splash. The two who remained on the docks were treated to a rippling silence for a moment, and then a stream of expletives which would have made a sailor lose his luncheon. <BR>
<BR>
As the soaked mercenary began to swim his way back toward the shore below, Grimple turned to their hooded friend, and clapped him on the shoulder. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Listen inkie, you know that our black-clad fishbait friend over there will rebuild the Unseen. You could join them, and nobody would ever question your identity.&#8221; The halfling waited for a moment, and then smiled ruefully as Catalyst shook his head. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Well,&#8221; the halfling went on, &#8220;I suppose I can understand how ye&#8217;d not want to band up with any formal group, but you will want to stick around with the likes of us, won&#8217;t you? There are plenty of gods we haven&#8217;t kicked in the shins yet, even if they&#8217;re not currently walking Norrath. Besides, I know this Teir&#8217;dal girl called Dove&#8230;&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
At that, Catalyst did laugh, and then looked quickly from left to right, paranoid that his accent could somehow be detected in his humor. It was a hard road ahead, but he wanted to lead his own life, now. The power of Innoruuk still flowed within him, but Catalyst was determined to play the ungrateful son, and oppose him at every turn. Few would understand, but at least this odd pair seemed to try. As their dripping mercenary friend clumped rather un-stealthily toward them down the dock, Grimple looked up at him. <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;Eh, half-breed,&#8221; the druid said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ye think we could find something for this worthless hooded bastard to do, now that all the gods are back where they belong?&#8221; Modus sat heavily down in front of the halfling, with a clear, resolute expression on his face. He looked from Grimple to Catalyst, and back again. <BR>
<BR>
Then he spit water right into Grimple&#8217;s face. <BR>
<BR>
The tiny druid roared in rage, and charged after the fleeing thief, bellowing about beating him with a rabid badger, and other such pleasantries. As they capered about, Catalyst pulled his gaze up from the water, and stared out onto the horizon. As if it were the very birth of a new era, the day began. The brilliant morning sunlight cut like fire through the fog, and fell upon Catalyst&#8217;s face. <BR>
<BR>
His eyes remained wide open despite the light, and he smiled. <div class=byline>-- Jordan Thomas</div>
