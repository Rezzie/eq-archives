The following contains Gordon's latest post to the official Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010981-4.html"><b>PvP</b></a><br>There are a lot of spells out there that are nearly unresistable. I really don't have first-hand experience with these spells, but if that's the case, I'll take your word for it. <br><br>I noticed that the thread is mostly bumps wanting some sort of comment about it, but I really don't have any.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019818.html"><b>GM Corruption</b></a><br>Why is it that you assume that there is some favoritism going on every time someone gets something over on a GM? It happens sometime. I wish that it didn't, because if it did we'd be able to take players word for things on a broader basis, but unfortunately it does happen. <br><br>It doesn't sound like from what you've said here that the person should have gotten a res. That said, it is only a third of the story. I'm sure that there is something here which we here on the boards are not privy to.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019832.html"><b>Pet Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Long ago, when Mage pets were *not* dual-wielding, and the Focus items were introduced; Mages received a number of mid-level and high-level items.<br><br>Necromancers received only 1 high-level item, off of a God [Innoruuk] no less. Reason? Necromancers are strong enough as it is--by GZ.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, the same answer still applies. Regardless of what has happened with mages and focus items, necros are still strong enough. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019798.html"><b>Gone for a Day Over the Weekend</b></a><br>What's sad is that if I go away for the weekend, and have access to a computer while I'm there, I still come here and post. Just can't drag myself away :)  Maybe people will understand why I take the "you don't care" posts too well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019712-2.html"><b>Wizard's Epic Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Thanks to the efforts of hackers, everyone who has bothered to look the info up knows what their FA weapon will do as its "special property".]</i></font> <br><br>And thanks to the effort of Javier, the game designer looking after the spell database these days, the hackers didn't get very far. Javier put a ton of red herrings in the spell database to keep them busy. <br><br>As to the person who broke the display of the the thread with your "hahaha" and subsequent flaming, you should check your email tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019757.html"><b>Blighted Drops</b></a><br>Each type of NPC that can drop a particular kind of armor has a percentage chance to spawn. Once spawned, each has a percentage change of dropping a particular item. <br><br>These percentages cannot be considered average over a single plane clearing. It really can't be considered an average over 10. Perhaps 100 is more likely to give a meaningful average. <br><br>If you look at the posts here on the board, you'll see that different servers complain about different drops in the planes. This suggests pretty well that drops are working appropriately. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019733.html"><b>Gargantuan Spider Leg Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Come on fix the Gargantuan spider leg quest]</i></font> <br><br>It was fixed over a month ago.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019584.html"><b>Server Split Moves Guaranteed?</b></a><br>I wouldn't say anything along these lines is "guaranteed". I would say that if we guaranteed the moves that there would be a very good possibility we'd end up crowding the other server. The possibility of being split up from friends is about the only thing that keeps the numbers manageable. <br><br>Anyway, I've asked Ops for counts from both MithMarr and Tunare, and should know if we'll be able to move everyone soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019710.html"><b>Large Races Being Punished?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are large races being punished?]</i></font> <br><br>Because they have so many other advantages. Great stats, slam, regen (if troll), immunity to stun (from front, if ogre), are all among those advantages.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019711.html"><b>Bards Nerfed Again?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Selo's Accelerando, thats right, our level 5 bard speed song, has been cut by about 25% speed.]</i></font> <br><br>We haven't changed it.</UL>

From Rob:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings,</p><p>I would like to inform the readers of a few popular EverQuest related websites of their present status. Sites such as Evercrest.com, Gucomics.com,EQanswers.com, and Eqnecro.com will be experiencing a slight delay indowntime due to GameFan-Network shutting down their servers (in which thesesites were hosted on) earlier then expected. These sites have moved to ourown servers and we anticipated that the DNS change would mostly likelyhappen within the next 48 hours. The sites will be in fact <b>coming backup</b> shortly, but now it is a matter of Network Solutions. Sorry for thisinconvenience, regrettably we did not have much control over the situationand we appreciate your understanding. </p><p>Best Regards, </p><p>Rob Anderson<br>Network Director <br>Game Answer Network <br>www.ganetwork.com</p></BLOCKQUOTE>Sorry to hear it, I hope the Network Solution DNS changes go through fast!

Illanae Willowsbane passed the following message that was posted to our Povar board along:<BLOCKQUOTE>So many of you responded when you heard of Dawn.... the child of two of my <br>EverQuest guildmates. The few minutes you took from your day to visit her <br>website at <a href="http://www.dawnspage.com/">http://www.dawnspage.com/</a> and leave a message for her on the <br>message board there have meant more to the little girl than any of you could <br>possibly imagine! <br><br>Here is what her father had to say about it..... <br><br>"The response we have gotten is wonderful. The many posts have helped lift <br>Dawn to a new high. She is ready to face this thing head on and beat it. I <br>honestly have not seen her this ready to face this disease since she was <br>first diagnosed with it over five years ago. There are not enough words, and <br>I am not sure there are the right words to express what an impact this has <br>made on me and the rest of the family. <br><br>I do have to ask that if you have stopped by and left her a message to please <br>keep doing so. Starting Oct 12 she starts a minimum of four months in the <br>hospital and I know that any words of encouragement during this phase are <br>going to help." <br><br>And here is a message from her mother ........ <br><br>"We have learned that we are going to Denver on the 9th of October to get <br>ready for the transplant. I am so glad of all the support I have seen and I <br>Thank-you ALL very much! Please keep the messages coming in. Dawn really <br>likes it and some of them make us work even harder to do our best at eating <br>and keeping in good health. I am touched at how many people could care about <br>a little girl that they don't know except what they have seen on her webpage. <br>And wish to encourage you to keep writing and hope with all the messages she <br>will pull through a little harder. As of right now she is doing her best to <br>please not just herself and family but everyone that has writen her and <br>wished her good luck and keep her spirits high. I can't Thank-you enough and <br>will Thank-you for as long as I can." <br><br>========================================================= <br><br>Dawn has suffered from Acute Lymphoblastlic Leukemia for five years now and <br>she was diagnosed with her second relapse in April of this year after only <br>having gone into remission about a year ago. The doctors have said that it is <br>likely she will only survive this round of the fight if the upcoming bone <br>marrow transplant is successful. The pain and suffering this young child has <br>endured is incomprehensible to most of us.... she can pronounce the correct <br>names of prescription drugs and understands more medical procedures than most <br>adults <br><br>Dawn goes to Denver on Tuesday the 3rd of October to get a check-up and tests <br>done. Then she goes to Denver again on the 9th of October to get ready to <br>start the process for her transplant. That starts on Oct. 10th with <br>outpatient radiation and then she will be admitted on the 12th to start her <br>chemo and everything else to clear her body of lekumia cells so that the bone <br>marrow transplant will take. <br><br>Please take a moment to leave her a message.... little things can mean so <br>much! </BLOCKQUOTE>Awesome, I hope everyone can help out! :)

If that is the case, you need to contact your server GM to arrange for verification of membership. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019445.html"><b>Customer Service Issue</b></a><br>Except in very special circumstances (which are made public on the server when those circumstances apply), GMs cannot come verify possessions prior to the completion of a quest. There are thousands of quests completed every hour, and doing this would have a severe impact on their ability to do their job. <br><br>GMs can, after the fact, see what happened, but keep in mind that they do not have write-ups of all of the quests available. When there is a broken quest (which incidently there are very few of these days), they become aware of them, but normally working quests are not on a list for GMs to view or confirm. <br><br>Yes, I agree that GMs should not leave mid-conversation, but he could very well have been zoning or away from the keyboard for subsequent tells. It's very possible that he thought the conversation was over. <br><br>If you feel you've had a problem with CS, please email <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.comeqmail@verant.com</a>. It will be forwarded to the appropriate personnel. I'd appreciate it if you could indicate at the top of your email that your suspicion regarding the quest was incorrect, as otherwise it's libel to be forwarded to the reimbursement issue queue rather than customer service management.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019411.html"><b>Most Powerful Pet Throught Process</b></a><br>Certain classes, specifically pet classes are designed with soloing in mind. Those pets are important for that purpose. The pets do not, however, eclipse the need for tanks in a grouping situation where tanks are generally needed, which means that there isn't an imbalance. <br><br>Pets actually become less useful in many dungeon-going groups due to the difficulty in controling them in tense situations. The fact that it ended up like this is no accident. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019169.html"><b>Toggle for Ctrl + 1-8</b></a><br>If we made it just the number keys up top, would that address the concerns here?

Why is such a powerful npc in a newbie zone ?]</i></font> <br><br>Simply, there are no newbie zones, not from the standpont of the story. Sure, you normally find lower level stuff closer to the cities as a matter of gameplay, but when trying to develop a story we cannot always adhere to these rigid structures. <br><br>People talk all the time about how neat it would be for cities to get invaded and taken over, but we can't necessarily have that happen if we're restricted to using level 1 to 4 NPCs because it's a "newbie zone". It wouldn't make much sense for the high-level nasties with a plan to only hang out in the sparsely populated outer areas. <br><br>For the purpose of presenting a story, it may be necessary to have some high level critters running around a zone that's been considered relatively safe. It's part of our goal to bring the story to the players and have them participate in it. Certainly some people will be caught in the crossfire, but it's just part of the game. I hope that we can continue to please more people than we upset in the process.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019397.html"><b>Allowing Items into the World</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How do you get items into the world at a rate of 1 every 20 hours, without requiring the player to spend that long staring at an empty spawn point?]</i></font> <br><br>You don't. Perhaps the only way to get a quest that has 10 2-hour steps without having the items come in at the 2-hour rate is to have it so that step 1 cannot be attempted again until the completion of step 10. That way a person going through the quest would encounter 10, 2 hour steps, but the next person wouldn't be able to start until the first completed the quest. <br><br>The problem here is that the second person could certainly choose to camp at the spot for 18 hours waiting for his "turn" to come up. Not to mention, what is there to do if the first person decides to quit halfway through...</UL>

Jeannette brings us the following announcement:<BLOCKQUOTE>***Blackburrow Triage Event**<br><br>&#8220;BAAARRRRRRRKKKKK!&#8221;<br><br>It was a familiar howling cry that ripped through the Qeynos night.  Zsalshun stood up and waited for the inevitable as the howl of the hunt bounced off the stone walls of the city.  In the dark there were cries of pain as the pack tore through the young adventurers, even as the guards rushed out to slay the encroaching  dogs.  The priestess called upon the powers of her dark god to help the unfortunates in the way of the reckless charge but still some were lost.  The guard came back to his post with the fire of hate burning in his eyes.<br><br>&#8220;Those Darkpaws grow ever bolder and we don&#8217;t have the manpower to exterminate them in that black den of theirs!&#8221; <br><br>The Tier &#8216;Dal priestess cast her dark lord&#8217;s protections on a recently mauled fighter and sent him healed and on his way.  The citizens had come to tolerate her and on occasions such as this even respect the power granted to her by Innoruuk.<br><br>&#8220;These gnolls have taken quite a bite out of the citizens here.  I think it might be time for the citizens to start taking back.&#8221;  The priestess raised an eyebrow at the guard.  He looked at her uncertainly.<br><br>&#8220;Their den is a hive of traps and they are as thick as Inkies in Neriak in there.  No offense.&#8221;<br><br>Zsalshun sighed and thought a bit.  &#8220;House Winterborne can provide protection and aid to the townsfolk.  That might help and I am sure there are several young adventurers who are looking for revenge on these dogs.  We have healers, casters and respectable warriors who can insure a margin of safety for an all out assault.&#8221;  She tapped a finger absently on her mace.  &#8220;Yes, I think that with our help, the citizens of Qeynos can finally charge into Black Burrow and take back some of which the gnolls have taken.&#8221;<br><br>The guard smiled grimly.  &#8220;I wish you all the luck.  May the gods smile on your plans.&#8221;<br><br><br>OOC:  Monday, October 2nd at 8:30 EST  House Winterborne of the Xegony server will be providing aid for any adventurer wanting to assault the Darkpaw gnolls in their home of Blackburrow.  We shall  assist those in Blackburrow by healing, buffing, providing bandages, food and drink as well as the esteemed services of our warriors for train breaking.  We invite you to come spend an evening stopping the gnoll scourge at the starting point:  Their own home den.  We have no delusions that the gnolls will be exterminated, but for one evening we can definitely help with the thinning of their ranks. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Following any new server being brought up, there's always a bunch of people that flock to them. This dies off in a couple of days and the population stabilizes. I'm sure that everyone has their reasons for going, but what makes you think it's all about twinking?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019116.html"><b>New Server at Peak Hours</b></a><br>I assume you mean Kelethin. In any case, it hardly mattered when the server came up. It would have been crowded. It happens every time a server comes up. If you find it unplayable, you might want to wait a couple of days for the population to stabilize. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019110.html"><b>Shared Account Issues</b></a><br>Unfortunately Zacheus, we've been unable to come up with a way of verifying *for certain* that the characters wouldn't actually be changing hands, so it's not something that we can pursue at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019087.html"><b>Res Nerf?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Second hand info.

An effort is under way to immortalize the late Guide Llara in Norrath.  Here's the announcement from Romak:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello All.  <br><br>I have recently started a Petition to<br>erect a statue of Guide Llara of Erollisi Marr, whom<br>you know has just recently passed on.  I plan to<br>request to have the statue placed in a remote part of<br>Greater Faydark for all servers.  This statue will<br>serve as a way to remember Guide Llara, and how she<br>has touched so many people's lives, and how she truly<br>guided them through their play at Everquest.  I wish<br>to do this so that she may live on in memory forever<br>in the game that she loved so much.  To help in this<br>gracious cause, please Email <a href="mailto:RememberLlara@yahoo.com"><b>RememberLlara@yahoo.com</a></b><br>with your character name and other information if you<br>wish.

Here's the most recent posts from Gordon Wrinn as posted on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019097.html"><b>New Server Population</b></a><br>New servers always get an influx of people way above the norm. It takes a few days for population to stabilize. I was just looking at the counts by zone, Gfay was leading with 389 :)<br>--<br>Actually only 300 players total on the new server were druids last time I looked.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019065.html"><b>Movable Window Suggestion</b></a><br>This is on our list for possible future enhancements. Thanks by the way :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019039.html"><b>Today's Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Well, it's patch day yet again. It's a good thing, bugs are fixed, content is added, and other generally positive changes are made. Patch is announced ahead of time and an ETA is given on when the servers will be back up. Then..... Silence... Patch goes over the posted time frame one hour... two.... three.... STILL no update on server status on the website]</i></font> <br><br>To my knowledge, this patch went only 15 minutes over the scheduled time, meaning that there'd really be no point to a status update. <br><br>Now there is always login congestion following patches. This is unfortunately not feasibly avoidable, as login traffic is many times normal load during this time. I suppose that we could automatically put up a banner explaining this each time, but that'd really only be useful to the brand new players, as everyone else is already aware of these issues.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019059.html"><b>Will Tholuxe Paells be a split server?</b></a><br>No, we don't split people off to "new character only" servers like Tholuxe. Some were once moved from Test to Morrel, but that was a mistake and they were later moved off. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018972.html"><b>Buying Whole Stacks</b></a><br>There's no need to convince us that this is a change that needs to be made. We already agree :)  While we understand the desire for this functionality, some things are quicker, easier, or more important to do than others. We'll get it in, just please be patient.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018757.html"><b>Cleric Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "id much rather spend 2 hours each on say 10 or 12 items for 1 stage of the quest than sit under a lake for 23 hours watching goblins spawn."<br><br>I think we ALL would Woundweaver.]</i></font> <br><br>As I've mentioned before, the 10-12 step quest with 2 hours required for each step allows items into the world at the rate of one every two hours. We do not want any of these items to be that common.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018732.html"><b>NPCs and PCs</b></a><br>NPCs do not not collide with PCs due to AI limitations and potential balance problems. I understand your assertion that from a real-world perspective it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, however from a gameplay perspective it is necessary. <br><br>NPCs already have to calculate the best route to a target around world geometry and switches. It would be another matter entirely for them to try to also calculate the way around dynamic objects within the world. <br><br>So, as foreseen by Lostalus, NPCs can do things that PCs cannot. This is discussed further in the FAQ.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018406.html"><b>Customer Relations</b></a><br>I appreciate where you are coming from Jochomo, however there are a number of things that I don't think that we can agree on. <br><br>First is that its been shown in the past that the more in-depth an explanation in attempt to get buy-in, the less buy-in we get. Threads quickly devolved into arguments over each point, each of which expect those arguments to be addressed in the same fashion. Second is that sometimes the information you are requesting is information that we'd never release. It might be something that's internal information that will never be made public, or perhaps its something dealing with mysteries of the game. Finally, a lot of the time it is an opinion. Facts and formula can back not everything up. For instance, I saw of thread the other day asking why halflings couldn't be rangers. There's no formula that will answer that question. The answer is that our opinion is that they shouldn't be rangers, and is as simple as that. <br><br>We're not going to break things down to a scientific certainty in all, or even many of the cases. We won't post our logs, or snippets of code. We'll certainly make every attempt to explain the things that we can, however please remember that this is a service that we provide, and that you choose to purchase based upon the merits of what we provide. Simply, sometimes "no" is the best answer we can give. Going into a dissertation on all of the reasons why the answer is "no" every time it comes up gives the impression that we're willing to change our minds if sufficient counter-arguments are presented. Sometimes this *is* the case, and other times it's not. We're fairly open about it when we're willing to debate matters further. <br><br>For example, if someone posts here on the board that Ice Comet is broken, because it should do 200pts more damage, what should our answer be? Do we need to lay out a matrix of all of the spells and try to justify scientifically that its current damage level is appropriate? Or do we just say "No, it shouldn't" or "No, it's working as intended". <br><br>I used to work for a company that developed highly expensive customized software for a relatively small customer-base (around 100). Certainly, when customers would request new functionality, we'd fly out to their location, and bend over backwards to implement the functionality for them in order to keep getting their yearly 6-figure support and license fees. There was no such thing as something that we couldn't do. It's a great way to do business, and leads to customers being very satisfied. <br><br>The last company I worked for built moderately expensive, highly configurable software for a customer base of around 1500. Here, we would not fly out to customer sites, but would certainly meet with them if they came in or talk to them on the phone if they called. We'd keep their suggestions for new functionality on a list, and implement as we could. If there was something that we couldn't do, we'd make a good effort to explain why, however it wasn't the same case as above where there was nothing that we couldn't do. <br><br>However, here, we're dealing with 300K customers, who all have their own ideas as to what the product should do. In this case, we cannot afford to take suggestion from them all, and completely justify our decisions every time we decline to implement suggested functionality. <br><br>It's all a matter of scale. Though the extent that we explain things varies depending on the issue, we&#8217;ll generally explain them to the point that we feel that there is something to be gained through the depth of the explanation. That often changes as the issue comes up over and over again. The melee binding issue, for instance, was explained and debated in great detail shortly after I came on board, but now it&#8217;s a simple &#8220;No&#8221;. <br><br>As for other issues, we&#8217;ll see as they come up :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018335.html"><b>Binding</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Casters bind anywhere except Kunark dungeons. This is a bug. Originally casters were supposed to self bind ONLY in towns.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure where this is coming from, as I've seen it posted several times, but it was not the original intent for casters to be able to bind only in towns. <br><br>Now they were not supposed to be able to bind in dungeons, so that much is a bug, but any non-dungeon location was to be fair game. Though it is technically a bug, it's one that we've waived, so it essentially becomes part of the game.</UL>

Brad reminisced about days gone by, namely EverQuest beta, in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018611.html">following response he posted</a> to the Gameplay Board:<UL>Out of curiosity, back in Beta, I recall Verant saying that there was an employee of Verant who was had a warm spot for musicians and bards. Who was that person and do they still work at Verant?<br><br><b><i>You bet! Steve Clover, one of the original two designers of the game and bard lover is a programmer for EQ Live.<br><br>And, if I might persue a tangent...<br><br>One of the really cool things about this place and EQ is that almost all of the original EQ team are still working on EQ related projects. Out of like 30 plus people who were originally involved I think maybe 3 or 4 at most have left to pursue other interests.<br><br>Which is, of course, very cool because the original creativity and talent is still with us going foward. Couple that with all of the new talent we've brought on board since then, and the fact that we've also got original UO team members working here (for example, Raph Koster), and you have, IMHO, one heck of an MMOG company <br><br>-Brad</i></b></UL>
