With another day comes yet another round of updates from Alan on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>EverQuest: The Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I started playing this game about a month after it was released. I read up on the manuals before I started playing, and in game I talked to each and every NPC, looking for quests, and the history of the world to immerse myself into it. <br><br>The one thing I never found, after 2 years of searching, is the story. I know the history of Norrath, but I just can't find the story of Everquest. <br><br>Maybe it's me, so maybe someone can help me find the story of Everquest? In particular, what's the plot of Everquest and who/what is/are the protaganist(s) and antagonist(s). <br><br>Afterall, every roleplaying game has a story, or there wouldn't be any roles to play. <br><br>HELP! <br><br>Aloran Al`Aan - The Lost One<br>Tunare Server ]</i></font><br><br>The history of EverQuest is our job to convey. As the world builders, we set the setting and prop up the props. <br><br>But as for the story of the game as it exists today, that's mostly up to you all to write. What happens on Norrath in the current days is motivated primarily by the actions of player characters. The story of EverQuest is what happened to your group last night in Unrest. The tales of EverQuest are told around the water cooler in your office the next day as you relive the battles and travels of the weekend with your friends. The epics of Norrath are written in long drawn out e-mail conversations with your guild members. <br><br>Obviously there are restrictions to your ability as a player to tell your own tale, limitations based on the technology that restricts us and the game world. You can't burn the tavern down in a moment of drunken panic. You can't permanently remove Emperor Crush and replace him yourself (after all, you're far more handsome). <br><br>But, barring these limitations, the story of EverQuest is written by the players. <br><br>Bring life to your characters, and you bring life to Norrath. <br><br>I know, I sound a bit like a commercial there, but that's what we have in mind. We set up the world and you all people it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000089.html"><b>Inspection</b></a><br>Tagadin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've been following the thread on inspection and I would like to ask a question. Is there a way to turn off the message that you recieve when someone is inspecting you? In a previous post you said... <br><br>"There really is no need to remove it, we just went for the more flexible idea, allow players to choose to turn it off if they wish." <br><br>I may have read it wrong, but it kinda implied that we had the power to turn the message off if people were annoying us with it. Personally, I couldn't care less if people are peeking at my undies or measure my feet for new sneakers. I just get tired of seeing the "Soinso is inspecting you" message...]</i></font> <br><br>Sure, you can do it from the command line in game. Here are the instructions from the supplemental manual in your EverQuest directory (actually, it's from the one we're updating now&#8230;) <br><br>/inspect [ON/OFF] &#8211; Toggles on and off the message that you see when someone is inspecting you.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000103.html"><b>Favorite Zones</b></a><br>It's nice to see so many zones that have their own fan clubs. :)<br><br>Thanks for the nice comments and suggestions.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Eating Food</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Question, what is the reasoning behind being able to right-click to eat your food? <br><br>In another post you responded to a similar questions with a statement something like, If the action confered a special property.... or something like that. <br><br>Well, you have just clarified that there are no special properties confered when right-clicking, only that the food will last about half as long. <br><br>So, a better question to the one I started with would be, "Why would you implement right-clicking to eat food when there are no benefits to it and only a penalty of making the food last a shorter amoount of time?". <br><br>Kayael McBain<br>Warrrior of Rallos ]</i></font><br><br>For the emote. It's a simple answer, but it's the truth. You can eat food on purpose and get the emote that goes with it. For those that aren't interested in having it known that your character is actually stuffing Froglok Feet down his gullet, this won't be a useful feature. <br><br>For others, it's a lot of fun.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: My play time is equally mixed between playing a roll and not, but I far and away prefer the role playing. <br><br>All of my fond memories of this game revolve around times we were playing a role. I currently play with a DE Wizard and a Barbarian Shaman. My high elf cleric, Tavari, is attempting to reform this wizard, and is under the delusion that he's harmless. Of course, this is aided by the fact that he acts a bit loony at times with her. He get's drunk and has a tendency to cast grav flux way too much. The shaman and the wizard despise each other, and spend most of the time hurling insults at each other. Shaman refusing to sow or heal the wizard, the wizard refusing to teleport the shaman or "accidently" leaving him behind. <br><br>Now, when this same DE Wizard is teaching Tav's younger sister (Talys) the ways of wizardry, all apearancing of bumbling drunken sot are gone. He is far more sinister, uncaring and cold when he's with the younger sister. Talys will never be able to reveal his true nature to her sister either - unless she's okay with her sister finding out she switched allegiances and now worships Solusek Ro. <br><br>Point to all of this is that I LOVE when we are all together playing roles and laughing our butts off. *smile* I never thought I could role play - I've never played Dungeons and Dragons or anything else. The barbarian insists he has no imagination and doesn't know how to role play. If we try to make it "formal" and call it "role playing" he gets all nervous. On te other hand, I know he's not entirely like his barbarian in real life. <br><br>Roleplaying is what makes the game exciting :)<br><br>Tavari - 45 Cleric<br>Guardians of Honor<br>Test Server ]</i></font><br><br>Woot! <br><br>Joegorde wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: But secondly was that I was wondering why it would be that people would be as likely to understand what a Vulcan speaks like as they would speaking like a Scottsman <br><br>Duh Absor, your subscribers are computer geeks.

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Bards</a>.  Bards are the jack-of-all-trades of Norrath. While playing magical songs, a bard can fight, heal, charm, damage, run fast and so much more. Bards were created for grouping and make an exceptional addition to any group.  But there's so much more to this class .. how much do you really know about the story-tellers and traveling minstrels of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the story tellers of the realms.  Mana song isn't the only thing that bards can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Bards of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Read the guidelines and follow them. We want those boards to be useful as they were in the past.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Patch Issues</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think you misunderstood what Azmira was trying to say. Instead of tracking window placement for each inventory slot (the way it is now), he was recommending tracking window placement for the first bag opened and the second bag opened. <br><br>Since we can only open two bags at once, I think this makes alot of sense. Please consider this idea. <br><br>Gilgurth ]</i></font><br><br>I sure did. I get it now. <br><br>I'll pass it on. Thanks for clearing that up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really like the new right click loot feature for corpses - it saves quite a bit of time. however, I've noticed that if I loot a monster's corpse and have a slot that will fit an item it has, I end up equipping that item. <br><br>For instance, my warrior currently has no ranged-slot item, so every time I loot a FS dagger it ends up in the ranged slot. <br><br>Would it be possible to turn off this new feature for monster corpses, and have it apply only to player corpses? <br><br>Nathan ]</i></font><br><br>Well that's pretty much how it's supposed to work. If you can equip the item and you right-click in from the loot screen, you equip it. Moving it from the range slot is going to be no more or less time consuming than the old method of looting (faster, really). And it's most certainly better than the old way if you're in a hurry.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000115.html"><b>Fan Faire Coverage</b></a><br>The Fan Faire site has our coverage of the latest San Diego Fan Faire up.

One of the things you could do in that game was donate valuables and cash to your guild (equivalent to class in EQ). At regular intervals, the game totalled up the donations for that interval, and whichever guild had the highest donations would receive a small boon to their abilities (though the exact quantities of the bonus were not revealed). <br><br>Anyway, my idea is to allow donations of some sort to your deity. Donations could include cash or items; items would be valued at their nominal merchant-sold price, i.e., the lowest price for which a merchant would sell the item to a player character. After some interval - weekly, perhaps - the donations would be tallied and divided by some normalization factor (so the very few worshippers of Veeshan would have the opportunity to compete with the fifteen gazillion worshippers of Brell), and the followers of the leading deity would gain a small bonus of some sort for that period. If you like, you can also make that deity ineligible for the next one or few intervals, to give more people a shot at the bonus. <br><br>It requires far less balance concerns than a permanent bonus to abilities based on deity, and it has the added bonus of removing cash and the glut of equipment from the economy. <br><br>Who knows, it might even work, if adjusted just right :)<br><br>Nizanko Seigikan]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting idea. The two birds with one stone thing always appeals to me. <br><br>I've passed it on to the team, as usual. Other than that, the only thing I have to say is that it's an interesting idea. And I've already said that twice&#8230;</UL>

Dynamite brought us this event update:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail good people of Norrath!<br><br>    Again, I come before you today with news of Fennin Ro's Wizard<br>Faire! This Faire shall be the first of its kind, where wizards of all<br>levels come together to have fun. We shall have games, contests, duels,<br>prizes, and on top of it all, our monthly Rune Trade!<br><br>    For those who do not know, in past months I have hosted a wizard<br>Rune Trade on Fennin Ro. Wizards of all levels came together with their<br>runes and helped each other: if there was a rune you needed that someone<br>had, you would ask and it would likely be given to you. Subsequently, if<br>you had a rune another wizard needed that you didn't, it was expected<br>that you would offer it to your fellow wizard in order to further his or<br>her own advancement. Several higher level wizards also offered their<br>time and skills in research to the cause, ensuring their lower level<br>comrades were able to get their spells.<br><br>    This month, the trade is still on. However, on top of that, we will<br>be having several contests and games just for fun, some of which will<br>have prizes for the winners! As this is an effort put forth by the<br>community, as a member of the community you are welcome, and even<br>expected, to lend your assistance. If you have ideas for games (we<br>ALWAYS need these), prizes or money for prizes you would like to donate<br>to the faire, or any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at<br><br>fenninrunes@hotmail.com<br><br>or contact me in-game.<br><br>    If you are making a donation, I would ask that you please hold on to<br>it until the Faire, but please let me know that you intend to donate it.<br>This way I can schedule the games around the prizes, making sure the<br>appropriate prizes are awarded for the appropriate games and contests.<br>Also, if you are not able to attend, but have runes or prizes you would<br>like to be at the Faire, then please give them to a wizard friend who<br>intends to attend. On that note, be sure to tell all your friends! The<br>Faire schedule is currently:<br><br>Fennin Ro Server<br>Toxxullia Spires<br>Saturday 28th April<br>Begins: 2PM PST (5PM EST)<br>Ends: when it's over! =)<br><br>    The trade itself shall begin when attendance has peaked, so the more<br>people you bring with you, the faster we can begin trading. Also, I am<br>only one brewer, and in past months, I have had JUST enough of my fare<br>to please the attendants of the trade. If you are a tradesperson and<br>would like to bring some of your stock to the Faire, no matter what it<br>is (baked goods, alcohol, anything!) then you are more than welcome...<br>just remember to save yourself for the drinking contest!<br><br>    Thank you my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro, for being such a wonderful<br>community and making this possible. When we stand together like this, we<br>truly shine in every way. It is you that makes the Faire, and the Faire<br>is magnificent. I look forward to seeing you all there!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks.

I just play. I play EQ to be with my friends, and some of them LOVE to roleplay. You see, I have a problem. My friend told me to buy this game because it was cool, so I did. I have NO CLUE how to roleplay, I would love to, but I don't know how. Also, I would end up looking like a fool if I started to roleplay in front of a ton of people that don't. <br><br>Maybe if I could learn how, or if I was around a lot of RPers I would. I'm seriously considering trying it, but I just can't now. :(<br><br>EQ is a great game role playing or not, but I feel that role playing would add a lot to the game for me. <br><br>-Chris aka JarasayIsMyHero<br>Mith Marr<br>Relzon 11 Human Rogue<br>Reznur 10 Human Monk<br>Banjanjas 22 Halfling Warrior<br>Kizak 20 Barbarian Warrior<br>Jindrak 13 Erudin Necro <br><br>Yes, I love to play many different characters.. And Jarasay deserves a promotion. :)]</i></font><br><br>I've heard that sort of thing before. You're not alone in thinking that you don't know how to roleplay and that you would feel silly doing it. <br><br>Most people already know how to roleplay. A lot of us roleplay at work (we act like we enjoy our jobs&#8230;) or when meeting the girlfriends parents (we act like a responsible person&#8230;). It's not a hard thing to do, and everyone can do it. There is no requirement to be clever, or funny, or silly, or any other such thing. All you have to do is try to think like your character. <br><br>I've always told people that if you want to start roleplaying, build a character that would think and act a lot like you already think and act. If you are a jovial person that tries to see the good in things, then make that the personality of your character. The only 'trick' to roleplaying is to allow yourself to think as if you were really a citizen of Norrath. That citizen can have all of the same principles and values that you do. But he doesn't know about your favorite baseball team. He does know about the way that people treat him in Neriak or in Qeynos, and that matters to him. <br><br>As for looking silly, don't worry about it. You said yourself that you think it seems like fun. You see others doing it and to you they don't look silly. And, well, it isn't silly. It's fun. Personally, I think people look silly when they dance&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think one of the things I keep in perspective when roleplaying, is the goal of the thing. Granted, roleplaying does hamper my advancement a bit- but my goal isn't to make it to level 60. That, is something that will/won't happen over the course of each of my character's lives. The goal is, when I /camp desktop at the end of the day, am I smiling? Did I enjoy my day? <br><br>So.. my barbarian warrior has a nifty collection of rusty weapons taking up valuable space. I mean, look how nice and sharp they are! And.. a library card from Erudin, because he wants people to know he is NOT ignorant. After all, he as this here card for books (which he looted). My high elf paladin curses the idiocy of the squirrel-elves who fail to make a proper wall, then runs and argues with the orc lift guards in Kelethin for their slow reactions to threats. Or my wood elf ranger's penchant for casting all healing spells on others, watching his life line ebb away while poisoned. <br><br>So, yes, I give up a lot of opportunity for experience, I have useless items, I haven't maximized my equipment and Tunare knows, my poor ranger is a crunched bit of Orcbreakfast to quote my favorite bard. But.. I'm having a wonderful time. <br><br>And by the way, thank you for the wonderful graphics all over the world. My ranger stood in awe, exploring all of Steamfont that first trip there, admiring the geysers. <br><br>Agramor Treewalker<br>24th season ranger of Tunare<br>Karana Server ]</i></font><br><br>Excellent. You're right, the real thing to do is to make sure that when you're done playing at the end of the day, you felt like you were playing, having fun. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Though I would like a server that encouraged people to avoid abbreviations in public chat. How in the world you'd do that properly, I don't know." <br><br>humor<br>This is easy. You add a grammar and spell checker to the EQ client and have it parse every sentence the player types in. You then grant xp for every sentence with no errors. :)<br>/humor <br><br>Thanoslug Barukhazad<br>Singing Paladin of Brell Serilis<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>Yikes. Charge us with the responsibility of creating a grammar checker that actually works! There isn't one on the market yet, so I suppose we'd be able to make a fortune selling it as a secondary product&#8230; :)<br><br>And, worse yet, we'd need 14 of them&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Ne Patch Feature Comments</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, <br><br>Had a chance to test most of the new patch features (as much as a 28 enchanter can)and I am imensly impressed, thanks to you and your team! =) <br><br>I have 2 comments reguarding new features however: <br><br>1: /charinfo; can this be extended to include the number of kills and deaths attributed to the PC? <br><br>2: Container Placement; As only 2 containers may be open at any one time, it would be nice to just save the location for [open container 1] and [open container 2]. <br><br>Finally, one bug I found related to new container changes: (told the QA team about it too, just passing it on as a warning to others): <br><br>If you do NOT use Screen Same Resolution (makes your non-full screen view smaller) then if you open bags in full screen and place them near the edge, then switch screens to non-full screen your bags will be locked in the void outside the interface and you'll have to ESC out of your inventory and start over. <br><br>Thank you all again for taking the time to not only read but implement our ideas =) <br>/hug dev team <br><br>Azmira Ani<br>Legion of the Vale (.com) ]</i></font><br><br>Well, thanks! But I don't do the work, so I'll pass on your hug to the team (though not literally&#8230;). <br><br>I really don't think we would want to track the number of kills a character made. First of all (and to me most importantly), this isn't a first person shooter. We're not emphasizing any sort of scoring system here. Secondly (and probably most importantly for our programmers), there tracking the number of kills you get is another bunch of data that we would have to track along with your character, and that's not something we want to do unless it's important to the game. And as you can see by my first point, it really isn't. <br><br>And the answer to your second point is similar. As it is now, we only have to track the location that each inventory slot opens to. That's about 16 pieces of information per character (17 if we get around to world containers&#8230;). If we had to track this for each bag, we'd have to store it on the bags. So each bag would have to know where each person that holds it wants it to open&#8230; <br><br>And as it is now it's just as useful as having the information attached to the bag.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000113.html"><b>Key Mapping Bug</b></a><br>Crism_KotWR wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have recently started using mouse control more often in Eq. So I have mapped movement keys to W, A, S, and D. At the same time I also use CTRL-S and CTRL-D religeously. Unfortunately, when I press CRTL-S not only do I stand up, but I also take a step backwards. So both the CTRL-S map and the S map are happening at the same time. If you press CTRL or ALT with a key, then that should not execute the event mapped to just the letter key. Sounds like a simple fix, but just annoying. I guess I could remap sit to CTRL-Z but then that would treat the symptom and not the problem. ]</i></font><br><br>I sent your concern to the programmers, and I was deluged with responses&#8230; Rowyl's was, for once, the shortest and most concise, so here it is: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The problem is that we allow people to hold control why moving to allow for strafing. We can't make is to that CTRL-S doesn't move backwards without causing problems for people that just hold CTRL down while moving in order to strafe. They would have to release CTRL to backup... <br><br>He just needs to remap his sit key (that's what I did since I use the W A S D setup for moving). ]</i></font><br><br>So, really, the only solution would be for you to remap your sit key (or your movement keys&#8230;). It's not a bug, it's just the way it is.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items & Eating Food</b></a><br>I need to make a correction to something I've said about eating food by right-clicking and about the way that special food items work. <br><br>Right-clicking a food item only sends out the message that you've eaten something. It does not confer any of the special properties that the food may have. And the food will only last half as long as it would if eaten naturally. <br><br>The special foods will give you their benefit as long as they are the food that you are currently eating, meaning as long as it is the first food in your inventory. <br><br>I was mistaken in how I thought this worked, and I have been giving you the wrong information about it.

We're in the process of getting a web site up that should answer a lot of questions. Look for it to show up on Monday.<br><br>That said, in response to this one, "Kerrans" isn't entirely accurate. The cat-people of Odus were dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites during the process of their segregation. They do not call themselves "Kerrans". The cat people of Luclin are actually known as the "Vah Shir", the nobility among the cat people. The tale of how they ended up on Luclin is pretty interesting, but I'll leave that for the web site :)<br><br>As for your other questions, yes, other races will be able to become Beastlords, but there are certain limitations involved.

More mayham and madness to report that occured on the Developer's Corner today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000099.html"><b>Sneaking Hiding and You</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I can agree with Absor on most points in this discussion. However there is one point that I cannot reconcile with the explainations. The ranger is a master of the wilderness. He is the master tracker and can tell how big and bad a creature is by smelling it on the air. He above all others should have the sneak/hide combination "In A Wilderness Setting". So you don't allow in in cities, dungeons, etc. that's fine and reasonable. But, when it comes to the great outdoors, no one should be able to move undetected about better than a ranger. Even if you don't give them the message they should still be able to do both at the same time. <br><br>Being trained for a lifetime on how to get close to animals without spooking them Rangers would have to be able to sneak/hide in the wilderness. Rogues are trained on how to sneak/hide from "people" if anything their ability should be deminished when in the rangers world of the outdoors trying to hide from animals/monsters. I am not suggesting that the Rogues be nerfed in the wilderness, only that the ability combination be give to rangers on their home turf. <br><br>JackMagist ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not trying to convince you that a ranger wouldn't be good at hiding in a wilderness setting. I don't disagree with the idea at all. <br><br>I'm telling you that the reason that rogues get the ability to sneak and hide at the same time and nobody else does is simply because that's one of their special perks. <br><br>It's pretty easy to justify a lot of things in a roleplaying game. I can justify any class/race combination you can think of with some simple roleplaying setup. For example, Ogre bards: Ogres have an innate sense of rhythm. Their music is not complicated, but it is powerful. And because the have no written language, the bards of their culture are the focus of all of their lore, keepers of their tales and their myths&#8230; <br><br>I can just as easily claim that rogues should be very good trackers, at least as good as rangers, and certainly better in an urban setting. But they don't get that skill in the game because of game balance, because giving tracking to too many classes dilutes the skill. <br><br>Anyway, my point isn't that rangers would suck at hiding and sneaking. My point is that they don't get it because rogues are the only ones that do. <br><br>Raean7 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Incoming! Monty Python reference! <br><br>"How Not to be seen." <br><br>*tree explodes, rogue bits fly everywhere* ]</i></font><br><br>Quit that.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000105.html"><b>The Deities</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just thought I'd point out that inside that little green book (the manual?) that came with my RoK starter pack, there is a sketch of the major deities at least.

If you have difficulty understanding normal english then you will certainly be overwhelmed with the mangled ole'english that people tend to adopt when roleplaying. <br><br>As well, I understand that r u there and plz and all of the abbreviations in game are associated with leet dewds or whatever, but they are also adopted because of the technology. I am a pretty competent typer. So I can throw out big words and sentences in game without having the other person sit around and wait half an hour for a reply. But many folks who rely on the hunt and peck method may take forever to reply to you. I'd rather get an abbreviated response back in a short period of time that addresses the issue or question or whatever, than wait 5 minutes for them to write out a complete sentence. The point gets across fine whether you abreviate it or not. People are quick to associate this to laziness or childishness or wanna be leetness as opposed to other factors which could force someone to abbreviate or drop words from sentences. And in a roleplay server they will be punished for a language barrier. Doesn't seem very fair to me. <br><br>Biz. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, actually, I don't know anyone that roleplays in Norrath that uses any form of 'ole' english'. In fact, I've never heard it used in any roleplaying game I've ever attended. <br><br>But typing is a barrier to roleplaying in a computer game. It does slow down the conversation. But there is no rush to hurry up and roleplay. <br><br>And I suppose rules created for a roleplaying server could punish people for such things, but that wouldn't be a very fun server, now would it? <br><br>We're way ahead of ourselves talking about a roleplaying server in any solid form. But I wouldn't advocate any server that would punish people for misspelling a word. Though I would like a server that encouraged people to avoid abbreviations in public chat. How in the world you'd do that properly, I don't know. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000101.html"><b>Random Rolls</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Cheating on rolls might not always be a matter of hacking the algorithm. A player once demonstrated to me how he could fake a random roll fairly convincingly. The text of the roll message is fixed except for the roll value and the high-low limits. So all this player did was enter a /shout command (to get the red text) and enter the right number of spaces to get a blank line (as I recall) after his "shout", then add a fake roll message. So it looked like <br><br>Rollfixer shouts "Come on, 100! <br><br>Rollfixer rolls a magic die ...." <br><br>Maybe not too sophistocated a method of cheating, but with half a dozen players rolling at once, it might pass muster. <br><br>OutlawEyes ]</i></font><br><br>There will always be people trying to do things like that. The system is as foolproof as we can make it. Such tricks will always exist. In this case the way to defeat it is to read the message. We can't make it much simpler than that. <br><br>It's a good warning to people to keep their eyes open to things like this.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000054.html"><b>/Assist</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Why /assist %t? <br><br>I hope that they mean /assist playername. <br><br>I would love to be able to set up an assist hotkey that only assists the puller, instead of who I have targeted. Or perhaps a way to do /assist <F1-6> so I could just assign /assist to a specific groupmember. <br><br>I thought a while back that you could do /assist <playername>, but it has not worked for me at all recently, and until I played a Monk, had no idea how usefull /assist was. (hehe, so I wind up solo alot with my Necro. I am better now :)) <br><br>--Necridious ]</i></font><br><br>/assist <charactername> works fine, used it plenty last night. Have a hotkey for each of the people that might need assistance that just does /assist Bobo (no, Bobo is not a real character name). <br><br>%t is the replacement variable for the name of your current target. You should not need to use this in conjunction with /assist, since assist without an argument should assist whoever is your current target. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan said.. <br><br>"Why would you type /assist %T when you can target and then just type /assist" <br><br>The player didn't specify, but I'd assume it was a hotkey. I have /assist %T as part of a multi-line hotkey that does some other stuff :)  makes life much easier for me, would be nice if it was fixed to work again (and the difficulty in targeting players when they're crowded with mobs is about one of the most aggravating things about EQ) <br><br>Cairin Hairytoes - 29 druid &#8211; Test ]</i></font><br><br>But that's where the confusion comes in. /assist and /assist %t do exactly the same thing. I know that /assist works peachy, I've used it a lot recently. So rewrite your hotkey without the %t and see how it works.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Deities and Expansion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was rereading this thread, and then read the dieties section on the main page (nice; was it there before and I missed it, or is it new?) <br><br>Anyway, I got to Zebuxurok, the little-known-about demi-god. <br><br>I found the second paragraph the most interesting:<br>"There is said to be a hidden city on Norrath that honor, not worship, the 'Ungod', Zebuxoruk. Something not even he truly cares for. This city has knowledge of his history both true and false and the community is mostly comprised of fallen priests, shadowknight, paladins, any who have been forsaken by thier deities and either seek a pathway back or seek true neutrality among the planes and and understanding that the deities are more mortal than they think." <br><br>Two observations, comment if you like. <br><br>1) I smell an expansion with a new city (could it be Luclin?) Somehow I think not, but could be wrong. I'm sure you don't have a comment on this one yet. <br><br>2) I smell a quest involving this city to alter your religion. <br><br>Sniff, sniff. Any comments? <br><br>Jynx ]</i></font><br><br>I don't have a comment about that directly. I do want to tell you that Norrath was already a pretty well fleshed out world before EverQuest went live (before that even). There a tons of things that exist in the mythology that we may never have time to create in the game itself. That's one sign of a good world, at least to me. <br><br>So if you see hints of interesting things in the mythology of Norrath, you're seeing the results of a created universe, not necessarily a plan for a future zone or quest. Sure, that's where we draw that stuff from, but we're not going to pretend it doesn't exist until we can put it in game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "A Wan Ghoul Knight was struck by the judgement of Tunare." <br><br>I like the idea... I can only foresee 4 problems here... <br><br>"Tunare was struck by the Judgement of Tunare!" There are some sickos (jk) that decide to go against their god, and kill him/her. (Cazic, Innoruuk, Tunare and Bristlebane) It would look slightly silly if they were killed by their own powers... Perhaps it should be so that you can only go against your own god if you change deiety...? <br><br>Noor :)]</i></font><br><br>I admit it, I laughed at this.</UL>
