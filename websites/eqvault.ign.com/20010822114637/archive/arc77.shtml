Travelling through the Karana's one day I stumbled upon a freshly eaten<br>corpse, I kneeled down to inspect the poor fellow when inspecting him I<br>noticed he was a hired Runner.

EQ Rants sends word that they've kicked up a brand new <a href="http://eqrants.net/abashi.htm">Q&A with Verant's Gordon Wrinn</a>.  Here's a clip from this amusing interview:<UL><b>*Some people are under the impression that yourself, and Verant employees in general, are evil and perhaps demons from hell. Could you please clear up this mess. Are you indeed a demon from hell and, to your knowledge, does Verant actually employ any of hells minions? Or is that just a Microsoft thing? </b><br>  <br><i>*looks over his shoulder* <br>  <br>I'm sorry, but an NDA I signed shortly after being summoned...er...I mean hired... prevents me from answering. <br>  <br>Seriously though, we are sincerely aiming to please the largest percentage of our playerbase possible by keeping the game fun and interesting for them.  Though it may appear to some that our intentions are "evil", it wouldn't make much sense for us as a company to purposely alienate our customers.  The numbers, particularly the ones that show EQ's ability to retain subscribers, and the ones that show EQ's subscribers gladly recommending the game to others, clearly show that we must be doing *something* right. People may disagree on exactly what that *something* is, and most would agree that EQ isn't perfect, but in the end, the people are here, play the game nearly every day, and enjoy the heck out of it.</i></UL>Check out the link above for the rest!

A very interesting article titled <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/guidebook/kunark/spell.shtml">Descriptive Statistics and the EQ Magic System - Part 1</a> can now be found in our <a href="/guidebook/kunark">Kunark Strategy</a> area.  The purpose of this article is revealed in the opening paragraph:<UL><I>I&#8217;ve read many comparisons of spells on many website and many online forums.  Almost exclusively the power of spells is compared based on the maximum damage they can deliver and the efficiency of mana put into those spells is compared by the ratio: Point of damage per point of mana. <br><br>These are valid measures for comparison.  However, they tell a very limited story in terms of the true power and efficiency of the classes.  My purpose is to offer a more complete view of casting power using different statistics than what I&#8217;ve seen proposed previously.  But first let me start with what seems to be a reasonable argument using the old statistics: </i></UL>Very special thanks goes out to Nenelar Valandur, High Elf Elementalist, of the E&#8217;ci server for writing this for us. <br><br>Enjoy!

<a href="/files/eqlogsplit1.1.zip">EQ Log Splitter v1.1</a> (250KB) us now available in our <a href="/files/">File</a> section. Here's a clip from the readme file:<UL><b>Fix/addition: Ability to track money received on a per character basis, either cumulative or per session.</b><br><br>This program was designed to separate an Everquest log file into one log file per character.<br><br>As long as your character was online long enough to be "saved", it should work okay.<br><br>The new files will have the original filename plus "for " plus the character name.<br><br>Simply place this executable anywhere you like, wherever you keep your eq log files is obviously the easiest.<br>A DLL will be extracted the first time this program is run, and a simple INI file will be created.<br>No other changes will be done to your system.<br><br>This program is a bit slow, but works great as far as it's been tested.<br><br>It appends to any preexisting files, so if you run it twice on the same log file each character file will have the same bits twice.<br>I thought about putting separators when a character is restarted, but I decided against it unless someone particularly wants it.</UL>Enjoy!

I received the following from Banegrivm:<BLOCKQUOTE>It was a day of epic proportions that would be forever remembered for all time by both the armies of the light and the dark. The 1st Fist of Light had gathered at the gates of Qeynos and prepared their descent into the depths of teh catacombs beneath the city where had rested the fate of Norrath in the grips of the Plaguebringers.<br><br>As the army made their way down inside their deepest fears had been wrought to light. The armies of hate had indeed forged a pact with the plaguebringers but Drayvar was not their only commander. Euthan Hatebringer had indeed brought ihs warband the Order of the Crimson Hands in tow. Behind him from the shadows Euthan summoned his ally tis his side. Lasombra, high lord of the dark order Illumin Cathari.<br><br>The army of light stood their ground yet could not possibly survive the onslought of the defending forces. Having retreated back into the surface, Drayvar turned his attention to the now disheveled army of light assured that victory was his.<br><br>Drayvar sent a herald to the Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light and demanded that a battle be set for he had the paladins betrothed and would see her fate sealed in hate, should he refuse to meet him in battle to the end with the loser decommissioning their army. (OOC - duel for deletion of guild and character).<br><br>The two stood before the gates with people from both sides of the army standing fast to the battle. Yet upon that hour Innoruuk was not with his daughters champion. As the paladin that had been Banegrivm drew his blade down to send the shadow knight to his god, Drayvar whispered his final words, "she is one of us, you will never know your peace". With holy rage the paladin took the shadow knights head to place back upon High Keep as witness to all those who cross the threshold of darkness.<br><br>The armies of hate were no more, however now an alliance was set. Where Drayvar had failed stood the human born son of Innoruuk to hold fast the mantle of hate and reforge what was broken. Euthan Hatebringer, High Lord of the Order of the Crimson Hands stood...and evil would surely flow. <br><br>There were tales and legends of heroes, of villains, and strange beasts that walked the lands. This was but a saga or a legacy of things to unfold. Was this the end of the war of Hate as we had known it...or a new beginning? Many questions yet remained unanswered. Only time would tell...but at least for now their was a banner of peace.<br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Shalkai was kind enough to inform me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings from Aven du Sora on the Innoruuk server! We'll be holding another event this Saturday, June 10th, at 8:30pm PST, in and around Qeynos. This event is the second edition of YAAP (the Young Adventurers Assistance Program). All races are welcome - we will be stationed outside the gates. We'll have food, drink, buffs, and weapons available for free for characters under 10 seasons. Armor for all classes available for free or for easy tasks. Magic items will also be given for simple quests and contests, which we'll customize for participants.  Expect role-playing, races, and anything else that looks fun. Equipment will NOT be "uber-twink"; expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If you have Crafted Armor or a Flowing Black Robe at 5 seasons, you've already had enough assistance :-).  <br><br>More experienced adventurers are cordially invited too! We'll have a free 6-pack for anyone who wants to imbibe, and you're welcome for storytelling, buffing the youngsters, helping out in your own way, or just having a good time.<br> <br>We hope to see you there!<br> <br>Shalkai Windchaser, Organizer<br>Wyndorn Windchaser, Guildmaster<br>Aven du Sora<br><a href="http://ads.eqhq.com">http://ads.eqhq.com</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

Agravaine sends us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, It was an ordinary day on the Test Server in the Oasis of Marr,<br>until I thought someone had trained 3 spectres from the island to the<br>gypsie camp.  After the sprectres spotted me, I made a quick run to the<br>North Ro zone.  But on the way I encountered 3 more spectres at the zone,<br>making 6 spectres total so far.  I found this very odd since the specs<br>that were on the island were still there.  After I rested up and zoned<br>back in, I noticed that everybody was talking about people training<br>specs.  That was not the case.  Spectres were spawing everywhere...on p1,<br>p2, South Ro zone, North Ro zone, gypsie camp... pretty much everywhere. <br>Nobody could quite figure out the reasoning behind this. No strange<br>drops. Possibly GM fun...but on the test server?<br><br>Here are some screenshots that I took: <br><a href="http://www.redrival.com/vs/specs.html">http://www.redrival.com/vs/specs.html</a><br><br>Agravaine<br>17th season  High-Elf Enchanter<br>Test Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Kardeiz:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<br> <br>For several months now I've been writing an ongoing comedy serial for the Fennin Ro Epic, entitled The Perils of Pinter.

The guys at the Electric Playground have kicked up a <a href="http://www.elecplay.com/review.html?article=2572">new review of  Ruins of Kunark</a>.  Also included in the article is some commentary on the current state of the game.  The overall score they give the expansion is an 8.8 rating.  Here's a clip:<UL>The designers of Everquest had the best intentions when creating the world<br>of Norrath. Unfortunately, very few of the gamers who populated this world<br>chose to play in the expected fashion. Verant envisioned players exploring<br>wilderness locales and crawling through dungeons as they quested for power<br>in a classic Dungeons and Dragons style of play. The gamers of Everquest had<br>other ideas and an entirely different style of play. Exploration gave way to<br>finding spots with bottomless experience pools, dungeon crawls resulted in<br>room camping and item farming and the quest for power ground to an annoying<br>and bickering mess of players fighting over the right to sit and kill<br>monsters in a repetitious cycle of boredom.</UL>Thanks Sean!

It's part of a ruleset specific change in design to reduce the impact of DOT deaths, bleeding to death, and Pet kills were causing XP loss in PvP combat.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050337.html"><b>What happened to Kunark refunds?</b></a><br>George Scotto (<a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com">gscotto@station.sony.com</a>) is handling issues related to the Kunark shipping problems directly. Feel free to drop him an email. <br><br>I apologize for the problems you've experienced.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050341.html"><b>More Armor Questions</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would much rather be able to wear plate. We all know that it was supposedly the limit of texture memory that caused us not to be able to wear plate. You cripple a nice race/class combo for that reason?]</i> <br><br>That's not the reason at all. They can't wear plate because it chafes their scales. There are still 4 different texture sets for the Iksar just like any other race. The hardiest just isn't considered "plate". <br><br>Of course the hardiest stuff will still be less AC than the plate in the game since Iksar get an innate AC bonus by virtue of having scales.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050370.html"><b>Class Testing</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi - Why we don't think Verant does throrough class testing...]</i> <br><br>What's an issue here is the definition of "thorough". It's simple math, 250K players can find more issues in a given amount of real time than everyone here at Verant, or everyone on the Test Server combined. <br><br>Mistakes happen. I apologize here on the board for them. I take every step possible to reduce the chance of their occuring. They still happen, and will *always* happen. <br><br>EQ is not a linear game where there is a specific and small set of things that a player can do. It's a complex system where thousands upon thousands of people are doing thousands of different things, all at the same time. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050373.html"><b>Harvest</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I think that the recast on harvest is too long, because the small burst of mana every 10 minutes isn't a huge difference. (i love the spell effs btw)]</i> <br><br>Harvest is ok. It is something that you have now that you didn't have before. I realize that everyone wants more, but keep in mind that we have balance issues to consider. The extra mana every 10 minutes easily eliminates on period of meditation per hour. It's fair. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050406.html"><b>Gordon on Kunark</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2) In Norrath proper these mobs will chase you all the way to zone to kill you because they are mad at you.]</i> <br><br>No, they don't. All over, NPCs will not pursue you if you are out of a certain range. Try rooting a fire beetle on the Northeast side of east commons, then run with SoW to the Nro Tunnel. If you get far enough away before the root breaks, it won't pursue. <br><br>The zones being bigger in Kunark do probably exacerbate the problem, since the zones are bigger, and someone is more likely to be able to run a good distance without hitting a zone border. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: In Kunark the mobs won't follow once you get out of spell range, which is very short and very dumb. They should follow you until out of visual range, and maybe even then.]</i> <br><br>Are there specific mobs that only follow you for this short distance? I'd like to get a list of zones and specific critters that have this problem. I asked for it once before, but didn't get much of a response.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050247.html"><b>Melee Classes Getting Robbed?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Non melee classes getting ROBBED, avoiding the PvP switch, ABASHI!!!! Its called Disarm.  So what do casters have to do to make $$, camp, quest, KS!!!, and other undesireable actions.]</i> <br><br>Disarm is not at all reliable enough for this to be effective, so we wouldn't consider it a cheat. Thought I don't have the exact formula handy, I'd be surprised if one in twenty weapon-wielding critters could be disarmed on the first attempt before getting back to the group.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050181.html"><b>Server Listing Question</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: WHen will the server list go back to server population rather than alphabetical?]</i> <br><br>It's back to being listed by population. New users will see it that way, however since the new program stores preferences, existing people will see it in whatever order they had it set to the last time they entered the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050157.html"><b>Getting Harassed</b></a><br>There is absolutely no tolerance of character gender based harassment. It is handled with the same policies and with the same level of response as every other type of harassment possible. <br><br>If there is something that offends you, please /report it and /petition to let a GM know that a /report has been filed. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050034.html"><b>How do you react to people telling you your job?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Cleric, don't stun just heal. Druid, don't waste mana on thorns just heal. Bard, don't twist, just "play the mana song." Wizards, don't stun, just nuke.]</i> <br><br>Well I've always been of the feeling that a person who built the class up from scratch knows more about the class than someone who hasn't, but I have run across a cleric or two who wanted to be wizards. There's nothing worse than being the first person in the group to call for a heal and being met with an "OOM!". <br><br>Not meaning to take this thread off topic, but this is one of the reasons that it wouldn't make much sense for me to endulge a common request on this board that I "Whip up a level 50 XXXX and see how well you do!". Unless I personally build the class from scratch, or at least get some serious calendar time playing it, I wouldn't exactly be a very good example. I certainly wouldn't even be an average example of the class.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050139.html"><b>Closing Rallos Zek Threads</b></a><br>No, it's not censoring, it's spam control. Deleting the threads would have been censoring. <br><br>Systematically bumping all threads of a specific issue to the front page is spam and is not something that we want to encourage. When this happened a few weeks ago with threads on another issue, I said at that time that we'd close the threads. <br><br>I'm sorry that this was necessary, but artificially elevating the apparent importance in this topic doesn't help your case. It in fact hurts it, because supporters of the issue don't know where to post their followups. For instance, instead of getting 22 people posting in support under one thread, you end up with one person posting in support of 22 different threads. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049576.html"><b>Monks and Stun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I just read something on a warriors kick being able to stun at a given level? My question, Abashi, is: If a warriors, oh say 15 damage kick, can stun a target...don't you think a monk's 100+ damage kick would knock the target out for a few minutes?]</i> <br><br>It's a good argument Mooo: If a warrior can stun a target with a Kick, and monks kick so much better, then monks should stun. <br><br>However, this is one of those cases where gameplay supercedes realism. For balance reasons, we can't give monks stuns in this manner. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049910.html"><b>Few Armor Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1. You said a long time ago Verant wanted to increase Pally/SK quest armor AC without nerfing rangers. Did anything ever come of this?]</i> <br><br>I don't think that it was this that was said. What I believe that was said (and we're talking like 5 months ago now) was that it wasn't the Paly/SK mid-level quest armor that had AC that was too low, but rather the ranger armor AC that was too high, and that we didn't want to nerf rangers. <br><br>I think it was also said at that point that deciding not to nerf in a particular case did not mean that we'd automatically upgrade everyone else. So by deciding not to nerf ranger armor we weren't saying that we'd up Paly and SK AC. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2. You also said a long time ago you'd look into increasing the crusader spawn (darkforge armor quest). Anything ever become of this?]</i> <br><br>Again 5 months ago, but as I recall we decided against it. Frequently when new items come into existance, there's a rush of people that want them. Since everyone wants them, a shortage *in relation to demand* is present. However, after a period of time goes by, supply and demand even out. <br><br>We try to avoid upping spawn-times or item creation rates based upon info received within a short time after item availability as the data is skewed by the new-item rush.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049962.html"><b>Broken Quests</b></a><br>Thanks for the post Qwinn. I'll send it to the test team. There's a couple that I can comment on now: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 3) The Cannibalize 2 quest is broken. Dread Diamonds do not seem to be dropping anywhere.]</i> <br><br>It's not broken. It's been confirmed and completed by players. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: There is a quest in the Qeynos bard's guild that involves delivering lute strings to a npc named Fabian. No one's ever seen him.]</i> <br><br>I commented in a Bard thread the other day about this one saying that it was flavor/future expansion. This was apparently incorrect. I read the list wrong, and information on what the deal with this quest is is still pending. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: A special Bardic weapon" mentioned by one of the Bard NPCs in Temple of Sol Ro. May not count as 'broken', but merely unimplemented.]</i> <br><br>This one *is* unimplemented and for future expansion of the storyline. It doesn't count as "broken". <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Blued Two Handed Hammer]</i> <br><br>As I recall, this is one of those rumors that floats around<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049983.html"><b>Naming Bug</b></a><br>We are aware of the problem regarding the names showing for skeleton models as well as a couple of others.

We absolutely dislike the idea of messing with an existing server community in a manner that those in the community would find offensive. In this particular case we're only allowing people unhappy with the current looting arrangements to switch between Vallon and Tallon in an effort to try and make people on both servers happy. <br><br>We basically broke the rule above when we switch Tallon to Coin Only, but we needed try a few things with PvP to try and see what the players there *REALLY* want. As I'm sure you can see from the board here, some things aren't actually representative of the way the population really feels. <br><br>As for Rallos, there are no plans for this server at present. In all likelihood, we'll leave it's loot rules the same, since there isn't a sister server to split people off to. We don't intend to allow people from Rallos to move to Tallon, as the rulesets and the way PvP is handled in code is *very* different. In addition, Rallos went live the same time EQ did, whereas TZ and VZ came up much later, but at the same time as each other. <br><br>We'll be looking at how things turn out after the TZ/VZ/TZ move before making any further decisions.</UL>

I discovered the following announcement made by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><I>Hello Everyone,<br><br>As many noticed in the last patch message, the Gunthak Harpoon (a 15/31 piercer) was made a rentable (meaning permanent) item. As it turns out, this was a big mistake on our part. Basically, one of the guys on the Team received an email about it being NORENT, figured that this was a bug, and fixed the item.<br><br>Even with the item's disadvantages, its stats make it something that should only have been available in the deepest parts of Veeshan's Peak, if at all. <br><br>In the next item patch, it will again be made NORENT, meaning that it will disappear like a summoned item the next time you log off. I do apologize to those who obtained the item in the meantime.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>
