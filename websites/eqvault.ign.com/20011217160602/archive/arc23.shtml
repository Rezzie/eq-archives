From Merliben Halliwax:<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes. And that is all I know!" Zarn continued. "I was getting to the end when i remembered my errand." <br>"Oh, you blunderhead! You left me thinking there was much more!" Thurbiz scoffed. <br><br>"Bah! Blunderhead, indeed! I have found out some very interesting news and you call me a blunderhead?" Zarn cried. "You are always nosing about, i thought you should like to know about this kind of thing!" <br><br>"Not nosing about! Finding things out! And it is usually dark, nasty business as it has always been, not just finding half dead theives in windmills! But come..." Thurbiz continued before Ialle or Zarn could correct him with a "Scout!", "Let us put our heads together a moment. Obviously if there are Gnomes attacking Gnomes with the Help of gigantic skeletons somewhere, this is not the best situation. Necromancy is a disease, it seems, spreading across the face of Norrath. First the Gnomes in the Mines of Old, or rather, the Mines of Malfunction..." <br><br>Mumbled agreements from Ialle and Zarn followed. It was well known to the Halliwax Family that Zakis Halliwax was slain in the Mines deep in Ak'Anon by Necromancers of Bertoxxulous, but nothing could ever be proved to the King's Court. <br><br>".. and now it has turned up half a world away! I should not be worried if it were not gnomes... we have sharp minds and they could do much damage to the good worshippers of Brell..." Thurbiz continued. <br><br>More muttered agreements. <br><br>"So... in light of the fact that we have become lazy, fat Gnomes.. AND that this is a great threat to Norrath in general, and the Gnomish Good name in particular, I say we find out what we can from this .... Scout. And then we do something about it." Thurbiz insisted. <br><br>"Hear Hear! " Zarn agreed. "I don't know all about the gnomish good name, but I do know that you have become quite fat and lazy indeed and DO need a good adventure!" he chuckled. <br><br>- from the Fourth Book of the Halliwax history dealing with the war against the Children of Isharuuk<br><br>To read all the books of Halliwax history, visit the Thurfiz' Kin library at <a href="http://thurfiz-kin.8m.com">http://thurfiz-kin.8m.com</a><br><br>Also, the Enemy's library at <a href="http://isharuuks-children.4t.com">http://isharuuks-children.4t.com</a> is interesting and they are in need of new members.<br><br>Merliben Halliwax<br>Wizard of Solusek Ro<br>Leader of Thurfiz' Kin - Tallon Zek</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Banegrivm brings us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>It had been thought what would be the coming of the Plaguebringer was just <br>that. As events unfolded about us in Norrath things were discovered. The veil <br>that seals Veeshan off from Norrath finally begind to break way and Now the <br>Bloodsabres and their unholy allies seek to summon the Lord of Decay into <br>Norrath. In Firiona Vie's return to Felwithe it was discovered that Tunare <br>herself now seeks entry into Norrath. This is only the beginning. <br><br>Long ago the ancient wurm Trakanon revealed his prophecy of the end times to <br>Edril the Lancer; the last of his chosen heroes of the days that prepare to <br>unfold before us now. The strange circles that have been sighted throughout <br>the lands also seem to herald this coming war as indicated by what seems to <br>be their marks or holy symbols upon it. As evidence by these circles within <br>the Rathe Mountains and Lake, Oasis of Marr, Castle Mistmoore, and Neriak <br>just to name a few of the locations. <br><br>Further information on the war can be found by way of www.1fol.cjb.net under <br>the war thread. As to where it concerns to the realm of Druzzil Ro I am <br>concerned for I would hate to think of what might happen if we were all <br>caught off guard when the gods may come, and their minions might come as <br>well. Whose to say a god would not show without henchment and or followers. <br>Think the Bloodsabres would stand idly by while Bertoxxulous walked the lands <br>assaulted by adventurers or another god? <br><br>As such I am asking everyone that sees this missive hailing from the lands of <br>Druzzil Ro to bind together. I saw what happened at Bloody Kithicor and we <br>were fortunate to have pulled together that day across the field of battle. I <br>would have hate to imagine the carnage that would have been had we all not <br>chosen to share the field that day. Thus being the case I am asking all <br>guilds to please join us at the Inner Council. <br><br>I realize everyone may not see eye to eye, however I would like to think that <br>we are also adults and could put aside our differences for a time to see this <br>thing through. No faction or group will stand alone, we MUST stand together <br>or all WILL be lost. We are to a time when we have no choice. Again, I am <br>asking that we could all come together. If we can stand together, all of <br>us...we stand a chance, if we become proud then we will fall and the streets <br>shall be paved in our blood. <br><br>I would ask all those that would come to throw their hand to the war front in <br>our realm to please post to the war thread for those guilds that wil join us, <br>and a war council will be conveiened the following week for all of us to <br>gather about and further discuss things. Again, ALL GUILDS are welcome and <br>INVITED to enter into the round table of the Inner Council. <br><br>May the light shine trut, <br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>Inner Council Member </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Tzuten Tsunami informed of of a recent event that involves Firiona Vie:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings fellow adventurers,<br><br>	Last evening I recieved a message from my dear friend Timbre that<br>the Firiona Vie has returned to Greater Faydark. Seeing that I am a curious<br>sort, and my current adventure within Kedge Keep was successful,  I decided<br>to see this for myself. I followed the mass of players as Firiona led them<br>from the gates of the High Elven City to Lesser Faydark. Many feel into<br>blackness (/ooc went LinkDead) when we entered Lesser Faydark. Seeing this<br>has my oppurtunity to speak with the Princess, I offered my humble services<br>as a monk. She smiled and thanked me.<br><br>	It seems that she was searching for an old friend of hers. The<br>Unicorn that wanders about in that forest. In short time the unicorn made an<br>appearance and spoke to the assembled crowd. Some of the followers of Cazic<br>Thule and the darker gods were on hand to "heckle" the Princess and the<br>unicorn (/ooc roleplaying Player Characters). Those were met with stern<br>words from myself and the others who guarded Firiona. At times I found<br>myself quiet vocal in the defense of this Elven Princess.<br><br>	It seems to be that they are trying to summon the "Avatar of Tunare"<br>and they need four magical stones to do it. With the knowledge of the stones<br>existance (but alas, not their location) we headed back to the King. While<br>Firiona told the King what was needed to bring forth the "Avatar of Tunare"<br>more hecklers interrupted the King (/ooc more RolePlaying Player<br>Characters), and more people defended the king (myself included). The King<br>then began to call forth those people that traveled with Firiona to thank<br>them. I was quiet shock when I was summoed before the King and given a token<br>of his thanks. I and the others who recieved a token was told to seek out<br>one called Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato and show him the token we recieved. We<br>thanked the King and Princess and left the hall.<br><br>	We found Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato in a nearby inn and each of us<br>was giving an item suitable to our class for aidding Firiona. I recieved an<br>Earring of AC 5 effect: Haste.<br><br>Here are some Screenshots of the Event:<br><br>Tzuten meeting Firiona Vie and stumbling on his words:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_and_friona_meet.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_and_friona_meet.jpg</a><br>Tzuten is summoned by the King Thex:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/summoned_king.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/summoned_king.jpg</a><br>Tzuten is praised by the King:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_is_praised.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_is_praised.jpg</a><br>The Coin...<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/the_coin.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/the_coin.jpg</a><br>Announcement from Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_name_in_lights.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_name_in_lights.jpg</a><br>The Earring I recieved:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/earring.gif">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/earring.gif</a> <br><br>(/ooc I would like to that those evil roleplayers, for making the event that<br>much more special, that Iksar Monk*forgot your name* and the High Elf in the<br>King's Court.

From PlanetEverQUest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Shadow Knights</a>.  Shadow Knights are the evil counterparts to Paladins. Part warrior and part necromancer, these evil knights use the powers of the undead to aid them in their battle against the forces of good. Shadow Knights work best in group combat but through the use of a pet and their dark magic can solo very effectively. But there's so much more to these dark knights .. how much do you know about them? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the dark warriors of the realms.  Harm touch isn't the only thing that shadow knights can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Shadow Knights of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The following was sent in by Grimstaff Theurgist:<BLOCKQUOTE>Wizards use runes to combine in research of new spells.

Here is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000132.html"><b>Annul Magic Update</b></a><br>Just a small update. I have been informed that this scroll has been updated and Enchanters will no longer be listed as able to use the spell after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000139.html"><b>Guardian Robe</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, <br><br>I obtained a Guardian Robe from Skyshrine a while back and I play a Wood Elf Druid. This robe has nice stats and is a fairly rare item for a Wood Elf to have. The problem that I have with it is it displays as a PINK TUNIC!! I am a male Wood Elf and get ridiculed alot by fellow players for wearing pink. Is there any way that this item could have a Robe texture added instead of just being a pink shirt with some trees on it? I would really appreciate this because i really like the magic resistances and mana that this item gives and have no plans of changing it anytime soon. <br><br>Thanks<br>Tomwin - Cazic-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately, some races just don't have robe textures. <br><br>Wood Elves are one of them. The rest are, I think, Dwarves, Half Elves, Halflings, Ogres and Trolls. Any race that doesn't have a native Intelligence caster doesn't have a robe texture. It's one of those things that had to be left out for efficiency when the game was built. <br><br>So if your character is wearing a robe and you don't see a robe, that's why. Or if you see some robes that fit several races and classes and wonder why your race can't wear it, that's probably also why. It's not usually a bug. We just didn't make too many robes that would fit people that have no robe texture in the game to display. <br><br>What you are seeing is a tint to one of the other textures available to your race. Why it's pink&#8230; that may remain a mystery. I'll prod a few people and see what I can find out. I would think that a truly tough guy could get along just fine in pink.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000140.html"><b>Cleric Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A long while ago, when Kunark was released you guys said something to the fact of 'Spells will now be dropping, but the spells that are the 'core' of your character will still be purchaseable at NPC vendors. (That isnt verbose, since it was almost a year ago, but that was the gist of it) When Velious came out, a new healing spell was added to the game for clerics called Celestial Healing, now I dont know about you, but for a level 44 spell this one sure does seem hard to get, I'm level 57 and i've been trying to get it because i'm trying to get ALL of my spells, ya know? =) I'm just wondering if placing this spell on really hard monsters was intentional? <br><br>Also there is sort of a rumor spell floating around called Turning of the unnatural, I'm wondering if this spell exists, that is all. I've never ever seen a single cleric that has it, and i've never seen it drop. <br><br>Oh, and please look at the RageFire spawn! =p hahah =) ( I had to throw that in there ) <br><br>Mishy ]</i></font><br><br>For more on that: <br><br>quote: <br>----<br>With Velious we decided to only sell the level 34 spells, and have the rest be drops on the continent. It was our intent to make these spells fairly common. Unfortunately some of these spells were a little too rare. We have addressed this by upping the 39 and 44 spell drops on the Test Server, this change should go live next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-----<br><br>One of those spells is the Turning of the Unnatural.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>Dynamic Changes/EverQuest Ingame Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I certainly would love to play in a world such as you describe. But many people wouldn't. There are a lot of EverQuest players that do not like the idea of allowing a GM to 'smite down' their characters, from on high or from below, with or without reason. << <br><br>We'll leave the discusion of "Dynamic Changes to the Environment" for another day, as I concede that the task is too large for the current incarnation of EQ...I bring it up mostly as a suggestion for future events. <br><br>The point you make above, however is a very, very valid concern. The same difficulty comes about in every P-N-P (pen and paper :)) RPG that I played. People feel very strongly when they invest time and effort into a character. It's very easy to see any permanent changes to that character as being an attack on the fruits of their labors. <br><br>People generally do not like for situations to get beyond what they consider to be a level of "their control", and some such people refuse to tolerate it. Many people like the security of knowing that the have determined: how they're going to play, that they know the risks, that they accept the risks, and as a result can move forward around the board toward whatever goal they have in mind. <br><br>It is, in fact, one of the things that makes EQ a wonderful game. I know (for example) that there are certain situations where I can advance and be reasonably assured that nothing catastrophic will happen to me. This allows me to spend time doing new, dangerous things, without feeling that I won't ever be able to recover. Dragon raids would be far less common if there was a chance that you could permanently end up in the Dragon's belly. (I believe in this sort of world, too, but it's definitely not EQ's ideology). <br><br>However, when you come to the concept of story, I think it's important to consider the role of a GM as a creator and "prime mover" for his/her world. Whenever someone plays a P-N-P RPG, to a certain extent they are empowering the Game Master to take action against their characters in order to support the storyline and to create a conflict for them to resolve. This can be driven by the GM's ideas for the game, or can come about as a consequence of their own actions. It is that "conflict" (be it a puzzling enigma, a challenging foe, or an adventurous discovery) that drives the story forward. In a sense, they give up some of the security they feel about their characters in exchange for a more dynamic experience, and (hopefully) a free enough hand to spin an entertaining story. If you don't accept the dangers outside of Hobbiton, you'll never experience the wonder of the Lonely Mountain. <br><br>Thus we come to my true point (long winded, aren't I?). I think that the people who would be more interested in a highly "Roleplay" oriented server are also the people who would be very willing to see the Game Masters have such Power. I believe they would (and ultimately MUST) be willing to accept that the GM's have creative control to whatever extents can be given. This allows the GM's the power to not only Roleplay effectively themselves, but to weave a storyline that is unique to their character experiences (with potential permanent consequences). It's accepted that the EQ world can't really be made dynamic, but it seems that many aspects of the Characters themselves COULD be affected (as long as such was within the context of a well-executed storyline). <br><br>Obviously, such a redefinition of "GM Powers" would have to be explained to someone going to such a server right from the start (in much the same way as the PvP servers have explanations associated with them). Each story seed that can be planted is another opportunity to Roleplay, and it seems that more dynamic capabilities (even those capable within the game engine today) would be a natural complement. <br><br>Again, more for you to chew on, as it's a subject that I'm (obviously) keenly interested in. <br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names ]</i></font><br><br>You sure are long winded! :)  But that's a good thing. <br><br>I've had this discussion before, on the old boards, with a player. In the end I think we agreed to disagree (though I also admit that I appear to be in the minority with this issue). I often feel somewhat cheated if I do something while roleplaying (pen and paper) that really deserved to get my character killed, and yet he survives. Happened just last weekend, though it wasn't me that made the mistake. One of us did something that should have gotten us all killed. While I certainly understand that killing the whole party could really crimp the game a bit, letting us live doesn't really make me happy either. It's hard to explain, but when I play, I fully expect the GM to kill my character when it's appropriate, when it would have happened if the characters were real. <br><br>When we don't suffer the 'realistic' penalties for our actions, the game world is a little less convincing. <br><br>Yes, I hate losing a good character. And, yes, I'll admit that most of the time I'd rather that the GM 'cheat' in our favor, especially when playing it out straight would mean starting all over or the end of the campaign. But if you play long enough and characters never suffer the true repercussions of their actions, the world that you're playing in gets less and less believable, and you are less and less likely to be afraid when your character <b>should</b> be afraid. <br><br>I do agree, though, that IF a server were set up wherein the GMs were given and expected to use their powers to enliven the game setting, even at the expense of some well deserved character deaths, that a warning to that effect would be needed. I also agree that I'd want to play on that server, very much. <br><br>The nice thing is that when you're in Norrath, no loss is truly permanent. Lost items and experience can be regained. So while some people are certainly upset at such losses, they are never going to be permanent by force of the game (some people might not bother to recover a lost item, though). Whereas if a pen and paper GM kills a character or destroys an item, such a thing can be permanent. So giving the GMs that added (and I agree necessary) freedom over the world and the player characters shouldn't be too intimidating, even to those that have never played a pen and paper roleplaying game. <br><br>See, I can be long winded too (and I held myself back!) :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, thank you for the reply to my comment. <br><br>I would agree that we (as players) have license to write our own story, create our character, and roleplay to that story, but what is lacking right now from this design is the ability to accurately perceive the story of Norrath, as a Civilization, as a World, and all that entails. <br><br>I would like to be able to respond, and more importantly, tailor the reactions of my character to the events that occur on a "Grand Scale". In order to do that, I would have to know more about the "living history" of Norrath as a civilization on a wordly scale. <br><br>What I mean about a Grand Scale and living history would be those events that have the tendacy to alter the fabric of Norrathian culture, environment, etc either temporararily (IE what's going on now with Good Ole' Bert, assuming it is temporary) or permantantly (I.E. the change in Undead spawning during the evening hours in Kithicor, or the Fabric that was torn to form a gateway to Hate when it first launched). <br><br>If I were able to know the events and storyline of what leads up to those moments, I would feel much more a part of the Norrathian history, and, thus, have more input to developing my character in response to those events. I understand that I may not have the possibility of directly influencing or triggering such events, but I'd very much like to be involved in them more then I am today (IE by actually knowing WHY they occur, when and how without scouring the internet for news, or talking to 500 NPCs). <br><br>I think an appropriate solution would be to record, publish and promote such events in the Roleplay way. For instance, as these events occur (or soon thereafter), record them in an RP manner (a gnome journalist witnessing an event, or a bard spinning a yarn of his experience during such events). Record them and then publish them. Then promote them in the way of News items on the Fan Sites, or at Harpy's Head. <br><br>I think I and many other folk would appreciate the effort of recording the details of the World History of Norrath and communicate them to the players in order to further enable us to develop our characters. <br><br>Sorry for the long post :)<br><br>Aloran Al`Aan<br>Tunare Server ]</i></font><br><br>It seems we're all long winded when we're on an interesting subject. :)<br><br>A lot of the details that people seek are available in game. I recently had a friend ask me what was up with the weird green mist in the Karanas. I asked him if he had asked any of the NPCs what was going on, or if he had even slowed down while running through the zone. He hadn't. <br><br>Now I will be the first to admit that there could be more of this sort of thing available in game. But I always hesitate about putting it up on a web site. How good is it to bypass the need for characters to actually go someplace in the game world to learn about what's going on? Something interesting going on in Halas? Rather than going to Halas and getting involved in it, people would just go to the web site and read about it&#8230; <br><br>I would much rather see something like a herald in most towns reporting local news than a web site doing so. <br><br>But I am also more interested in people knowing what's going on than I am in preserving my own notions of the right way and the wrong way to pass out that knowledge.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Your comments regarding the "story" of Everquest are, to a large extent, true. Each player writes their own stories as they play the game, etching a bit of themselves into Norrath's history. But I, like many other players, with that Verant would take a more active role in making Norrath a more dynamic place. <br><br>Take, for instance, the plague currently rolling through the Karanas. Word of this event got to me offline, and encouraged me to sign back on after I had stopped playing for a short while. The world is changing? That got me excited! The ongoing events leading up to that are a fascinating story and make the world feel all the more real, even if they did take far too long to unfold. It has led me to abandon the never-ending experience quest in lieu of exploring the world and talking to its denizens, something I have not done in some time. <br><br>Bloody Kithicor, an infamous world event if ever there was one, is an example of the kind of events that can make Norrath exciting. I was not around for Bloody Kithicor, having come on board shortly after. Reading about it from one involved player's point of view (read the fascinating tale here <a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net">www.1fol.cjb.net</a>, under "We are at War") made me almost drool with the thought of the green mists leading to an event of this magnitude. <br><br>My point is this: GM Events are wonderful diversions and add a bit of flavor to the world, but they do little to make Norrath an ever-changing, unpredictable place. And Norrath must be ever-changing and unpredictable to sustain long term interest. Expansions fill that role, but there are only so many possible, eh? Not all events need be on the scale of Bloody Kithicor or what is happening in the Karanas, either. Just small things to add to the mystique of the world. <br><br>For instance, what if, for a month or two, the Kerrans decided to fight back against the Erudites? Change some of the Toxx spawns to Kerran warriors and such - a nightmare for those who've gotten bad faction. Add some new comments for NPCs to say regarding the Kerrans' attack, both in Toxx and the two appropriate cities. Maybe add a wandering Erudite guard or two to Toxx, so they can fight with Kerrans. Maybe a few temporary quests surrounding it, but those are 100 percent needed. Shortly thereafter, revert back to situation normal, with some lingering NPC comments about it for a few months afterwards. <br><br>What if the Qeynos guards discovered the activities in Fish's Ale and shut the place down for good? Burned it to rubble, leaving its shell in Qeynos forevermore? The city would never be the same. Some of the NPCs can remain in city in the general area. The city folk can talk about what happened. And maybe, just maybe, the workers at the establishment took up shop in the aqueducts, keeping the quests alive and in place. <br><br>In my opinion, each patch should bring some small but noticeable change to the world, some bigger that all will see, and others that only some. Simple changes in NPC comments alone would be a huge and very welcome addition to the game. Just that would be fantastic. <br><br>I know I've gone on for some time, but I'm sure I am not alone in this. I think the green mist in the Karanas has renewed interest in the actual world of Norrath, as has Luclin. I'd love to see Verant make it a living, breathing place. <br><br>Talmer [Winter Raven]<br>Ranger, Bristlebane Server ]</i></font><br><br>And I think most people would agree. Having the world change like that would be great. <br><br>But it's not as easy to do as you might think. The time it takes to come up with interesting events for the old world could just as easy be applied to new material. New material, such as Luclin, adds to the game world. The value of new content over changing old content is, well, new content adds to the volume of the 'stuff' in the world. For a long time player, that new content might have the same value as revising old content (making it 'dynamic'). But for the new player, who has never seen the old content, the fact that Qeynos is 'new' won't add much to the value of the game for them. Whereas new content is new for everyone. <br><br>And there is a lot more to making seemingly simple changes to zones. For example, burning down a bar in Qeynos would, basically, require rebuilding the zone (though not extensively, for certain). Any NPCs that talk about that bar in any portion of the game world would have to have their text revised. Any quests that too place in that bar would need re-working. And the players would have to download the whole zone. <br><br>Despite all that, I am in agreement with you, in theory at least. And I certainly understand how such things can make the game more exciting.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000119.html"><b>Questions about Cannibalize 2, 3 ,4 </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to every shaman I have talked to, every board I have read, each tiny bit of information I can scrape up, canabalize 4 does not drop anywhere, is not for sale anywhere, does not have a quest anywhere. <br><br>Was this done on purpose to torture the shaman community or is this just another glitch that needs fixed?

It seems to have about 5 or 6 lines of text in it but it vanishes before I can read what the text says.. It is not a Windows-generated error or confirmation box of any kind, and from what I am able to see it seems to have an "EQ style" appearance to it. From reading threads on several EQ boards it appears to be showing up on several other player's PC's as well but since it exists for such a short period most have likely missed it.

The Test Server is the subject Shadoe explores in his latest article titled <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid988510119,92452,"><b>When Proddies Attack</a></b>.  The following is a clip from this editorial:<UL>One thing you have to understand about Test Server players, is that they value their isolation. No, not value&#8230; covet. I can't emphasize enough how compelling this sentiment is to these people, even to the point where they brave the ever-present threat of complete character wipes to obtain it. The Test Server has already weathered one item wipe, triggering an exodus the likes of which Fidel Castro has never seen. What does that tell you about those players who chose to remain? <br><br>I have to admit, I was one of those who chose to stay. Though I left to play elsewhere for a while out of spite, my characters remained on Test, placed in a state of suspended animation with the hopes of being cured by future generations. A cure was never discovered, so I continue to play on both Test and production servers to this day. In my arrogance, I believe this qualifies me to lecture you, the reader, on what happens in the Test Server when proddies attack.

Another round of updates were spotted the Developers Corner today posted by Alan:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000136.html"><b>Kodiaks in the Great Divide </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to one of the latest patch messages, Kodiaks in the Great Divide were supposed to be seen as "animals" and be affected be Animal specific spells. My friends and I went hunting there last night (Fri, 3/30/01) and guess what? They arent. We all got messages saying that "this spell may only be cast on animals". As we were set to do a little fear hunting and our spells and attacks were geared for it. Luckily, we could root and move to remem spells and change plans. No one died, but it was close. I did petition a GM and he did tell me that the code did not go into this patch as was announced. <br><br>Please tell others about this, I just dont want anything like this to happen to anyone else because they beleived the mis-information posted on the patch message. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Kirlan Oakthorn (Ranger, level 38th, Druzzil Ro) ]</i></font><br><br>Sorry for the confusion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This change currently exists on Test server, however in the last patch we did not patch Great Divide, this change should go live in the next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe ]</i></font><br><br>So the change should make it in the next patch. Again, I'm sorry for the error in the patch message.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thought</b></a><br>Danyela wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I posted a comment about this yesterday, but I did not get an email response letting me know it had been received, so I am submitting it again. <br><br>Many months ago, when enchanters were getting defensive about the dillution of their defining class abilities, a promise was made rather vehemently that no items would ever be placed in the game that granted the wearer a clarity effect. This was to guarantee that enchanters would always have something unique they could do, especially in light of all the illusions and other versatility given to other classes that used to be the domain of the enchanter. <br><br>Now, with the upgrade of the planes, Cazic Thule himself drops items that grant the effect of Flowing Thought. Ok, that isn't officially clarity, but 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' should come to mind. It may not be clarity, but it sure acts like it. Even better in many respects as it never wears off. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I can only guess that you're not very familiar with the actual effect of Flowing Thought. <br><br>I'm an advocate of the whole idea of not blurring the class lines. But here your are concerned about something that if rubbed vigorously on that line, with much force and perseverance, won't even smudge it. If Flowing Thought acts like clarity, then I act like a Pulitzer Prize winning author&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' <br><br>This is true, however the difference between Flowing Thought I and Clarity II is more like the difference between a rose and a dandelion. <br><br>- L. Poe ]</i></font><br><br>To top all that off, we're talking about the New Cazic here, not the little baby Cazic that you used to know&#8230; <br><br>And I wanted to let you all know that we won't be sending individual e-mail responses to every comment. We don't have the resources for that. There is a confirmation page that you'll see when you successfully send in a comment. If you see that, rest assured that we have received your comment. There's no need to send it in again. I'm sorry that we can't respond to every comment. I'd like to, but it's just not possible.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000010.html"><b>Absor Wrong!</b></a><br>Furgan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You Wrote 'All area of effect spells will damage the caster.' <br><br>Actually, all AOE rain spells will damage the caster, not all AOE spells. Lighting storm is an AoE rain spell and as such it will damage the caster. You may want to go back an post a followup to your comment that it was intentional that an AOE Rain spell was chosen as the proc for this weapon, since I beleive that is more of what the original person was asking. ]</i></font><br><br>And to make it worse&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: He's right. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe ]</i></font><br><br>It seems that I was wrong&#8230; :)<br><br>My point still stands, though. Not all weapons can be the best weapon in the game. This one has uses. The fact that some people won't use a certain items does not mean that we need to change it so that it is a more powerful item.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000137.html"><b>Damage Shields</b></a><br>Cedral wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I always wondered why player-cast damage shields are unresistable. <br><br>It seems strange that a level 50 rock golem would take damage while pounding a level 9 character with a thistle coat. <br><br>Don't you find it odd that a monster that easily resist Draught of Fire (51 wizard) is burned every time by the lowliest magician damage shield?]</i></font> <br><br>The answer to that, really, is: Because they are, that's why. :)<br><br>Thistle coat is easy, it's a physical object. If the golem could resist it, then it would be resisting sword blades and arrows. <br><br>The fire one is different. I could, I suppose, come up with a good enough explanation for it. Like perhaps the fact that the shield resides within the aura of the person being hit, that shield is much stronger than normal fire spells. Or that by actively reaching into the fire the opponent is sacrificing his ability to resist the fire. <br><br>The reality is that those spells just don't give resists, and their power and effectiveness is based on that fact. If they were resistible they might be more powerful. <br><br>Though I like the idea that in order to reach into that fire to attack their enemy, someone has to give up his resistance. They are willingly putting themselves into the fire, and that gives it the power to burn them. I'll stick with that one.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000130.html"><b>Server Split Questions</b></a><br>I'm going to respond within your post. With so many questions, it's easier to read if the answers appear directly after the questions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have been playing EQ for about 6 months now, and I have found out that the server I play on was initially a split server. Recently, a new split server (Zebuxaruk) was opened, splitting off E'Ci and The Rathe, as I recall. <br><br>My questions revolve around split server economics, and are many. Though you might be able to answer several or all of them with a simple publicized policy statement regarding split servers. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, there isn't a lot of mystery about it, but I'll answer your questions as best as I can. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 1. What metrics do you use to determine when or if a split server is created, and what servers it draws from? ]</i></font><br><br>We create new servers based on all sorts of factors. Primarily we put one up when their seems to be a need because of overcrowding on existing servers. There's no science to deciding whether a new server will be a 'split' or a new server. We judge that based on the perceived need as much as anything. And when it is a split server, we will split people from servers that are the most crowded. Keep in mind that some servers don't have their busiest times when others do. Recently, for example, we split Karana when it wasn't one of the top two busiest servers during the usual prime time. It was, however, much more crowded during its own prime time than the others were in theirs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 2. Why are all the split servers delineated from exactly two "older" servers? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think one was split from three servers. Splitting from two servers usually gives both the older servers the relief they need, while not flooding the new server with too many people. More than two could easily fill the new server (when you include players that start fresh on that server) so much that the new server would be needing a split&#8230; And that sort of defeats the purpose. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 3. Why are there not more opportunities to "split" from one server to another? ]</i></font><br><br>Undercrowding is just as much of a problem as overcrowding. We won't split a server based only on a slight or possibly a temporary increase in population. Splitting a server and ending up with an underpopulated server is something we need to avoid. We always approach adding servers with caution, nobody really knows how a server will react to a split, how many people will move and how many will stay. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 4. Once a new server is designated the "split to server", what is the likelihood of it becoming the "split from server" and in what time frame?]</i></font><br> <br>It's really the other way around. We'll usually identify that we need to split a server or two and then gear up to set up a server to split them to. The timeframe varies, as do all things, based on what's going on here or with our Ops department at the time. But we can move pretty fast. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 5. What happens in the case that you have characters on both of the servers being split from and you /movelog from both servers? ]</i></font><br><br>If you have a total of less than eight characters, then they would all be available to you on the new server. If your total, however, is greater than eight, some of those characters will not be available to you. You'll have to delete the ones that you are willing to lose until you have reduced yourself to just eight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 6. What is the procedure when characters from the two different splitting servers have the same name? Who keeps it, who changes? ]</i></font><br><br>When two servers are split to one server, one of the characters with duplicate names will have an 'x' appended to their name at random. The player whose character has had the 'x' appended to its name will be able to have his or her name changed by a GM to a new name. But the character without the 'x' will be the one to keep the original name. If you get the appended 'x' you will have to go by a new name, you won't be getting the old one back.<br><br><br>But, as was the case recently, if characters are moved to a server by a second movelog and there is an existing character with that name on the server, the existing character will keep the name and the new one will have the 'x' appended. The newly moved character can petition to have his name changed to something new. This is one of the risks of moving to a new server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 7. What is the chance of a new server that would allow splits from ANY other server? ]</i></font><br><br>None. For reasons I explained before, the new server would be hopelessly overcrowded. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 8. More specifically, what is the chance of Xev and Drinal splitting onto the same server in the future, and if they were to do so, how long into the future do you think that would be? ]</i></font><br><br>I can only guess that you have friends on one of those servers, and you play on another&#8230; :)<br><br>I can't possibly tell you when or if those two servers will be split. The odds of them being split to the same server would seem slim. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: 9. Could you explain again publicly why you will not move characters between servers except under the split server scenario? ]</i></font><br><br>There are a few reasons. People would want to switch servers just to avoid their reputations. We don't want people to be able to duck out on their reputations. And server economies vary. Pulling an account with a ton of items that are not as rare on one server to a new server where they are extremely rare provides an advantage to that player. And a lot of moves like that could affect the server as a whole. Moving characters also requires a fair amount of work on our side. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thank you for your response. <br><br>Esqubel Highmind<br>23rd Enchanter of Xev<br>Povar-Tarew Artisans]</i></font><br><br>I hope that clears things up a bit.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000131.html"><b>Divine Glory</b></a><br>Rangerguy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: When 'Divine Glory' wears off it says "Your Divine Strength Glory". Shouldn't it say "Your Divine Glory has worn off" or somehting close to that? ]</i></font><br><br>We fixed that a few patches ago.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000133.html"><b>Barrier of Force</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The effect on the wizard epic, Barrier of force, is currently overwritten if a druid casts Protection of the Glades on the group. This is extremely frustrating in the high end game where PoG is cast frequently. Is this the way it is supposed to be? I sincerely hope not, making an epic effect useless in some situations seems wrong.

But the cleaner way is to take the class off the list for using the spell. <br><br>You can ask a question like this in either forum. The fact that it seemed like a bug makes it appropriate for the QA forum, but the fact that your question actually covers a game mechanic that some people don't know about makes it something I can answer for you.

Mr. Poe assited Alan several times today by helping to explain certain spell questions on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000126.html"><b>Scale of Wolf</b></a><br>MagisteRex wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I posting to learn if the way Scale of Wolf works currently - drops the way in invis does if you cast or attack or are attacked - is a bug or as intended? <br><br>If as intended, please reconsider this. Druids get an upgrade to sow in wolf form at the very least and I believe they get one other. Bards call all outrun sow. Why cannont Shaman have an upgrade that is functional? It is worthless even as a long distance traveling spell since it drops if you are attacked. I have ended up in bad situations due to casters casting on me and even due to a greenie skellie getting in a lucky hit as I passed it. <br><br>This is absurd. <br><br>If the way it currently acts is a bug, please fix it! ]</i></font><br><br>I don&#8217;t want this to end in a lecture&#8230; so I'll do that now. <br><br>This was a perfectly nice comment. You made your points, you had your reason, and you were making sense. And then you decided to add the "This is absurd." line. This line changes the tone of your post from upset, but rational to upset and verging on irrational. It does not make your point stronger and it will not somehow make us more likely to agree with you. <br><br>I just needed to point that out. <br><br>Mr. Poe has an answer to your concern: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This effect was changed several patches ago. Scale of Wolf will only drop if the spell expires, the enchantment is dispelled, the person with the buff turns on auto attack, or the person with the buff casts a spell.

Quite a few of us rather like keeping our faction.

I hesitate to list them, but I'll tell you this much. It drops in Wakening Lands, Iceclad, and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. And we'll be increasing its drop rate in the Tower a bit. <br><br>And having such a good spell be hard to get isn't contrary to our intent. Good stuff should be hard to get.

It could be the same amount of mana and casting time as an evac, and would be useful at the end of a grouping session when everyone wanted to get back the city they were bound in. Just a suggestion. ]</i></font><br><br>I don't want to give away too much, but since I don't have any news about Shadows of Luclin&#8230; :)<br><br>Another short quote from Mr. L. Poe: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is going in next patch in the form of Translocate: Group it will drop in Velious. ]</i></font><br><br>It is, of course, my job to tell you that we intend to have it in the next patch&#8230; :)<br> <br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000124.html"><b>Spell Stacking Bug?</b></a><br>Nicol wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Topic: Spell stacking bug <br><br>The ranger spell call of earth overwrites/blocks the enchanter epic quest effect speed of shissar. <br><br>The latter is almost always the preferred buff.<br>Their effects are unrelated, far as I know. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, they both add armor class. I believe that the ranger spell adds greater armor class than the Speed of Shissar, and that would explain why it is the spell to take precedence. <br><br>This is not a bug. There will be cases when you must choose one spell over the other. Not all spells will stack, nor are they intended to. Making decisions about which spells to have cast on you is the same sort of decision that you have to make about which weapon to use or which armor to wear.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000123.html"><b>Voltaic Draught / Draught of Jiva </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I hope this is the correct forum for this question: <br><br>I acquired a spell the other day Draught of Jiva and found out I already had it but it was under another name, Voltaic Draught! These spells are not merely similar they are identicle in terms of resist, mana, casting time, spell recovery and damage per level. (the only difference it seems is the level of the spell: one is 54 the other is 55) Since I find this type of thing no where else in the EQ spell lists I have to ask whether there has been some mistake in the creation of this spell. <br><br>Validata Tempestas<br>Wizardess Of Saryrn ]</i></font><br><br>They may appear to be the same, but they are not. Draught of Jiva has a slight stun attached to it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000122.html"><b>Critical Hits With Bolt Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello, <br><br>I have recently been hearing about "Bolt" type spells doing critical hits (doing about double their normal damage). I was wondering if this is true or merely a rumour. <br>Any information would be much appreciated :)<br><br>Feynan Escafon'ea<br>45th Wizard<br>Karana Server ]</i></font><br><br>It's a phenomenon, not any sort of new special skill&#8230; here's what Lawrence Poe (spell guy) had to say about it: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: We have not added critical hits to bolt spells. I've read a couple emails about this phenomenon. I spoke with Steve Clover about this, what appears to be happening is that the mage will cast a bolt spell and due to lag or the zone server not updating it will miss and fly off. The caster of the bolt will cast another bolt spell as the 2nd bolt spell is hitting the first one will correct itself and also strike the target, giving the appearance of a "Double attack" or "critical hit". ]</i></font><br><br>I asked, 'cause it seemed strange to me, how a bolt could wander away like that. It seems that it's not something that strange. Bolts aren't that different than NPCs. If one can go astray, the other can. <br><br>So if you've seen this happen, check the circumstances. If these double hits have occurred after a previous bolt seemed to have missed or you thought it just failed to report damage (and might have, indeed, missed), then that would explain it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000119.html"><b>Questions about Cannibalize 2, 3 ,4 </b></a><br>RazcoForte wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: what is the significant changes ?<br>ex. HP to Mana exchange? ]</i></font><br><br>Lawrence Poe, spell guru, has a short answer for your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The Ratios of Cannibalize II and III were made slightly better. The hit point cost remained the same, but the mana return was slightly increased. ]</i></font><br><br>I also wanted to address something that I've been hearing a bit of lately. The changes to these original spells and the addition of the new one don't dramatically increase the power of the spell line. What they do is address an issue. Shamans everywhere were using Cannibalize I in preference to Cannibalize II because it was the more efficient. The improved spells address that problem. That's why they are only slightly better. The higher level spells are now preferable to those of lower level.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000120.html"><b>Teleport Spell to Bind Spot</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I dont know if anyone has mentioned this before but I think it would be a much welcomed addition to the teleport line of spells! Teleporting a group to the casters binding spot would speed up guild raids, trips to town. There have been many times I got a ride to a druid ring and then got left to walk as they gate to town. Toss the idea around and see what you think please. <br><br>thanks, <br><br>Radrez of Lanys T'Vyl ]</i></font><br><br>A spell like this will probably never be created in Norrath. There are far too many ways that such a spell could be abused. We're certainly not set against the convenience that this spell might add. But there are far too many ways to use a spell like that to trivialize zone content and the challenges that are presented in the game world. <br><br>Sadly, this isn't much different than watching many episodes of Star Trek where the writer has to create silly reasons why transporters can't work in a given area or why they can't use their replicators to do, well, just about anything. I mean, if you can transport people by taking them apart and putting them back together again, then you would never need a doctor. Nobody would need to die&#8230; <br><br>But I digress. The idea here is that we don't want to introduce things into the game world that, by their very nature, make many of the zone designs and concepts meaningless. So, this spell will probably never be seen in Norrath.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000121.html"><b>Abscond </b></a><br>Lord_of_the_Pit wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Abscond - Self only teleport to zone safe point. <br><br>I was informed by the GM that this is not accurate, the description on websites cannot be trusted. <br><br>The spell can get you killed becasue in certain cases it'll bring you right in front of a mob (i.e. fear) <br><br>a. What's the point of this spell?<br><br>b. 600 mana and cast time 7.0 @ lvl 52 seems expensive for a spell that does a self-only teleport to possible safe place and clears aggro. ]</i></font><br><br>Mr. Poe has been taking his day responding to comments. I appreciate his time. And, as I should, I pass on his responses to you: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote:  Abscond will take the caster to the "safe spot" in the zone. Safe spot being a designation we use for the load in point of a zone. It is true that sometimes these "safe spots" are not always safe, but we try to fix them when we find them. In the case of extraplaner zones however, there really are no "safe spots"]</i></font> <br><br>The value of the spell is evident to me; to remove yourself from what appears to be certain death to a place where there is but a small chance that you will find yourself in danger. :)</UL>

I announced those changes the second I heard them so that you would have as much warning as possible. <br><br>Since then we've looked into other, more interesting ways of fixing things that we deemed wrong with this area (I'm not going into details, I love the fact that this zone is complicated, and I'm not spoiling things). I'm not sure how, exactly, we're going to make these changes yet. And it might very well include making many of these items No-Drop, as I mentioned. But I think that you'll see that it works out well in the end, and making those items No-Drop shouldn't actually be a problem for those that are playing in the zone. We're adding levels of convolution to the zone. :)<br><br>I can't explain it further, but if the items do become No-Drop, we are aware of the concerns that folks have brought up, and we know that it's nearly impossible to tell what's what up there.

I ask this because the Velious Expansion seems to tell you that you should not bother with it until you can even get close to killing the dragon on the cover. Can you tell me what the cover shows? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Hammie]</i></font> <br><br>There was a quest that related to that picture. It was a dynamic quest (run by real people playing the NPCs involved) that ran shortly after the Ruins of Kunark was released. This quest will probably never be run again, since it was designed to be part of the story line that lead to the discovery of Kunark. So, unfortunately, you missed it. <br><br>You shouldn't let the cover art on the Velious box make you think that you can't enter Velious without the power to kill a dragon.

It is the story of Firiona Vie and her companions, a story of GM events, and zone changes. Bloody Kithicor, the whole Bertox thing in Qeynos, the dragons who are outcasts, this is the story of EverQuest. Granted, there are lots of sub-stories, and other stories in the world, but I think most people would agree that the real story revolves around the stuff with epic characters and worl-changing consequences. ]</i></font><br><br><br>Ok, I'll admit that. :)<br><br>But I disagree a bit. While those quests do lead to world altering events, they aren't really the 'story' of the game. While some folks do get involved in those events, and they become part of the story of their character's life on Norrath, for some these events are tales not reality. To me, at least, the real story involves my characters. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: <br>Apostrophe problems in the Subject again =)...just for note. <br><br>One thing that I've always wondered about concerning the "dynamic" nature of EverQuest, the ever evolving storyline, and the variations between Servers, etc. <br><br>Now, I understand that there are some storylines that come up dynamically that cross all the servers (like the Dark Elven war that changed the face of Kithicor). My Cleric has sniffed out another brewing in the Karanas (tremendously well done, BTW :), and smells the work of the foul Bertoloxxus behind it. Those seem to also coincide with big product releases, and that's a very cool thing as well. <br><br>But, beyond those, it does not seem that the world of Norrath is particularly dynamic in nature (at least not to any lasting extent), nor does it seem that servers have their own specific individual "character" by and large. <br><br>Here's what I mean, for the most part, no matter how monumental the efforts of a group of players, no permanent effect can ever be had upon the face of Norrath. That's expected, due to the "Everlasting" nature of its inhabitants. Still, you run into a roadblock "as a character" trying to write the story when you realize the static nature of the environs. <br><br>What I do wonder about is the "power" that a lead GM for a particular server might have in suggesting a change to his/her world. In other words, if a GM decided one day that he wanted pirates to have swarmed over the Ogre/Aviak island in Timorous Deep, and have "taken over" the Ogre outpost there. What power would they have to (even for a short time) have someone change the spawns there so that Pirates spawned there instead? I understand that there could be severe technical limitations to this...but it would open the possibilities of characters being able to effect a "change" upon their world. <br><br>For example, let's say that a Guild of Followers of Marr declared a crusade (much like the Pirates above). Let's say they staged a fantastically successful raid, and kept the island cleared of Ogres for a full week (real time). Let's say that in the course of this, the GM's ran an event where the Ogres tried to take the island back, and failed. The GM would then have the option of effecting a "permanent change" on the island to change it around. The world would be dynamic, and a change would have been made on that individual server. <br><br>I know the kind of nightmarish changes this would cause programatically, and I understand how difficult the patch process might be to try and keep up with it. What I might suggest, however, would be the possibility of localizing this to a special server (Perhaps even a RolePlaying server? Hmmmm? Sorry, had to get that in :)) <br><br>Call it a "Dynamic Storyline" server if you like, and give the GM's license to do anything they wanted to effect the storyline. Restrict them to rules that they have to coincide with the "global" storylines, and give them a specific list of things they can do to the environment at different levels. Use the current event structure as a guideline, but take the kid gloves off. Let the GM's play Gods, smite down characters for no reason, create general havoc in their world, even without the "world" being affected. Let them do anything necessary (even destroying character's items, changing religions, heck, change a character's SEX if it takes that). Let them submit changes to the world based on story, and schedule some programmer time to do them. Keep the patching scheme on a different line than the main program (much like the Test Server is done today). <br><br>Obviously, it's a pretty bold step, but it's something to consider strongly for EverQuest II (The Second Story), or any other MMORPG that you guys might design. It might even be a way to spur on interest when your "next big thing" starts to take away from the EQ player-base. <br><br>All just suggestions, as usual, take them as ye will... <br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names ]</i></font><br><br>Heads will role&#8230; er&#8230; roll! <br><br>I've no idea why those apostrophes are such a nightmare. I'll hassle someone about it. <br><br>Unfortunately, maintaining completely different data for each server would be as much of a nightmare as you imply. <br><br>I certainly would love to play in a world such as you describe. But many people wouldn't. There are a lot of EverQuest players that do not like the idea of allowing a GM to 'smite down' their characters, from on high or from below, with or without reason. <br><br>And even if this were to happen on a single server it would require a ton of resources. One GM can only entertain so many people at one time, after all. Writing up, testing and coding changes to a zone (even the ones that might seem simple enough) is time consuming. The awesome thing going on now regarding the plague has taken several people a lot of time to conceive, code and build. They deserve a ton of credit for it, it's a great event. But it's a time consuming process.</UL>
