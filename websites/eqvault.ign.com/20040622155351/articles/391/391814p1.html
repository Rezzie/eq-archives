<span class=dateline>February  21, 2000</span> - It spread out before him, the emense, dark Kithicor Woods, through which he must pass in order to meet his friends in the Commonlands. Scytalix Atreides knew the woods were well know for the number of travelers who spent days trying to find their way through. Some had never emerged from the other side. 
It was not because dangerous creatures lived admist the huge trees. The Kithicor Woods, in fact were known to be quite peaceful. The canopy of dense leaves overhead blocked out most of the sun's light from the twisting trails below. Some of the trails had no final destination, they just gradually faded away, leaving whoever had followed them in a dark sea of identical trees. During the daytime, if one knew their way, a person could follow the correct trails and find their way out to the westernmost part of the Commonlands.
At night, however, a thick, wet mist settled, making it almost too dark for even one with elven sight. 
	Scytalix did not have elven sight. He was a Barbarian from the frozen Northlands of Halas. It was dusk, and as he wandered into the woods, he began to realize that he could barely make out the faint path he was following. Maybe he should camp for the night and navigate the woods in the daytime. But his friends were counting on his help and time was running out. He was big and little stood in his way, but he was slow, and was almost a day overdue for the meeting.
	As he squinted through the fading light, he thought he saw a figure on the road ahead. Or was it just a small tree? The mist ahead parted some and he realized that there was indeed somone approaching.
He lifted a huge battle axe from the strappings on his back and held it where it was more visable. He didn't want to seem threatening to the other, but wanted it well known that he would not be a victim to a highway robbery. Whoever it was, they were headed with a deliberate stride right towards him.
	A few paces in front of him, the figure halted. It was tall for a human, but slight of build, and covered from head to ankle by a heavy black cloak. The face was shrouded with a deep hood.
	"Lay down your weapon, Traveler," a  firm but definitely female voice commanded. "I bring you no harm. I am a Mercenary, charged with the duty of seeing all through these Woods."
	Scytalix put up his axe on his back again. This was a Mercenary? He glanced down at her feet and saw that sure enough, she wore the gilded black boots that the Mercenaries wore. But charged with guiding travellers, he doubted. She was probably empolyed by one of the Lords at HighPass to spy out whoever had bussiness passing through the woods that boardered that notorious town. But if she could get him through these woods in a timely matter, he would allow her to guide him.
	"How long will it take to reach the Commonlands?" He demanded.
	"No more than this night and all of tomorrow, if you stop babbling and follow me."
	"I MUST be in the Commons by noon tomorrow!" 
	"I strongly suggest that you lower your voice, Traveler," she said through a clenched jaw. "Your harsh manners may make me cut out your tongue!"
	"Well then, shall we go?" He whispered. It sounded loud in the silvery mist.
	She turned sharply on her heel and briskly began back the way she had come. Scytalix silently followed, peering intently ahead of him so as not to loose his guide in the darkness.
	Hours later, after what seemed to Scytalix as walking circles around the same trees, the Mercenary came to a halt in front of a small log building.
	"We will rest here until dawn comes," his guide annouced.
	The windowless shack was small and crude, but the wood pile was full and Scytalix proceeded to build a fire to drive of the dampness from the mist. He dropped his backpack and axe in the corner and removed his heavy, horned helm. He knelt in front of the fire, trying to dry away the damp chill that had settled into his fingers. His back was turned to the Mercenary, but he could heat her rustling though her packs behind him.
	"I will share some mead with you, Traveler, if you have any meat to spare." She offered in a soft voice. "It is hard to find big game in these woods."
	Scytalix turned around to face her, a bit startled by her friendly offer. He froze and stared, rather impolitely, as Barbarians often do. Standing before him, dressed startling in black, was a tall, lithely slender woman.  Her long, well-formed legs were encased in a blackened iron chain mail, and she wore a black silk man's shirt and vest. Her gold-heeled Mercenary boots were the only brightly colored thing she wore. She was removing a black mailed veil from her head, hiding her face from his sight. When she was done, she looked up at him with questioning eyebrows, and large brilliant black eyes. Her hair, now free from the armor, he could see was a long braid of shiny golden brown. It draped serpent-like down her breast, a bright contrast to the black silk.
	"I asked if you would like some mead, Traveler!" She harshly brought him out of his daydreams. How long would her hair be if he untwisted that braid? Would it cover her breasts? Her black eyes flashed with anger at being stared at.
	"Uhhh...yes, I do have some meat I could share. A hunk of dried snow bear from home. Do you have a hunting knife to cut it with? Mine is a litte dirty for sharing."
	She stood still for a moment, her arched eyebrows drawn in thought. Then she reached down below her black leather belt, down the front of her leggings. She pulled out a knife with a blade half the length of Scytalix's hand. She held it out to him with a sly smile. When he held out his hand to accept it, she slapped it into his palm, blade-first. It was plain steel, unadorned accept for the initials V.L. engraved on the handle. The letters were surounded by an etched vine pattern. He could feel the heat from her belly burning into his palm from the flat steel blade. The fire felt a little too warm.
	He thought about where the little knife had been until he noticed her pulling more blades out from hidden places on her person. One from each boot, one strapped on the inside of a firm thigh, one from a forearm, and the last, a long narrow spike from between her breasts. 
	"As you can see, Traveler," she warned, "I am well armed, and you can be assured that my years in training at the academy have taught me how to use these. I have others too,  that you cannot see"
	Scytalix wondered where these might be hidden.
	"I suggest that you stay on your side of the cabin. And do not think that your size can overpower me. I will have a blade sticking out of your belly before you could get both hands on me."
	She seated herself in front of the fire and began twisting the cork off a small jug. Scytalix joined her a good distance away, but so that he could still watch her face. If she'd only smile again. He thought there may a hint of girlish dimples in her cheeks. He divided his bear meat in two halves and handed one to her on the point of her knife. She took a man-sized swig from the jug of mead and passed it over, wiping the back of her hand accross her mouth.
	"How long did you study at the academy," he asked, trying to draw her into conversation.
	"For ten years." She answered. "I have killed many men, so do not underestimate my strength and abilities."
	"Look, Mercenary, why don't you drop the formalities and just enjoy peaceful human company! I am not going to attack you in your sleep! I am Scytalix Atreides of Halas, and I am going to the Commonlands to meet some old friends. Why don't just tell me your name and we can be friends for one night?" He passed the jug back to her, and smiled.
	She studied his strong face for a moment, her eyebrows dipping into a thoughtful frown. Then she leaned over and reached a small, slender hand towards his face. She brushed his short coarse beard with a knuckle, and mumbled something about crumbs. Her eyes rose to meet his. In the firelight, her hair had a coppery glow and he could now see that her eyes weren't black at all. They were a deep, dark brown.
	"It's been a long time since I can say I've had a friend," she spoke softly with a small smile. There were almost dimples. She looked sincerly into his blue eyes, noting that that they were honest and gentle, depsite his harsh voice and brute size.
	 "You learn not to get to close to anyone, being a Mercenary. Anyone who pays you is your friend. When the job is done, they may try to put a knife in your back. But you, you are not paying me are you, Scytalix? So maybe just for this one night, I will have a friend. My name is Vathelle. I gave up my family name for the anonymity of being a Mercenary, but I can tell you, my family was from the Qeynos Hills, not too far from where you came from."
	She rose up and stretched like a feline, nearly letting out a cat-like growl. She walked over to her cloak and spead it out near the fire.
	"We had best be getting some sleep, My Friend, Scytalix. We must rise with the dawn to get you to the Commons and your friends. It is a short, and easy trail we follow come day. The path outside this door leads south to the edge of the Kithicor Woods"
	Scytalix likewise lay down on his cloak, using his pack for a pillow.
	"Vathelle, friend to friend, why do you do it? Be a Mercenary, I mean. A beautiful woman like you shouldn't have to sell herself to the highest bidder. Why don't you have a husband or something?"
	"Scytalix, I am beginning to like you. Don't ask me questions like that, or I may change my mind. The life of a Mercenary is not so bad. Sure, I slave from employer to employer, doing jobs that are sometimes against my own ethics, but there is money there! You could join me sometime, when I'm done my duties in these woods, and after you have met your friends. You may find the life to be favorable to your purse, and your sense of adventure!" 
	With that, she rolled over, pulling her cloak over her shoulders, ending their conversation. Sctytalix watched her for a bit, wondering about the life she led. He soon dozed off himself, to enjoy dreams of seeking out where she hid those knives.
	In the morning, when he awoke, the fire had burned out. He rose and looked around the room. It was empty except for his own belongings. No sign of the Mercenary. He did remeber her instructions on which way would lead him to his destination, and realized that she never had any intention on leading him in the morning. He gathered his things and headed to the door. His hand on the latch, and a glint of metal caught his eye. There, stuck in the wood of the door, was the Mercenary's little steel knife, the one which she kept sheathed against he warm belly. It impaled a small scrap of parchment, with the words "HighPass" and the signature "Vathelle" surrounded by a vine pattern.
	He headed out in to the daylight, still darkened by the trees of the Kithicor Woods and followed the trail south.<div class=byline>-- <a href="mailto:ayse@home.com">Aysha Atreides</A></div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
