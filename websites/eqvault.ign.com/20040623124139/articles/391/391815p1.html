<span class=dateline>February  21, 2000</span> - It was hot. That&#8217;s all that he could think of, sitting there on the damp boggy ground, his brow furrowed in thought as he swatted mindlessly at the stinging clouds of insects. Even the fire was a mouldering, smelly affair that gave off great clouds of stinking bluish smoke. Nothing was dry, and he wondered if he would ever feel clean again. He looked around him, and then upwards into the night sky. Not much longer till dawn he thought, and then they could get moving again. He&#8217;d be damned if he was going to spend another night in the malodorous, fetid swamp of Innothule. Hmmm, speaking of they he wondered where his companion was. 
Suddenly the surrounding water erupted upwards as a greenish mud colored form rose from beneath the dark water. Great clots of mud and vegetation flew off it&#8217;s great bulk. Up and up it rose, towering above him by a full head and a half. Purple maleovalent eyes peered balefully outwards, and it&#8217;s great ham hands came up clutching something in them. 
"Urg, me thought yuh was over on da uver side of da swamp. Me took times ta find ya," said Hungaz, "Me finds dis&#8217; follerin&#8217; me so me&#8217;s brung dem&#8217; wif me. Dey&#8217; don&#8217;t move so much anymore. Me only bash dem&#8217; a lil&#8217;bit." Ragn&#8217;s eyes bugged out as the two froglok corpses were raised effortlessly by the huge troll and offered to him. The trolls fists were wrapped around the rusty mail shirts that the frogloks had fashioned, and his grip seemed to crush them with a shriek of metal being compressed. " That&#8217;s fine Hungaz," said Ragn with a sigh, "I don&#8217;t really need them. We&#8217;ll be leaving soon."
Hungaz flopped down with a crash still holding both frogloks in his hands. Their skulls noticeably dented and their great tongues flapping about aimlessly. Shaking the one in his left hand so that the wide grinning mouth flapped open and shut he spoke in a surprisingly high-pitched falsetto "Oh Mr. Troll, will you play with me?", said Hungaz, "Well, me onlees gots a bits of time, but yuh wants ta play a game?" Then he rattled the one in right hand, "Well Mr. Troll, why don&#8217;t we play the bashin&#8217; game? I hear all trolls like to bash!"
"Hungaz!",said Ragn scowling at the massive grey green troll in front of him, "Stop that! It&#8217;s disgusting! Just get rid of them. The last thing we need are any souvenirs of this stinking place. Not to mention that those two aren&#8217;t going to be smelling to good in a couple of hours." Ragn then stood up and began to pack his camp gear away in preparation for their departure.
Hungaz had an injured look on his face, but he tossed the two corpses behind him with a small flip of his arms. They landed with a loud splash far out in the brackish water and they had almost disappeared beneath the surface when something long, green and scaly snapped them up and then disappeared under the water with a last flick of a ridged whip-like tail. "I wuz&#8217; onlee tryin&#8217; ta hav sum funs. I hates waitin," he said with a grunt, "Wer&#8217; we goin&#8217; anyways?", he asked lifting one cheek up off the ground and scratching vigorously. 
"Honestly Hungaz, I don&#8217;t know. I just have this feeling. I need to keep travelling this way. I know you miss the others," said Ragn giving Hungaz a brisk pat on his big bald head," but I need you to watch my back. This isn&#8217;t the safest place in Norrath you know. All sorts of things creep, and crawl around in here. But, I really wanted your company. You may be big and dumb, but you know the difference between right and wrong. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here with me." He finished with a big smile on his face.
"Yuh, me likes ya Ragn. Ragn my friend." said Hungaz, a foolish grin splitting his floppy green face in two. He pulled out his great two-handed sword, and then took up a rock from the ground and began to work out the nicks in the blade. The stone made a rasping, grating sound, that eventually turned into the smooth sound of well sharpened steel as the bumps and scrapes disappeared under the relentless grind of the stone and the impressive strength that was Hungaz&#8217;s birthright as a troll.
"It&#8217;s time to go,"said Ragn after another hour had past. He hoisted his pack to his shoulder and looked about in the pre-dawn gloom," It&#8217;s light enough to travel and the bigger creatures should be sleeping now. We should be out of the swamp by midday." With that, he turned towards the north and began making his way through the dense, damp vegetation, cursing as the insects followed him, and stung his flesh. Hungaz gave his sword one more swipe with the rock, and then got up. Turning towards the water he closed one eye and squinted in the early morning gloom. Hauling back on one arm, his tongue came out and to the right of his mouth and his face bunched up in concentration. Then he let fly the smooth water shaped rock. It skipped six times before the great troll turned to follow his friend northwards, a simple-minded smile on his face.
* * * * * 
The haze of the desert sun beat down on the trio, one slightly ahead and seeming to lead, with the others following a few paces behind. The sand made travel difficult as their boots crunched down, and indented into the loosely packed grains. Two sets of tracks led off up and over the dunes, stretching back into the hazy horizon to the south. One largish booted pair, and another huge set made by some gargantuan species. Upon close inspection, the trio turned out to be the great troll Hungaz, and lumbering at his side, almost as large himself, the barbarian shaman Ragn. Strangely out of place here under the sun the pair trotted relentlessly. Ragn was far from his frigid homeland of Everfrost. That great expanse of frozen tundra many, many leagues to the north. A land that never saw the greenery of spring, and was a hardship merely to survive. The northern tribes had learnt to flourish, however, and they were a strong and proud people. Even the trolls, who&#8217;s own homeland abutted the desert, rarely came out under the withering heat of the arid desert. The person in the lead was not a person, but rather a long lean wolf, slightly transparent, a spirit companion, showing them the path. It did not speak, and left no tracks, but it moved in a determined direction, northward towards the rising peaks of the Rathetear mountains. Finally, after what seemed like days, but was in fact only mid-afternoon of the day they had set foot into the furnace that was the great desert of southern Ro, they came to the foothills, and thence to a small pass that led up into the mountains. Still they journeyed onwards, relieved to be out of the scorching heat, and their fatigue sloughed away in the coolness of the screening shade.
It wasn&#8217;t much to look at, thought Ragn, his breath coming in a steady rhythm. At least he wouldn&#8217;t be putting on any extra pounds soon. As a matter of fact, he was quite certain that he had sweated a few pounds off on this trek. Even though the sun had baked the moisture out of his sweat as soon as it appeared, he could still feel a salty, grimy coating covering his skin. Gods, what he wouldn&#8217;t give for a stream, or at least a shallow pond of water. Turning in mid-stride he jogged backwards for a few steps, making sure that Hungaz was still with him. The troll had accompanied him uncomplainingly for over a week now, and seemed content to follow his lead. Good old Hungaz, as stout a companion as anyone could ever want. Though most trolls were savage and brutal, Hungaz seemed to contain more of a human heart within him. He was easily amused, marveling at the simple beauty of a flower picked lovingly from the sides of a trail, but could turn savage and vengeful if his friends were threatened. Yes, a stout companion, and a good friend. A true friend.
Turning back to the spirit guide that had appeared this morning, surprising them both, he continued up the slight incline and deeper into the mountains. The peaks rose on either side of him, dark and forbidding, their caps dusted with snow. Seeming to touch the very sky in their magnificence. A testament to the raw brutal power of nature, and seeming to shrink into insignificance the cities and constructs that the various races of Norrath had created. Higher than the towers of Felwithe, deeper and more mysterious than the underground city of Ak&#8217;Anon, and dwarfing anything that the humans in Freeport and Qeynos had ever built. It was with these thought in their minds that the two trudged along, unmindful of the passage of time, and concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other.
At last the wolf stopped and sat, turning to face the pair, it&#8217;s tongue lolling out of it&#8217;s mouth. When they had almost reached it, the wolf sat up and then loped forward and around a bend. They wearily followed it, and when they had also turned the corner, they stopped in astonishment. Before them was a small clearing, the majority of it being occupied by a vast pool of still, deep water. The surface was calm, and the air seemed almost to lighten as they gazed into it&#8217;s placid depths. Though there were no trees, lush grass surrounded it, a marked contrast to the dark rock around it. On the other side of the lagoon was another passage snaking off into the mountains. What had shocked them however were the two stone monoliths flanking the entrance to the passage. They were shaped of a rock different than that of the surrounding mountains. It was a dark yellow, runes inscribed on it&#8217;s base and cabalistic markings ringing the top. Set above the right one was a carved wolf, while on the left was a bear. The wolf was standing, it&#8217;s hackles raised and it&#8217;s mouth hewn into a dangerous snarl. The fangs clearly visible, even from across the pond. The bear was standing on it&#8217;s two hind legs, it&#8217;s arms outstreched as if to grapple with an opponent. It to, was snarling, and it&#8217;s open mouth was gaping and feral.
"Ragn,"asked Hungaz, "where doggie go?"
"I don&#8217;t know Hungaz."said Ragn looking around for the spirit animal. It was no where in sight. "However I DO know that I need a bathe."
Saying that, he stripped off his stinking armor, and plunged headfirst into the icy water. The shock to his system was immediate, but he was expecting it. Soon he was luxuriating in the feeling of being clean once again. The cold forgotten, he sank down under the refreshing water and came back up just in time to catch a mouthful of water as Hungaz leaped joyously into the pond. Water sprayed in a wide arc as the troll, with obvious amusement, splashed about contentedly.
For some reason, Ragn couldn&#8217;t stop looking at the two obelisks. They seemed to tug at his mind, something almost remembered, but not quite within grasp of his consciousness. He would plunge back down into the water in an effort to get the two pillars out of his mind, but each time he came up, his eyes strayed back to them. Finally, unable to contain his curiosity any further, he turned and began to swim strongly for the other side of the lake. His lean muscled form cut the water like a knife, and his powerful strokes carried him to the far shore in a few moments.
He rose from the pond, water streaming off his naked form and approached the pillars. Unnoticed by the pair as they swam, the sun had set and the moon, full and bright, had risen in it&#8217;s place. The night air was crisp and sharp, the soft white radiance of the moon spilling down and refracting off the small lake as the water lapped at the shore. It filled the entire area with it&#8217;s shimmer, creating eerie patterns against the rock walls. Certainly enough light to read by, thought Ragn squatting down and running his hands over the runes.
"Wut dey sey,"asked Hungaz from behind him,"Me no reads so gud."
Ragn looked at his friend over one shoulder then turned back to the inscriptions on the pillars, a look of concentration clearly visible on his face. "They say,"started Ragn and running one finger over the runes as he read," Enter ye only willing to face death through the trial of spirit. Only through the merging of man and spirit shall earn ye the right to enter into the beyond. Take nothing with ye of this mortal realm. Take only what ye carry within you."
As he finished the inscription the long wailing cry of a wolf echoed and rolled around the pond, the sound seeming to come from the very air. It sent shivers down the spines of the two companions and they looked around for the source of the howl. Then, mixed in with the fading cry of the wolf, a great guttural snarl boomed and echoed as well, throwing echoes and reflections of itself back from the stone sides of the enclosure.
"Ragn,"said Hungaz in as low a whisper as his great voice could manage," Me tinks dat yuh shud come back wif me an we&#8217;s gos and leaves now. Me no like here. Me tink we go now."
"I know what you mean Hungaz,"said Ragn," But this is what has been calling me. This is what I am here for. I can feel it in my very bones. The spirits of this place are urging me to go forward. If I can cross into the spirit realm, then perhaps I can save my brother."
Ragn straightened himself and then turned to look at Hungaz with a steady gaze. Gone was the fear, gone was the fatigue. What remained was a look of impacable resolve. " You see,"said Ragn in a calm voice, "many years ago while hunting with my brother we came across two pillars like this in the mountains of Everfrost. We were young and foolish, and though we could read the runes, we paid them no heed. Old times, and even older stories, meant to scare children. We were men, or so we thought. My brother and I wrestled to see who would be the one to dare to challenge the spirits. Luckily for me, he was older and stronger. He won and ran off past the pillars, I sat there and waited. I didn&#8217;t have to wait too long, for there arose a great cry from within. I could tell that it was my brother, and I almost ran forward myself, but something stopped me. Before I could cross the threshold between the two great statues, I was thrown back by a great force and landed on my back. As I raised myself up to hurl once again through the pillars, a ghostly shape appeared between the columns. A ghost wolf, a spirit totem of the beyond. It blocked me as I tried to dodge past it, and then there was a blinding flash of light and I fell backwards to the ground unconscience."
Ragn turned and gazed upwards at the columns, their stone surfaces gleaming in the moonlight. "I awoke many days later," said Ragn in a soft voice, "I was back in our village, in my own bed. Apparently the wolf spirit had appeared to a patrol from my village sent in search of me and my brother, and they followed it to my body. It was they who carried me back, and they all swore to seeing the great wolf, so I have no reason to suspect that they were lying, or that I had seen things. Of my brother, never was he seen again. Though I begged and pleaded with the elders to let me try and search for him, none would let me pass the pillars. It was deemed forbidden, and the entrance was sealed off with most powerful magics. I haven&#8217;t thought of my brother till now, and it was surely him who was guiding my steps all these years. I can feel him nearby. I must save him. Alone he cannot free himself from the other place, but together, we may be able to break the seals that hold him in bondage. I know he&#8217;s still alive. Don&#8217;t ask me how I know, but he is. He is in that other place. The spirit realm. Why, or for what reason they have kept him, I do not know. All I know if that he needs me now, and I will not fail him this time. I didn&#8217;t really remember him till that spirit appeared this morning to guide us. I&#8217;m sure it is the same spirit that forbade me to follow my brother so many years ago, knowing I had much to accomplish in this realm first."
Finishing his story, Ragn turned back once again to face the big troll. "I must go forward alone now, Hungaz. Where this path leads, you may not follow. No matter what happens, you must promise me you will not cross between these pillars."
" Me go where Ragn go," said Hungaz, "Ragn friend! Hungaz protect Ragn." His great voice tried to conceal the hurt that lay in his heart, but was not quite able.
"No, "said Ragn, "this is no place for a troll. The path will lead only to your death. Promise me!"
"No, Hungaz no promise. Hungaz no hear you now. Hungaz go where Ragn go!" said Hungaz bringing his arms up to cover his ears, tears already welling in his huge, luminous eyes.
"Promise me, Hungaz!"
"No, Hungaz go with Ragn. Ragn friend!" wailed Hungaz sitting down on the grass and shaking his head from side to side.
"Promise me!"
"No&#8230;."
"Promise me!" shouted Ragn tearing Hungaz&#8217;s arms away from his head, and then squatting to look into the trolls face. "Promise me, Hungaz.", he said softly, " Promise me, and I will come back. Promise me, and I will return to be your friend. I will come back, but only if you promise."
Hungaz&#8217;s body shook with racking sobs, and he ran one beefy arm across his nose as he sniffled. Looking into Ragn&#8217;s sincere face he quietly mumbled. "Hungaz promise, no go." Ragn threw his arms around the great troll and gave him a big hug.
"Ragn promise to come back,"said Ragn holding his dear friend, " I won&#8217;t leave you alone here. I&#8217;ll come back. Camp here the night, then go home. I&#8217;ll find you." Saying that, Ragn turned and trotted through the pillars and into the dark passage.
Hungaz just sat there. His eyes seeming to see nothing but empty air, his breath coming in ragged stuttering inhales. "Hungaz promise. Hungaz no go&#8230;" repeated Hungaz shaking his head slowly from side to side, "Hungaz want Ragn come back. Hungaz no go. Hungaz wait here till morning, den go home. Hungaz wait home. Ragn come back. Ragn promise. Ragn promise come Hungaz&#8230;"
* * * * *
Ragn ran down the dark passage, stopping only long enough to imbue his eyes with the spirit of the snake. They glowed red in the dark, picking up the faint light in the canyon and reflecting it back. Though not as clear as a dark elf&#8217;s sight, it did enable him to negotiate the pass as it twisted and turned, backwards and forwards, but ever downward. His feet slapped coldly against the rock and his footfalls echoed and ricocheted off the canyon walls. The air had become oppressive, and a heavy weight seemed to lay against his soul. The night was charged with magic. It was almost something malleable here in this sacred place. Poor Hungaz, thought Ragn to himself with a frown, having to cover all that distance back to the swamps alone. Then he chuckled to himself. Poor Hungaz? Poor me!
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
The question sounded within the vaults of his mind, and he instinctively knew that it demanded action as a response. He could feel the hairs on his neck raise, and knew that something came for him. Something behind him, and yet he dared not look back, for that would doom him.
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
The question pounded at his brain, seeming to strike him like a physical blow. He knew now that any delay would cost him his life. He could feel the thing behind him getting closer, and could almost feel the hot slavering breath on his flanks. He seemed to hear the scalding slobber dripping in anticipation against the rocky floor. Raising his arms wide, he shouted out an incantation, and his feet churned. Infused with the spirit of the wolf, he coursed along the passage and pulled slightly ahead of what was hunting him. Still it seemed to be right behind him, no matter how hard his legs pumped nor how hard he leaned forward in his gait.
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
The question came again, seeming to blot out all thought, all sense of where and who he was. Dammit, he was running as fast as he could. Still the beast drew nearer, and nearer. Think Ragn, think! What do they demand? How can I cross the barrier?
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
This time the question almost bowled him over, and his pace staggered a bit before he regained his balance. Yes, now he knew. A great smile crossing his face, Ragn again raised his arms and invoked the spirit of the cheetah. As the last words of his spell rolled off his tongue he lept forward and kicked up a veritable hail of rocks and dust. Take that spirits! I come brother! I have discovered the secret of the trial of spirit! Surely the elders would be proud of him thought Ragn racing along, his body a blur in the night. His feet seemed barely to touch the ground, but where they did, it was sure footed and even. Not long now, he thought to himself. The spirits will let me through soon.
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
A cold fear gripped him, and his heart pounded in his chest. What else was there? What do they seek? What do they want, though Ragn in a panic. His mouth dropped open, gulping air and forcing his feet to go faster, but to no avail. There was nothing left to push, no faster could he go. The spirits had trapped him, and he was going to die. Try as he might, he could not go faster. No one had ever run this fast, and still the beast came after him. Still it slavered for his flesh, and he knew that it&#8217;s great claws would soon rend him to pieces.
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
Nothing. There is no spirit that will help me now. Nothing is left. He strained to think, but already the pounding of his heart, and the adrenaline coursing through his veins made that impossible. I&#8217;m sorry Hungaz, I&#8217;m so sorry. I won&#8217;t be able to keep my promise to you.
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
He ran faster than he had ever run before, a demon chasing him, and his feet bleeding and raw from their race along the canyon&#8230;
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
His hands slapped the sides of the walls, trying desperately to pull something down, anything to impede the pursuer that he knew was only steps behind him. Sobbing in despair, his breath whistling out as his stamina drained from him, he bore on, nothing left in him, no reserve energy, nothing to do but run.
What is the spirit that will pass the barrier?
Goodbye Hungaz, he thought, sudden tears blurring his vision. I&#8217;ll have to break that promise dear friend. He thought back on the great troll, and hoped the best for him. Hungaz didn&#8217;t belong in the brutish tribes of the trolls. He had too great a heart for that. He was one of the most selfless and true friends he had ever had. A true friend, with a kind soul. A friend who&#8217;s spirit had seen him through thick and thin. Then, suddenly, clarity breathed through his mind. He finally understood what the spirits were asking him, and it dawned on him with a sudden insight. He knew the answer that the spirits demanded of him! His mind set, and ready for the worse, he stopped and stood there in the middle of the passage. Looking up into the night sky he shouted out to the heavens.
"IT IS THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAT WILL PASS THE BARRIER!" he cried out, "Not through spells or incantations. Not through communing with nature. Not through taking on the aspects of animals, but the human spirit. The spirit to survive. The spirit to continue when all is lost. The spirit of comradeship, and the spirit to love others instead of hate. The human spirit can conquer all barriers!"
Then, inevitability etched on his face, Ragn turned to face the beast that had chased him from the start. He turned, and saw nothing. Stark gray rock walls, and a bloody set of footprints leading up to where he stood now. The human spirit, he thought, is indomitable. Then he was surrounded in a brilliant white light, and faded out. His last thought before he disappeared was that if the human spirit let him cross to the spirit realm in search of his long lost brother, then that same spirit would see him back to Hungaz and his friends in the Blood Tide. Then he was past the barrier, and the stone canyon was empty once more.
* * * * *
Hungaz awoke with the dawn, and trudged back down out of the mountains and headed south across the baking desert. He amused himself by sliding down the dunes, and then racing up the next one, only to repeat the same procedure. It took him most of the day to finally reach the edge of the swamp. He was tired, but at least the end of his voyage was in sight. It had been a long, long time since he had last been to Grobb, and it would be good to see home again. Home, he thought. Hungaz wait home for Ragn. Ragn promise come back.. Maybe Ragn already there, he thought. If not, Hungaz wait. Hungaz Ragn friend. Hungaz promise wait Ragn. Hungaz wait for he friend. Smiling to himself, he tromped off into the gloomy marsh towards home to await his friend Ragn.
A set of red eyes followed the lumbering troll, and the wolf sat up as Hungaz disappeared into the swamp. It pointed it&#8217;s nose in the direction the troll had headed and loped along behind. Always staying out of sight, but staying within tracking distance of the troll. It seemed almost to grin as Hungaz trod along singing to himself in an off-key. The promise would be kept.<div class=byline>-- Zalbar The Mad</div></div></div><div id="intelliTxt"><div class="editorial">
