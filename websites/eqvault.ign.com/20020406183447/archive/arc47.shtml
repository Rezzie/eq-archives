Here's the round-up of posts written by Alan today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046807.html"><b>Forums and Bugs</b></a><br>I don&#8217;t usually visit other sites because it seems likely to cause more trouble than it does good. If people think that they can get a response from Verant at a certain board site, then they will often flood that site asking questions, most often questions unrelated to that forum. And this will often harm the community that exists there more than it helps it. <br><br>But I do read those other forums with some regularity. <br><br>To answer your question, I don&#8217;t know when we&#8217;ll be patching to fix this bug. And I&#8217;ll certainly announce it as soon as I know. <br><br>I am know what bards get from the enhanced speed their drums give them for their movement songs. I would argue that the speed without them, however, is still faster than Spirit of Wolf. I understand that you are all used to a greater speed. But, be honest with yourselves and with me, is this really that much more than an inconvenience? Does fixing a bug that affects two songs warrant taking the servers down for several hours for our entire customer base? We don&#8217;t think it does.<br> <br>I want to stress that we are certainly sorry that this bug got into the game. And we&#8217;re sorry for the inconvenience it is causing some of our customers. But we have to consider the entire customer base when deciding to take servers down to fix this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046829.html"><b>Trueshot</b></a><br>Trueshot, when first implemented, was horribly broken. We, basically, gave the archer a minimum amount of damage using the Trushot, plus some modifiers. It turns out that doing this made the fast bows way too good, because their low base damage was being ignored, and some of the higher damage bows were made worse because their base damage was also being ignored. <br><br>So we recently changed it recently to work as intended. There is an amount of damage added to the base damage of the bow. So higher damage bows use their base damage, as do lower damage bows. The discipline is now working as intended&#8230; <br><br>But we agree that &#8216;as intended&#8217; in this case isn&#8217;t really good enough. We are evaluating some changes to the discipline, and we are running them on test. We are thinking about increasing the damage, or increasing it a bit more and reducing the duration&#8230; We&#8217;ll let you know what form the changes will take as soon as we are more certain what they will be. But we will definitely be improving the discipline.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046864.html"><b>"Accounts &#8216;deleted&#8217; isn&#8217;t really what it seems&#8230;"</b></a><br>Basically, the way that Station passwords were cached was changed recently. This means, basically, that if you are having trouble logging in, you may need to reset your password. <br><br>Go to: <br><br><a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/forgottop.jhtml?forgot=password">http://www.station.sony.com/services/forgottop.jhtml?forgot=password</a> <br><br>The system will mail you a new password. <br><br>If you e-mail address is not correct in your Station information, then you will not get the new password, and you&#8217;ll need to contact the Station directly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046873.html"><b>FAQ Revision</b></a><br>The EverQuest FAQ is getting out of date. I&#8217;ve been assigned the enviable task of rewriting it. <br><br>Are there any questions that you think we can answer in the FAQ that are not already there? Keep in mind that the idea of a FAQ is to answer questions for the new or potential player, not for those that have played for a while. And we&#8217;re not going to turn the FAQ into a spoiler list&#8230; <br><br>But there are certainly some questions that you had when you started playing that you wish the FAQ had answered. And if you are a new player, post up your questions here. <br><br>I&#8217;d like to include as much user input into the revision as I can. It saves me from having to do too much thinking&#8230; :)<br><br>Thanks<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046790.html"><b>More Bard Issues</b></a><br>Ralidin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;...is how the Selo's bug was patched in. I thought that the long track record of patches that have to do with bard-like effects have always broken bards, you would have taken a look for once.&#8221;]</i></font> <br><br>I find it hard to defend the fact that we missed this bug. I can assure you that it is not because we harbor some secret hatred of bards. For as many bugs as we&#8217;ve missed regarding bards, we&#8217;ve caught many more. There is no excuse for missing it. But it happened. And we&#8217;re sorry that it slipped past us. <br><br>We&#8217;ll be patching again as soon as we can. But we won&#8217;t be making an emergency patch for this one bug. Again, I&#8217;m sorry that we introduced this bug, and I&#8217;m going to look into how it was that this got past us.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046796.html"><b>Bard Thread</b></a><br>While I accept how upset bard players are over this error, I'm going to have to start shutting down the excessive number of threads that have been started over this issue. I'm willing to talk about it, that's not the problem. The problem is that there are other issues that deserve attention too, and multiple threads on the same topic have a tendency to stifle other topics.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-2.html"><b>Root + Scare = Kiting Heaven</b></a><br>Solos wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: &#8221;If you remember, a couple months ago Verant put in a patch to make kiting less effective. That is, DoT will do 2/3 dmg if the DoTed mob moves around.&#8221;]</i></font> <br><br>This is certainly something that we discussed before making this change. While it does make kiting slightly easier, it&#8217;s not that significant of an improvement to that tactic. We are anticipating very little change in that particular tactic as a result of this change. And the overall positive effect to the game system far outweighs what it might or might not do to kiting. We&#8217;ve never stated that kiting is a tactic that we are against, as a rule. The change you mentioned was made because at that time the tactic was, essentially, a risk-free method for gaining experience. The change to Root might very well make this tactic a bit easier, but we don&#8217;t think that it will be risk-free.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045987.html"><b>Concern About Bard Songs Not Overwriting Root</b></a><br>Word is that only the movement portion of a spell will be suppressed by Root. So if a spell has a movement reduction and debuff components, only the movement reduction component will be suppressed.</UL>

Brad McQuaid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045899.html">posted some of his thoughts</a> in a thread after a Tuning Meeting yesterday:</a>:<UL><i>After a long meeting that started before lunch and ended just now (we did break to eat, though), here's what we're going to try out short-term:<br><br>1. Increase the grouping experience bonus significantly. It's currently 2% for each group member other than yourself. When it's finalized and about to go live, we will release the actual percentages.<br><br>2. Increase the experience modifier for underutilized Old World and Kunark dungeons. We will post the percentage by which these dungeons were increased when this data goes live.<br><br>3. Place more bind spots in the Old World and Kunark (we decided to try this as opposed to more teleports). These will most likely be placed somewhat near to dungeons we consider underutilized.<br><br>Realistically, these changes will probably go live not this patch (hey, it's tonight/tomorrow), but rather the next one.<br><br>More longer term, we are doing to randomize loot, re-path, and even totally revamp some Old World dungeons.<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Dranis Winzar informed us of a new event:<blockquote>On Saturday December 13 at 4:00 Eastern Time, Dranis Winzar and Tedain Rhythmweaver will have a special Roleplaying Duel. This will be somewhat like a play that contains a duel between the two. People involved in the Event will be Dranis Winzar, Tedain Rhythmweaver, and hopefully the guild of Arma Aquetatis. There will be no outside participants in the Event. Spectator ONLY! However this will be a first time ever that players made an actual "play" on Everquest. The duel will be held at the East Commonlands at the desert area near the zone to Freeport. The Event will be announced within the game 10 minutes before it starts in Freeport and the East Commonlands. Please feel free witness this Event. There will be more in the future as well that continues the story.<br>NOTE: There was a story made up before this but was never actually played out or written.

An increase in the experience bonus for grouping is in no way a reduction in the ability of any class to play solo. If it is an encouragement to group, then that&#8217;s a good thing. And that is, obviously, the intent. Nothing is being removed from anyone&#8217;s ability to solo, so I can&#8217;t see how this would affect the solo player.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045911-2.html"><b>Server Problems</b></a><br>Sorry about that. I'm not sure what the problem was, but there was a hickup with the login server. It should be working now.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045938.html"><b>No New Bard Spells</b></a><br>Actually, I don't think bards are getting a new song with the patch.

Let's keep this to items that have no graphic at all, or those that seem to be part of a set that don't have new graphics to match the set. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046448.html"><b>Bard Problems</b></a><br>Unfortunately we broke the bard drums with this patch. That&#8217;s already fixed and ready to go in with the next patch. We&#8217;re looking into the snare thing. It was not intended that direct damage break snare (though it is intentional on the PvP servers).<br> <br>Sorry about the mistakes.</ul>

<B>Newest hub site to offer a wealth of information and features in the action genre</B><br><br>While the game industry has expanded into some new directions, it has also been known to generate titles for genres that have proven fairly popular over the years. As our longstanding <A HREF="http://rpgvault.ign.com/">RPG Vault</A> and Vault Network can attest, computer role-playing games have certainly enjoyed a generally high degree of interest by fans and gamers. Another genre long rooted in this industry is action, one held dear by countless players and developers. With a past rich in classic titles that have produced so many memorable experiences, we're certainly looking forward to the multitude of upcoming action games in the works. As such, the future holds promise of tremendous excitement, and we're naturally thrilled about this.<br><br>In this spirit, the IGN Vault Network is pleased to announce the launch of its newest hub site, <A HREF="http://actionvault.ign.com/">Action Vault</A>. Here you can expect to find the latest news, information and features on a broad range of forthcoming and recently released titles. These include not only ones falling strictly or closely under pure action such as first person shooter and action/adventure, but those generally considered as either hybrids, massively multiplayer, simulators as well as others that defy rigid classification. Over the course of the coming months, we'll endeavor to make Action Vault your number one source for reviews and previews of both hot and intriguing titles, interviews with game developers and well-known industry figures, editorials addressing a range of thought-provoking topics, developer diaries and much more.<br><br>Today, we'd like to celebrate our launch with an informative <A HREF="http://actionvault.ign.com/features/interviews/3rdworld.shtml">3rd World Interview</A>, in which project leader Vitomir Jevremovic discusses XYZ Team&#8217;s futuristic online space game where players try to build their reputation and fortune. Accompanying the interview are some great new screenshots that haven't been seen elsewhere. We&#8217;ve also made available several new boards, covering titles such as <A HREF="http://mcszone.com/games00.htm" target="_new">Fighting Legends</A>, <A HREF="http://www.digitalextremes.com" target="_new">Dark Sector</A>, <A HREF="http://sierrastudios.com/games/tribes2/" target="_new">Tribes 2</A>, <A HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/planetside/" target="_new">PlanetSide</A>, <A HREF="http://jumpgate.netdevil.com" target="_new">Jumpgate</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com" target="_new">Quake</A> and <A HREF="http://www.unreal.com/" target="_new">Unreal</A> franchise, plus various categories under the <A HREF="http://vnboards.ign.com/default.asp?cat=5070">Action Vault Boards</A>. Previously existing boards for Halo, StarLancer, FreeLancer, Allegiance and 3rd World are available for your perusal as well. Access to all boards pertaining to action can be seen at Action Vault&#8217;s Forum Index.<br><br>Have fun visiting the boards and reading the interview, and also remember to cast your vote in today&#8217;s poll. Be sure to check back regularly for frequent news, goodies and upcoming features at Action Vault

Today's Patch Message is now up:<UL>January 9th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>We're happy to present today's patch, which focuses primarily on addressing issues that have been brought forth by EverQuest players.  We appreciate the opportunity to spend some time focusing on specific issues important to you.  Today's patch includes the following:<br><br>*Disciplines*<br><br>- The "Resistant" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 1.<br>- The "Holy Forge" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 2.<br>- The "Weaponshield" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.<br>- The "Leechcurse" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.<br>- The "Deftdance" Discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.<br>- The "Puretone" Discipline now lasts 4 minutes instead of the previous 2.<br>- The "Sanctification" discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.<br>- The "Unholy Aura" Discipline now gives a 50% bonus to Harmtouch (compared with the previous 25%) and causes it to save versus disease, which should result in even fewer resists in most high-level encounters.<br><br>*Spells*<br><br>- "Lay on Hands" has been improved starting at 40th level.<br>- The "Summon Corpse" spell is now available to Shadowknights.<br>- Corrected a bug that was causing damage while using the "Trueshot" Discipline to be the same regardless of the quality of your bow.<br>- The spells "Focus of Spirit" and "Visions of Grandeur" now stack.<br>- "Harmtouch" is now resisted as if it were a "Lifetap" spell, meaning that it is all-or-nothing, and nearly unresistable with exception to encounters that are immune to magic or out of the acceptable level range.  In addition, maximum damage for Harmtouch has been increased starting at 40th level.<br>- We fixed a bug that caused "Lure" type spells (Wizards) to be resisted more than they should have been in certain types of encounters.<br>- Melee attack timers will no longer be reset when a SK, Paladin, or Ranger cast a spell.  Previously these classes had to wait a full attack delay after casting before they would attack via melee again. <br><br>*Miscellaneous*<br><br>- You may now adjust the clipping plane in the Hole.  Previously, the clipping plane was fixed.  Many people requested the ability to bring the clipping plane closer to allow them to improve their client's performance.<br>- Fixed several problems with trade-skill components that were not dropping.  Also added some new recipes.<br>- Fixed the Iksar "Shackle of Steel" quest.  <br>- The additional options for /camp (/camp server, /camp desktop) have been implemented.  /camp server will take you to the server-selection screen.  /camp desktop will cause EverQuest to terminate and take you to the desktop.<br><br>*Root and Snare*<br><br>Root-type spells and "snare" type spells now use a separate spell effect.  <br><br>Previously, "Root" spells would overwrite any snare effect upon the target.  When the root would wear off, the target began moving at full speed.  With this change, when root wears off, snare will still be in effect.  This has a few added effects on the other end.  <br><br>For instance, root will no longer cancel SoW or Journeyman's Boots effects.  It also allowed us to correct a long-standing bug that was allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's Accelerando if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was rooted.  As mentioned in a previous patch where the first part of this bug was fixed, this was not the intended effect.<br><br>*Looting NODROP Items*<br><br>A new command is now available to EverQuest players.  <br><br>In order to prevent the accidental looting of NODROP items, the /lootnodrop command has been added to the client.  The command supports three options:  ALWAYS (Default) - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP item.  SOMETIMES - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP items that your race and/or class cannot use.  NEVER - NODROP items will be looted without confirmation. <br><br>It is highly recommended that you DO NOT CHANGE this from the default option, as the GM staff cannot assist in cases of accidental looting.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</ul>

If you&#8217;re role-playing a dark-elf necromancer and happen to run into a halfling cleric, logic dictates that there would be some tension there. While you may not want to haul off a blast the guy, a few well-worded threats, insults and general nastiness are completely within the bounds of the world Verant created. I&#8217;m not saying you should make life miserable for the little guy (you shouldn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s when petitions get noticed), but some in-character name-calling is, like I said, dictated by logic (unless you&#8217;re one of those rare halfling-loving DE&#8217;s&#8230;*rolls eyes*). However&#8230;it occurs to me some might go a bit far with that line of thinking&#8230;let me clarify things by providing some dialogue to my DE meets halfling scenario.</UL>Enjoy!

And I&#8217;ve stated the way I understand it, Lifetaps are resisted as magic, not on some special resist. And there is no Lifetap flag. But I&#8217;ll double check that for you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045870.html"><b>Details on Tomorrow's Patch</b></a><br>We&#8217;ve got a lot of changes planned for the next patch. Changes for hybrids, a change to the way that movement spells work (specifically Root), and a bug fix for Lure spells (among many other things). First and foremost I want to explain the fix to Lures. <br><br>Right now (before the patch), creatures that should not get a save versus Lure spells are getting saves based on their levels. This has been broken for a while. We fixed it on test before Christmas, but this is the first patch since then, and the fix should go live with the patch. Basically, Lures will become less resisted after the patch. <br><br>The changes to hybrid disciplines and powers are as follows. Hopefully these will be the last. <br><br>1) Resistant Discipline will last five minutes instead of one minute.<br>2) Holyforge Discipline will lasts five minutes instead of two minutes.<br>3) Sanctification Discipline will last fifteen seconds instead of ten seconds<br>4) Lay on Hands will have increased healing for each level after forty of the paladin. After forty it will do approximately twenty points per level more (for levels 41-60).<br>5) Normal Harm Touches will save as all or nothing. There will be no partial resists.<br>6) Harm Touch will increase ten points per level for levels one through forty. From levels forty-one to sixty it will increase thirty points per level instead of twenty<br>7) The Harm Touch discipline will increase Harm Touch damage by fifty percent instead of twenty-five percent<br>8) Weaponshield discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br>9) Leechcurse discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br>10) Deftdance will have its duration increased from ten to fifteen seconds<br>11) Puretone will have duration increased from two to four minutes<br>12) Hybrids will no longer reset weapon timers after casting a spell (further explanation below)<br>13) Trueshot discipline damage calculations will be changed (further explanation below) <br><br>We will also be giving Hybrids a new spell at level fifty. <br><br>Now for the further explanation: <br><br>Trueshot damage was messed up. Basically it was giving low damage bows too much damage and high damage bows too little damage. We are making the damage more in line with the base damage of the bow. This will reduce the damage of the discipline for some and increase it for others, depending on the type of bow you were using. <br><br>As for the timer/casting thing&#8230; As it is now, casting a spell while using a weapon will cause your weapon swings to be delayed by the casting time of the spell. So, making up numbers here, lets assume you would swing your weapon every ten seconds. If you were to cast a five second casting time spell directly after a weapon swing, then your next swing would occur fifteen seconds after the last one (adding the five seconds for the spell). For hybrids, this will no longer happen. So if your weapon takes ten seconds to swing, spell casting will no longer increase that swing time. <br><br>Movement Rate Changes: <br><br>We have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works. Essentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means that Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That's the primary change. But there is also a side effect to this change. <br><br>Bard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that enhance movement. <br><br>We are aware that this will be seen as a 'nerf'. However, I'm pretty sure that most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break root, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045780.html"><b>Shaman Talk</b></a><br>How about a 'hang in there'? <br><br>Changes are not made over night. We're looking at a lot of issues. Your concerns have not been ignored.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044943.html"><b>Hate List Suggestion</b></a><br>I'm here. I'll ask about this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043278.html"><b>Defoliation - Necro Spell & Plane of Growth </b></a><br>Well, in the case of discussing what are and are not plants, there are two things to consider. The first is, could it be seen as a plant by some use of the word plant (as the discussion about fungi does), and also whether or not it&#8217;s a good idea for the game to consider such things plants. <br><br>Obviously if a treant is a plant on Norrath, it&#8217;s probably still a plant on the Plain of Growth. But we also have to consider the gameplay repercussions of allowing them to be considered plants on that plane. It&#8217;s easy enough to justify not having Defoliation work on them from a roleplaying standpoint (they are at the heart of Tunare, and are therefore more than mere plants). The question there is, would allowing that spell to work on them be too much from a gameplay standpoint? I don&#8217;t know the answer to that. I&#8217;ll ask. <br><br>As for fungus&#8230; I hear that some fungus are affected by defoliation and some are not. We&#8217;ll probably look into that.</ul>

Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291.html">summed up where things are</a> at regarding the intense Necro discussuions taking place on the Gameplay Board:<ul><i>The old threads were getting a bit nasty and were wandering. Let's not have that happen here.<br><br>Let me sum up my thoughts on this whole thing.<br><br>Necromancers are just fine, in all aspects of the game, with one possible exception.<br><br>On raids they can find a lot to do up to and after the encounter with the boss mob. But in that encounter some necromancers don't feel that they have enough to do, or feel that what they can do isn't what they want to be doing.<br><br>In this thread I would like to keep to one narrow focus. What things could be done to give necromancers more to do in that one encounter, without improving their power in other situations?<br><br>It's a very narrow question, and a very hard one to answer. Here are the ideas that I've seen that won't work, or won't happen:<br><br>DoT stacking: We're probably not going to allow more DoTs to stack than already do. And this would have an impact far beyond the scope here, it would increase the power of necromancers across the board.<br><br>Unresistable Lifetap: Probably never going to happen. I understand the whole concept of Lifetap to power mana transfer. I'm just telling you with a pretty firm tone, that it's really not likely to happen.<br><br>Mana Transfer: The rate will probably not be improved. As I've said before, currently necromancers can convert 1 hit point into 1 mana. Right now they can give that 1 mana to a cleric (as an example) for the cost of about 2.5 mana. The cleric can convert that mana into about 2 hit points. That's the right ratio, really. There shouldn't be a time when the amount that can be returned is higher than the amount that is given out.<br><br>Poofing: with the next patch, this should be pretty much fixed&#8230; let me copy one of my other posts:<br><br>"Ok, this whole thing was Alan getting confused.<br><br>There was special code put in several months ago that prevented nearly any possibility of a corpse poofing if the NPC is over 54th level. I was right there.<br><br>But recently, a few weeks ago, we added some code to deal with a unique NPC situation (that I'm not going to go into&#8230;) that might have been causing corpses to poof is the kill was assigned to a Link Dead PC over 54th level. This will be changed with the next patch.<br><br>I was confused and thought that this change was already in.<br><br>I'm sorry about the confusion.<br><br>Alan"<br><br>In any case, let's leave this one off the list until we see how things go post-patch. I have noticed, though, that the only complaint I've seen was about Ragefire&#8230; I wouldn't be worried about poofing due to DoTs anymore. At least try it out.<br><br><br>Issues that we can discuss:<br><br>Ignite Bones: I'm willing to suggest some change to remove the skeleton. I think to do that we need to have something that does the same sort of thing, but I don't know what that is. This spell will probably never be changed into a standard direct damage spell. I like some of the ideas (like changing the tinting on the target), but unfortunately most of them don't seem possible technically. I'll keep thinking up ideas. Post any you have here.<br><br>Group Feign Death: I haven't mentioned this idea to the team yet. I suppose that there might be a lot of reasons not to implement this idea&#8230;<br><br>Making pets immune to fear: This probably won't happen. Then we'd have to do the same for magicians (not an inherently bad thing, but it has broad repercussions), and there's PvP to consider. But I think I have some interesting ideas along these lines that might work out. I want to here other ideas along these lines.<br><br>Possessing the pet: that's a cute as heck idea (maybe 'cute' is the wrong word&#8230;). Another one that I'll mention to the team. But keep in mind that I'm not really looking for totally new stuff. I'm not advocating that we start making up new spells and whole new concepts. It would be hard to justify spending a ton of time making new concepts at this point. But it's certainly interesting&#8230;<br><br>Essence Emerald: I'm kind of in favor of using this device as a way of changing things. It's a very expensive casting cost&#8230; For example I kind of liked the idea of allowing the mana transfer spell to be usable on others, considering the cost.<br><br>Unrelated Issues (meaning that I'm mentioning them here so that you don't have to bring them up&#8230;) :<br><br>I'm aware that Track Corpse doesn't work. I'm going to ask about that.<br><br>The epic weapon. It's not really related to this anyhow, and I am already very aware how you all feel about it.<br><br>Defoliate: If someone wants to start a new thread about which things they think should be affected by this spell, go for it. But it's not part of the focus of this thread.<br><br>I may have missed some&#8230;<br><br>Keep in mind that I understand that many of you are not happy with a support role on raids. I'm fairly convinced that it is perfectly fine for a necromancer to act in that role during the final battle of the raid. But I'm open to ideas (barring the ones that I've already vetoed) that would make them more aggressive at that one final battle.<br><br>Alan</i></Ul>

Alan was answering posts on the Gameplay Board as usual.

Even at 2:1 it would be too much (plug it into my calculation). <br><br>Xdammedx wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "As for the lich thing, it totally sucks that the rest of us have to suffer because of a BUG on 3 total servers out of over 30."]</i></font><br><br>Actually, you're not 'suffering' from this bug. You're gaining from it. It reduces the damage that the spell does to the caster. You're getting a 1:1 ratio of hit points for mana, instead of a 3:2 ratio as was intended. <br><br>Scriabin said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Frankly, "interesting" is about the last thing from our uber, Vox-soloing minds.

You claimed we get a hp to mana ratio of 1 : 1. Were you mistaken on this or are you sure? Demi lich is 48 hp for 30 mana supposedly, 48 hp for 48 mana seems like a lot. Or were you referring to 48 hp * 33% = 16 48 hp - 16 hp (for pvp coding) = 32 hp. According to this demi lich gives 32 mana for 32 hp and lich gives 26 mana for 26 hp /shrug just food for thought."]</i></font> <br><br>Yup, I'm sure. The damage taken by the player is reduced in code by 33% because the code sees it as a player damaging a player.

Brad posted a follow-up to the thread he started <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924.html">yesterday on the Gameplay Board</a>:<ul><i>Hi all,<br><br>Again, thanks very much for all of the responses, feedback, and ideas. I've read through them twice now and it's given us a lot to think about. Perhaps there are some issues that could be addressed in the short term, but I also think there are some lessons to be learned whose solutions probably won't be realized until the second generation of massively multiplayer games.<br><br>The following are excerpts from various posts to this thread and my responses. I tried to vary the topics and issues as much as I could and get a decent sample of the many threads. That said, I'm not saying these are the best (or worst) responses, and I'll apologize in advance if yours isn't one I responded to.<br><br>-----------<br><br>Goji: "Downtime should be easily reduced the higher level you get. This scale is met in the mid levels quite well..." <br><br>Well, the death penalty continues to go up, but then we introduce the resurrection family of spells, which we assume will be used the majority of the time. Also, mana regeneration and other spells are introduced to compensate for the increased mana costs and total mana a character may have.<br><br>Uberwolf_Unity : "Exactly&#8230; you should be rewarded for reaching higher levels ... everything should not simply get more difficult and more time-consuming.<br><br>However downtime that is required to GET into that group is unacceptable and should be shortened if at all possible. For example, lets imagine I want to hunt in Kael in Velious. I'm a warrior, so I'll have to do some walking. Lets imagine I start at Karnor. First I walk to the druid ring (5 minutes) and wait around for a ride (variable, average 10 minutes). Since the Wakening lands ring is unsafe to a majority of druids I get a ride to Iceclad. I run to Kael (15 minutes) and then wait around looking for a group. An opening eventually happens in a group (VERY variable number here, lets assume 15 minutes) and I then begin to fight.<br><br>With the above scenario we're looking at close to 45 minutes to an hour just to get started playing the game. If a death results after working this hard just to get to point A, getting back to that point could take as long or longer. This means the majority of my evening could be consumed by downtime.<br><br>Karnor, Lower Guk, Temple of Cazic Thule&#8230; all have one thing in common. Downtime is reasonably small for these dungeons. There are bindable places close, there are druid and wizard teleports very close, there are safe 'zone lines' that one can exit from, and there is a LOT of room for groups to adventure in."<br><br>I think you've got some great points there, and there definitely is a difference between adventuring in some of the newer zones relative to the older. In an attempt to make larger zones to reduce over crowding we've also created a situation where it obviously takes longer to travel. One of our many plans in the future to improve EQ is to attempt to get zone size 'just right' - not too big, not too small. And, of course, this also relates to where the teleport points are.<br><br>Lisset: "The boat trip from BB to Kunark is no worse than the trip between BB and Freeport. I've timed it. It's approximately a 20 minute trip in both cases. However, if the boat just left (and you usually have no way of knowing if it did) it's now a 35 minute trip.<br><br>So let's say you want to travel from Firiona Vie to Freeport and can't get a port (believe it or not, it's possible). You've got a potential travel time of over an hour. And that's just from city to city. That is not traveling to your final destination. All of this is assuming that you don't get disconnected and have to start all over again."<br><br>We've really tried to get the boats running smoothly and as fast as is reasonable, but they ARE there as a means by which we make the world larger. We feel it should be time consuming to travel from one continent to another. If it was a similar trip from one zone in one continent to another as it was from one zone to another across the ocean&#8230; well, I really think that would diminish the immersive nature of a virtual world. <br><br>Airtreader: "Please, Brad, name 3 things that VI has done to mitigate unwarranted downtime. Maybe 2 things would be easier. One thing? Oh, yeah post 35 while in downtime you don't have to look at the book any more."<br><br>Since launch, we've:<br><br>1. Halved the experience lost due to death.<br>2. Increased boat speeds<br>3. Increased range for evac and teleport spells<br>4. Added a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock<br>5. Increased treasure and experience gain rewards for many older quests<br>6. Implemented Specialization<br>7. Enhanced High Level (35+) Meditation<br>8. Reduced many spells' mana costs<br>9. Added Summon Corpse<br>10. Added Call of the Hero<br>11. Given more classes resurrection family spells<br>12. Added more resurrection family spells<br>13. Improved Tracking<br><br>I'm sure there are many others.<br><br>Post_Toasties: "Is this how one becomes a gaming god? Farm for ideas?"<br><br>You bet. Listening to feedback, learning from others, and 'farming' ideas are definitely ways to become better at just about everything in life.<br><br>Terrak_Steeltalon: "Well, I don't think that the exp penalty concept in and of itself is too bad, but it's how it is executed. Death at the high levels doesn't cost you a few hours if you don't get a res, it can cost you days or weeks worth of exp. That's really just not fun and I think that needs to be softened. Also, like others, I think it's a real downer to lose a level due to death."<br><br>I think I agree with the losing level part, and I'm going to debate it a bit with the designers (although even if we all agree, I'm not sure such a change to EQ would be practical). As for your other point, as mentioned, we do expect the majority of high level deaths to be mitigated by resurrection family spells.<br><br>Lisset: "It's my belief that downtime should not force you to do nothing. You should be able to do something useful, even if it's not as useful as what you would like to be doing.<br><br>Take waiting on for the boat. At least while you're doing that you can usually fish. However, the fishing skill pretty much sucks. If the fishing skill actually did something more useful we would see a benefit from having a good fishing skill and wouldn't mind the waiting so much.<br><br>The key here is that while there would be a benefit to fishing in that scenario, the benefit is far less than if that time had been spent hunting. Therefore you have downtime, but it's not useless."<br><br>I definitely agree with you, but honestly, it's easier said than done. I think going forward this is a very real goal: provide other activities when downtime is incurred - the player should never be doing 'nothing' (btw, though, I don't consider socializing 'nothing').<br><br>Grave_Robber: "Death of a tank could also = death for the entire group as well. Multiple penalties for all in the group. Death = a long wait for the guy to get back."<br><br>That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes.<br><br>Meleagar: "I think that the whole concept of "corpse recovery" is just a flat-out bad idea, and it involves far too much work to recover from a death. It prevents people from even WANTING to explore highly dangerous areas, simply because they could lose everything they've earned up to that point, equipment-wise. The experience penalty is bad enough ... why tack on a huge corpse-retrieval penalty?"<br><br>Because 'corpse recovery' allows us to add a variable to the death penalty. It's based on the premise that death in the depths of a dungeon should incur a greater penalty than death on top of a hill outside of a city. The depths of a dungeon should be a scarier, more risky place (and therefore, have better treasure) than, say, the top of a hill outside a city, and therefore dying there should be nastier. So while experience lost is the same regardless of where you die, the time involved in recovering your corpse is not, and neither is the risk you'll not get back your equipment.<br><br>Lerahs: "I understand totally. But why does time lost (due to one death) cost a heck of a lot more than [the experience gained] winning that particular fight. I understand there has to be a penalty, but your system really seems to be designed to hold the player back."<br><br>Because we expect the majority of time the ratio of NPCs killed to you dying to an NPC to be significantly in your favor. In other words, many more NPCs die than players in most adventures, and so a single death needs to cost the experience gained by killing many NPCs.<br><br>Chief_Wahoo: "'The fundamental advancement mechanism in MMORPGs is Time Invested.' Why? Why is this the only advancement mechanism that anyone has come up with? This in and of itself is the paradigm that you have entered and now you can't think outside of the box. Change your views of what you consider the main advancement method and you can change your views of the rest of the issues."<br><br>I don't know for sure why this is the only mechanism people have come up with, but it seems to be (at least for MMOGs). I sure don't like to 'think in a box', which is one of the very reasons I created this thread (to get feedback and hopefully new ideas for the future). But the other advancement mechanisms used so far in games (pure luck, actual real life skill and dexterity ('twitch'), puzzles, etc.) don't seem to be what RPG players want and/or simply don't work in an online persistent environment. I'm all ears if you can think of a better one that would really work - heck, if you can, please email me and we'll definitely talk :)<br><br>Alcarian: "Again, I reiterate: I don't play EQ to 'learn good tactics'. Why would I do this? Where would I ever use these 'tactics' except in this game for powergaming? Will you now tell me that learning 'good tactics' and how to form the most 'efficient group' is somehow a public service provided by VI--for RL situations?<br><br>I play a game such as this to have FUN. I am willing to pay for it--up to the point I find the first game out that deals with my complaints. There isn't one, YET. But there will be. And, until VI gets it together and starts addressing my 'fun issues', then the doom of ultimate cancellation looms on the horizon (no pun).<br><br>By telling me that downtime penalties are in place to force me to 'learn tactics' and 'form efficient groups', you are, in effect, telling me: be a powergamer or suffer."<br><br>With all due respect, I totally disagree. Discovering effective tactics, playing smart, and being efficient don't make someone a 'powergamer'. That's like saying a casual gamer is somehow unable to use good tactics and operate efficiently in a group - I don't buy it.<br><br>RunDMZ: "I CHALLENGE the designers to create a level one character (a melee or hybrid preferably) and play him WITHOUT twinking and WITHOUT grouping with the other designers (meaning pick-up groups only).... find yourself soloing quite a bit? or at least wishing you could? Find yourself begging for Binds, SoW's, etc? Could you find that cleric you needed? You having fun running across 12 zones to get your body? Still waiting for that boat?"<br><br>Oh come on, many, many designers have played multiple race/class combinations to high levels, without twinking, and by making friends with players who don't work here. And yes, we ask players for binds and SoWs, and yes we often find clerics for our groups, and yes we wait for boats at times (although I prefer to make friends with people who can teleport me). Hrm, and no, I doubt we run 12 zones to get our bodies unless we have a brain fart and forget to bind where we should :)<br><br>Belrath: "Verant - you still have never directly asked me for my opinion on anything other than whether or not I want to renew my subscription. How do you know if I am happy? Do you view every active player as happy because they subscribe? You should poll your players A LOT and get demographics on who thinks what. All these blanket statements about how happy everyone is nonsense."<br><br>I don't think subscription numbers and churn rates are at all 'nonsense' indicators, rather I think they are ultimately the best way to gauge the success of a product. But I do agree there are other ways to gather information and to learn how to make a better product, including polls. I DO think we should poll more often. Perhaps Absor could start a thread on what you all think we should ask our customer base via polls. <br><br>Thessaly: "I hope you're reading this far down the thread, because I think this is the only post I've ever tried to address directly to you or anyone else "in charge", in 18 months of following this board. And I'm doing so because you actually seem interested in the responses. Please, please listen to me, as an average but longtime player who has no personal vendetta on any particular issue."<br><br>I definitely read down this far and beyond :)<br><br>I can also say with certainty that both I and all the other SOE/VI employees that post here and read these boards are interested in the responses and the feedback in general. We are listening, and we greatly appreciate the time many of you take to post.<br><br>Yzona: "Conclusion: You need to encourage risk taking instead of actively discouraging it, and one way to do this is to reduce the penalty for it, which in most cases can be summed up as downtime."<br><br>Wow, one of best counter arguments posted, giving me much to think about - thanks. As for your conclusion, though, it seems to be contradictory. 'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself.<br><br><br>Skruff: "AC has very different death penalties, loss of vitae affecting stats and skills while you make up some additional exp, and the loss on your corpse of only some of your (best) items and all your money unless you recover them in time (much shorter time limits). So no major exp loss, no losing all your items, and yet the desire to stay alive is just as great and the fear of dying no less than in EQ. What this proves to me is that you don't need a massive death penalty to create a sense of atmosphere or a "risk versus reward" motivation."<br><br>Regardless of how effective or not that system is for our distinguished competition, I really don't feel it would work for EQ. First, EverQuest is more group oriented, and coming back after death with significant stat penalties would make you unattractive for a time (even after you'd looted your corpse). Also, EverQuest is a VERY item-centric game, and significantly increasing the chance of item-loss would turn out to be a much harsher penalty than what currently exists.<br><br>Aldarion_Shard: "Guilds are 99.99999 percent of the time a downtime INCREASING factor. They want you to help power level. They want you to help them go on a raid for stuff you don't need and won't be offered a roll on. They want your ports, sow's, rez's, etc. the best way to eliminate downtime is play solo and don't talk to anyone."<br><br>I think that definitely depends on the guild. Guilds for me have had the opposite effect and have definitely helped me decrease downtime. They've provided people to group with me, they've helped me recover corpses, they've teleported me, they've resurrected me, they've given me advise on where to hunt, etc. <br><br>Petoffen: "Verant has done a pretty great if imperfect job.<br><br>Heck even the players have been partly to blame - for example, Verant has given us great AE tactics for wizards, yet they are little-used.<br><br>If anything, I'd tell Verant, keep the game with lots of challenge for the single group. I prefer not having to get huge raids together much, even if that does have its place at times. And do something to keep the uberguild stuff under control. I'm on the server they say is best for this, and I'd hate to imagine the servers where guild fight over who gets to raid what more."<br><br>I think you've got a good point there. The majority of content in EQ should definitely be targeted at a solid group (4-6 players). Then should come the really difficult stuff, requiring multiple groups, as well as content for people who prefer soloing. Recently, as we've focused quite a bit on higher levels and very difficult challenges, we've also added a lot of multiple group content. And while this in and of itself is definitely not a bad thing, in the future we'll make sure more single group challenges are added, as well as content for all level ranges, more playing styles, etc.<br><br>Lerahs: "I say again THANK YOU Brad for coming in and starting this discussion. Communication means a lot to tons of us. A post like this once a week will do a lot for EQ."<br><br>Thanks Lerahs, but unfortunately I simply don't have the time to post here often. I read the boards a lot, but I'm really the type that prefers detailed design discussions which, of course, require a lot of time to read through and respond to. Hopefully Absor can conduct similar threads regularly (I know Abashi used to), and I'll try to drop by occasionally as well.<br><br>'Till next time,<br><br>-Brad</i></UL>
