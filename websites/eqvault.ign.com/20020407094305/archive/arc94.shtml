Gordon has made a few more posts since the last infobit post.

Is it on the infamous "list of stuff that would be cool but we will probably never have time to implement?"]</i> <br><br>The way item storage works in EQ doesn't allow comments to be attached to any particular item without them being attached to all items of that type. So though I would be hesitant to say that we'd never do something along these lines, its not something that we have planned in the foreseeable future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052950.html"><b>Getting Rid of "That" Screen</b></a><br>I assume you mean the UI overlays.

In fact, I specifically said that we'd increase the drops, but we don't want them to become so common that they're destroyed for taking up backpack space.</UL>

As usual, Gordon was once again on the Gameplay Board answering people's questions and responding to comments.  Here's the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052852.html"><b>Rare Spawn Complaints</b></a><br>Most of the complaints I see in regards to these rare spawns for quest components is related to the general feeling that there is an "entitlement" to these items. There isn't. No one is entitled to any particular item. <br><br>You can't fix a situation where everyone is camping by making what they are camping for more plentiful. That just encourages camping, as the camp duration gets shorter, and more people feeel that the camp time is worth the effort. As it is now, maybe people will get the idea that the camp is too long, and just choose not to camp. Then perhaps someone happening by can get lucky and find the spawn in question. If people are still choosing to camp it, perhaps we need to look into making it even rarer, closing the quest, or look into creating other items that represent reasonable alternatives to the item that people are choosing to camp.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052874.html"><b>EverQuest & FPS Games</b></a><br>I completely agree that Doom and other First-person shooter type games are very fun, despite the lack of a penalty for death. However, those games are not about building and molding a character to your desires. The worlds aren't persistent. There's is nothing that can be achieved by playing for a year that can't be achieved in the first few minutes of each life. <br><br>The games are completely different and cannot be measured against each other. The concept of "Challenge" is implemented in different ways. EverQuest implements challenge by providing risks. In order to provide risks, there must be some downside that will be realised should a task not be completed. That downside can't be enjoyable, or it wouldn't be a risk. <br><br>I do wish that I could explain this to everyone's satisfaction. If anyone can offer any suggestions to this end, I'd certainly appreciate it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052875.html"><b>Gaining Experience</b></a><br>Experience given by a creature is based upon its level, and the zone you are in. It is not based upon its level in relation to you, other than at the point that you stop receiving experience from killing a particular level creature. <br><br>In other words, if you are level 50, a level 49 creature will give more experience than a level 48 creature, even though they are both blue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052873.html"><b>Online Store Status</b></a><br>The status is that the online store in it's former incarnation will probably not be up in the foreseeable future. We are however working on a web-based store that we expect to open in a few weeks.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052845.html"><b>Spell Drops</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I have yet to see a difference in the spell drop rate. Hours of hunting skyfire, chardok, etc. still yield nothing]</i> <br><br>Most people who cite problems with spell drops cite hours of hunting in Skyfire and Chardok. Consider for a moment that though spells drop there, those might not be the best places to find spells.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052735.html"><b>The Bammbo Bo Stick</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: We were told by you Abashi that the Bammbo Bo stick was a mistake and was being lowered in weight.]</i> <br><br>Actually I never said that. I said that some of the monk-only weapons in Kunark were too heavy, and I never meantioned what specific weapons. Anyway, the live team went through the weapons and lowered the weight on some of them. Some of them are remaining rather heavy, and are that way on purpose. <br><br>I'll ask the live team to look it over again, but I wouldn't expect a ton of dramatic changes. The fact that a particular character has the ability to use a particular weapon doesn't necessarily mean that they *should* use it, nor that it's the *best* thing that they could be using. <br><br>Wait until you see some of the cursed items that will begin turning up soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052614.html"><b>Account Hacking</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon this must be fixed(account hackers) Now this is an ongoing problem and need to be addressed instantly!]</i> <br><br>I would love to be able to find out how this stuff happens. In most cases, we can usually track it back to passwords being given by the account owners to guild members or real-life "friends". In most other cases, it turns out to be some auction or account sales related fraud. <br><br>Players have to be responsible for their own account information and never provide it to anyone. They also need to refrain from buying characters online as the original owner can get the account back at nearly any time. We'll of course ban the account in the case of the latter, but we don't at all get involved with any lost funds. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Set up direct link command just like bug or feedback and have it go directly to all gms guides and customer support peeps online so that the peeps hacking are caught in the act!]</i> <br><br>Very few people could get caught hacking in the act as most people don't have multiple accounts to log in and see it for themselves. That said, some type of more direct system-wide petition would probably end up being used for things other than hacking. <br><br>All of that said, I would like to hear from folks who've had their accounts hacked, and honestly never gave the password to anyone and never bought or sold the account. I do have some questions that I'd like to ask. Please email me at gwrinn@verant.com. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052726-2.html"><b>Why can't Paladins use piercing weapons?</b></a><br>It sounds like it might be possible that some of our apprentice game designers might have been unaware that paladins couldn't use piercers. We probably won't give them that ability, but we should address the fact that they cannot use these weapons. <br><br>We're doing a weapons search to see what weapons out there are actually usable by Paladins so that we can correct any discrepancies.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052729.html"><b>I can attack 72 times in one second, what do you think of that?</b></a><br>The test department took a look at this just to see what would happen. We were concerned about the possibility of a potential loop. <br><br>No one takes any damage when this happens, but it doesn't loop.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/049304.html"><b>Robe of Living Fungus - Nerf or Bug?</b></a><br>I've asked around here, spoken to everyone with the ability to make or modify items, and can't find any indication that the robe ever had that effect. The closest thing I can guess is that we might have had a bad item export at some time that went live. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052301-3.html"><b>Rogues Picking off Spells</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Rogues pickpocketing spells off of Kunark mobs Please fix this so it's not possible to pickpocket spells]</i> <br><br>As infrequently as pickpocket will get an item, and as infrequently as the creatures drop spells, and considering that there's no way to tell when killing it that it has a spell, I really don't see a need to eliminate this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052104.html"><b>Spell Droppings</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please try that again where you find a place you know spells SHOULD be dropping and kill 250mobs to see how many scrolls you got just like you did before..... Please! I beg you....]</i> <br><br>I did last night, and saw a good number more drops. I probably got some good rolls, but still received several more spells even after accounting for that.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052554.html"><b>Enstill Won't Override Root?</b></a><br>This is the same issue that causes lower level attack speed debuffs to overwrite the higher level ones. It's a problem with the spell stacking code and on our list.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052557.html"><b>After a 7 Month Vacation..</b></a><br>Wow, I'm really glad that I went looking on page 5 and came across this post. It's nice to see someone spend this much time on a positive post. We really appreciate the opinions. It's a nice outlook. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: What are your thoughts on no_drop? Am I missing an important reason why no_drop should still be in game for all but the most uber/critical items?]</i> <br><br>NODROP was originally created with the intent of requiring that someone be at a specific event in order to reap the benefits of it. Quest items are a good example of what NODROP was intended for. We also expanded upon this initial design as an anti-farming measure. <br><br>Of course, with all of the new lands, items, areas, creatures, etc., that Kunark brought to the table, and with the introduction of contextual random loot, the need for anti-farming measures is decreasing. Most of the items in Kunark are not NODROP unless part of some quest. <br><br>We probably won't, however, go about removing the NODROP tags from existing items.</UL>

I received the following notice from VanZant:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings All,<br><br>On Thursday, May 15th, the Crimson Dragons guild on Fennin Ro hosted their<br>1st Annual Newbie Gnome Race.  The Race was started at the entrance to the<br>city of Ak'Anon and ended at the gates of Halas.  Over twenty-five members<br>of the Crimson Dragons guild created 1st level gnome characters of any class<br>and raced this tremendous distance.  None of the racers were allowed to use<br>any type of speed increasing buffs or buffs such as invisibility and<br>levitate that help to avoid creatures.  Teleports were not allowed, nor were<br>high level escorts.  Binding in cities along the way was permitted.<br><br>After the start at Ak'Anon, the stampede of newbie gnomes rushed through<br>Faydwer and boarded the ship at the docks in Butcherblock.  After much<br>singing, merriment and the spreading of sheer terror to the Ocean of Tears<br>population, the gnomish hordes spilled out onto the Freeport Docks and began<br>their frenzied rush to Halas.

Here's the first report:<BLOCKQUOTE>The casting time for Donal's Arms of Mourning (effect: Valor) was doubled, to 12 seconds. Verant "forgot" to mention this in the patch info today.

They are now Half the old price.<br><br>For example where it used to cost 10p5g to make a sow potion it now costs 4p2g5s.

Another very positive <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquestrok.html">review of Kunark</a> was posted at Electric Games.  The final score awarded to RoK is 4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.  Here's the bottom line:<UL>The Ruins of Kunark adds about 33% more land content to Everquest, a new playable race, the ability to achieve character levels above the previous limit, and a ton of new spells, monsters, items, and quests. The graphics in the new zones are incredibly detailed and show off all new effects. The expansion is more difficult than the original game, but still worth a look by new customers. 200,000+ subscribed players (even though a minority of them complain very loudly) is an impressive number and shows how addictive this game can be. </UL>Thanks RHFactor!

As promised, here is the second part of today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052536.html"><b>Explain ATK and AC x/1000 Caps</b></a><br>Numbers over 1000 are indeed calculated. <br><br>Back in beta, for a time, AC and ATK were displayed with two numbers each, showing the different components of the factor. For instance, AC was displayed with both a damage avoidance and a damage mitigation factor. This was highly confusing to a majority of the players, so both numbers were combined for the purpose of display. <br><br>Basically, the two numbers were added, then divided by a theoretical max that one could attain at the time, yielding a percentage. It's this percentage that is displayed. <br><br>Now, when we brought new items into the game that raised the true theoretical max (as opposed to the calculated theoretical max), and espicially when we brought out Kunark, we could have raised the calculated theoretical max so that the percentage would always be below 1000, but that would have resulted in most people seeing their AC drop, making them think that we had somehow nerfed it. So we left the calculated max the same, yeilding numbers greater than 1000. <br><br>For actual combat calculations, the values you see are still reduced into their specific componenets which aren't capped with exception of lower level twinking-impact caps that we've referenced before.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052577.html"><b>Speed Advantage</b></a><br>Well with any internet-based game, a better connection never hurts. However EQ is designed to mask some of the typical problems experienced by slower connections. For instance, some games won't allow you to move unless packets are flowing. EQ does, and sync's up with the server regularly to see that you aren't doing something illegal. <br><br>The biggest difference experienced is usually the time it takes to zone. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052579.html"><b>Server Population Cap</b></a><br>As I've mentioned before, capping server population is not something that we consider to be a valid option, and certainly wouldn't help retain players. People would get upset and leave if they suddenly found themselves unable to play that character that they have months of playtime invested in. It would be an all-too-regular occurence if server population were capped. <br><br>Also, people new to the game often have friends that already play. We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot if we just told all of these new players that they couldn't play with their friends. <br><br>As for your assertions on what would be fixed: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Camping would be lessened]</i> <br><br>No, it wouldn't. People still camp on the test server which only has about 500 people on it at peak. They camp because its an easier and preferred method to get experience and loot. What there *would* be is less people waiting to join a particular camp. We're always working on this issue by trying to get people to spread out, moving loot around, randomizing drops, etc. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Class envy would be less because competition would be less.]</i> <br><br>Class-envy will exist as long as some class can do something that another class can't. It's not related to competition for most. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Finding groups would be easier]</i> <br><br>Actually we've found that smaller populations have more problems finding groups than larger ones. With more people on the server, there are more groups, and thus more groups that aren't full, leading to more groups that need people. <br><br>Servers with smaller populations (PvP servers, Test) often have people who cite problems finding groups, as well as problems getting services such as binding or resurrections during off-peak times. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Economy would not be as screwed up]</i> <br><br>The economy being "screwed up" is subjective. Trading among people happens very frequently on the servers. Signs of a screwed up economy in a game of this nature are indicated by a lack of demand, due to an excess of supply, or vice versa. Either the items are too valuable to trade, or they are too worthless to be traded. <br><br>Since people are constantly trading items, the economy isn't "screwed up". <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: People would be able to play and enjoy themselves and when the can actually play, they will tend to dwell less on the things they *cant* do, and the things they *cant* get.]</i> <br><br>That's based upon the personal psyche and choice of each player. Many "play and enjoy themselves", others obsess on items, levels, and what they can or cannot do. It's different for each individual.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052516.html"><b>Nerfing Items</b></a><br>Casting times were applied to the cloak and the guise due to the "bounce" of levitation. Since the low-Z of the bounce would be reset to the Current-Z on each cast of the cloak, or on each cast of the Guize while levitating, it allowed people to get to places in the game that weren't designed to have PC's flying about (tops of buildings, trees, some ledges, etc.) <br><br>The staff was done to the spam on the target. <br><br>Jboots, however, don't have this problem since it is self-only.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052523.html"><b>Alchemy Prices</b></a><br>Some of the price reductions should have gone in last patch, with the remainder in today. As I'm not familiar with the old prices, please let me know what you find.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052533.html"><b>Staff of Temperate Flux</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Might I suggest make the Staff UNRESISTABLE. Then I wouldn't mind the casting time at all.]</i> <br><br>That's a good suggestion. I'll bring it up a the tuning meeting on Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052569.html"><b>Gordon Posts Per Day</b></a><br>Actually I make 30-40 posts daily under most circumstances.

In other words, you won't see "IgnoredPerson begins to cast a spell", but you will see "You feel friendly", because it is an effect upon you. <br><br>At the point that you are feeling the effects of the spell, the game doesn't know who cast it. Changing the game on a broad scale to include that information for the sake of two items really wouldn't be a good use of time. <br><br>I do apologize to everyone affected by the casting times.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052431.html"><b>Caster Spellbook</b></a><br>Though I appreciate the effort to form an argument and draw a parallel between the two issues, looking at a spellbook and being able to bind anywhere aren't related. <br><br>Melee bind is an issue of balance and class-interdependence, whereas a caster looking at a spellbook is one of fun and aesthetics.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052356.html"><b>Post 50 Hybrid Spell Bug?</b></a><br>It's not a bug, but rather it is based upon the level that you get the spell in question.

Their ability to have much higher AC and Hitpoints than any other class gives them some serious advantages in the defensive department. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors have higher downtime than ANY class.]</i> <br><br>Only if they don't have healer support. If they do, which they always should, their downtime is no more than that of the healer/buffer supporting them. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Warriors are the most dependant on healing classes.]</i> <br><br>I'll buy that. Of course, I've never met a healer who didn't like warriors either. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: As a 54 Warrior I see the ONLY place that warriors are "powerful" is in groups, and while we are better than other classes in that aspect we are NO WHERE near as balanced in the solo/small group aspects that make the "balance" of Versatility playable.]</i> <br><br>This is as intended.

Feel free to edit this file as you wish, but take care to leave any unprintable characters or spaces intact. If you make a mistake editing this file and have problems, merely delete the file. A new default version will be created the next time that testeqgame.exe is launched. <br><br>If you use a standardized keyboard layout other than QWERTY, such as the French AZERTY layout, we would be interested in seeing your version of the file.

Although it is all done thru the game, it is still the same principle, is it not? Why is twinking allowed, but not using a macro to raise skills? Twinking raises AC, ATK, and often other stats.]</i> <br><br>It's a nice argument, but twinking is accounted for in the game design. We acknowleged that people would do it and put things in game to minimize any unbalancing impact from it. Not to mention, with twinking, *someone* had to put in the effort. Whether the fruits of that effort move around is up to the person who put in the effort. <br><br>Macroing doesn't compare to twinking. If an analogy was needed, I'd have to compare it to duping. In both cases, someone receives gains that were not earned by anyone. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Again: He wasn't playing HIMSELF.

Here's today's message following the patch that was implemented today:<UL>June 15th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br> <br>*Patch Day*<br> <br>Hello everyone,<br> <br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<br> <br>- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle.  <br> <br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br> <br>- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.)<br> <br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br> <br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.  <br> <br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<br> <br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br> <br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.  <br> <br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br> <br>*Chat / Login Process*<br><br>Due to the rapidly increasing number of people playing EverQuest, the Chat<br>and Login processes have been moved to more robust servers. This should<br>increase the capabilities of both servers and help alleviate the congestion<br>experienced by some during periods of high utilization.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Alexisi!

The blokes at GameSpot UK have kicked up their <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/rpg/ruins_uk/review.html">review of the EQ expansion The Ruins of Kunark</a>.  In the end the reviewer awards Kunark with a 9/10 rating.  Here's a blurb:<UL>If you're a long-term EverQuester, you won't think twice before purchasing this upgrade. The new areas offer an exciting challenge for seasoned players and advancement for those who have hit the limit in the original game. The hostility of the new environments and the vastness of the new zones might put off the more casual player, especially as the restrictive binding rules on the new continent make lengthy hikes across zones a necessary evil. </UL>Additionally a photogallery can be found by <a href="http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/rpg/ruins_uk/screenshot1.html">clicking here</a>.

I received the following report from Caleryn:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night, my guild The AnDarim on the Morell-Thule server decided to<br>sponsor an event entitled The Quest For Fire.  Our guild is a fairly new<br>guild and we are trying to encourage roleplaying and events in Norrath to<br>make EverQuest as fun as possible.. The following is the tale of The Quest<br>For Fire.  I would appreciate it if you could post this on EQVault, as we<br>are planning more events in the future and we are trying to get our name out<br>there in the world.  Thanks!<br><br> The Quest For Fire<br><br>The call around Qeynos went out... "Here Ye!  Here Ye!!  The AnDarim are<br>sponsoring a guild event entitled The Quest For Fire, all levels 1 to 5<br>interested in participating, please come to the Qeynos gates around 11pm for<br>further instructions"<br><br>So, 11pm rolled around, and their I stood next to the gate in Qeynos,<br>surrounded by about 20 or so players all excited and waiting to partake in<br>this mysterious Quest For Fire...<br><br>The following we're the rules for the contest, I paired up each of the<br>participants based on level and then sent them the instructions for the<br>quest.  They had to gather 2 fire beetle eyes, 4 bat wings, 2 ruined wolf<br>skins and 1 snake skin.  Once they had gathered all the loot they had to<br>find an AnDarim guild member hiding in the Qeynos Hills.  Once they found<br>one, they had to prove they had the goods, and then they we're each given 5<br>beer to drink.  Once the alcohol was consumed by each, they were given a<br>Torch (the fire) and had to run to the Qeynos Gate to present me with it.<br><br>The winners of the Quest for Fire were:<br><br>1st place: HuneyPie and Rackal: They took home a forged bastard sword, 4pp,<br>banded bracer and raw hide sleeves<br>2nd place: ElementalMaster and Vaill: They took home 4pp, a dex ring, medium<br>PW pants and tunic<br>3rd place: Tormathacot and Tatiania: They took home 3pp and a banded bracer.<br><br>I would like to extend my congratulations to the winners and ALL the<br>participants in the event.  Fun was had by all.<br>I would also like to thank the AnDarim members who helped in the event,<br>Torynth, Druan, Droin, Talavir, Grendyn, Laythar and Athene.  They were<br>wonderful, and after the event was over we all congregated in Qeynos all had<br>a few too many beers!  The Drunken AnDarim we were!<br><br>Thanks again everyone, and stay tuned for more AnDarim events in the near<br>future!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Lord Caleryn<br>Guildmaster of The AnDarim</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you, Caleryn!

Khana sent the following report in:<BLOCKQUOTE>I, Khana the 19th lvl warrior was on a journey from Qeynos to Highpass.  <br>Everything was going fine until I hit the wooden bridge that separates North <br>Karana from East Karana.  On this bridge was a troll.  A particularly rude <br>troll named Oothomp Boro extorting money from passers by.  He wanted 5 shiny <br>gold pieces from all that passed.  He claimed it was his bridge.  I tried to <br>give him bronze but it was no go, and the pair of wolves that he kept as <br>pets helped back him up.  I tried to find what he wanted the money for, but <br>the beast wouldn't tell me.  I snuck by him and got some friends.  With <br>help, he was conquered and his wolves fell to our blades and spells soon <br>after.  As far as loot goes, he was carrying a standard warhammer and a pair <br>of Black Iron leggings.<br><br>/ooc as my first GM event, I thought it was fun.  Problem was there was no <br>real roleplaying.  It was see monster, talk to monster, call in Level 50's <br>to nuke monster.  Ah well.  The ole' troll on bridge is stilll fun!<br><br>Khana, lvl 19 warrior</BLOCKQUOTE>Here are a list of the screenshots he enclosed:<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/tribgm1.gif">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/tribgm2.gif">Screenshot #2</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/tribgm3.gif">Screenshot #3</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/tribgm4.gif">Screenshot #4</a></UL>Thanks Khana!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
I was recently sent an email concerning one of the most (if not the most) controversial class in EverQuest, the Rogue, but more specifically about their Pick Lock ability.  To start off with I'd like to post that letter I received:<UL><I>The rogue community may soon come to a close over a issue concerning Locked <br>Doors and Verant.<br><br>Rogues have for a long time dealt with the issue that the class was never <br>fully finished and that some skills would never be used in the game  (Locate <br>and Disarm Traps).  Verant told them it was a dead issue and the skills <br>would neither be implemented, replaced, or remove from the class as it would <br>be "to difficult".  The other list of skills for the rogue class has always <br>been questionable by those who play it.  Poison has been almost a year on <br>the dev team's desk, waiting for bugs to be fixed that had been reported <br>since it's implementation.  It was added to the list of useless skills.  <br>Today the rogue community has learned that Door Exploits are now allowed.<br><br>Pick Locks has always had a shady history with Rogues.  The lack of locked <br>doors in Ever Quest, and the doors wich were locked, but unpickable in <br>dungeons like Najena had always never made sense.  They did make the skill a <br>integral part of the Burning Rapier quest though when they demonstrated they <br>had the power to put a locked door anywhere they felt necessary.  The door <br>contained within a essential part of the Quest.<br><br>The skill package of the rogue still left much to be desired though, and <br>Verant realized this.  They promoted and sold expansion to the rogue <br>community on the fact that they had a better designed world with more locked <br>doors to be use with Lock Picks.  Now that Kunark is here though, and the <br>majority of players have bought this expansion, Verant has decided to pass a <br>ruling that effected the use of this skill, and the rogue class itself.  <br>Door Exploits are allowed, and you do not require a rogue to proceed past <br>these locked doors in Kunark.  Pick Locks has now become another skill in <br>the list of abilities for rogues that serves no specific purpose.<br><br>Gordon has stated that it is more reliable to have a rogue open the door, <br>but that it is not necessary.<br><br>It is now a acceptable practice to open these doors in Kunark with specific <br>lock pick ratings (average of a 201 which requires a minimal of 20 hours in <br>befallen of constant clicking to raise the skill.  this is not a <br>exaggeration.) with methods other than a key or set of lockpicks.  The use of <br>AoE spells, pets, and manipulation of NPCS are now all approved for use if <br>you do not feel you need a rogue.<br><br>I write this as calmly as possible, but due to Verant's lack of willingness <br>to fix this issue they have in effect killed a class that they have showed <br>their unwillingness to deal with in past issues.  I retire my rogue, and <br>step away from EQ with a sad heart knowing that I can no longer be a part of <br>this when even the creators encourage cheating.  I know I do not walk away <br>alone though.<br><br>Tarkien Motiff<br>Rake of the 52nd Dagger.<br>The Nameless</I></UL>Continuing on, I have created a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5878823&replies=0">Player View Discussion thread</a> regarding the "Lock Pick" issue.  Do you think there are enough locked doors in Kunark?  Do you think the skill is as it should be?  Or is it under-powered? And maybe most important, should something be done about the mentioned ability to use AoE spells and Pets to open these doors?<br><br>Please feel free to share your feelings and post your comments on the thread.

Gordon has been busy on the Gameplay Board as usual.  Here are the latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052131.html"><b>Music Problem</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: So, I am wondering why I can't get ANY music in Everquest at all. Now, recently, we were sent all those .Xmi files I had to sit through,]</i> <br><br>They were pretty small, it shouldn't have taken too long to download them. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: and then deleted anyways for fear of having the camping issues. Either way, I have yet to get music in the game.]</i> <br><br>You'll only get music if there is an XMI file for the zone that you are in. If you've deleted all of the XMI files I doubt you'll get any music. Now if you didn't get any music even when you had XMI files, there's probably a problem with your sound card configuration. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052141.html"><b>Illusion/Faction Issue</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why does faction(good and bad) transfer to my"true self", when I have any Illusion on? Example: I use my DE illusion when I do the stein of moggok quest in Oggok. My true self is no longer KoS there now. I use my DE and Troll illusion in SK to kill treants. My "true self" is Kos to druids and all of Qeynos now. Is it a bug or are my illusions just kinda worthless now? I would really like to hear from you on this, Abashi, if at all possible. ]</i><br><br>It's not a bug and it's always worked this way. Deed-based faction (faction based on what you have done) is attached to the character, not the race that you happen to look like at the time. The only faction that illusions can affect is that of your race. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052143.html"><b>Item Specific Issues</b></a><br>Though I appreciate everyone's concerns on some of the item-specific issues that have come up lately, some of this stuff is just the way it works. <br><br>I would like to come up with a better way to say that, but sometimes that's the simplest explanation for issues such as this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052145.html"><b>FA Quest Question</b></a><br>This is the first report I've heard along these lines. The quest components are pretty rare drops. <br><br>That said, I do believe that the quest was revamped less than 4 months ago, so your data might be a bit off.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052129.html"><b>Unblockable Spam</b></a><br>I'll talk to the guys about including that in the /ignore filter. In the mean time, please /report anyone being anti-social in that fashion and /petition to let the GMs know that you sent the report. <br><br>Though we do like to retain our customers, we'd be happy to do without those who purposely try to ruin the game for others.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052127.html"><b>Bug Report List</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: L56 Mage spell Muzzle of Mardu is bugged and can't be used by any race at all.]</i> <br><br>Not a bug. Give it to your pet. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Mage spell L56 Dyzil's Deafening Decoy have a spell that was meant to be an AE tauntspell (atleast what I heard), it ain't working, it can't taunt a mob of a L53 Airpet.]</i> <br><br>This should be pretty straight forward, I'll see if test can take a look. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Mages normal focus items don't work on Pets over L51, this is a huge bug or a secret nerf.]</i> <br><br>Neither. They just aren't implemented at this time. That's not to say that we will want to implement them though, as pets are about as powerful as we want them to be. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052100.html"><b>Suggestion for Vallon Zek</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering if the CHEST piece could be made no drop on VALLON because its the most important piece for melee types and if some naked caster pkes it off ya when at 2 bubles of health the efficiency of that char goes down alot casters got nothing to lose when they die.]</i> <br><br>We really don't have any plans of making items NODROP to eliminate them as a loot possibility on the PvP servers that allow item loot.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052095.html"><b>Undead & Nightvision</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, Why do undead not get Night vision?  Is this a bug or a feature?]</i> <br><br>Like some other things on the board today, this is just how it is. When creating the illusions we decided what benefits an illusion would have. Night vision wasn't one of them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052009.html"><b>Fun Ideas for High Keep Hold</b></a><br>Though in the original design, meta-games (games within games) were later scrapped in favor of working on other and more pressing issues. We do not have any immediate plans to revisit them at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052067.html"><b>Complement</b></a><br>I think that there's more than a few out there like you, and I appreciate the fact that you posted here on the boards. <br><br>I'm glad you are enjoying the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052068.html"><b>Team Servers/Rallos Zek & Faction</b></a><br>The teamservers have faction hits for PvP. Rallos Zek, on the other hand, does not have those faction hits. That's just how the servers are set up. <br><br>Plenty of people still engage in PvP combat despite these restrictions.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052086.html"><b>New PvP Server?</b></a><br>We bring up new servers when the population on existing servers gets to the point that a new server is needed. All three of the PvP servers are currently underutilized, leaving no reason to bring up another at this time. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: Plus im sure a huge majority of people would love to start fresh and not have 1000 people higher in level.]</i> <br><br>This happens after the server has been up a few days anyway. Unless you are the one who's highest in level, there will always be people higher than you.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051942.html"><b>Inspecting Players Suggestion</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've posted about this before, and I've also suggested maybe making right-click player inspection re-mappable to a keyboard key, but maybe the simplest way to do this would be to just make player inspection during combat not possible. Accidentally right-clicking on other players, and seeing their stuff while I'm getting wailed on is annoying. I can't be the only person who has this problem. Thanks.]</i> <br><br>Sounds simple enough. I'll ask the client programmer if he can take a look at it. No promises though.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041075.html"><b>Falling off Boats</b></a><br>Thanks for the info. Until we can get it fixed, I suggest you jump over that area with the collision problem. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050423-2.html"><b>Server Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Case in point, after 5 days hunting in Hate during normal prime time hours, little was available to hunt as the non-peak crowd from over seas had largely cleared the zone during the "day" here (late aftrnoon here). This leaves many guilds in peak time at a loss for hunting for those items specific to these types of locations.]</i> <br><br>We can't start restricting use of a server during specific times of day on the basis that other people can play when you can't. It could very well be the other way around, with non-peak players citing how peak-players kill everything in these areas. <br><br>The servers are up 24/7 excluding scheduled and emergency downtime. Nothing is on a perfect 24 hour or 12 hour spawntime, so sooner or later the critters in question will pop when virtually anyone is online.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051708.html"><b>Druid Quest Armor</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: The last thread had a lot of good ideas and was completely ignored. Let's try again]</i> <br><br>This issue comes up about every two weeks as people who bring it up move on, and new people come here to the boards. I know that I've addressed it probably a few dozen times in the past 6 months. <br><br>That said, we are aware of the interest in a mid-level quest armor. We haven't ruled out the possibility of putting some in in the future, but we don't have any specific plans to do so. We recieve hundreds of requests for items, quests, and content of various types daily. We have to decide what is *needed* versus what is *wanted*. Right now there is no pressing *need* for a mid-level druid quest armor based upon the fact that there are many other items in game that druids can wear, and that provide stats and bonuses in excess to what any class-specific armor would. <br><br>Hopefully we will do it some day. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051872.html"><b>Blood Ember Armor</b></a><br>The guys have looked the issue over. The blood ember armor weight is intentional. According to the Live guys, it's due to the fact that the armor is easier to get than the other armor types in Kunark. <br><br>I've had them look at the issue twice now, so it's pretty firm at this point.</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Here's the morning edition of the Gordon Infobits for your reading pleasure:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051787.html"><b>EverQuest Issues</b></a><br>I had a few comments on some of these: <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 1) GM's will almost always take the side of the higher lvl player during a dispute. The high lvl players are usually friends with the GM group. They have been around the longest and have probably have even grouped with GMs.]</i> <br><br>False. Someone can be "high level" in a matter of calendar days. The GMs don't run around seeking out high level people to be their friends. The only people that the GMs really get to know are the ones who petition more than others. 90% of GM and Guide time is spent servicing 10% of the people on the server. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Abashi will only fight the fights that he can win. He will not respond to "real" problem issues.]</i> <br><br>I prefer to spend more time on issues where forward progress can be made rather than the ones that are entirely subjective in nature I'm really not here to win. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Twinking will not be stopped.]</i> <br><br>True. People twink. Most people don't have a problem with it. We've tried to design the game in a fashion that the effect of twinking in minimized. The main issue left is envy, which I'm not sure if we can solve. Someone will always be able to get more things faster than someone else. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 5) There is a 'experience range' around the monster when it is slain. The closer you are to it when it dies, the more exp you get.]</i> <br><br>Though there is a range to get experience, the amount of experience you get is not scaled by distance from the creature, damage that's been done to it, or how many spells have been cast during the fight (some of the more popular myths). <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 6) Almost all of Verants statements have a hidden agenda.]</i> <br><br>Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar... - Freud <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 7) Following the path is not any less dangerous, and will not get you to your destination any sooner than running a straight line.]</i> <br><br>Maybe they are just trying to see where it goes? I usually follow the path in Nektulos. I get turned around in that zone so easily. <br><br><i>[Quote from original post: 9) Kiting was nerfed, but not how you was told. Way back when, Verant decided to nerf kiting (dot and run). They told us that if the monster is moving, it will not take damage by the dot at all. Only if it is stopped, then it will be harmed. This is not true. What they did, is decrease the time the dot is present.]</i> <br><br>Huh? Kiting was addressed, but not in the way that you mention here. Duration is a constant. The variable is damage per tick. If the critter is moving and chasing (but not fleeing) at the time that the damage is applied, it will take 2/3rds the damage that it normally would. At the time this change was made, all DOTs had their duration upped slightly. <br><br>We originally considered not applying any damage in the event that the creature was moving, but scrapped that idea due to public opinion.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051782.html"><b>Kunark Loot</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: You have reduced coin-loot to lower than typical levels on most mobs in Kunark as part of your effort to prop up the value of plat?]</i> <br><br>The idea was to redefine, worldwide, the definition of good coin loot. The problem is that certain static costs in game remain just that, static. <br><br>We're going to discuss the coin drop issues, and other things related to the economy (trade skill costs, component costs, etc.) in the tuning meeting next Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051818.html"><b>Level Limits</b></a><br>We really don't intend to close off areas of the game based on people being too high in level. There are a number of reasons for this, not the least of which is that some high-level areas require passage through lower level areas. <br><br>Lower Guk, for example, requires passage through upper Guk. If you are in Qeynos Hills, EverFrost and Permafrost require passage through Blackburrow. There's also the fact that we'd have a few problems coming up with an RP reason to restrict higher level people from entrance into lower level areas. <br><br>We only put the level restriction on the Planes because we wanted the items there to be a badge of honor for the person wearing them. When the plane of fear was first opened, people were taking level 1 characters up there to loot things that people in the group could not otherwise use. <br><br>This limit also let us bend some of the previous game mechanics that were required in order to insure that twinking does not have a huge impact on the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051837.html"><b>Class vs. Skill Based Systems</b></a><br>Actually I think that most people would agree that the class-based system is one of EQ's greatest strengths, even if they don't agree with the particular way we've implemented it in regards to a class or two. <br><br>Skill-based systems, in my opinion, inevitably lead to all of the characters migrating slowly to whatever combination of skills is deemed "most powerful" at the time. The only safeguard against that would be a skill-based system that doesn't let you switch to the skill-lineup du jour, but of course, then it would really be a class-based system.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050279-2.html"><b>Are Hybrid Hogging Experience?</b></a><br>Experience allocation hasn't changed, and is how it always has been, so nothing has changed. The specifics surrounding how experience is passed out within the group isn't something that we plan on releasing. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051505.html"><b>Desktop Bug Still Around?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that every time I either log in or zone into Southern Karana, West Commons, or The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule I get booted back to the desktop?]</i> <br><br>I'd try deleting the XMI files for those zones. We created and distributed a bunch of them and it caused a few problems. We're working on them now.</UL>

EverLore has smacked up a new <a href="http://www.everlore.com/news/Interview_BT.asp">interview with Verant's Bill Trost</a>.  Bill, for those who don't know, is one of EverQuest's lead designers.  Unfortunately, this interview was originally done a few months ago during the second EQG, and as such the majority of the Q&A is very dated.  Here's a clip:<UL><b>Bryan Reynolds: Would you ever start taking checks, money orders, or other forms of payment other than just credit cards?</b><br><br>Bill Trost: That would be cool. I think we should. It&#8217;s not necessarily my area of expertise, but I think that would definitely be good. </UL>
