John Smedley also talked about the downtime suffered by the Nameless this weekend on the Gameplay board.  Here's his post:<UL><i>Brad's correct in that we've lost a server exactly 3 times in EverQuest's lifetime. This one particularly bothered me, because it's the 2nd time it happened to The Nameless. This time around I had them completely switch in entirely new hardware for the server because we began to suspect another piece of hardware in the configuration. <P>We do apologize for any downtime Nameless players have experienced. We understand completely that you pay us for a service that is expected to run 7/24 and we do our best to live up to that. In certain circumstances like this we need to tread extremely carefully to make sure we don't lose a whole bunch of data. That's why we backup everything (It's actually backed up in multiple ways). <P>Again, please accept our apologies and know that we are doing our best to make sure this kind of thing is inredibly rare. <P>Regards, <P>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>

The folks at 3DGN have published a brand new <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/stuff/quickie/4100.shtml">preview of Ruins of Kunark</a>, the upcoming EQ expansion.  No new information was revealed but for those who can't get enough Kunark it's a good read.  Here's a clip:<UL>The cost isn't all that bad, for an upgrade that you can play endlessly, that is. EBX says the price is right at $37.99, and since they have a return policy that makes those unfortunate souls who bought Quake 3 very happy, they must be right. But if you already own EverQuest, just wait for Verant to announce their upgrade plans shortly. <P> The box art is once again done by fantasy artist god Keith Parkinson, who I worship every day from 9-5 here on the discovery channel. If you're a real dork, I'd suggest picking up the expansion pack, which will ship with the original EverQuest and an updated map, simply to give yourself something to do in the bathroom, since you have so much spare time on your hands. </UL>

EQ Producer Brad McQuaid talked about the downtime the Nameless server experienced this weekend.  Here's the first post:<UL><i>Actually, I think this has happened 3 times in the history of EQ... maybe 4. <P>It does suck. Thank God it happens very rarely thanks to the RAID setup on our machines. Basically, 2 drives have to go bad around the same time for this to happen.<P> The chances of that happening, of course, is very small, which is why it's only happened 3-4 times in a year. <P>Typically a single drive goes bad, we bring down the server, put a new drive in, and rebuild it. <P>But if the RAID controller and/or 2 drives go bad, it's restore from backup time. <P>I assume this is what happened on the Nameless recently, though I've not talked to anyone one at EQ Operations. <P>In any case, what's with the 'it's happened twice on the Nameless!!' stuff? Do you guys think we're picking on servers now? Nerfing hardware instead of classes? <P>Yeah, we're putting substandard hardware in the Nameless because, well, um, we hate the Nameless! Er, no, um, we're stealing Nameless CPU cycles to reverse to reverse engineer a UFO found in Verant's basement! <P>The truth is out there! <P>-Brad</i></UL>Here's Brad's second post on this:<UL><i>tpowell2: rebuilding while keeping the server up creates an unaccpetable performance hit. <P>Senlaan: Yeah, I'm at home, it's the weekend. I'm spending my free time posting here. I'm not at work talking to the EQ Operations team.<P> In any case, my post responded to two things: <P>Contrary to what csorrows posted, people wanted more info, and I gave it to them. I explained what can cause, albeit very rarely, data loss.<P> I addressed, using comedy to put things in perspective, some people's assertions that we are targetting, or neglecting, or maliciously messing with the Nameless server. <P>-Brad</i></UL>

The following Patch Message has been added to the Patch Server:<UL>Emergency Patch April 1, 2000<br>-------------------------------------<P>The EQ servers were quickly brought down this morningfor an emergency patch update.  We'd apologize once againfor taking the servers down, but what would be the point?<P>The following changes were made:<P>1.) Wizards - We've finally given Wizards a few quick"Insta-Death" spells.  Our hope is that this will makeall the wizards shut up for a little while, until theystart to complain about lack of plate armor for their class.<P>2.) Druids - Because of the over-abundance of Druids in Norrath, the next timeyou login one out of every three Druids will be randomly reassigned a newclass.<P>3.) Warriors and Monks - These melee classes have been given magical abilities at last.They now can bind, gate, heal and summon food.  <P>4.) Magicians and Enchanters - New pet spell added: Nagafen.  We've given these two classes a fine new pet to helpthem in their everyday struggles in Norrath.    <P>5.) Rogues - We feel this class is our crowning achievement.  We believe it has been perfectly balanced, and as suchwill not receive any modifications for the rest of EverQuest's life.<P>6.) Hybrids (Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights) - After careful data analysis we've come to the conclusion that simply giving these classes a few of their spellcaster counterparts spells is not enough.  So thus we've given them all the spells they would normally receive had they been a Druid, Cleric or Necromancer.<P>In addition to these changes, the Necromancer and Cleric classes will be overhauled in the near future!  Unfortunately if you already have a character that is one of these two classes you will loose all your items and be randomly renamed.<P>Thanks for your patience!<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL><b>Update:</b> For those who haven't figured it out yet, April Fools! :)

Verant Interactive's John Ratcliff talked about Verant Interactive in St. Louis, Mo recently on the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5158">Hero's Journey Dev Board</a>.  Here's what he said:<UL><i>John Ratcliff, that's me, has an office in St. Louis because this is where my home and my family is and has been for over twenty years. <P>I enjoyed working at Simutronics and loved working on 'Cyberstrike 2' and 'Hero's Journey.' Now I'm working on a project for Verant. Before that I worked for Electronic Arts for almost 12 years doing a number of games. <P>No, I did not play paintball, airsoft, or any of that stuff at Simutronics. When I was there I *worked*, and worked hard. <P>Now I work hard for Verant. Not that complicated really when you think about it. <P>Regarding the cost of living being 'incredible' I probably should have worded that better. Where our offices are you can own a beautiful 4 bedroom home in a resort community for as little as $120k. For West Coasters such a thing is mind boggling. <P>John W. Ratcliff <br>Senior Technology Architect <br>Verant Interactive </i></UL>Sounds like a nice place to me.  St. Louis, and the area around, is simply wonderful.  Anyway, he later added another post to the thread:<UL><i>Thanks. Sorry to sound so defensive, but getting the story clear about my departure and relationship with Simu is somewhat important to me. <P>I will say this much, the new game I'm working on is not of a genre that has anything to do with any Simu product and probably would not be of direct interest to members of this forum. <P>Thanks for the kind words, best of luck. <P>John W.

The following message was added to the EQ Patch Server:<UL>***EMERGENCY PATCH***<P>Today it was necessary to bring the servers down in order to patch some files designed to correct some stability issues that were introduced in the last patch.  As part of this patch, some minor changes to game-play have been implemented:<P>- Corrected a bug that would sometimes cause an NPC to "warp" out-of-sight when fleeing.  The NPC in question would then heal to nearly full health before coming back to re-engage.  <P>- Corrected a bug introduced two patches ago that stopped NPCs (including pets) from using their "bash" skill unless they had a shield equipped.<P>- Casters of DOT spells will now be notified when their spell wears-off of the target.  In addition, pets will also tell their owner when any spell wears-off of them.<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

On the Gameplay board, Gordon Wrinn made the following post:<UL>EQ is awesome, but something better will come along, if only because of inevitable technical advances. Where will Verant be then? <P><b><i>We'll be releasing a new game :) We are fully committed to remaining on top of the newest technology available. </b></i><P>Too many companies have this "We're successful right now, so we don't have to improve" attitude.

Gordon Wrinn made his comments about some suggestions posted on the Gameplay board.  Here's the thread:<UL>How about a mystical portal in the game that you can walk through after you pay the NPC who stands next to it 20,000pp a trip to whatever server you want to be transferred to. <P><b><I>We considered doing that at one time, but seriously, would someone who knows how to make 20Kpp *really* want to be on a server with 1000+ other people who know how to make 20Kpp?</b></i><P> Not to mention it's a good money sink, and would help smaller people aquire a ton of items from the players trying to fund themselves the plat to step through. <P><b><i>Definitely a good money sink. Our final decision was that we wanted to try and maintain each server as a real community, where people on that server have earned their way into its history. This would yeild a place where reputations mean something. <P>Though it is true that the latest moves may have compromised that philosophy a bit, overall it's still looking good. </b></i><P>I know, this would take some seriously insane coding .. <P><b><I>And oh, you are right about that.

Gordon Wrinn talked about PvP on the Gameplay board today.  Here's the post:<UL><I>We're actually going to be shutting down the PvP thread here in the near future, probably before we release the expansion. Though I've seen many good suggestions, the majority are things that would require too much work for the possible benefit. Of the easier to implement suggestions, I liked the idea of experience loss on death more than anything, but I have to acknowledge that there's no way that a reasonable percentage of players on the PvP server would agree with it.<P>We are planning on allowing people to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, probably after the expansion is released. Since those two servers came up at roughly the same time, there aren't any worries about affecting their respective economies. <P>We also still plan to change the /con message so that you don't get an indication of level for anyone that you can attack. If they are in your level range, they'll just /con even. <P>That's about it.<P>-Gordon</I></UL>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Good grief has Gordon been busy today.  In the past 24 hours Mr. Wrinn has made over 60 posts on the Gameplay board alone.  Here's a rundown of some of his latest:<UL><b>Quest Structure</b><br>We're not at all opposed to quests giving out real (e.g. tangible) experience, however that's really not going to be possible given the current architecture. The problem is that we need to have the ability to store completion-info as part of the character. This would keep the same character from doing the same quest over and over again, which is what keeps us from doing things like giving out half-a-level for a tough quest. Tracking this unfortunately isn't possible without doing a player-wipe. The Quest engine could be improved in many other ways, but they all require the ability to know exactly what a character has or has not done. <P><b>Hybrid Debate</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028515.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Wow! These are probably some of the best arguments I've seen. I am impressed...however... <P>Hybrids don't get teleports, not even Gate. Only two classes get teleports, and even though rangers are a hybrid of one of those classes, there's really no compelling reason to make an exception.<P><b>Money and the PoS</b><br>If you are paying 3Kpp per person to go to the Plane of Sky, there's only one reason: You want to. The zone need not cost a cent after the first trip in. Deaths can be handled with resurrect. Heck, you can even get by a few of the key requirements using death, resurrect, and summon-corpse (this one costs money though). <P>Now of course if you want to bring more people than there are keys, or skip by the first island, it's going to cost you. We want the Plane of Sky to remain challenging regardless of how many warm bodies you can throw at it.<P><b>Skill Caps and Individuality</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: What about giving characters one generic skillcap point per level that they could assign to any skill? Or&#8230; implement some quests that can raise skillcaps for different skills.  A 50th level character could have assigned 50 skillcap points to one skill raising its effectiveness by 10 levels. If this is too much there could be a skillcap addition cap for certain skills.]</i><P>First, just because you stop gaining in a particular skill doesn't mean that your skill level does not go up. For instance, a level 50 person with a 200 skill in 1HS does not hit like a level 40 person, they hit like a level 50 person because their is more to calculating it than just the skill. <P>Secondly, please keep in mind that all of this stuff is balanced based upon the caps and how they work now. We just can't arbitrarily decide to start letting people increase their skill-caps on a whim. Sure, it would be neat, but since things are currently balanced, the only way that something like this could go in is if we substantially nerfed the skills so that any net gain would be zero. <P>Finally, enabling what you ask for here would not diverse characters. Skill-based systems never do. Everyone gravitates towards having whatever skills are perceived to be ideal. This has been persistent flaw in every skill-based MMORPG architecture that has been developed. That&#8217;s why we chose to go with a class-based system.<P><b>Drops in PoH</b><br>Just trying to verify your logic: The drop percentages in Hate are low so people with armor in Hate will play longer? I suppose that means that since the drops in Fear are higher, we must want everyone with armor there to quit. <P>Please... We have Hate updated on the Test server and hope to patch it live the next time we do data. Probably next week.<P><b>Bonus Skill Points</b><br>Well I can say that we don't have any intention of including bonus points. It's certainly possible for people to work up any skills that they need, the inclusion of more points would just serve to save them some time, and go a long way towards making point meaningless in the first place. Save them up!<P><b>Kunark and International Orders</b><br>Our plan is to have the Expansion in everyone's hands prior to the official launch, even the overseas people. That's our plan, and it is looking good so far. However we really won't be able to nail it down further for a bit yet.<P><b></b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029398.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Unfortunately, this is the way resurrection works, and it's not considered a bug. If the resurrection doesn't go through on the first time for whatever reason (e.g. Zone, cancel, LD, etc.), the experience cannot be restored. <br><i>[Quote from original post: I disagree with the behavior not being considered a bug. A res should give the exp, period. No, two reses should NOT give any more exp than one res.]</i><P> I understand your opinion, however when making coding decisions, the programmers have to decide how many contingencies they are willing to trap. There are functions that you can perform in the game that account for all different kinds of things that can go wrong, such as everything that can go wrong in a trade. <P>Resurrection is one of those things where not everything possible is trapped. It makes resurrection fairly black-and-white, but has the side-effect of missing them under certain circumstances. <P><b>Resurrection Bug</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: I too recently lost the exp from missing the first res attempt. What happened was, I was waiting a while on the cleric to med and res, and going through inventory. The window popped up as I clicked on an inventory item - and clicking on the item made the res window disappear!!]</i><P> Yeah, I'll buy that that is a bug with the confirmation-box code. You would think that a confirmation box wouldn't disappear unless you actually click on something. In *most* cases, it's safe to assume the answer is "NO", which is how the item-destroy confirmation works, but I can see this being a problem in reference to a resurrect. I'm not sure if this can be worked around, but I'll bring it to the Team.<P><b>Fear and Charm in PvP</b><br>Fear and Charm spells have been disabled in the PvP environment for some time due to abuses that surround them. They made it possible for all kinds of bad things to happen, including intentionally causing experience loss and they allowed people to bypass the PvP level limits. <P>When this was done, AE Fear spells continued to work due to how those spells interact with the players. This latest patch merely fixed that issue, causing PCs to be immune to them as well as the single target spells from before.<P><b>On Reported Bard Bug</b><br>GZ has vowed to take another look at it, though no progress has been made. He's fairly tied up with trying to get the expansion spells in order. Due to the complexity of the spell system, we prefer to have only one person with the ability to modify spells.<P><b>Terms and Phrases</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just time for another "pop" word I think...."Uber-guild" is dead....both the word and the definition.]</i><P>Hmmm... <br><br>Overguild<br>Superguild<br>Surguild<br>Pas Sous Guild<br>Powerguild<br>Capo-guild<br>Bossguild<br>|3W|_guild<br>Getsmolewtguild<br> <br>Hmmm... Maybe we should just stick with Uberguild<P><b>Pro Asheron's Call Posts on the Official Boards</b><br>We really don't mind seeing the posts on the board proclaiming one game better than another. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that opinion means so much more when it is tested. It's one thing for us to talk about the positive aspects of EQ when people haven't tried another game. It's another thing when they've tried the other games and then affirmatively choose EQ. <P>Thank you for continuing to choose EQ.<P><b>Magician Spells</b><br>Breaking a moment from not speaking about 50+ spells, I'd like to say that magicians will keep Malosi, it just won't be as a level 49 spell. <P><b>DoT Spells</b><br>There's a difference between having one message that's sent to one person, and having one message that's broadcast to several. For things like Taunt and Spell damage, it would result in an increase of network traffic that would be problematic :(<P><b>Do Celebirties Play EQ?</b><br>I've wondered this many times myself. I'd heard that a mainstream band interviewed in a popular music rag once stated that they spent their spare time playing EQ. I'm sure there are other celeb's playing, and wouldn't mind knowing for personal reasons. They can feel free to email me at gwrinn@verant.com if they like, and I'll even see about getting a signed poster out :)<P><b>Charm Bug</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029409.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Indeed a bug, and easy to understand when you know how this stuff works. I'll forward it to the test team.<P><b>More on DoTs</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: When it breaks fear tho the mob runs for me at full normal speed, as for some weird reason whenever fear is broken or wears off, the movement inhibiting portion of the "darkness" line of dots seems to wear off as well.]</i><P> This definitely isn't as designed, nor is it as I've observed myself. I'd suggest you try some extensive testing to see if it&#8217;s truly the case. If this did go in at some time it was accidental. Can anyone confirm or deny this behavior?<P><P><b>What about Pet Bashing in this patch?</b><br>Well it's not just pets, it's all NPCs are refusing to bash without a shield. And yes, that will be corrected in this patch.<P><b>Can EQ Be Made Into a Better game?</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: At this point in development, with EQ having been out for a year and over 200,000 installed copies of it on the market Verant would be making a bad business choice to rework every system that we, as players, recommend to them to be changed.]</i><P> That's something that we struggle with here on a near-daily basis, and it comes up every time we discuss any planned enhancement or "nerf" to any particular aspect of the game: Do the ends justify the means. Will the changes we are considering really do anything for the game? Will it make people stay longer? Will it prompt them to quit sooner? Will the people who will stay longer make up for all the people that will quit instantly because of a specific change? Do we really want to risk making vast sweeping changes to an already successful game? <P>In a system with over 200K active subscribers, we can pretty much bet that any change we make to the game will cause people to quit sooner, stay longer, quit instantly, resubscribe, and do nothing at all. All of these actions are represented. <P>So, to the people who think that we just run around arbitrarily making changes to the game, I'd like to point out that there is a whole lot more to it than that.<P><b>The Odds</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone have the odds that the servers will be down for more then 2 hours.]</i><P>I'll give 3:1 again :)<P><b>Casters realm reports that all of the dot spells now give messages when they wear off - True?</b><br>I can confirm this. I believe that someone suggested it on the boards yesterday, and I said I'd take it to the team. Well the programmer who does things like that regularly reads the board here. He grabbed it and ran with it. <P>The technology that lets us report when charm and fear wears off is what let us do this fairly easily. <P>One additional note that's not mentioned at castersrealm is that pets should now tell their owners when a beneficial spell wears off. <P><b>EverQuest and Realism</b><br>Sometimes we have to put some limitations on realism for the sake of gameplay. This takes many forms, some of which are considered both good and bad. As an example, it's "unrealistic" for someone to heal from near-dead to full simply by sitting on your can for 20 minutes. Even in game-time, that only accounts for about 8 hours. Embracing realism in this case would lead to tedium in the game. <P>The same philosophy is true for things such as archery. Though realistically, a person with a really good bow could kill something in but a few shots, from a gameplay standpoint that would be too powerful. Though tedium isn't an issue with this, the sanctity and meaning of gameplay (e.g. challenge) is at stake. <P><b>GM Events Involving City Assaults</b><br>We'd like to see it too, and have tried it on occasion. Unfortunately it's always followed by people coming to the boards and complaining how we get our kicks out of killing newbies. After about the 3rd or 4th time we decided to reevaluate our plans and try to hold these types of things at least one zones from a newbie zone.<P><b>Posion Update</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Can us rogues expect to see comments regarding the poison changes?]</i><P>Comments as in "When will they be done?" or comments addressing "What will they consist of?" <P>To the former, we've got it set for post-expansion right now. I posted in another thread about it today: <P>---SNIP---<br><i>[Quote from original post: I don't suppose any rogue changes were put in? </i><P>Nothing in this patch specifically addressed the rogue class. As far as what we have planned, we're still planning an update for poison, but that's looking to be post-expansion now. Doing a worthwhile update for poison is far more difficult than putting in something like Evade or the hide/sneak/undead thing. It will take a good deal of effort to get it right.<br>---SNIP--- <P>As for the latter, we're still working on that. All I can say is that it is supposed to be "cool" :)<P><P><b>Pet Bug Overview</b><br>NPCs (pets included) have always had the ability to bash (slam) without having a shield equipped. The ability was accidently removed in the patch last Friday, and was put back in in the patch today. <P><b>Expansion Skills for Melee</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: What's up with them? Have they already been selected, coded, and finalized (I hope so, release is but a few precious weeks away, but then again... -bah, this isn't a flame, but a qustion) All the casters have their rumored new spells posted on every EQ board from here to Kaladim, but what about the new melee skills?]</i><P> They've been coded and are currently undergoing balance tests on the Test server. We just aren't ready to release any specific information about them. As for the spell info that's out there, there wasn't much we could do about that. We're just not commenting on them either, and have thrown in a few red herrings to keep people guessing.<br>--<br>All of the melee classes are getting new abilities post-50. Though I wouldn't classify them as skills (a skill being something that you must train up, whereas abilities are semi-innate). We do not, however, wish to comment on any specifics in regards to them at this time.<P><b>Harmony and Feign Death</b><br>Harmony and Feign Death cannot be compared directly. The spell and skill have two completely different uses. Harmony, for instance, is an outdoor-only offensive spell, and Feign Death is an escape skill that works everywhere.<P><b>Rogue Changes?</b><br>Nothing in this patch specifically addressed the rogue class. As far as what we have planned, we're still planning an update for poison, but that's looking to be post-expansion now. Doing a worthwhile update for poison is far more difficult than putting in something like Evade or the hide/sneak/undead thing. It will take a good deal of effort to get it right.</UL>

More good news was posted today by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay board:<UL><i>One thing that I forgot to mention is that harmful DOTs will now report to the caster when they wear off the target. Furthermore, pets will report to their owner whenever *any* spell wears off of them. No more guessing involved. <P>I believe that someone suggested it on the boards yesterday, and I said I'd take it to the team. Well the programmer who does things like that regularly reads the board here. He grabbed it and ran with it. <P>The technology that lets us report when charm and fear wears off is what let us do this fairly easily. <P>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon posted the following on the Gameplay board this afternoon:<UL><i>The bad news is that we need to bring the servers down for about an hour shortly to deal with some stability issues introduced with the last patch. It will be quick, but you know how we hate to bring them down for any reason outside the normal scheduled outage period.<P>The good news is that as part of this patch, we've fixed the "warp on flee" bug that plagues many areas of the game. In some zones, NPCs will warp-off somewhere when they turn to flee. They tend to come back at nearly full health, usually leading a nice train behind them. They'll no longer warp when fleeing.<P>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon responded twice to a few posts regarding one of his previous posts concerning an email scam and not giving away user info.  Here's the first clip:<UL>Actually, Verant's own Guide program application requires you to type in your station name and password to enter an application... it would be very easy to design a site that is a fake "guide application"... so yes, in fact, Verant CAN ask for your name and password, just not directly in Email... didn't think of that?<P><b><I>Actually that's not true. Though the guide application does ask for *A* password, it specifically states that the password that you give should be different from your login password.<P>So yes, we thought of that.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's the second post:<UL>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the FIRST time you go to CREATE your guide app, you must put in your REAL EQ Login name and REAL password. AFTER that, when you get to the screen to create your app, you are allowed to specify your NON-LOGIN EQ password as something different. <P><b><I>No, when you first go there you can enter any password that you like. However looking at the site, I can understand how it would lead people to believe that they have to put their actual password. I'll work on getting this clarified on the site. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Another email scam is going around.  Gordon spoke about it today on the Gameplay board:<UL><i>We just received word of yet another scam directed at EQ customers attempting to get them to send their passwords and login information to parties impersonating Verant personnel. I would like to stress as firmly as possible that no Verant, Sony, nor 989 Studios representative will *ever* ask you for your password, or request that you change your password to a specified string. <P>Furthermore, any official communications will come from the verant.com or station.sony.com domains. We never use free email accounts provided by any of the free email providers on the web. <P>I'm beginning to believe that people are perpetuating these scams in order to get some sick sense of accomplishment by seeing their scam-email posted on the front page of news sites. I'll therefore ask that news sites no longer post those actual emails when issuing the warnings, and instead opt to just summarize them. Please do not be fooled by these scams. <P>-Gordon</i></UL>

*starts huming "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" to himself*  Eldrad the General sent me the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>After reading some posts on Alakazam's new quest board and checking out the rumors, I was able to figure out the quest. <P>The stats on the Oaken Scimitar are different than the "beta version". It's druid only, 1h slash, 8 dmg 25 delay +9 wis +4 agil and weighs 3.5, no drop, magic, lore, with a Thorncoat effect. Also when you wield it it looks like a runed falchion, only with a light tan tint. <P>The quest is tough. There's a wandering rare NPC in W Karana. I forget his first name but his last name was Oaksword. I found him wandering around sort of near the ogres, but a bit south of them, seemed to be on the same route as the ghoul messenger (so maybe the ghoul is his placeholder). He just happened to appear on track so I went to check him out. <P>What you need basically is the Solvedi Scimitar and the Treant Staff, both quests in Rathe Mtns. Then you need the testimony & the head of a fallen druid, named Jordynn or something like that, who is a new rare spawn in SK now.<P> Turn these 4 items in to him and you'll get the scim. Luckily I did the solvedi scim and treant staff quest long ago and had them wasting away in my bank. Jordynn I found in SK sort of near the pyramid. I think maybe talking to Oaksword made him spawn since I've spent lots of time in SK with many different characters and never ever saw him before. Jordynn coned blue at 48 and was pretty nasty.. I'd say a 45ish druid, but I had a full group and we were able to take him down :) <P>I have screenshots of what he was saying that you can see at <a href="http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/oak.jpg">http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/oak.jpg</a> and also one of me holding the scim at <a href="http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/scim.jpg">http://www.tarewmarr.net/shots/scim.jpg</a> <P>So, go get one :)</BLOCKQUOTE>Wow, everyone must check this out!

Gordon Wrinn answered one of the deepest questions one can ask about EverQuest, that is what is the point of it all?  Here's his response from the Gameplay board:<UL>Whats the point of Everquest? I have not seen anything about the enviroment that promotes roleplay. All I see is CAMPING for ITEMS and EXP. Even in groups thats all the game is about.What is the point of getting plane gear? Plane gear is suppose to be the best gear in the game and since this game is all about camping gear why should we camp this last tomb of gear if we will never be able to use it anywhere better? <P><b><i>That's one of the interesting things about MMORPGs: They are what you make of them. If all you choose to see or partake in is "camping items and exp", then that's all there is here for you. On the other hand, if you choose to believe and pursue something more, you can get as much out of the game as you allow yourself to. <P></b></i>Is there a feeling at Verant that there is much room for impovement or is it true that you guys are satisfied with the current state of the game as Brad likes to hint at? <P><b><i>It would be entirely arrogant of us to try and say that "EQ is perfect". EQ is however, extremely successful, and fulfills the general goals that was laid out for it. EQ generally adheres to the vision of the perfect game, but there is and always will be better ways to do things than what we chose for this incarnation. </b></i><P>Will you try to do things different on future games or keep the same attitudes and practices towards players? <P><b><I>I think it makes sense that any future products that we create in the MMORPG genre will try to capitalize on EQ's strengths and leave behind its weaknesses, much as competitor&#8217;s products will try to do the same. As an example, we would try to retain the things about EQ that makes it a very compelling game to play, and might try to rid future products of the aspects of EQ that people tend to be unhappy with (e.g. downtime). Though downtime is integral to EQ at this point, and will remain a facet of EQ, future products might focus on limiting its impact. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

I thought the following board post was very funny.  It was made by Gordon Wrinn in response to a "concerned" player's board posts.  Here's the post from the Gameplay board:<UL><b><i>Ooooh... Someone has dared me to comment, thus issuing a challenge! I must respond!</b></i><P> ABASHI, when are you going to...?  <b><i><P>Soon(tm) </b></i><P>ABASHI, what are you going to...?  <b><i><P>Nothing planned really. </b></i><P>ABASHI, how can you explain...?  <b><i><P>Well I *could* explain it, but does it really matter? </b></i><P>Abashi, 4 GM's personally harassed me, forced me to give up a spawn for their favorite players to play, here I have it logged: "A_GM_guy tells you, 'Sorry it's against our policy to do anything' SEE? THE WHOLE THING RIGHT THERE  <b><i><P>Oh, ouch. That sounds bad. I see your point. </b></i><P>Abashi, you told me that my class was getting an ubertwink...now look, it's been 3 whole seconds since that post, NO TWINKAGE!! How do expect to explain that?  <b><i><P>I'm sorry, the ubertwink has been delayed. The dev team found it necessary to blink. </b></i><P>ABASHI, my class must be useless, I was once casting a spell and it fizzled and it costed mana; is Verant aware of these bugs?  <b><i><P>Bugs? I assume by bugs you mean "Fire Beetles". </b></i><P>ABASHI, I have been playing for 10 minutes and I haven't been invited to a single dragon raid. My class is useless.  <b><i><P>I think you may have forgotten to press the "Play EverQuest" button. </b></i><P>ABASHI, when are you going to give us the gm /kill command? Obviously this is favoritism towards GMs.  <b><i><P>It's queued right after the ubertwink which is right after we blink. </b></i><P>ABASHI this is the GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT ok only PRETTY GOOD sister of all wood elf posts!!!  <b><i><P>As long as it's not the mother-in-law of all wife posts, I'm interested. </b></i><P>ABASHI!! If you don't reply in 3 days I will cancel my account, wreck my car, and kill my goldfish!!! (that oughtta work)  <b><i><P>How do you define "3"? </b></i><P>ABASHI this is the GERMAN SHEPHERD of all DOG posts! Why wolves and no dogs?? HUH???  <b><i><P>Have you pet your Druid today? </b></i><P>Abashi, once I was walking and I got a LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... message...obviously this indicates serious serverside lag!!! Fix it!!!  <b><i><P>Ok sir, please put down the keyboard and slowly back away. </b></i><P>Abashi, I always wanted a pony...this is a roleplaying game and there are centaurs but no ponies...wtf is with that?? How can I roleplay an unrealistic environment?  <b><i><P>You're right. I want a pony, too. </b></i><P>Abashi, I have several issues you need to address.<P>1. Damage. I can barely solo a red when I'm oom  <b><i><P>Out of Manacotti? NOOOOO! Say it isn't so!!!! </b></i><P>2. Hit points. If I get more than half a dungeon training on me, I have to zone. This is highly inconvenient.  <b><i><P>Make use of that /kill command right after the blink-n-twink. </b></i><P>3. Items. In the last patch, Verant lowered my classes quest items by almost 30 or 40 points...this 1% decrease is highly unfair to our class.  <b><i><P>We haven't nerfed them, those quests just all start now by you /hailing Nagafen. </b></i><P>4. Drops. I camped an item for almost 10 minutes and didn't see a single drop, not even a common one.  <b><i><P>You might consider killing the critter. It's a bit of a prerequisite to a drop. </b></i><P>5. Spells. I keep having to pay money for these things???? Come on, my character should be able to learn them by rote, even make them up...see post 361 appendix A article 2 where I made some suggestions on the kind of spells my monk should be able to invent on the fly...  <b><i><P>Please forward me the library of congress catalog number of your post, I'll be happy to take a look. </b></i><P>6. Duelling; somebody beat me the other day; obviously his class is supieror to mine. Make mine the better one or I'll cancel my account.  <b><i><P>Well I would suggest that you make use of the post-blink-n-twink /kill command, but since he'll have it too, we'll put in a confirmation box. "Are you sure you want to be /killed by [charactername]?" </b></i><P>7. Money. What's with this $10 a month bullcrap?? I already paid for the cd and everything cut me some friggan slack  <b><i><P>Hey, we all need something to wallpaper our dens with. </b></i><P>8. Overcrowding; once someone got to a camp before me, and there were almost 5 people in the zone when I logged in. Can we have a server-wide split like some of those other panzy servers are doing?  <b><i><P>The other panzy servers have been sacked. </b></i><P>9. PVP. The other day, a guy attacked me while I was OBVIOUSLY not prepared to combat him. We should get a yes/no box asking "Are you ready?" before somebody is allowed to damage us. <b><i><P> See number 6. </b></i><P>10. Mana use: It takes me almost 1/4 bubble a mana to cast my "instant-death" spell. Obviously this is a mistake; I can barely solo 4 rooms at a time this way!! <b><i><P> The instant-death spell has been sacked. </b></i><P>11. Pets. In the last patch, you nerfed my pet not to go around tracking automatic blue things and kill them for me. how the heck am I supposed to level while I'm at work now?  <b><i><P>Work? You've been sacked. </b></i><P>12. Spamming; the other day almost 300 people told me 'Welcome to ignore.' How can I stop this harassment?? Also; these other people kept on shouting when I was trying to tell the zone something and auctioning when I was trying to sell something. Others could barely hear me! This is an obvious breach of serious etiquette.  <b><i><P>I suggest you make serious and judicious use of /ignore. </b></i><P>13. Logging in; it takes me almost 4.89 seconds to enter Everquest, and on top of that, I get disconnected almost once every other month!! My time is valuable; can we fix this?  <b><i><P>*blink* <P>Sorry, what was that? </b></i><P>14. Patches. THIS THE BIG ONE; Why the HECK do you guys keep turning EQ off for several hours just so some stupid flamers can get their twink upgrade???? COME ON AND PLEASE stop foolin with the selfish kiddies I WANNA PLAY RIGHT NOW!!! <b><i><P>We're just trying to pretend that we do something beyond wallpapering our dens with your $10/month. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Gordon, Gordon!  Why, why, why?  How, how, how?  Gooooorrdoon!

Gordon Wrinn, Verant's Internet Relations Manager, has made many posts over the last 24 hours.  Here's the latest round of them from the Gameplay board:<UL><b>GM Question Answered</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: It is my understanding that you must have had several warnings b4 your account got suspended or the GM had to has to at least TELL you thet you are being suspended and for how long.]</i><P> No, depending on the offense, sometimes no warning is given. I would suggest that you try to log back in in an hour or so though, as there's a good chance that you were just given a 1-hour suspension due to the chat-room misconduct.<P> If it's longer than a 1-hour suspension, and your email address in your profile is correct, you should get an email from the GM shortly.<P><b>Regarding Humor Post</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028772.html">click here</a> for original post)<br>Incidently I was thinking of getting a personalized plate that reads "Abashi", but then I was hit by a flash of common sense (...or was it fear?)<P><b>Necromancer Suggestion</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Being's Dot's are our main and pretty much only damage source of great value, shouldnt there be a message that could rea " Heat Blood has worn off" or "heart flutter has worn off"..you get the idea.]</i><P>It's an interesting suggestion, and I'll bring it up, since everyone knows that Necromancers are my favorite class too :)<P>I'm also looking into seeing if we can get pets to report when their buffs wear off. No guarantees though.<P><b>Color Change for the EQ Fonts</b><br.This is one of those things that we'd like to do, but aren't able to commit to it at present. It's basically still on our list, but it doesn't show any promise of being worked on in the near future. Perhaps some day we might be able to get this one done.<P><b>What are the benefits of being evil?</b><br>Well, for a tangible benefit, I've always found the ability to kill indiscriminately with my evil character quite refreshing. Though there are certainly some faction loopholes that allow "good" characters to kill "good" NPCs, they often have to search and find specific NPCs that don't hurt their faction, my character never really had to worry about that. <P>As far as intangible benefits go, I just like roleplaying an evil character. <P><b>Regarding Statement about Humans</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: "Human have no remarkable additional abilities or powers, but do seem to Level up faster than other races"]</i><P> I was wondering what the actual quote from the book said, and I thank the author of this post for posting it. This particular line *seems* to be an opinion, not a statement of fact, eh?<P>   <b>Pets Aren't Bashing?</b><br>Really? Doh! <P>Haven't checked it myself, but if its true then it isn't intentional, and probably affects all NPCs. <br>--<br>I can now confirm that we did introduce a bug last Friday that has stopped all NPCs from bashing unless they have a shield equipped. <P>This is already fixed on test and will be moved live the next time we patch.<P><b>New Station Policies (No under 13 years old)</b><br>It's not a matter of a "mistake" and there's no conspiracy here. It's just federal law. We cannot maintain information on people under 13 years of age without their parents permission. As such, some April 21, we'll be unable to offer anyone in that age range an EverQuest account. This goes for current subscribers as well. <P>Now we aren't required to verify those birthdates, so as long as we think you are over 13 you are fine.<P><b>Erudite Graphic Problem</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon, on Erudite males, their gloves only show up as steel if you're wearing leathre gloves, and the helmet will only show up a steel if leather gloves are worn.]</I><P>I'm checking into this. Remind me about it tomorrow or so.<P><b>More Zones, More Quests</b><br>They're coming as part of the expansion in less than a month now. Though we continue to work on additional "free" content, the expansion does represent a big chunk of new content coming in at once.<br>--<br>Well "soon" is relative. There's nothing quick about building zones. They aren't generated by computer, they are instead built polygon by polygon by an artist. <P><b>Would you buy EverQuest 2?</b><br>You bet I would! Of course something tells me I could get it for free :)<P>Seriously though, I'd be interested in knowing, of the people that said no, how many are still playing EQ?

A debate on the Gameplay board continues to rage about the Monk class.  Here's Gordon's latest post on the issue:<UL>I understand what you are trying to say, that monks deal more damage faster, but at high levels this is just not the case when compared to other tanks. Yes, in my full gear with haste items and so forth I will deal more damage faster than a warrior/rogue with no gear on. Factor in the gear available to those warriors/rogues and procs and then monks don't deal more damage faster. <P><b><I>I didn't miss your point. You indeed do more damage than any other melee class assuming a toe-to-toe confrontation. I'm sorry if you haven't observed this to be the case. You also get more defensive skills than the other classes. All of this goes into helping offset your low hitpoints. </b></i><P>IF what you said was true, that Monks deal the most damage in the least amount of time than ANY other melee class, then it would have been impossible what the rogue did in ksing the ghoul lord from my entire party of 6 people. <P><b><I>A well-played rogue has the potential to outdamage the monk. It's just the way it works and how it's supposed to be. The last update we did to monks (where we decreased their Hand-to-Hand delay as they level) was a big enhancement for them, and was made to put them solidly into the damage scheme where we wanted them to be. </b></i><P>All I say is that because monks live off the land and are not dependant on gear, then we should have a skill(or a improvement to our natural haste) that makes up this difference. <P><b><I>This is already accounted for. All of it. <P>Just to be as clear as possible, no further across-the-board enhancements are planned for the monk class in the short term, nor is any need for such enhancement recognized at this time.<P> -Gordon</b></i></UL>

On the Gameplay board, Gordon Wrinn has been posting up a storm.  Here's his latest posts:<UL><b>On New Servers</b><br>We have 4 new servers planned over the next several weeks. Two of them will probably be split-servers to take overflow population from some of the busier servers. We'll release more information as to times that these will come online when we have something firm. <P>In addition to bringing up the new servers, we're going to be changing some colors on the server-selection screen in order to try and get new players to choose less-crowded servers. We think that there's a possibility that people new to the game are largely choosing the more-crowded servers thinking "If everyone is on server X, it must be the best server". <P><b>Catering to Uber Guilds</b><br><i>[Responding to claims that Verant "caters to the uberguild"]</i> I don't think that we are "catering to the uberguilds". We said back in the begining that there was creatures in Norrath that would take waves and waves of people to kill, and even mentioned a few times phrases like "very large organized guilds". <P>And we're not consistently beefing up these mobs as you state in your post. They've really only been upgraded a few times. <P>Why is it that you think that these creatures should be pushovers for you just because you can't get that number of people together? Don't tell me that you don't want them to be pushovers, just possible. They are possible, and take the same amount of work based on experienced no matter what the size of the guild going after it.<P><b>Why Can't You Loot Other Player's Kills?</b><br>There are things that take more than one group to kill. People would be pretty well up-the-creek on creatures like that if corpses didn't automatically unlock after a given time. It also ads a nice aspect to player interaction. Following a group around and looting their leavings can be a good way to make money. <P>Sure, like anything else there are some downsides to this, but overall I think it works out ok.<P><b>On Gods and Dragons</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not asking that all dragons/gods pop during primetime, like they do now during the day, but maybe one or two. Or actually have a somewhat set time, like once a week, where they will pop.]</i><P> Though we really can't do anything at present about the fact that they pop whenever the zone is restarted, they do have the opportunity to spawn at other times in the week, and on a random timer at that. Prior to last week, the servers went nearly a month without being patched, and each server spawned dragons several times during that period. <P>People who are online most of their natural lives will probably always have an edge in fighting creatures such as that, but I don't think that other people are locked out of the opportunity.<P><b>Vendor Locations</b><br>Not every city has everything. That's just one of the design aspects of the game, and is there to encourage people to travel around to get the goods that they need. It's that way to add some distinction to the cities and give people reason to visit them. <P><b>Planet of Sky Equipment</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: "Equipment from the Plane of Sky makes all other items look like rusty daggers."]</i><br> Actually that's a misquote. The real one was something along the lines of "Some of the Plane of Sky stuff makes other stuff look like rusty daggers". Note the subtle difference. <P>Yes that quote still applies.<P><b>Soundblaster Bug Update</b><br>I posted the other day that we are working closely with the Creative Labs folks on this. *Most* people cease to have a problem if they update both the LiveWare AND the drives. In the event that that doesn't work, there's a work-around (not a fix, a work-around) to get you by in the meantime. Here's a quote from the other post: <P><UL>---SNIP---<br>SB Live users need to get BOTH the latest LiveWare AND the latest drivers. This fixes the crashing problem for many people. Some still crash, but the Creative Labs people were not sure how that could still happen with the proper LiveWare and drivers installed. One work-around for these people is to go into their "Control Panel\Multimedia\Audio Tab\goto Playback 'Advanced Properties'\Performance tab" and then lower the "Hardware Acceleration" slider down one notch to "Standard Acceleration".<br>---SNIP--- </UL><P>We'll continue to work on this until it is resolved.<P><b>Spell Issues</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Oh and BTW Abashi. If those wizzies, Druids, mages, or necros have 200WIS/INT they can do the Ice Giants fairly easy. My bud which is a 49 Druid soloes em all the time. As a matter of fact he is bound just outside the Ice Giant castle for this reason.]</i><P> Notice that I said the ice giants INSIDE permafrost, not the ones outside. The point I was trying to make is that solely comparing classes based upon what they can solo in a wide-open outdoor area isn't going to get you much sympathy here, just as solely comparing them on the basis of what type of group is required in a cramped indoor location will do the same. <P>Yes, casters do, and will always, have an advantage in wide-open outdoor areas, but when they get indoors, they need the melee classes. I don't think that this is quite the epiphany that you make it out to be.<P><b>Buffing Mobs</b><br>Well we don't ever want Dragons or Gods to become yard trash, but we are sensitive to the concerns that many people have about us buffing them all up in light of the new level limit. Aside from that, we aren't really prepared to release further information on it. <P><b>GM Favoritism</b><br>People claim favoritism simply because there's no reasonable defense against it. There's often no way to prove that something didn't happen, and we frequently won't stoop to the level required to refute individual claims. People making the claims don't even have to produce any evidence. Other people reading it just assume that since they heard it on the Internet, it must be true. <P>Like I've said before, if anyone has a specific information concerning favoritism or any other customer service staff misconduct, send me mail and I'll get it to the appropriate people. <P><b>More on Togor/Code Issues</b><br>The entry in the data file didn't matter before, as it was all controlled in code. It's now controlled by the spell database, because the code-cap had to be raised to allow for new spells that do more. Thats why the controlling factor was moved. <P>Please read that closely. I've explained it many times. <P><b>Stop the Farming!</b><br>To be honest guys, the quickest way to stop the farming is to quit buying their wares. It's a demand-driven business. Now if so many people are refusing to quit buying their stuff that it creates a big enough demand to encourage the farming, I wonder if the "majority" doesn't in-fact approve of it. <P>Thoughts? (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029165.html">Click here</a> for that thread)<P><b>On Server Downtime</b><br>There's always at least 5 minutes notice for any intentional outage. The servers are brought down by script to insure that this happens. Now does this mean that no one gets cut off? No, it's still possible that someone just logging in gets cut off without notice, but that problem will exist no matter how we do it.<P> The point of the language is to illustrate the urgency of the situation. <P><b>Hint Book Inaccuracies</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029133.html">Click here</a> for thread)<br>I've never bothered to look at the hint book, and really am not concerned with what it may or may not have said. I'll take your word for it that it says what you say it does, and decline to comment further. Whatever the experience requirements are, that's what they are, that's the way it is, and it won't be changing. The contents of the hint book aren't going to change, and neither are the experience requirements to put them in line if any discrepancy exists. <P>As we didn't have creative control over any of this documentation, it's very likely that it contains information that might not be entirely correct. It is also very likely that it contains information that we didn't want released. The hint book itself was written in late beta, and since the game has continued to evolve after print, I'm sure that there are many things in it that are obsolete. <P>As for the question in general, there's really nothing wrong with it, I just don't want to be roped into answering all of the other questions that would result from it. My recommendation to you would be to kill a few things and draw your own conclusions.<P><b>Repop'ing the Planes</b><br>The GMs won't manually repop the planes after a scheduled outage, and are only doing so after an unscheduled outage as a courtesy. <P><b>Lack of Class Quests</b><br>I'm aware of several identifiable groups that currently don't have any quests. Our Live Team will address these issues as they can, and there is always a need for additional quests in game.<P><b>On Scheduling</b><br>Every company has their own guidelines to determine what constitutes "Scheduled". Before I came to Verant, I did some consulting for a wireless/satellite data Communications Company in Chicago. Outages there had to be "scheduled" 3.5 weeks in advance. Any outage taken without being scheduled that far in advance was considered an "emergency" outage. <P>Though I think 3.5 weeks would be a little extreme for our purposes, I do think that we've been throwing around the term "scheduled" a little too freely. The fact does remain that we would do those updates regardless of what we call them, but I'll see if we can get the terminology a little closer to reality. </UL>

I received the following announcement from Mince:<BLOCKQUOTE>Mince's Dungeon Crawls (Luclin server): Befallen, April 2nd <P>Greetings adventurers, I am Mince, a proud Gnome Gemchopper. I am of the opinion that many areas of Norrath, especially dungeons, are underutilized. In order to promote these areas as well as the art of the Dungeon Crawl, I intend to periodically lead expeditions to these locales. I am looking for hearty adventurers to join me in these expeditions. Be forewarned that dungeons are dangerous and have their own unique challenges (i.e. locked doors, traps, large groups of monsters, etc.). Also, it will be a Dungeon Crawl (meaning we will be moving from room to room, not camping in the same spot). Therefore, power levelers, campers, and people that run at the first sign of danger may not find this experience to there liking. However, for those who enjoy joining a band of adventurers and conquering a dungeon while focusing on fun, companionship, and defeating foul beasts, please come out and join me. <P>Target: Befallen, an undead infested dungeon located in West Commons. It consists of three floors with the dungeon getting progressively harder the deeper you go. Level range: 6-19th. I will lead the Bottom floor group(s) (levels 16-19). I will need leaders for the Middle floor (levels 11-15) & Top floor (levels 6-10) groups. Rallying point/time: Ro Tunnel entrance in East Commons at 4 pm Pacific time (Sunday, April 2nd). Please be geared up and ready to go. It is encouraged that you bind yourself in West Freeport beforehand. The dungeon is roughly 5 minutes travel time from the rallying point. <P>Any questions? Contact <a href="mailto:mince@luclin.com">mince@luclin.com</a> or Mince in-game. And be on the lookout for future Mince's Dungeon Crawls in the weeks and months to come. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon responded to two posts on the official Kunark boards today.  Here's the first infobit:<UL>I am using a P200 with a Voodoo 1 card. Will I have any problems with RoK?<P><b><i>Your processor hits the minimum system specs, but you'll want to pick up a newer card (one with at least 8MB RAM) for the expansion zones.</b></i></UL>Here's the second:<UL>Assuming that we will not be able to download RoK, we will probably be receiving it on a CD. My question is: When will we get the CDs? Before or after the launch?<P><b><i>Our plan is to have the upgrade CDs in peoples hands a few days before launch.<P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

A new Patch Message was added to the servers today:<UL>March 29th, 7:00am<br>---------------------------<P>***TODAY'S PATCH***<P>This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to improve performance of the game engine in general.  No items, spawns, spells (with the exceptions below), etc., were changed as a result of this patch.  <P>- Area Effect "Fear" spells will no longer work in PvP.  This affects a bard song, as well as the Cleric "Wave of Fear" <P>spell.- Corrected a bug with some of the Resurrection spells that caused them to return too little experience. <P>We plan on publishing data and item changes next week if all goes well on the Test server.  We apologize to those who are inconvenienced by having to wait for the expected changes.<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

I received the following from John:<BLOCKQUOTE>     Tonight many brave souls wielding swords aflame did assemble to honor Faraday on achieving the holiest of weapons and to do battle with the corrupt guards of Freeport. This realm has been gray for me and many of my brothers for a very long time and today gave me a renewed sense of pride to both my class and the people of Norrath.  We assembled at the Temple of Marr and spent time talking to people we hadn't seen in a long while, posing for group shots while Faraday, Gorfan and I tried to think of a way to pull off what had never been done before. <P>     Breaking through the first gate we slew Effel and the various patrolling guards in front of the house, knowing our time would be short. Holding a line we beat down eight guards with few injuries to show for it. Faraday then stormed the house and drew out Jentry and Lucan. My brother engaged the foul priest while the main party attacked our target with passion and bravery. Effel returned to the fight behind us, slashing at my wife and I let loose a bellow and cut him down quickly. While Gorfan kept Jentry busy we cut down Lucan, ripping his testimony from his dead hands. <P>     Our objective had been made but we all had a gleam in our eyes. Smiling and nodding to each other we changed the house and did battle with Captain Hazran, cutting him down as he fled from our mass. Jentry raised many of the dead and we did have a pitched battle. Weaz and I were able to get Jentry away, he would be the crowning glory of the event. Szak joined us and we held him fast, raining blow after blow on him and then, near death, he did gate back to the house. <P>     Enraged with only Faraday, Gorfan, Farse and myself in any condition to do battle I charged into the house and tagged Jentry with a blow to lure him out. With a score of guards on me they were able to get him alone and eventually take him down so my weary legs could rest.<P>     It was an incredible event and it makes me proud to be a paladin. My thanks to all that attended. </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
