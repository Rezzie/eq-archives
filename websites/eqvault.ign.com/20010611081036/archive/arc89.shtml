Colors sent me an interesting report containing a response from eBay regarding the recent Verant announcement.  Here's his letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hello,<br><br>I have done a lot of business with eBay <br>selling EQ items from different servers.  I was really concerned when I had <br>heard rumors that somehow eBay sellers and/or buyers would be banned from <br>EQ.  I had even heard that Verant/Sony may actually have eBay start <br>retracting auctions, etc.  I decided to write eBay and see what they had to <br>say.  Here is their response...<br><br><i>"Thank you for contacting us about your concern in this situation.<br>The auctioning of Everquest items is currently being reviewed by Sony.<br>At this time such sales are not prohibited on eBay.  We appreciate your <br>concern in helping to keep eBay a safe and reputable forum in which to <br>conduct business.  As always, if you have a question or problem, please <br>contact us and we will gladly assist you."</i><br><br>So apparently, as of now, eBay will not stop the auctions of Everquest <br>items.<br><br>Thank You,<br><br>Colors!</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the report. It will be interesting to see what measures Verant will take with eBay concerning these auctions.

Here's today's round of Gordon Infobits, with a few Brad-bits in it as an added bonus:<UL><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030661.html"><b>Next Data Patch</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone know when the next data patch is due to go live? ]</i><P><b>The way it's looking, early next week. Sorry for the delay. - Brad McQuaid</b><br>--<br>I do respond to some posts that fast.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030480.html"><b>Problem with /who all? </b></a><br>We changed /who all to return a count in the event that the filter returns so many that it would result in a truncated list. It turns out that no one likes this, so we'll be changing it back.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030615.html"><b>Clerics, Invincibility and Stun</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Please explain the rationale behind the fact that when Clerics cast Divine Aura (or versions thereof), they are still able to be stunned by mobs. Is this an oversight or something not worth the effort to correct from a coding standpoint?]</i><P> It's purposeful. It falls under the "Nothing is perfect" idea. For instance, gate potions can fail, LOH can fizzle, Evac can leave some people behind, etc. <P><i>[Quote from original post: This was made like this on purpose for "game balance" which translates to... Verant wants you to die more, and doesn't give a flying frig what you think about that.]</i> <P>Well obviously we want your characters to die. What fun would the game be if that didn't happen? As for dying "more".... More than what? More than you would if you didn't get stunned? Sure, in the same fashion that you die more in South Ro because there are Sand Giants there. Incidently, you die LESS than you would if you didn't have the spell. Get my point?<P> <i>[Quote from original post: Maybe they should just give you complete invincibility for 1 hour.]</i><P>Yeah, we'll get right on that :)<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030627.html"><b>Researchers Unite </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I would like to propose a new item in everquest. It is a 16 slot container that holds nothing but research words. i find it troublesome that 90% of my bank space is filled with backpacks with nothing but research pages, and i hesitate to throw them away or sell them. You never know who will need them someday. <P>Perhaps make it weigh 20 lbs, I don't care, as long as it fits in my bank and I can read the words when I open the container and move it to the top of the screen (ie: it doesn't block the text space on the screen). ]</i><P>We've seen this suggested many times, and really don't have a problem with it, unfortunately the core engine can't support containers with a size over 10.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030634.html"><b>Why has Verant chosen to cave to the hackers and vocal minority? </b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Scanning my tasklist for hack programs is not that big of a deal and if it gets rid of the hackers anyway, I say go for it. IMO it is not an invasion of privacy to do this. I give out more information, personal information, everytime I use my credit card at the store ]</i><P>Unfortunately it is a case where paranoia ended up winning out. I think that we could definitely have done a better job explaining what it was we were doing, and that would have lead to a bit more buy-in. Instead, some people decided to make up reports that we were scanning directory trees (false), internet files (false), internet history (false), cookies (false), and email (false), and unfortunately many people believed them. <P>The general paranoia resulted from the assumption that we (meaning: our servers) were actively collecting information from your system. This simply wasn't the case. The client simply would examine a small subset of information on your system, none of it containing information personally identifiable to a third party, and only send it to our server in the event that you were "running" an illegal program at the same time you ran EQ. We had absolutely no interest in what was installed on your system, only what you were running when you connected to ours. <P>I think privacy is important as well, but I don't really care about what a piece of client software is doing on my system. I only care when that piece of client software is transmitting information from my system to an outside source. In this case, the only time any data transmission was to take place was when something bad was found by the client. There was to be no server-side analysis of raw data. I'm sure that most people would agree that we do have a right to insure that our software license is being complied with. <P>In any case, I guess it's water under the bridge now. I'll blame Hollywood for all of the misunderstandings.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030654.html"><b>Privacy Issues, Hackers</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I've noticed that the hackers are the first people to cry foul about privacy but they don't mind breaking into systems and stealing data that doesn't belong to them. ]</i><P>Funny how that works, isn't it?<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030658.html"><b>Spoilers - What classes will the Iksar be?</b></a><br>I understand that you want to know, but its always been our policy to let people find things out for themselves. We never announced the classes that any of the races could be before release, and though this information turned up on sites anway, we didn't comment on it. <P>We're just sick that way :)<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030646.html"><b>Level 50 and Beyond Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: I know you mentioned it before last month, that experience gainned for level 50 will not be taken away when the expansion takes affect. However, my friends dont seem to believe me and the post you answered concerning this on 08MARCH cant be accessed. Can you please reconfirm that no experience gainned in level 50 will be taken away when the expansion takes affect? ]</i><P>We won't be taking away any experience points. The only possible thing that could happen is if we adjust the experience required for level-50 prior to release. This is very unlikely, but I won't go so far as to call it impossible. Assuming that we don't adjust the experience curve for level 50, we fully expect many people to hit level 51 within minutes of logging on the day of release.<br>--<br><b>No exp was removed -- exp was recalculated, sometimes making it the exp bar at level 50 appear lower. - Brad McQuaid</b><P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030480.html"><b>Looking For a Few Good Sites</b></a><br>We're currently looking for a few cool EQ sites to list in the "Featured Site" section of the www.verant.com website. We are specifically looking for little-known sites that are updated regularly, contain tasteful content, and good art. If you know of a cool site that fits these requirements, please email me at gwrinn@verant.com. Please use the subject line of "Cool EQ Site" and place the URL in the body of the message to insure that I can view it. <br>--<br>I should clarify that we aren't looking for mainstream news sites (sorry guys, but you get enough publicity as it is:) and also aren't looking for sites that specialize in information that we would consider spoilers. <b>(Note from Aurum: Blast it! ;-))</b><P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030476.html"><b>Rules of Banking</b></a><br>Bankers (NPCs that you right-click on to open your bank account) have been in game since the earliest phases of beta. But it doesn't appear that that is who you are talking about. <P>Now it appears that you may be talking about players that exchange small coin denominations for larger ones, such as taking the 2000 silver off of someone in exchange for a lesser value of platinum. Assuming that this is what you are speaking of, you just need to find someplace notorious for generating large amounts of inferior coinage. The Treants in SK come to mind.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030439.html"><b>Intelligamer Editorial</b></a><br>I was very pleased to see that the news sites looked a bit deeper before responding to the grass-roots email drive by the 26 or so people who were participating in it.

ANY PET USER with sow or jboots can solo him u just run away while pet rips him a new one for 10 minits]</i><P> Thanks for the heads-up. We'll check into it. <P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030371.html"><b>More on +Mana Topic</b></a><br>Well I was able to track down some additional information that I don't mind distributing. The benefit of +mana items is scaled to reduce the impact of twinking in certain circumstances. I can't give you the formula, but I can say that if you load up your level 1 guy with +300 in mana items, he doesn't have 300 more mana. <P>The benefit that you can receive from a +mana item is based upon your total natural mana. <P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028242.html"><b>Gordon Responds to Guild Command Ideas</b></a><br>Definitely some good ideas. I agree that some more robust guild-management commands would help things go more smoothly. I'll check into what may or may not be possible given the current archetecture. Currently, the server's do not keep track of players who are offline, so it could present some problems. We'll see what we can do, but no guarantees at this time.<P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029179.html"><b>More Odus Zones Coming</b></a><br>We have a few more zones planned for Odus, but it's too soon to comment on them at this time.

Do they still cause XP-loss on Rallos? What server do you speak of?<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, there are still circumstances where you do, in fact, lose exp in a duel on a normal server. Case in point, 3 duels last weekend by myself and 5 others, all 3 of us are lvl 50 and lost exp upon death.]</i><P>Yeah, I can see this happening on some servers in a duel. DOTs are scored as environmental kills, such as drowning. These cause XP-loss on most servers, but not on the PvP servers due to the customer service issues there. It's currently on our plate to normalize that across all servers.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Unfortunately, I believe a few spell lines were missed. I have not tested them all, but here are two I am sure of]</i><P>I mentioned in another thread yesterday that these were addressed on the Test server. They should work the next time we patch. <P></UL>

The article recalls the events that lead to the recent announcement and adds some commentary on it as well.  Here's an excerpt: <UL>EverQuest is one of the most popular "massively multiplayer" games now on the market. Like peers Ultima Online or Asharon's Call, it creates an online world in which tens of thousands of players can interact at once. <br><br>But the game's developers were concerned about unauthorized software that apparently gave some players extra information that they could use to take advantages of others, or even try to disrupt the game's servers. <br><br>In a message to players yesterday, the company said it was changing its game software to include a small program that would identify these "hacking" programs when players tried to use them. </UL>To read the complete article please use the link provided in the above.

I just received a letter from Verant CEO John Smedley regarding the new policies and security checks announced yesterday.  Here's the complete letter:<UL><i>Ok. We put the poll in, and with roughly 15,000 people participating thepoll came up with 83% of the people being fine with us running the check forcheating.<P>DESPITE THIS POLL we have decided that it's the wrong thing to do. Enoughpeople have convinced us that it's chipping away a little too much atpeople's privacy EVEN if they do consent for us to implement this policy.<P>Therefore, the change to the EULA will read as follows:<P>Solely for the purpose of patching and updating the Game, you hereby grantus permission to (i) upload Game file information from the Everquestdirectory and (ii) download Game files to you.<P>Now, before anyone wonders exactly what this is, let me explain. Technicallyspeaking we probably should have had this language in there from day one foryou to consent us to even download new game files to you in the first place.We apologize for not realizing that we should have gotten this consent, butlive and learn.<P>We can admit when we make mistakes, and I believe this is a case where weowe an apology to our Playerbase. In our haste to try and thwart people fromdamaging the game we went overboard.<P>There will be absolutely no scanning of anyones computer for any reasonother than the normal patching process (which won't do any sort of checkingon what you have running).<P>Regards,<P>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>Thanks John!

The following report was sent in by Golgi:<BLOCKQUOTE>A faint laughter can be heard upon the rising wind, a husky voice, filled with hatred and disgust.<br> <br>The voice grows from gentle laughter to a roaring shout, "Children of Scale!  You shall not succeed this night.  I shall make sure of it!  For centuries, you have evaded me!"<br> <br>"Now, this shall end.  Everything that you possess... is but a waste!"<br> <br>The voice dies down again, but the wind rages on, swaying the few burned trees which line the firey mountains, their trunks creaking beneath the very force of wind.<br> <br>As silence descends, the voice begins to speak again, it's tone filled with mocking endeaderment.<br> <br>The voice cries, "Your names, your faces and your very ways shall fade from view.  Such a pity it is indeed, that the world shall know my name, and that of your Queen's fall from history and of the Gods and Mortals alike!"<br> <br>The shadows quickly retreat back to the corners and stones from which they came, their tendrils rising in the air and the sound of a thousand shrieks echo across the Lavastorm Mountains.<br> <br>As the shadows slither away from view, the voice can be heard, faintly hissing foul words.<br> <br>"You have evaded me this day, Children of Scale, but it shall not be the last battle which you will face!"<br> <br>"Rend your viel and harness your power, it shall do nothing for you, as in the end, you all shall perish, dragon and mortals alike, your corpses shall rot at my feet.  For this, I can asure you."<br> <br>"Untill that night comes, I bid thee all a good morrow, and watch your back.."

Following the example of Brad McQauid, Gordon Wrinn made a huge post full of nothing but questions followed by their answers on the Gameplay board.  Here's the first part of his post:<UL><I>Hello all, <P>I went through Brad&#8217;s answers from this weekend and pulled out a few things to comment on. For a few of them, I also copied Brad&#8217;s original response, signified by a &#8220;**&#8221; after my quote marks (>>> ). Sorry this is so late, today has been a vicious meeting day. I had to step out of one that was still going on just to do this :)<P>-Gordon</i></UL>Once again due to the large size of the post I have moved a copy of the post to the Interview page:<UL><LI><A href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid954903028,25472,">Abashi Q&A</a></UL>Enjoy!

Gordon, as always, has been busy on the Gameplay board.  The following list contains all his most recent posts over the last 24 hours:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030344.html"><b>Enchanter Illusions</a></b><br>I disagree that the current illusions aren't useful. I see many an enchanter running around illusioned as something from time to time. <P>That's one of the reasons that we added bonuses to the various illusions, to make them useful.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030380.html"><b>Real-Money Auctions and Platinum</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: "You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."  This could be interpreted to disallow in-game sales, which is clearly not the intent. Is the intent to allow out of game sales for in game goods? Platinum only auctions for example?]</i><P>Exchange of items for platinum doesn't constitute a "sale" from a legal standpoint. You're simply playing the game. <P>It is not our intent to interfere with the player economy.<P><LI><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030304.html">Has a Verant employee played a character all the way to level 50?</a></b><br>This question keeps coming up and the answer is yes. I know of one person here who has played a troll SK to 50, several who have played rogues, a few more who have played warriors. I'm sure there is a monk or two running around as well. <P>I think that some people think that "if only a dev team member would play my class, we'd be better". That might be true if it weren't for the ability of our game designers to distance themselves from the typical class-envy traps and overcome bias. If anything, perhaps some of the class-experiences encountered by people here led to the class becoming more difficult overall. For instance, I find it a bit humorous when some necromancers complain about how weak they are, since I *know* that it is not the case. I'm sure similar things happen in regards to the other classes.<br>--<br>A couple of people play on the Test server, but most play on Live servers. <br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: Why does my KICK sometimes do MORE damage than my Executioner's axe?  Com'on now, a little realism couldn't hurt.]</i><br>Hmmm, not sure how this ended up in this thread, but I'll bite :)  I imagine it would be possible to just barely knick someone with an axe, but land a kick square in the vitals. Seems realistic enough.<P><LI><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030317.html">Kunark, Skills and More</a></b><br>We've compensated for the problems with sense/disarm traps in different ways that balance the class. As much as we'd like to remove all traces of the sense/disarm trap skills, they are in the character files and therefore can't just be yanked out. "Climbing" wouldn't work out well since the world is already designed taking into account the locations that a player can or cannot reach. As for "Negotiation", the prices of items are already modified in regards to charisma.<br>--<br>We have added subsequent effects to skills. For instance, Crippling Blow has a chance to stun the opponenet. As for additional effects, we'll consider them as we have a need for additional abilities and skills.<br>--<br>Most of the new graphics/textures are based upon world geometry and objects in the Kunark lands, not on mobile objects that travel between the two. As such you won't have a need to see the majority of the new art if you don't purchase Kunark. As for the mobile stuff, you should be able to see all of that without a problem.<br>--<br><i>[Any new classes soon?]</i> Nothing planned at present.<br>--<br>When you choose your deity, you are determining the way your character ran his or her life prior to you gaining control over it (from an RP standpoint). From a gameplay standpoint, this is another case where we had to make a choice, and that choice was that religion would be both useful and balanced. In order to balance usefulness, there must be a downside associated with it. As such, NPCs can see through your religion.<br>--<br><i>[Any male models with long hair on the way?]</i> No. Hair is part of the character model, and long hair was only built on to the female models. It is for all intents and purposes an extra appendage. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030314.html"><b>Do you know about the disease/poison based DoT's not giving a message when they wear off? </b></a><br>Yes, it's fixed on test already.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030301.html"><b>Gordon Responds to Guide Account Auction</b></a><br>My money is on it being a scam. The person doing the auction doesn't have any feedback, so any fool with a keyboard could post the same thing. Secondly, guide accounts do not have any abilities that would allow them to obtain the items listed. Thirdly, GM accounts attempting to create the listed items would noted *very* quickly. <P>Just a hint, don't believe everything you read on the internet.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030303.html"><b>Hardware Issues</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Why did Verant release a "fix" that requires us to change the settings on our machines, thereby crippling the defining feature of the Sound Blaster Card?]</i><P> It's not a fix, it's a work-around designed to help you get by while our people here conference with Creative Labs and come up with a solution. <P><i>[Quote from original post: We no longer hear Environmental Audio with the acceleration turned down, so couldn't Verant simply revert the drivers to before the patch went in?]</i><P> No, part of the problem is that as new hardware drivers are released, the software has to maintain compatibility. Because EQ is a multiplayer game that is constantly evolving, we can't just make like a single-player game and say that the new drivers are unsupported. The release of the new LiveWare made going back impossible. <i>[Quote from original post: Will you actually fix this problem in the near future, or is this work around satisfactory with Verant?]</i><P> We don't consider the work-around to be sufficient and have someone working nearly full-time on resolving the issues. <P><li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030297.html"><b>Trade Skill Suggestion</b></a><br>Though a good idea, the current system of EQ wouldn't support this well as we would run into the problem mentioned by ksandjh (buying experience with Plat). I am aware that this problem exists a few places in game as it, and it isn&#8217;t very pretty. This is something that we can keep in mind for the future though.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030291.html"><b>Mages' Pets</b></a><br>Though I'm sure many mages would "like to see" the pets enhanced, we feel that they are fairly well-balanced at this point.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030295.html"><b>Permanent Death Debate</b></a><br>Wow! I haven't seen this argument since about March of 97. It's nice to see one of the good ole' ones come back once in a while :)<P>I do think that most people will agree now that EQ really wouldn't support permanent death very well. Actually I don't think that it will ever be supported well in any MMORPG. MMORPGs are about risk, reward, and character development. I think that in order to maintain some facet of character development, you'd have to make death so rare that there would be no risk. At that time, the whole concept of the game falls apart.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030262.html"><b>Reason for Lack of Auto-Equip Loot Feature</b></a><br>Back in beta when you right-clicked on items on your corpse you would auto-equip the items. I believe it was changed to add an aspect of realism to looting your corpse. Sure, it doesn't take the 30 minutes it would really take to climb into a suit of plate, but it isn't exactly instantaneous either.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030256.html"><b>How can we test things we can't see?</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: How can we test something we can't see? You've told us time and time again that some things are supposed to be a secret (like mana) so the "mystery of the game" is kept intact. ]</i><P>Someone obviously felt that they had enough information to propose that +mana items weren't giving their full mana, so I figured that perhaps they weren't the only ones. In any case, +mana items give the stated amount of mana regardless of race or class (confirmed today), so the question is moot anyway. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030260.html"><b>Blackburrow, not Butcherblock</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original message: Someone at Verant, please acknowledge the fact that you have accidentally turned on the flag for the wrong "BB" zone, and it makes no sense for people to Shrink in Butcherblock instead of Blackburrow. That's it. That's all.]></i><P>We're checking into this, but I think it's fairly safe to say that someone got their BB's mixed up when the zone headers were being inputed. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028990.html"><b>More on Enchanters</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: Will enchanters get a comment about their issues anytime soon? This week, this month, this year? Ever?]</i><P> It's a bit of a loaded question, but post some "enchanter issues" and I'll see what I can do. I will warn you however that we consider the classes in general very well-balanced at this time.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029697-2.html"><b>Is Rallos Zek Being Ignored?</b></a><br>You aren't being ignored, you just aren't receiving the focus. We chose to aim our efforts at Tallon/Vallon because both of those servers came up at the same time with the same rules. This provided a good foundation to determine whether or not the changes that we made were effective in making PvP better by examining the population differential between those two servers. <P>Making the changes on Rallos wouldn't really have told us too much.<br>--<br><i>[Quote from original post: People stayed, despite COIN ONLY. And people stay on Valon Despite Item loot. Both flawed systems. But we prevail for other reasons, which have little to with with a "successful pvp" system. ]</i><P>This is the reason that we intend on letting people switch between Tallon and Vallon after the expansion, to determine which method people *actually* perfer. <P><i>[Quote from original post: You'll see VERY VERY little support for COIN only are Naked PvP item loot. You'll see a compromise from many players wanting some measure of exp loss. Thems the facts.]</i><P> Sure, and the people posting in the PvP forum aren't representative of the people playing on the PvP servers. They are by definition the people who are generally unhappy with the system, or people who want to enact some kind of change, hence their presense on the boards. It's just the way these boards work. <P>My studies suggest that though people believe that there should be some risk, they wouldn't buy into a system where death caused XP loss. Now if we could find a way to reasonably poll just the PvP players, we could find out what the players as a whole really want in those regards.<P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/025541-5.html"><b>Bug List</b></a><br>I've referred this thread to the test team to be sure that the bugs listed are in our bug database. One thing I would like everyone to keep in mind is that just because you don't like something doesn't mean that it's a bug. For instance, the /con system. It is intended that as you level a balanced group is assumed for the /con message in many cases. <P>There are also other cases where things perceived and admitted to be bugs might be passed on when deciding whether or not to fix it. Things that would require an excessivly large download (like graphics or world geometry problems) are a good example of this. <P><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030032.html"><b>Whitened Treant Fists</b></a><br><i>[Quote from original post: If Monks are made to rely on very little, equipment wise, then why is there a weapon that is better than our own 2 hands?]</i> <P>Because it wouldn't have made much sense to put a weapon out there that's worse than your own two hands. No one would use it. I guess you are really going to be upset when you find out that there's two weapons out there actually better than this one. <P><i>[Quote from original post: I'm not trying to be sarcastic. It just baffles me why you have done this.]</i> <P>Why do you think we named them the Whitened Treant Fists? :)</UL>Also, you may have noticed I did the infobits in a slightly different format.  If people prefer the new format please post a comment so I know I'm not wasting time.

I just receive an important letter from Verant President John Smedley addressing several of EverQuest's major issues. Topics included in this letter are Kunark, login server changes, ShowEQ and hacking and eBay. It is now forbidden to auction EverQuest acounts and items on eBay for money. Here's the letter:<UL><I>Dear EverQuest Players,<P>An exciting time is now at hand. Within the next 2 days the Login Serverswill be coming down and we will be doing a patch that will add the EverQuestStore into the front end of the game. At that time, the first product we will be offering will bethe EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark (RoK) upgrade for existing customers. This will allow existingcustomers of EverQuest to purchase RoK for $16.95 (Plus S&H). In addition, we will offer variousshipping options depending on which country you live in. EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark will be launchingon April 24th. We want to insure that this product is in everybody's hands on or before that date.<P>In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User Agreement andSoftware License to add in some additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone toagree to before playing EverQuest.<P>The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest Characters andItems outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the text of this change:<P>"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin orcopyrighted material."<P>You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons, but first andforemost of them is the amount of trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there area lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it, and we don'thave the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next reason is amore philosophical one and that is that we believe people should have to earn their items and characters in thegame rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued from otherperspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours.<P>The next change to the User Agreement and Software license concerns ourefforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as anongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Withoutgetting into the specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's harddrive(aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that auser is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending information about everything the user is running back to ourservers).<P>It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ"  isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can allow in a game like EverQuestwhere it affects other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, althoughthis is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't the worstoffender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring down our servers withanother malicious program. We were able to quickly identify what was goingon and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless the potential isthere and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these types ofprograms. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send any information back tothe Everquest servers other than information regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intendedoperation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's going to beneccessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those ofyou concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel it'sneccessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going totry these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players.<P>Here is the text of this change:<P>"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files toyou. You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload(i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii)data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion,determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest."<P>Thanks,<P>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</I></UL>Very big needs indeed. Thanks John!

Suineko sent me the following report of a GM event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Long ago, while working my rounds purging the temple in the Feerott of<br>Thules scaled worshippers I heard news of another scaled beast via<br>the bards of Norrath... A singer had been seen in steamfont, accompanied<br>by a dragon, and she told of Veeshans coming return. <br><br>Again, word flew the taverns and bars of the world, and it was told that<br>she and her dragon had been slain at the hands of Mayongs man, who<br>then sent a pawn to the hell hole known as Dagnors Cauldron to employ<br>a dwarf of almost godlike skills to retrieve an... item... from the<br>ice Wyrms lair, Lady voxs own private treasures.<br><br>When for a third time rumblings of the scales awakening reached by ears<br>I abandoned by Crusade against the heretic lizards, and joined my<br>companions in a rush to Permafrost. We arrived to find a young, frail<br>rogue leading a High elven Lady of beautiful elegance and her company<br>of guards, trolls and the like, deep within permafrost to Vox's<br>nest... where we found the Dwarven rogue making his way out, carrying<br>a shard whos loss had raised the Dragons ire such that her screams<br>and roars shook the walls and caused the ice of the caverns itself<br>to fall.<br><br>The rogue, skilled as he was, was flushed with his success and<br>fearful of Mayongs temper, and wished to leave quickly. That fear, perhaps,<br>his downfall, as the Lady we were with began to seduce him, flattering<br>his skills, speaking of his feat, until at last she held the Shard<br>in her hands for "just a moment". She did not lie, for that moment ws<br>all it took to seal the dwarfs doom as her guards moved with inhuman<br>speed and slew him.<br><br>Vox roared again. Her goblins cowered. The intruders in her realm had<br>her treasure and vanished before she could rally her still considerable<br>might. One of the less... bright of the races in the Ladys guard let<br>slip a few words, enough to lead us to the Rathe mountains.<br><br>We arrived to see a Dragon, blue as the sky, its wings stretched<br>in triumph over the mysterious company. As we hurried to its place<br>we caught the Lady thanking her guide, the rogue, as two more of her<br>company shed their forms and took on wings... 2, then 3 dragons<br>soared above us, exultant in their triumph, the shard itself a shard<br>of Veeshans own claws, a relic of great power.<br><br>As she thanked the rogue, shadows gathered. Mayong, his prize torn<br>from his grasp had not been idle as the dragons wheeled in the sky.<br><br>Suddenly one fell, followed swiftly by its comrades, as the Undead<br>lord who aspires to godhood slew all those he could see in the air.<br>The lady, still concealed from him in elven form although doubtless<br>a Child of Veeshan herself, spoke swiftly to the rogue.<br><br>A sacrifice was required. Blood of one of the lesser children to open<br>the plane of sky and allow Veeshans kin ingress to slay those who would<br>usurp her and their rightful place on the world. He would die, of his<br>own choice, by the shard, and rise again as their champion, soul claimed<br>by the Wyrm Queen.<br><br>Despite my fears, and warnings, the rogue took this path, perhaps<br>flattered by the celestial attentions, perhaps hungry for reward and<br>power, maybe even merely fearful of the consequence should he refuse.<br><br>But he accepted, and the shard turned in his hands and slew him. When<br>he rose he was known as the Claw of the Scale. The remaining children<br>of Veeshan fled then before mayong could penetrate their cloak, and<br>left their new catspaw on Norrath, the shard still in his possession.<br><br>War is brewing, and this time I need no bards to tell me of its<br>consequence. Two sides, neither with the interests of the free peoples<br>at heart, struggle now for dominance, Mayong who pledged the death of<br>dragons and mortals all alike, and Veeshans children, returning to claim<br>the surface of Norrath from the usurpers who walk on two legs.<br><br>Be careful who you aid friends. Our fates are in the balance, and before<br>long we may find our only defence against these powers is in unity<br>ourselves. There may not be reward in refusing to serve these powers<br>beyond freedom for ourselves, but that is a powerful thing itself.<br><br>The gateway to Veeshans domain, the plane of sky, is crumbling and<br>this blood sacrifice may have torn it entirely asunder.<br><br>Mayongs power now extends far beyond the boundarys of his citadel, a<br>location perhaps more feared even than the lairs of the Ring of Scales<br>outcasts.<br><br>Do not mistake beauty for goodness friends. Be wary, and fearful.<br><br>OOC: <br>A GM event on Bertoxxulous. It was good, and nicely played, but packed.<br>As usual there were crowd control problems - I think maybe GM's should<br>be given an AE sit down and shut up audience spell or something ;) - but<br>it went off pretty well. I missed the beginning and a bit in the<br>middle as I travelled the long way from permafrost to Rathe, but its<br>mostly in there I think.<br><br>We also possibly missed the end on Bertie - finally too many people had<br>gathered, some intent on disrupting the play, and the GM characters left<br>some threads hanging that they obviously intended to finish. I think<br>we pretty much got it all though.<br><br>I'd post the logs but I kept getting disconnected so they're kind of<br>scrapp; overall a few ice giants were killed but this was mostly a<br>non-participation event, like a play staged for us.<br><br>And the three dragons were awesome ;)<br><br>Love,<br><br>Suineko<br>Suiddaru Fallenstar, 36th ranger and wannabe cyclops, Bertoxxulous</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

In regards to a new real-money auction a popular EQ site recently launched, Gordon Wrinn had the following to say about EverQuest.com's support of the feature: <UL><i>In short, one of the people who post news items figured that this one was OK since the auction specified that it was for exchange in Platinum, without knowing that the site in question also hosts auctions for real cash. We've since removed the news item and apologize to anyone offended.<br><br>Our position is that we do not support or condone the exchange of items, platinum, or accounts, for cash. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

A <a href="http://www.intelligamer.com/admin/editor11.asp">unique editorial</a> was published recently by Intelligamer.  This focuses on the "Vocal Minority" of EverQuest.  It explores several apsect of this crowd, including that of the board scene.  Here's a quote from this article:<UL>If this is all you ever read about the game, you'd get the impression that the game was incredibly bad and that you should have nothing whatsoever to do with it. But that's not the case at all. The real situation is that a very vocal, very passionate, and really very small group of players has taken it upon themselves to tell Verant how to design, upgrade, and fix the game. They do this at high volume as often as they can in as many ways, shapes and sizes as they can. And the truly amazing thing about all this is that the very same people who hate the game, hate the developer and will go out of their way to tell everyone in the world their opinion also continue to play the game day in and day out.<br><br>At last count Everquest has more than 200,000 active subscribers, most of whom play daily. That's 200,000 people paying $10 a month. You'd figure that if the game really sucked that that number would be falling. But it isn't. It keeps rising, even in the face of new competition from Asheron's Call.<br><br>A lot of people have said that because you invest so much time in a game like Everquest you tend to get passionate about what you like and dislike. And you tend not to want to take the drastic step of canceling your account after the, literally, weeks or months of your life you invested in improving your character. All true enough.</UL>To read the rest of the editorial use the link provided above.

With the redesign out of the way I wanted to let all the artists who have sent in their artwork over the past few months know that I will be stepping up work on all art sections.  <br><br>I'll try to go at a pace of one new art piece per day until I catch up.  <br><br>Today's new piece is titled the "Enchantress" by John Cressman.  As you'll notice on the new <a href="/features/artwork">Featured Artwork</a> page that we have a slightly different format showing more information about the artists.<br><br>Thanks for being patient! :)

Verant VP Brad McQuaid responded to a post claiming that the time it takes to load a zone has decreaed recently.  Here's his post from the Gameplay board:<UL><i>Actually, yes. We recently made some optimizations to the way data is transfered to clients when you zone. We were honestly unsure as to how detectable the optimization would be, which is why we didn't get too specific, so I'm glad to hear it's helped at least a few people.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>Good news for all!

Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Verant Interactive, tried a daring experiment last weekend.  Here's his announcement straight from the Gameplay board courtesy of Anders:<ul><i>I want to try something. I don't know if it will work well, but what the heck. <p>I want to spend some time today answering questions. Let me lay down some guidelines on the questions though: <p>1. Keep them short -- one or two sentences max. Short, succinct, to the point, etc. <p>2. No nasty flames, loaded questions, veiled insults, etc. <p>3. Nothing situationally or contextually too specific. Keep questions to a more general level. No 'why does item (or quest or spell) a with stats b & c vary from item d'. To be honest, I don't know a lot of the game at that level of detail (no one person can, and my job is to understand the game as a whole more than to have memorized every quest, spell, and item), and that's not what I want to focus on here anyway. <p>Keep the questions at more of a global level. Ask me about the Vision(TM), or the philosophies behind game mechanics, etc. Maybe we can put together a FAQ IF this works out (I know stephenmcleod tried to do something like this recently). I think the key here is to keep the questions short and the answers fairly short as well. My answers will be pretty blunt and matter-of-factly as opposed to responding with a detailed essay. <p>I will try to answer as many questions as I can. This is really an experiment to see if I can be of some assistance in explaining issues, positions, viewpoints, etc. I can't guarantee I will get to every question, nor will I be able to focus on this thread after tonight. <p>Also, in addition to being unable to answer the really specific item/quest/spell questions, I may also be unable to answer some questions about the future (for example, what all will the EQ team work on post-expansion, or will there be an EQ 2, etc.) or about areas that we've chosen to keep private (for example, what is the exact topology of an EQ server). <p>Anyway, enough disclaimers and explanations. Let's give this a shot :)<p>-Brad</i></ul>Brad must have used up a couple of keyboards during this experiement.  I can't post the complete Q&A sessions just because of how large each of them is.  So instead, I've copied the posts and added them to our new Lore Article Database in the <a href="/lore/interviews">Interview</a> section:<UL><LI><a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid954792180,57314,">Brad McQuaid Q&A #1</a><LI><a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid954792189,80089,">Brad McQuaid Q&A #2</a><LI><a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid954792345,4305,">Brad McQuaid Q&A #3</a></UL>Enjoy the reading. :)
