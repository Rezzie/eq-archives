From Kitt:<BLOCKQUOTE>     Just to pass along, got my new issue of PC Gamer, and there is an <br>article on all the new Multi-player games in the works down the line. Also in <br>the issue is an article that seems to take issue with Verant over the "cease <br>and desist order " given on an Everquest MOD called "EQ Macros" in the <br>"eyewitness" section. While the article seems to laud the programmer over the <br>program, I see it as probably the way Verant does, its a cheat to make things <br>easier for one individual over another who does not have the program. Just my <br>2-cents on it, but guess you probably already know about this by now, but <br>just in case you don't <br><br>Kitt Crimsonfeather, Druid, Karana server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

I wanted to quickly point out an <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1765_1.html">interview Daily Radar did today with Verant's Kevin McCann</a>.  For those who don't know, this month's issue of PC Gamer contained the unveiling of Verant's Planetside, a game Verant is billing as the world's first persistent massively multiplayer first person shooter.  Here's an excerpt:<UL><b>Daily Radar: Tell us about Planetside. What's the setup for the game? What's going to draw players in?</b><br><br>Kevin McCann: We're aiming to create a massively multiplayer tactical first-person shooter. Versus an RPG, the storyline plays less of a role because I'm trying to make sure that the game stays true to what it's trying to be -- a first-person shooter. We have some role-playing, but it's very light. People aren't going to be coming in here to socialize, they're going to come in to fight.<br><br>In the game, you'll ally yourself with one of four corporations, which are sort of your top level causes. They give you job assignments, character growth opportunity and professional advancement. <br> <br>You have access to abilities and implants as you advance. These are more like support skills. They don't impact you actual reflex performance -- you're not getting more hit points, you're not necessarily getting auto-aim. This is a first-person shooter, so you don't want players having an unfair advantage. There are, for example, electronic skills which allow you to hack into terminals or gain certain medical abilities.</UL>For screenshots and the rest of the interview <a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1765_1.html">click here</a>.

Bishoopugget sent me the following letter:<BLOCKQUOTE>Queen Velazul Di'zok slain on Luclin!  (11/5/2000)<br><br>In what will be remembered as the epitome of teamwork and skill, a multi-guild raid fought it's way through the entire line of royalty within Chardok.  With the expert pulling of Wang and Khato of Apex, we made it to the Overking and bested him just 90 minutes after entering Chardok.  After such a flawless raid we decided that a full coffin corpse retrieval would be acceptable in the pursuit of knowledge and experience against the previously untouched Queen of Chardok.  Needless to say, 20 seconds after our battle with the Queen started it ended with her own death cry and the cheers of many of the finest guilds of Luclin.<br><br>A hearty congratulations to all the guilds and players at this unforgettable event.<br><br>Bishoopugget<br>Pappanug of the Nuggets of Justice</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

While I agree that it would make sense for the 59th pet to do better than the 49th pet (which I believe it does under most circumstances, even if it is close), this is a case where the 49th is stronger than it should be as opposed to the 59th being weaker.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028054.html"><b>Velious Ad Mistake</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Saw this mentioned in a thread about a week ago.

Its a BUG that they dont and completely makes the skill useless in any bad situation with casters.]</i></font> <br><br>While I know some will disagree, this is how it is intended to work. Once an NPC begins casting a spell, only a stun will stop them. Even if you die mid-cast, the spell will still go off on a corpse. <br><br>It's one of the vulnarabilities of Feign.</UL>

Menuven sends the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>     An army of men and women converged in three areas of the land of <br>Norrath this eve.  Specters of great power loomed, the gods of our world <br>taking semi-mortal form to test our mettle.  Three times they were defeated.  <br>Three times they rose again.  Until the final battle, in the forest of <br>Nektulos, where the Ghost of the dead God Atrulen hovered over the masses, <br>and screamed its last cry of death, but also of thanks. <br><br>      As this god graduated to higher positions, he left behind many tokens. <br><br> Multiple items were left by his cohorts.  These minions of doom terrorized, <br>but were felled by the might of many on the Tribunal.  All Hail God Atruelen, <br>and may you rest in peace, as you leave this plane of existence. <br><br><br>      /OOC: <br>      Tonight (November 3-4), GM Atruelen left the Tribunal.  He has a new <br>job now, but many will miss him. <br><br>      In his final event, multiple high level specters and other creatures, <br>controlled by other GMs and Guides, fought.  No experience was gained or <br>lost, as far as most could tell (although some claim otherwise), but all had <br>fun.  Wizards and druids were kept VERY busy teleporting dead people back, <br>and never once did they charge. <br><br>      Although I only attended the last third of the event (as I did not <br>know the rest had occurred), the amazing power of these things was <br>astounding.  Yon To, a skeletal shadow knight, kept things interesting along <br>with a fellow Skeletal Paladin, as they dueled, and killed PCs by the <br>hundreds.  The Planes hardly compared to the carnage at the Wizard Pyramid in <br>Nektulos Forest.  A plot for the regular person would be to zone in, see Yon <br>To, live long enough for him to cast once or twice on you, and then return to <br>home point, only to try it again. <br><br>      Eventually, these two were slain.  Miggn was the name of the Paladin, <br>I believe. <br><br>      Then, Atruelen's Ghost arose.  It took a substantially less amount of <br>time for this one to be killed, as everyone was coordinated into a myriad of <br>groups. <br><br>      I died once, and had time to TP back into WC, and run back.  In the <br>end, I landed the final blow, and since there was no loot rules for this, got <br>the loot before any realized it was dead.  (No, I did NOT Ninja-loot) <br>      In any event, dropped was the following: <br><br>      Bracer of Scavenging <br>      Mithril Breastplate <br>      Mithril 2-Handed Sword <br>      Bag of the Sewn Evil Eye <br>      Cobalt Boots <br>      Hammerhead Helm <br><br>      Menuven <br>      The Tribunal <br>      (Dragon2120@aol.com) <br><br>      P.S.  Good Luck, Atruelen.  We'll miss you!! </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the news!

Kgar informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>On Thursday Nov. 2nd on Saryrn, there was a GM hosted event.<br><br>It took place in OOT at the sister island docks.<br><br>There were many Mermaids at the docks coxing people to go in the water and<br>swim with them and play with them.  <br><br>Upon doing so many people where attacked by the playful mermaids.<br><br>The mermaids were GM run and thus would interact and talk to you and giggle<br>at you and in general seem to want to have some fun.<br><br>Some of those on shore did what MOST EQ players would do.. saw them then<br>ATTACKED them.. so its no wonder they defended themselves and killed many of<br>those that attacked.<br><br>They even attacked Hava a level 20 Guide and spanked him a few times.. and<br>even killed him one time hehe.<br><br>It was a GREAT ROLE PLAYING event<br><br>I feel that many more could have had fun if they did not resort to trying to<br>KILL the mermaids at the FIRST option..   as soon as the mermaids where<br>noticed OOCs to the zone went out to come group and KILL them all.<br><br>Many items where taken from them the 3 I know of are EB mace, EE bag and<br>Ruined Circlet.    I received both an EE bag and a Circlet for being nice to<br>the mermaids and swimming with them and dancing and in general having fun in<br>the role playing event.. and for trying to protect them.  The rest of the<br>items taken at the event, I believe, were taken off the corpses of the poor<br>mermaids.<br><br><br>Kgar (my ogre shaman, 52) had lots of fun at the event in the form of role<br>playing.  Here is a bit of what happened.  <br><br><br>I heard people in the area calling out that mermaids where a the docks and<br>to come see what was going on.  I ran over to see what was and noticed about<br>7 mermaids near shore by the docks.<br><br>I asked the ladies what they where doing and they asked me to go swimming<br>with them.  I was not sure what all they wanted, so I tried to talk to them<br>more..  Allwett smiled at me and giggled and waved at me and blew me a<br>kiss..  so I jumped in the water to play with the nice ladies.  It would<br>seem however that Splash did not like ogres smelling up the water and<br>slapped me around pretty good.  Seeing as she did not seem to want me in the<br>water I got out.  All the mermaids where giggling and dancing and having<br>fun.  I tried to explain I was a nice ogre and would not hurt them.  They<br>(as well as those others on shore of course would never believe an ogre is<br>nice or kind) did not believe me and when I came close to the water again<br>Splashy blew me a big kiss (knocked me back half way across the island and<br>stunned me for a good 2 minutes).. what a kiss!!!  After that I went back to<br>the waters edge and talked to them some more.  In general they mermaids<br>still wanted me to play with them in the water.  I was about to go back in<br>when some Necro attacked one of the mermaids.  I of course jumped up and did<br>my best to help the poor mermaid.  I healed her as best I could and she,<br>with her sisters managed to fight off the necros pet and force the necro<br>away from the shore.<br><br>The necro was very made at me for helping the ladies.  I guess he had<br>nothing but greed and evil in his heart and tried to kill another one of the<br>mermaids.  Splash was the victim this time and many of those on shore jumped<br>in and attacked her.  Allwett and a few other mermaids asked me to help them<br>out and I did my best.  But one shamans magic is not enough to stop a horde<br>of people.  Slashy was chased out of the reach of my magics and was slain<br>somewhere deep in the waters off the docks.  This was very said..  But even<br>with the loss of one of their sisters the mermaids still wanted us to play<br>with them.  <br><br>A few others braved the waters to see the mermaids up close,  maybe too<br>close, I am not sure.  All I know is they must have displeased some of the<br>mermaids as most who entered the ended up being attacked.  I do not know the<br>details, these people may have been part of the first who showed up and<br>attacked the ladies.  I do know that mermaids play HARD when they first get<br>to know you, and maybe if you are not tough enough to endure their playing,<br>you are not tough enough to endure the depths of the ocean, thus not able to<br>play with the ladies in their own elements.  <br><br>A few of us had fun dancing and playing in the water with the mermaids, but<br>a few people seemed hell bent on killing them, some for the sake of killing<br>anything that moves and others outa pure greed and lust to take the few<br>items they had with them.<br><br>I was threatened with my life by many of those on the shore, outraged that I<br>would help the ladies.  Only a few supported peace and enjoyed the fun time<br>the mermaids wanted to share.<br><br>In the end I was to weak to hold of the ever growing hordes of people<br>wishing nothing more than to kill the beauty that swam in the ocean and<br>wanted nothing more than to spend a short time with us and have some fun.<br><br>I mourned the death of the mermaids and left the area before those cheering<br>on shore remembered I had helped save the mermaids.  I manage to leave<br>mostly unharmed, but with the great memories of the fun I had partaken in<br>with the mermaids.  Also the sadness of the loss of life.<br><br>I hope to see more mermaids some day, and hope that maybe the next time they<br>me be able to have their fun and leave in peace.<br><br>Kgar Z`Confused<br>The Kind ogre of Saryrn</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Dr. Flamer:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail,<br> <br>After a long time in this game, and a long time on boards I tend to see lots of flames, and rantings by people who inevitably get kicked off that board only to take it to another board and another board until they are eventually so fed up that they take it out on others and forever remain bitter...  Meanwhile, the board admins are left to look like bad guys for deleting and/or locking posts due to their content.<br> <br>I think there should be a solution for this... so, I made one.  I call the message board EverFlames.  Its dedicated to the players who just need to let it out, without fear of censorship, banning, or locked threads.  There are forums for each server, and a few general forums relating to certain aspects of the game itself.<br> <br>So, I encourage all those who are admins to boards, rather than saying, "Not on my board!" *ban* Say, "Take it to EverFlame!" *ban*<br> <br>Here's that link for ya!<br><a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/beverflames">http://pub31.ezboard.com/beverflames</a><br> <br>Thanks,<br>Dr. Flamer</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
